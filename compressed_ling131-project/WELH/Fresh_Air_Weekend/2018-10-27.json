Trump's first press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nNow she takes a different direction in the new film can you ever forgive me which is based on the two thousand eight memoir of the same name by the Israel\nIsrael who died in twenty fourteen had a moderately successful career writing biographies of people who had fallen out of the popular consciousness like actress to bank cat and gossip columnist ... gallon\nBut after her biography of as stay laughter flop she couldn't find a publisher for her next book about vaudeville star Finney Bryce\nFinding herself broke unable to pay her rent or her cat's vet bill Israel deployed her writing skills to forge letters by the new very luminaries like Dorothy Parker ... rubber note coward and the actress Louis Brooks and sold the letters to collectors\nReviewing the film and the New York times AOL Scott wrote the Israel may be the single most interesting movie character you will encounter this year\nLet's start with a clip from the film in which Israel confide your secret to jak hop a fellow alcoholic who scrape spy on charm wit and numerous scams and hustles jak is played by Richard ... grand each of these characters has an acerbic sense of humor\nOn you want to hold my friends with the [noise]\nQuite by accident I find myself in a rather [noise]\nCriminals physicians are coming from\nLaw school today\nI mean [noise] embellish [noise]\nBeautiful trees [noise]\nLiterary letters writers little tricks low mothers\nSays if you're not understandings of world of elite collectible literary artifacts are supposed to be fooled pieces of paper lovers I I Am selling to come home she goes [noise]\nThat there was a waste of a secret I should've gone out they're not in Iraq and told the rock 'cause I get a better respond [noise] most vetoed this [noise]\nThe only one without [laughter]\nThose McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you in this new movie so congratulations on it this isn't really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic dinner way\nBut it wasn't called a movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent an a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise] um I think it's\nA it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing dramatic place so\nI'm quite comfortable and I always kind of think if you\nPut all the all the things I've done together I I may have even done more drama than than comedy in its totality but uh [noise] and you realize I most people haven't seen a lot of that it was incredibly far off Broadway plays so you know the Thirteen people at each performance does [laughter] I don't have much impact\nThis is fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross back with Melissa McCarthy she co starred and bridesmaids start in the heat and now stars on the new film can you ever forgive me as a biographer turn literary forge or it's based on a memoir by the Israel\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for [noise] is um insults\n[laughter] insulting I don't know [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know I don't know why are you not [laughter] but but\nThe most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they were all called in to meet with the principal and the other couple the Leslie manpower ... couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't cheat on a leash than he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do say or even you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no what he what he said to me was he called me a what language Catherine language I mean really what these do not balls said to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her saying next door so\nAmusing man maybe if I looked more like this fake Kabul Bank commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple none of this talk\nIf productive I Would like your ... and my legs and kick you out in a job with my phone just really scaring me this is what happens when you corner rat you corner me I Will chew through you know she was from you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty it's just you kind of improving insults in that scene in it just goes on and on with more over the top insults is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to [noise] to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not go round insulting people I Hope\nEver but the first time I watched that back I kept\nSaying I didn't say that [laughter] I never say that and the person was sitting with was to sit for watching you say it you said all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of which made me feel slightly crazy there was just trying to say ... anything that came up the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\n[noise] Melissa McCarthy at what point did you start thinking about uh other acting or comedy which came first like acting or comedy that combination standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of suddenly and\nMoved to New York and I was twenty kind of out of the blue a pit and living in Boulder, Colorado I'm not sure exactly what I was doing or why it was even there I moved there with my sister and then just it was still kind of lingering and uh\nHad a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York so three days later I moved to New York city\nAnd our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and I said All right I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and\nI kinda thought oh I think this is what I'm going to do and I ...\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT I hadn't finished school is the fashion I wanted to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but I Love making clothes I loved\nWatching other designer studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching\nAnd then they did stand up one night and I just thought they think I'm going to go this direction\nSo um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because [noise]\nYou know the heckling wasn't there when you went into a regular comedy club you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is ending woman ever been like\nMy God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shove now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to Hitler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not\nHow was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road like can I get a show of hands from women who is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself because you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's the first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the actors if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching saying times oh my God so I Know there's the light oh\n... ever present uh not to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't know what the white men I would've flashes climbs up yes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get for ... other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up people actually laughed at something much to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth and I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah\nUp it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me\nHe's really encouraging me and then I finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act in material that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because\nYeah I think it's often hard for women to get\nGood roles [noise] I think it is and I think you know I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read your kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like what it who who cares there's nothing to think or decent too it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't it didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I felt that everything I read for female character was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car\n... also co starred in the films Little Miss sunshine twelve years a slave and portrayed Brian Wilson in the film love and mercy now the age of thirty four he's directed his first film called wildlife\nThe screenplay which day no co wrote with his partners away 'cause then is adapted from a Richard Ford novel of the same name wild life is about a fourteen year old boy Joe who was recently moved with his parents to a small town in Montana he hasn't yet made friends and he's looking to his parents for a sense of home instability\nBut his father played by Jake Gyllenhaal loses his job and his sense of purpose the mother played by Carey Mulligan takes a part time job to help make ends meet\nMeanwhile it's wildfire season and the father decides to join the men fighting fire which leaves his wife and son to fend for themselves during the end determinant period he'll be gone and that changes everything just as fires can get out of control soak in people's lives\nHere's a scene in which Joe comes home from school to find his father breaking the news to his mother that he's leaving them to fight the wildfires\nAre only [noise]\nTalk to your father told him not to act like a full\nTime nappy finish I put my name on the list I waited for much economics I'm able to push for me you don't know anything about fire you'll get burned up ... I've been reading about them I Know well known in reading about the study also were joined me gee what's going on with your father leaving us go fight wildfires\nMore white\nGrocery store we'll go out with a bunch of that faith and let's go to school and what isn't right\n[noise] what what does it pay\n[noise]\nDollar an hour [noise]\nKnow what will be flown once you get you know I was going to go in every single [laughter]\n\nDon't know what I'm doing a problem [noise]\n[noise] well they know congratulations\nOn making this film and welcome to fresh air so that this film was adapted from a Richard Ford novel that like your movie is called wildlife how did you first find the novel and why did you fall in love with it [noise]\nUm I was a fan of Richard Ford's I just wrote a book called Rock Springs which is a beautiful collection of short stories and I went to the bookstore in Brooklyn called the court which is which is now closed looking for another book of his\nOpened up wildlife and honestly from a first sentence or even the first paragraph remains probably one of my favorite in any book ever so I was sort of immediately in just as a reader I mean not my I'm going to make a film but while this book is for me\nWould you read the first paragraph from the novel which we happen to have sitting on the table here\nSure [noise] in the fall of Nineteen sixty when I was sixteen and my father was for a time not working my mother met a man named Warren Miller and fell in love with him this was in great falls\nAnd my father had brought us there in the spring of that you're from Lewiston, Idaho in the belief that people small people like him are making money in Montana or soon would be and he wanted a piece of that good luck before all of the collapsed and was gone and the wind thank you [laughter] I mean the language I\nI'm a bit richer for ... yes I yes I agree so tell us more about what you related to in the story of this is the writing which is beautiful yeah but you were adapting the story so what was it about the story that\nSmoke so even about twenty pages into the book there's a paragraph about a um kid watching his mom teach swim class and thinking that everybody around her things oh there's a woman with a good smile or there's a woman with a good figure there's one is happy and he knew something was wrong at home\nAnd at that point my heart sort of left and I was like wow this is as great writing can do or a great song or whatever is it felt like it's for you in some way and that\nI just remember I moved to a new town when I was fourteen your home is sort of the edge of the world when you moved somewhere new ... because you don't know what's outside of it you don't have friends yet\nYou know school is not yet a release um it's sort of scary to go there for the first time\nSo we grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan I'm really close with my family maybe too close and I remember when my parents started having\nYou know struggles in that relationship sort of what a profound and I guess difficult moment that was for me so this book sort of reflected back to me how family\nIs one of the greatest loves in our life and because of that it's also sometimes one of the greatest source of struggle in our life and he was able to capture that with compassion\nIn the clip that we just heard the parents are fighting and one of them says to the teenage boy what do you think Joe how awkward is at asking a teenage boy to weigh in on the battle between his parents were you in that position [noise]\nWell I think so and I think that's something I related to in this character I think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about I'm a kid who rebels writer or something from their used it for me\nI remember sort of standing in the middle feeling the ground shake and not wanting things to tip so Joe and I have something in common and and Richard for it and I have something in common in that regard I was somebody who wanted to keep things together so if something like that had been posed to me\nUm you know I when I said I'm ... you know out of here and like what are you know I Would have tried to actually understand what was going on and then it kinda help\nDid your parents separate well my parents have an interesting situation which is they separated they like the end of this book strangely which is not in the film half resume living together a few years ago they never got officially divorced but we did not always lived together\nLet's talk about your acting and let's start with there will be blood you gave such an amazing performance and this year you're Eighteen evangelical preacher in a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century during the early days when they are discovering that there's oil there\nAnd there's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also incredible capitalistic comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and he become an happiness and in one scene in the northern here\nBasically told by one landowner that he'll sign over the oil rights to Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis\nBy you and your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're baptized in him and I should just say parents that ugly that the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in\nA boy whose father was in was killed in the mining accident and then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another oil accident Daniel Day Lewis sends him away to school okay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and Daniel Day Lewis\nWe should our votes here well wishes for celebration or you assure\nThe laws cages you would you say it to him go\nAnd speak to him it's All right\nJohn nice\n\n... [noise]\nCome here and you wrote and grows and wealth but you have also brought your bad habits as a batch lighter\nYou've lost due to after women and you have a band in your child your child that you raise your the bans in all because she was sick and us in just said now I Am a sinner shouldn't say it loud or I Am a student and I'm a student\nLoan Daniel I'm a I'm a center I I'm Sorry\nOr ... I watch the law of blood you have a band that your child\nOr the bugs that much I Will never backslide whenever I saw was lost but now I\nDon't know I don't know about my Giles\nGED [noise] burn to be much louder shed loud\n\n\nApplause you give me the numbers you know what do you accept Jesus Christ as your lord\nAnd savior do\n\n\n[laughter] [noise]", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "27"}
