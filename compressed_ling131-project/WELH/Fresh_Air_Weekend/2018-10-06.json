mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I started under what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like ... ever said that exactly you know she's really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nAh to

Island public radio ...\n\nThis is fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross\nLet's get back to my interview with camera Jenkins she wrote and directed slums of Beverly Hills the savages and the new movie private life which is now in theaters and streaming Netflix\nPrivate life starts Catherine hunt and Paul Giamatti as a couple in their forties trying to have a baby do any means necessary fertility drugs in vitro fertilization egg donor adoption\nTrying to have a baby has become like a fulltime job for each of them it's emotionally draining and it's draining their savings to it's also become a source of friction in their relationship\nI think it's fair to say than in your movie you give pretty equal weight to how the husband and wife are experiencing trying to conceive or to adopt and they they each have their own like a motion of crises that they have to go through\nAnd I think it's interesting that you did that you didn't just try to do the woman's point of view and have the man be like totally and comprehending and and cold and you know not going not going through his own issues\nYeah I Love I like I'm Glad you said that and I love Paul's\nPortrait of I'm Richard her husband and I think when I set out to do it I remember thinking to myself oh this is a mutual midlife crisis\nThis is happening to both of them and in a way sometimes I think of it like a buddy movie and I did this with the Savage is too when you're writing some thing that's so character driven sometimes you need to create order in your brain because it's not a genre\nAnd I remember thinking with is that it was like a buddy movie\nAnd instead of getting in a car and driving across the country would I don't know a bank heist or something they're getting in a car and driving through like infertility land was important to me that it was a mutual\nI dunno crisis that it wasn't just her problem or I mean they're both falling apart they're they ah you know as they're heading up against the limitations of being a human being simultaneously it's not just her\nYou know when he has to do the sperm donation he's watching really awful [laughter]\nIt's like really cheap off\nBy the fertility clinic is that right\nYeah well they that's what they do that's always such a bizarre like if you go you know you open a drawer at a doctor's office and stuff with porn magazines that just seems like somebody actually to go out and go shopping for those and bring them to the office like that's a you know but that's [laughter]\nThat's medicine I don't know it's you know a medical office and somebody has to go pick up [noise]\nGo down the street and pick out some porn magazines and some videos\nOpposing Mahdi says like rolling his eyes instead of getting a rouse [laughter] he's rolling their eyes at the point I I was hoping to find something better do you like something yeah yeah it's not very good call is not very good quality yeah [laughter] okay\nUm so um during the process of when trying alternate path of either conceiving do various fertility treatments or of adoption did you have to ask yourself what would it mean for a child who really feel like your child\nYeah um but then I think something kind of takes I mean there is this presumption as a heterosexual couple that you have all the equipment to do this old fashioned thing which is to you know give birth to a child that represents\nHalf of you and half of your partner and when it is taken away for some reason I think it's traumatizing at first and then I think kind of like the characters in the movie\nYou tip toed towards different ideas of what it's really about is it about\nGiving birth to a baby or is it about becoming a parent\nUm what is that what is the end goal and it it just starts changing and shifting I always find it really interesting when people like in the movie I there's like a lot of I don't know if the right word is comedy of manners or\nLike when people are just saying oh my God I don't know why why why don't they just adopt and just as always a tally size like oh my God why would they be going through this why don't they just adopt as if adopting is just the easiest thing in the planet\nLike oh you just go out to you know target and pick up a kid or something it's very difficult to adopt I mean it's complicated um egg donation is complicated ivy F is complicated every way you have to get a baby that isn't lying in bed and having sex is complicated and people are so judgmental\nAnd the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica got access to the personal information of eighty seven million Facebook users which they used to target messages for the Trump campaign\nFacebook is now under investigation by the FBI the securities and Exchange Commission the Federal Trade commission and authorities in Europe and Australia\nOur guest New Yorker staff writer Evan Austin us explore space but history and profiles it's thirty four year old founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in a recent issue of the magazine he says ... relentless drive to expand Facebook's reach\nHas jeopardized the privacy of its users and made it vulnerable to political manipulation\nHis story is titled ghosts and the machine can Mark Zuckerberg fix Facebook before it breaks democracy he spoke with fresh air is Dave Davies\nWhile Evan us welcome back to the fresh air you know we all know Facebook is a very big deal give us a sense of its size and reach\nThere's really nothing quite like it in the history of American business uh it is now to point two billion monthly active users meaning it's larger than any country in the world it's really got no I'm no natural precedent when you look at the history of enterprise it's really closer in terms of scale and reach to\nA political ideology or religious faith I mean it just didn't literal terms it now has as many adherents a as Christianity and that is all been built in the last fourteen years since it was founded in two thousand for\n[noise] for this piece you visited Mark Zuckerberg at his home ... at his office had numerous meetings a lot of access from a guy who was pretty careful about you know journalists to getting connected to him how did you convince him to share so much time with it well\nHe did it I should say reluctantly um this was a long process that started a year ago when I first approached them about the idea of this kind of story I said look I I\nWe do in the New Yorker these very long detailed profiles and I think initially Facebook's view was we don't need to do this or a big powerful company um\nAnd I continue to work on it basically started interviewing a lot of other people around Facebook people who worked there in the past people who work there and the president\nAnd ah as that accumulated I continue to say look this fundamentally should be about how Mark Zuckerberg sees the world and over time they came to I think sort of grudgingly and I but I'm I'm grateful for it except the idea that\nTo an extraordinary degree Mark Zuckerberg is Facebook I mean that is the reality he's the chairman he's the c._e._o. he owns\nHe controls ... sixty percent of the voting share so if you're going to understand Facebook in any meaningful way the conversation really has to start with him and and with him and and for that I think they ultimately recognized\nHe had to be a part of this project\nThe company has come up against a growing and really serious decline of public trust both among politicians and among the\nThey recognize that at the core of that and I think he recognizes that there is this profound question mark around what does Mark Zuckerberg believes and what does he stand for what does he care about how does he see his role in the country what does he see for the\nFor the role of technology and this project was my attempt to try to answer some of those questions for myself and for readers\n[noise] um ... started Facebook when he was a Harvard it takes off and it grows and grows because they are determined you know to to get more users to connect more people as a river likes to say and you're right that in about two thousand seven a plateaued at about fifty million users which a lot of other\nKind of similar platforms had done what did the company due to break through that sailing\n[noise] when they first packed really there was a a a a sense internally that they wondered whether they'd sort of hit the wall and whether this thing that had grown so fast was now over and and what they did was they discovered something important\nWhich is that in order to punch through that wall they had to come up with a whole range of new ways of accessing\nNew populations people who wouldn't otherwise have been on Facebook the first thing they did was they discovered they simply had to translate the site into other languages make it available to other countries around the world and allow people to be able to post in Spanish and so on\nAnd by doing that they cross the barrier this moat which had prevented other social media sites from growing\nBut he did something even more important which was that it established\nThe sacred important really sacred is the word of gross internally they created a a team called the growth team which became as of this former Facebook executive said to me it was really the coup crowd this was\nThe team everyone wanted to be on was ... was about really sank defying the idea of growth as an end in itself that if Facebook stopped growing than its whole reason for being would cease to exist and that idea\nEnded up becoming the dominant fact of the next decade from two thousand seven until today when Facebook became a extraordinarily focused on whatever it could do to continue growing year after year\nAnd one of the things they did was that they made it a platform for outside developer so that may be able to explain what this means so that ups other software developers could reach into Facebook and use it\n[noise] they made a big choice which was that instead of saying we're just going to be our own site we're actually going to try to become a platform like almost like an operating system the way that windows used to be the\nYou know the way that everybody went on on to their personal computer and then you would build applications on top of that and that decision to open themselves up as a platform\nMeant that they were then sharing data to a much larger group of developers of programmers than they otherwise would end this turned out to be a fateful decision because if you fast forward many years later to and what we all now know is the Cambridge Analytica scandal that was\nIt was directly a result of this decision to open themselves up as a platform because what they'd done was they allowed an academic researcher to use some of the data\nOn the platform to build a personality quiz but then he sold that data to the political consultancy known as Cambridge Analytica and that sort of back door the way in which that data went out the door\nOr has created much of the crisis that now engulfing the company today\nYou're right that the executive within Facebook Sandy para kill us was put in charge of looking into what these outside you know at the developers were doing with that the data that they got from the Facebook users who you know plugged into their games\nUnnerved in a semi park illicit joined Facebook in twenty eleven and was one of the people responsible for going out and figuring out whether the data that they were given to developers was being misused in any way we're\nNow where people are violating privacy where they um taking more data than they were supposed to and what he found was that they were in some cases programmers for instance were siphoning off people's pictures and they're private messages\nAre in other cases he found a developer that was building essentially shadow profiles profiles for people who've never given their consent\nUm including for children and it was you know this was a case in which there was just this feeling of it being the wild west this data was out there and nobody was paying attention and and he raised alarms internally as he tells the story what he did was he said look we need to do a a major audit\nTo go out and figure out where is our data who has an how are they using it and as he says he was told a that's not going to happen because if you do it you may not want to know what you're going to find meaning that they may have already lost control of so much of that\nData that they didn't really want to discover the full reach a and and Sandy ... left\nBut in in many ways his warnings turned out to be prophetic because exactly the kind of undisciplined use the data which he had warned about and and and try to raise greater alarms about internally or turned out to be the origins of the Cambridge Analytica scandal which became so I'm so consuming for the company this year\nSo a lot of resources within the company devoted to pushing growth not so much into doing it response of\nYes exactly as he said that you know I needed people I needed engineers to help me try to police where this data was going with all of the resources we're going to grow he said at some point\nAnd he told me that the growth team had engineers coming out of their ears they had everything they wanted everything was devoted to growing and it was not devoted to making sure that what they were doing at the time was say\nWhat are some of the of the things the company did to keep growing that kind of pushed the boundaries of privacy\nWell they began to build in lots of ingenious details into the design of the site things like a auto play video this is something as simple as\nChanging the nature of Facebook so that when you scroll down your page that the videos would begin to play without you having to click on them what that was was essentially taking advantage of\nSome of our own psychological wiring that means that just eliminating that small obstacle makes much more likely to stay on the site to watch that ad and ultimately to consume whatever advertising is around it", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "06"}
