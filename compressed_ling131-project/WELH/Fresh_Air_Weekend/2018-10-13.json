[noise]\nThis is fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross\n\nThat video image was being transmitted live from the moon to NASA and around the world just after the Apollo eleven lunar module commanded by Neil Armstrong became the first manned spacecraft to land on the moon moments later Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon and said these now famous words\nFor [noise] [noise]\nThat was fifty years ago when NASA didn't have the computer technology we have today\nAnd that makes the successful moon landing even more remarkable I guess ... directed the new movie first men based on Neil Armstrong's life in the Nineteen sixties when he was an astronaut and took incredible risks to test new spacecraft and fly to the moon\nArmstrong has played by Ryan Gosling who also start in the movie musical Lala land which does al wrote and directed to do one of the best director Oscar for that film he also wrote and directed whiplash\nLet's start with a scene from first man astronaut Neil Armstrong Mike Collins and Buzz Aldrin played by Cory stall are seated together at a table at a press conference in July Nineteen sixty nine taking questions from reporters before embarking on their Apollo eleven mission to the moon\nIf it does turn out you'll go down in history will cut us off do you have about that when it thought it through a dodge suppose a flight successful we're planning on that point ... says will uh [noise] I I just know how you feel about being a part of history\nThe responsibility but it's exciting to be the first if my wife is excited she keeps doesn't [noise] jewelry into my care [noise]\nYou're planning on taking summer job or is it a new buzz sure what what fellow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise] Neal when you take anything a set of choices they force you\nDamien says oh welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was\nWhat [laughter] why would someone who is so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut in space\nI Love the film but I was wondering like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think had did the same sort of initial ah you know it it it didn't really line up with the sort of films I'd been making are are kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the region Hansen's ah incredible books at the movies based on it struck me as a story about dreams and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar seem addict terrain at least two\nWhiplash in la la land and and uh but just on this kind of grand cosmic canvas and so it seemed like if if I could tell that story and tracing the sort of journey from the kind of intimate home life on the ground to distorted extremes of human experience out in space\n... first manned spacecraft to land on the moon on July twenty eighth Nineteen sixty nine I'm ... and became the first human to walk on the moon\nAnd you mentioned you had the chance to talk with\nI'm Janet Armstrong who was Neil Armstrong's life they were married I think for thirty six years and then I'm divorced\nWhat were some I think he's learned from her and help you understand what she and she's portrayed by Claire fillet and land Armstrong we're going through during this period in the sixties when he was an astronaut\nOr well one thing I think that Neal and Janet had in common was this ability to put on his face and in moments of incredible upheaval\nYou know it was something in their character is sort of mid western I'm kind of ... that they had an awesome you know it was very much a product of of of their time and their culture\nThat was just able to do the impossible without complaint and you know I really got a vivid sense of that when talking to ... you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when ah you know you're you're you're moving from place to place in ... to say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for ... you know test pilot the acts of tea and he's\nWorking in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this loss as a family um and you know again Neal is work in a dangerous job and and away eighty percent of the time and who knows if you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she would uh several times just look at me and an almost with a shrug say well sink or swim\nThat really stuck with me just that it was as simple as that in a way but of course as complicated as that and uh you know so she vividly remember to so many of you know are the kind of day by day activities and instances of that we picked in a movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moments in the movie for example when when Janet a you know late in the film or a insists to her husband that you sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on his moon mission sits down and tells them that he may not return\nIt made him do that in real life\nYeah yeah that that this is all you made a lot of this was is already recorded in Jim Hansen's book I'm beginning to actually talk with her about it and you know talk through what that conversation actually wasn't than what the ensuing dinner table conversation actually was I mean a lot of that scene in the movies taken verbatim from what she recollection and from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process of the movie recollect it\nYeah and in the senior attacking Batman apparently in real life to Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with a sign saying I might not make it that that she demanded that he has to do and that she wasn't going to do it he has yet to see that and he has been in this incredible\nLike low key way without really without really showing emotion\nI mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through a or at least the only way they felt they could get through was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know a ... in real life it to a certain extent with someone who\nI think it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and are actually sitting down and facing them and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and fly into the void of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear are they\nExcept for this sort of deep ... fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the ground\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think is music he actually brought with him to play after the space signing my right about that [noise]\nUh this is music he plays on the way to the moon I think it's what you referred yeah and the way to yes yeah yeah so it's\nIt's a ... piece called litter Rhapsody ... and ... when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into the category about of of China that's been described as exotic I but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like Hollywood style celestial voices a therapy and it's incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like\nBeing on your ... to the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nRomney version of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you playing music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned that you may have to book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nShow for it or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracks the music that uh that Neal and the other astronaut to play during the course of their mission they played a piece from about divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a the ... or listen to together that they loved\nTogether when they were young and loving in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know a guy who was having a going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of expected Li play distracted really no one\nListening no wonder Mitch control certainly no one in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to ah\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay well why don't we hear a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nOh [laughter] oh [laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nLuna Rhapsody which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which has directed by my guest Damien says al who also directed la la land and wrote a too and also wrote and directed whiplash\nDiminishes Oh thank you so much for talking with as it's been great to have you back on our show congratulations on thank you so nice to be back thanks for having me Damien ... directed the new movie first man and win an Oscar for directing la la land\nAnd\n\nMy next guest is Adam Cohen the son of Leonard Cohen when Leonard Cohen died two years ago at the age of eighty two he left behind many unpublished writings some of his unpublished homes lyrics notebook injuries and drawings are collected in the new book the flame\nAdam Cohen wrote the forward and I'm also produced the album his father recorded shortly before his death called you want a darker\nAnd him as a singer and songwriter who's album like a man when gold in Canada and twenty twelve he was born in Montreal in Nineteen Seventy two and I'm going to talk with us about Leonard Cohen as a writer performer and father and tell us about working closely with his father in the final year of his life\nLeonard Cohen lyrics have adept few songwriters have achieved reflecting reverence and despair hit the traction to beauty and his knowledge of broken this lyrics informed by his Judaism his practice of Zen Buddhism and his doubt\nSome of his many well known songs include Suzanne so long Marianne famous blue raincoat Chelsea hotel number two everybody knows power of song I'm your man and of course his best known most frequently recorded and performed song hallelujah\nAdam Cohen welcome to fresh air I just wanted to start by saying I Love your father's music I left his writing\nAnd I feel privileged to have had the chance to hear him in concert and you talk with him on her show and I'm grateful for the chance to talk with you today so thank you for being here when I interviewed her father and two thousand six after the publication of a book of his poems and songs he asked to\nMinute Khan was very weak and in pain when he recorded it\nIs their son you remember from your childhood that sticks in your mind a song that meant a lot to you maybe even a song you remember your father writing\nI mean when I was really young\nI remember him composing hallelujah\nYou remember him writing it oh yeah and I remember him being your took um twelve years [laughter]\nSo you know started it started when I was very very young at here versus I think they're eighty four verses to that song I remember coming down to the kitchen table and he was there was no one string guitar in his underwear\nAnd are there to always be versus to consult and I remember even being invited to sing I'm\nWith a group of people in New York City when he was recording the song for his own album which by the way Sony at the time I didn't want to put out\nIsn't it amazing an amazing turn of events to have this man's popularity have have grown you know he lived in a kind of like comic anonymity if you buy those too if you buy that unlikely union\nAnd um two grown in popularity so much at the end of his life and for to get back to question for me to have\nSat on the side of the stage you know watching my old man at five years old and all the way up to in my forties um the whole canon of his work is is living inside of me is playing in my head is triggered by conversation\nYeah so for hallelujah that you say there's ... there were eighty four ... versus I don't think he ever recorded all eighty four\nBut did it take twelve years and eighty four versus before he considered it completed because of dissatisfaction with the versus that he'd previously written or because there's still so much you wanted to say in the format of that song\nThat is the popular a poem states of tone is never finished but rather abandoned\n[laughter] do you think he was frustrated working on it for so long or that it was satisfying\nI think I'm frustration\nWas expected um ... ... the success of being able to let it go was was the unexpected you know I think as I say he was very vocational from the early stage she would wake up earlier than anybody you knew to black and pages\nAnd uh and gave up an enormous amount for what he would for referred to as compromised norms amount\nUh go back to that song came so far for beauty left so much behind my patients in my family my master piece inside\nYou know you call it that you know some people subscribe to the to the philosophy first thought desk thought and that's often attribute it to a one of the beat writers but your father believed last thought best thought\n[laughter] yeah he he edited the edited his songs a lot he went through a lot of traffic it was a constant process of filtration and refinement for certain so ... why\nDon't we hear hallelujah your father's version short\n[laughter] this is Leonard coming other yeah go ahead more ... there was a moratorium on\n... yes refrain please refrain from playing hallelujah because\nI I think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something you know where you're give give some other songs a chance to get played um it was it was partly joke and partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song\n[noise] so in spite of the moratorium your family have an ... yeah I think I think will play in any way are you okay with that\nOh God you know I'm going to report due to the bully police [laughter]\nOkay I hear it [noise]\nHow there was\nDay or\nReally\nMusic do [noise]\nOr like a ball or maybe a\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nNo\nFrom\n... singing hallelujah and my guest is when it comes to an Adam Cohen and there's an he wrote the introduction to a new collection of passion mislead published Leonard cone um lyrics poems notebook injuries and drawings and it's called\nFlame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people have recorded hallelujah and um it but it didn't become well known until just about the recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded it and which is just so strange but um it's a sign of\nHow I think there's a period of years when your father's genius west and fully knowledge when you know he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him\nAnd um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit forgotten\nYeah [laughter]\nFeel like my father probably felt like his whole life um was characterized by that by that description that he did he been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the uh the you know cupid a forgotten by um [noise]\nI Know that he was not satisfied\nOr he was a seeker I wasn't satisfied with either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself that would that ... deep in the conflict\nHe wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people that you've chosen to be around him he wasn't satisfied with his role as the father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover I'm\nAnd through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction you somehow mustard I'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be a\nUm more than most delightful people anyone ever came across and um it wasn't with any sense of bitterness\nAnd uh you have this shabby little life and his only solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more astonishing and surprising and delicious you know this is a unexpected ability to have to fill you know twenty thousand seats in in any major city in the world\nThese reviews from people that were like you know this you're likely we're reviewing the Sistine Chapel itself\nUm the was the company by commercial success and accolades and ah [noise]\nTo see him take his hat off you know and sank we jubilant audiences one after the other was to see a man who was genuinely surprised and delighted\nBy the reception that he thought he was never going to get in life\nWhen I saw him probably in the late to thousands like two thousand nine maybe I I Can't remember what it was kind of like being in a church or synagogue there was this\nSense of like ... ... the devotion of as fans to him and his devotion to the music and see things a larger\nAnd he ended up with what struck me as the benediction and I forget exactly what he said but you know to those of you who are going home you know to your family's enjoy your family's in to those of you who live alone\nEnjoying a solitude and I thought like people don't say that that is such a beautiful thing to say such a lovely way of sending people home and sending home people who are going home alone and joy your solitaire\nYeah maybe songs fine junior solitude yeah\nThat's right near the ... the actually the the exact quote is made the blessings find you and your solitude I thought that was just beautiful well this is a man who are you know although we had a reputation as a ladies' man you know he was he had the greatest teeth to ten thousand nights you spent alone he understood something about solitude\n[noise] do you feel protective of his privacy 'cause in my opinion like your father was very um elliptical and has writing and a\nPretty private about his life he alluded to a lot of things in his songs but never quite came out and said them and a direct\nWay\nOh I I I'm not certain that's that's true in terms of the use of the word direct okay but I Will say that um\nTo speak on his behalf feels like a little bit of a transgression [laughter] you know you have a man who has designed is life around trying to not demystify a process um and uh his work really does speak for
