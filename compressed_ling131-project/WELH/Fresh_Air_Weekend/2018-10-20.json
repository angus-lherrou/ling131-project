{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WELH", "content": "Good evening and welcome to debate among Rhode Island's US Senate candidates sponsored by the University of Rhode Island public radio and the Providence Journal\nWere coming to you from Edwards hall at the ... campus in Kingston\nOn me and Donald political\nJournal managing editor of Mike German and your you are I sophomore Julia ... news editor with the campus newspaper the good five cent cigars\nAmassed in our audience to respect the candidates and the moderators and to please avoid applause and sharing until the very end of the debate so we can make the most of our time here\nNow I like to introduce the candidates on the last lawyer and former Rhode Island Supreme Court ah Rhode Island state Supreme Court justice Robert Flanders and on the\nDemocratic US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse who is seeking his third term in office let's\nGet right into the\nI'll ask the first question candidates you will have up to two minutes to respond if the panel considers inappropriate will allow sometimes allow for a thirty second follow up to comment by your opponent earlier today I think names out of a hat and Mr Robert Flanders you go first\nPresident Trump is very critical of us commitments to longtime allies NATO and cancelled large scale joint military exercises with South Korea critics accuse him of being too soft on repressive regimes\nDo you support the president's approach to Foreign Relations and his view of America's role in the world\nWell first I Want to thank the University of Rhode Island's Providence Journal and the public radio for sponsoring and hosting this debate and I want to wish my opponent I'm a happy sixty third birthday I promise not to make his age relative inexperience an issue in this can [noise]\nAh I said from the outset on this campaign that I'm going to call balls and strikes on President Trump a and that's true in his than the foreign policy\nI support his efforts to make our allies or pay for\nTheir fair share of the costs of defending Europe in NATO for example a and around the world I think he is also doing a good job and trying to uh get better trade deals uh with uh all of a A R trading partners I think that's a good thing uh\nBut uh I did not appreciate and I spoke out against a is a meeting in Helsinki with President ... where I thought he ah gave too much credibility to the Russian presidents are denials of Russian interference in the election and didn't credit our own intelligence agencies\nAre with the evidence or they were quite the anonymous about the fact that Russia had an attempted to meddle in the elections\nSo I think the president is trying to improve our trade relations around the world get better deals where we can\nUh this is filling his campaign promises\nA particularly on NAFTA and other arrangements um and I've supported that but uh I I I you know as as I've said all along I Wish uh his rhetoric a would be toned down a bit um and uh but I support\nThe idea that he wants to be an American first president and he's fulfilling his campaign promises and doing when he can to improve our trade relations are and trade agreements and I'm doing what he can to uh have ... ah America's influence in the world or be able to shouldn't be\nMr White house the same questions you be a problem with\nPresident Trump and Vladimir Putin we don't fully understand yet because there has not been anywhere near adequate disclosure of the president's business relationships with Russia\nIt's hard to understand exactly what is behind a the manner\nIn which she deals with a lot of ... and I thought that\nThe performance or on the stage of flooding or if it was more than just unfortunate I thought it was disgraceful um and the problem is that it's not just a one on one problem between us and Russia one of the things that I Do a pretty much every year and have done for some time\nIs one of the reasons we became such good friends is to be the co lead with John McCain\nOn the American delegation to the Munich security conference which is the big security conference for Europe and for the NATO alliance and the Atlantic alliance and what is hard to hear over there when you go to the things now is the feeling that the United states of America\nHas become an unreliable ally and when these countries have that feeling they have to hedge their bets and they have to move a little bit towards trying to ... to have to move a little bit towards Russia to hedge your bets they may not like to do it\nBut there is real damage done when our allies can't count on us um so I think that the president has a completely backwards he falls in love with tyrants like Kim Jong on\nAnd he uh really capers in front of Vladimir potent and in disgraceful ways and with our staunch friends and allies of decades he is a\nHarmful\nI have another question in the area of Foreign Relations says it's a question for both of you in light of the circumstances surrounding the debts of democracy Yogi should the u._s. be tougher with Saudi Arabia for example by\nHalting arms deals with Saudi Arabia where by ending us assistance of Saudi air strikes in Yemen is the White House\nI think ah we absolutely should be it is unbelievable\nTo imagine that a reporter for one of our great newspapers a columnist for one of our great newspapers is lured into the consular officers\nOf an ally of ours Ted Schiller ally of ours\nAnd murdered they are by a team of twelve to Fifteen people who were flown over there for that\nPurpose apparently bringing a bone sauce to help them get rid of the body um what has been disclosed so far about that crime is way too little the president has been far too soft on the Saudis I Believe\nThe uh there are some obvious questions like\nWhere's the body and who legitimately is going to do an autopsy to figure out what actually happened in that room this current notion that there was a fistfight of one guy sixty plus years old\nAgainst a team of Fifteen people sent there apparently to murder him [noise] it's just not credible I think we have to be deadly serious about it and I think we're going to be looking at that when we get back to the Senate or one set of\nPunishments one set of sanctions would be against Saudi Arabia generally and that would be in the\nArms sales area and potentially other related areas like our support for their activities in Yemen the other is to match the Magnitsky Act model when the Russians murdered someone and we went after individual Russian leaders and oligarchs\nAnd I am holding my powder on which is the best way to go until we know more we certainly don't know enough yet to identify who should be the Saudi targets of magnets Magnitsky style sanctions but this is something that the world should not tolerate\nMr Flanders seem to you yeah I think it's\nCrack down on Saudi Arabia even though they've been our strategic ally in in a in that region particularly a mix of the Iran and so we have to be cautious about dealing with them or because they have been such a staunch a friend of the United states but\nThis activity murdering a U.S based journalist or in the way that apparently it it happened a is absolutely or something that we as a civilized nation can tolerate\nAnd so a Saudi Arabia has to know that we're not going to buy the um the excuse that this was a fight and a and this went terribly wrong in bands all the ... of being a a\nA hit ordered by the highest levels of the government the crown prince\nAnd so I think that we need to be severe and our sanctions here and let them know that there's going to be held to pay for this kind of behavior uh this is not the way we want allies to behave and I think that uh we have to be serious and uh\nUh considered seriously cutting back if not eliminating the arms sales that are pending or with a Saudi Arabia and also I'm\nA allowing uh we we currently allow refueling and Yemen are for their activities and in that region\nAnd I think that's another area where are we ought to take a hard look at\nA cutting back if not eliminating of that activity but there have to be sanctions because of this kind of behavior particularly against the American based journalist [noise] um who uh went there are and was a a met with a team of assassins\nIn Arizona and California and those places so uh look ah my opponent\nA and the Democrats seem to be pushing for an open borders situation if only in a post nine eleven world we can't let an unfettered mass of people come in the year many of whom either seats and do us harm or prepared to go on the public welfare\nOr in a flood our schools are look we can't afford that and and we need to take a tougher stance on that so yes I support our states localities are giving more he's incident in prisons to the federal immigration authorities\nSo that we can get our arms around the situation even as we move a to reforming immigration the only two more skills based\nOn a more job oriented a system and the one we have now in place\nMr White house a first time I say that I was part of the bipartisan immigration reform the cleared the senator came through the Judiciary Committee we put a lot of work into it I think it was good work\nThe Republicans refused to even bring it up in the house and that's why we have some of these problems the two additional points that I'd make on this one is I've prosecuted gang cases as us attorney and as attorney general we've got five life sentences on the Latin kings game here in Rhode Island\nIf you want to do gang cases in Rhode Island you have to make sure that people from those communities will talk to you and if they fear that when they come in that will be punished for coming in and talking to you that hurts law enforcement so to me the people to listen to on this or the police chase\nAnd if the police chief in Providence says that he's doing what he thinks is right to keep the citizens of Providence safe I'm inclined to uh except his judgment on that subject\nAbout what we see across the board in Rhode Island is that I think all of our police departments right now or in the same place which is if the federal authorities will get a warrant for somebody to warrant being the thing that allows me to hold somebody under the constitution we honor the warrant every single city a town on her as a federal warrant\nWhether it's immigration or otherwise if they haven't got a warrant we have a district court and the first circuit appellate court that of both held\nBet if you hold somebody belong longer than when you're allowed to and there is a warrant that is your justification for holding them\nYou're liable\nSo the law here in Rhode Island that we follow if the if the federal government wants to have the police departments pick somebody up\nThey should go under the constitution and got a warrant and when they do the police departments conform\n[noise] you're listening to you and wives and US Senate debate at the University of Rhode Island featuring Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse and Republican Robert Flanders I mean Donald ... political reporter for the public's radio joined on the panel by Michael McDermott from the Providence Journal\nAnd Julia moral from the good five cents cigar this question will start off with Mr White house\nThe Washington Post and sixty minutes teamed up for a story on a building you sponsored\nAnd people with the federal drug Enforcement Administration said this law made it more difficult to go after illegal opioids shipments was it a mistake for you to to support that bill I don't think so it passed\nUnanimously in the Senate passed unanimously in the house of representatives President Obama signed into law um we\nHad when this story emerged we had a hearing on the Judiciary Committee a bipartisan here and we brought in the woman who runs the sex\nEnforcement the diversion section of the drug Enforcement Administration she testified before us she testified under oath\nAnd she said there had been no harm to her enforcement efforts by passing this law\nWhat I have focused on more has been to respond to the opioid crisis with bipartisan legislation that I was the principal author of\nThe camera built a comprehensive addiction Recovery Act\nThat also passed the Senate with huge numbers it also passed the house with huge numbers and President Obama signed into law it is the most significant piece of legislation that has been written to respond to the opioid epidemic I did it and bipartisan fashion with my colleague senator Portman of Ohio\nAnd if you go to the opioids and recovery community here in Rhode Island if you go and talk to anchor recovery do you go and talk to Kodak if you go and talk to Phoenix house\nThey will describe me not just as somebody who is okay on this issue but who is their champion\nAnd I'm proud of that and if they want to reconsider the Diego we actually put into it a section saying come back to us if you have a problem report to us they've never given us a report saying that there is a problem\nSo I'd rather move forward on continuing to get additional funding for Rhode Island and continue to implement my comprehensive addiction Recovery Act to support the\nA wonderfully brave people who are in recovery hair and Rhode Island as day at work through this tragedy\nMr Flanders of a slightly different question for you you've accused your opponent Mr White house of having a lot on his hands and drug money in his pockets due to investment and pharmaceutical companies\nBut financial disclosure show that you and your wife have between two hundred thousand dollars and six hundred Fifteen thousand dollars invested in big pharmaceutical companies are you being hypocritical\nNo I'm not because I've said that I won't take any contributions from big pharma and if and when I Am elected to the Senate or and have to pass on legislation that comes before me any investments I have a will go into a blind trust so that I don't know or or have anything to do with how the money has invested\nSo uh my criticism and I've also said I'm not taking any contributions from the former the problem with what my opponent has talked about is he was a co sponsored the bill that go to the DEA his power to shut down these pill mills that were flooding the market with these terribly addictive opioids\nAre that we're killing a six Rhode Island is a weak Seventy two thousand and across the country died last year from these opioids\nAnd the escalation of these deaths are continued unmitigated Ninety percent escalation uh uh over the time that he was a senator and a car accident talks about it absolutely nothing to deal with the enforcement problem sure it's like it's like shutting the barn door after the horses are\nYes it helps with the treatment part of it but the enforcement shutting down the pill mills and the pharmacies and the doctors that are over prescribing these opioids and addicting so many people so many Rhode islanders and killing killing our people at the rate of six week\nThis is a a a an epidemic of all kinds of proportions that he stands here today telling us that oh well I I helped out with the treatment on the back and well how about on the enforcement against these folks that are killing our people stop these pill mills from over prescribing an over shipping this stuff and the pharmacies that are\nAre allowing prescriptions to be filled way beyond the historical amounts that are um are attributed to whoever is getting\nA and diverting diverting all these\nUh opioids into illegal in St uses that are terribly or a killing people left and right so I I say shame on Senator Whitehouse ...\nInvesting in these very companies while he's doing working on this legislation\nMr Flanders Senate Democrats in two thousand Thirteen changed filibuster rules to no longer require sixty votes for lower court in cabinet nominations Senate Republicans did the scene for Supreme Court justices in two thousand Seventeen have these changes in your you've been in the best interest of the Senate and would you support any future ... the filibuster\n[noise] yeah I I think that the filibuster rule the ones that required basically sixty votes in order to get legislation passed the judges are are put on the bench particularly at the Supreme Court and the appellate level when the Democrats did away with it for appellate judges\nI thought it was um a bad development because I'm running a to be a bipartisan senator and one of those things about sixty votes rules that really encourages of both sides to work together and come up with compromises rather than going to extremes where a bare majority and can get something passed\nSo I think it's a good idea to go back to that unfortunately the Democrats are started the process Republicans then went up to them as they said they would if they told them that that you would live to regret that if you went this route\nAnd sure enough or once the Democrats did it for the appellate judges other Republicans then tested for Supreme Court judges and so now it just takes a bare majority are and that's unfortunate because I think it really a leads to the kind of a democracy that we saw in the capital hearings were\nEach side has armed camps that are engaged in hyper partisanship\nAnd and and my opponent here was one of the leading exemplars\nWith his uh ... political flatulence examination a and is going to this man's year bark than an questioning him I mean that was all avoidable uh but uh yeah the answer your question I'd like to go back to more\nOf civility in in our proceedings and I think the sixty votes rule helps that helps bipartisanship but again if this man is elected uh they're gonna keep opening they're trying to reopen the cabinet ... even though he's now sitting justice\nOr they're going to a ... initiate impeachment efforts and so we're on and on with more a hyper partisanship that I think we need to avoid\nAnd this was a huge payback for big Republican donors\nHundreds of billions of dollars out into the donor class I don't think it's working well at all and when I hear Republicans talk about how we're going to solve this on the spending side\nHere's what worries me because I just listened to Mitch McConnell talking about this just a few days ago\nHe's going to go after Medicare he's going to go after Medicaid he said very clearly that that's what he was going to do he said it publicly so you got to be very watchful about looking at the spending side while you have a Republican Party that is announcing\nAnnouncing that it's going to go after Medicare Medicaid and Social Security as well as the protections of the Affordable CARE Act so I think we do have work to do and I'm\nThinking it's a little bit unfortunate that in with the economy as strong as it is we um gave away such huge tax benefits to people at the very very high us and you never hear people on the Republican side talking about income inequality and the moral problem that since I'm not a problem\nI actually have a follow up question is is a question for you Mr White house it was suggested by Providence Journal reader or in light of your criticism of the Trump tax plan have you voluntarily returned any tax cut that you may have received to the U.S treasury or if you kept it\nI don't know that I've received any yet so we'll see what would you do I'll pay my taxes\n[noise]\nAnd if you received a tax cut when you were returned to the U.S treasury\nI wouldn't even know how to go about doing that but [noise]\nLet me look at my taxes for us I don't have a tax cut off from it yet myself\nSo Mr Flanders is slightly different question if elected would you seek to force President Trump to release his tax returns and would you do anything to find out more about the alleged abuse of public funds in the trunk cabinet such as the use of military jets for travel\nYeah I don't uh on the taking the latter first I don't believe we ought to use military jets for travel for secretaries and things like that list are extraordinary circumstances justify it as far as the president's tax returns\nOr if I'm the Senate and the and the house a field that we need to have presidents disclose their tax returns than I Would be supportive of that uh but uh so far uh during the entire time senator White House has been there a there's been no such a bill passed\nA and so if there is one that should be ... and it should be apply across the board not just the you know single out one particular president and they're not to be retroactive\nSo it's of fairness and it ought to go forward\nAnd let me just say a word about the\nAh his comment about the uh do Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security and he's running ads are absolutely false on that subject the Republicans have never said they want to get rid of any of these um uh programs that's completely false this was just a scare tactic to go after seniors and others\nIn the hope that they'll vote him again for him again and elect Democrats\nThat is not what's going on\nSenator why not stop trying to scare people with this false ads that you're running about getting rid of Medicare and Social Security is just totally untrue if there need to be adjustments they should be done on a bipartisan basis and that's the only way I Would support him and I would hope that that's the only way you would stop\nLying about the fact that you say Republicans want to do away with Social Security that's totally bogus and falls and you know it was that\nNoticed that they ... seconds Mr White house of what I've said is that they want to cut it\nAnd the reason that\nThat because Mitch McConnell just said it himself because the Republican House\nA budget with two trillion dollars in Medicare and Medicaid cuts\nThose are real acts you can't pretend that is a fantasy and the idea that you will support Medicare and Medicaid cuts if you can find one Democrat to make a bipartisan I think virtually disqualified for this all these\n\nI didn't say I would support them that's another or misstatements I said that if there are to be any it would have to be on a bipartisan basis that's wall and look we want to preserve these broad as President Trump has said that this is off limits there aren't going to be any changes under his watch\nAnd so that suggests that this this is going to happen and Republicans want to get rid of these things as a complete falsified\nAll right we're going to move on you're listening to US Senate debate at the University of Rhode Island streaming I've heard Joe dot com broadcasting on the public's radio\nArmy and honest political reporter for the public's radio joined by\nJulia ... from the good five cent cigar and Michael McDermott from the Providence Journal this question we'll start with Mr Flanders a lot of Americans are concerned about the issue of health care of this election season your opponent has announced plans to sponsor a single payer health care bill\nWith center Bernard Sanders of Bernie Sanders of Vermont Canada Country afford that and and do you support it\nAbsolutely not this is a socialist fantasy costs thirty two point six trillion dollars over ten years we'd have to double our taxes from our corporations and our individuals and even then we couldn't pay for this thing\nFor the health care providers doctors and hospitals will have to take a forty percent cut in their uh reimbursements to do for the system to work in a what's worst of all is they will have to blow up the Medicare trust fund so far far from Republicans getting rid of Medicare\nFor the plan that this man is sponsoring with Bernie Sanders you'd have to blow up the Medicare trust fund that myself and other senior urban or donating to in putting money into all our lives\nAnd what were we get to that we'd get government bureaucrats telling us where to get our hip replacements\nYou'd have lines like the DMV are waiting to get there and we'd have bureaucrats dictating who are doctors are are we the hundred and fifty American a million Americans that get their health care plans from employers would have to lose all that and instead we get the government to tell us who are doctors are where we go\nWhat a disaster this is a nonstarter\nMr for a White House we know there are a lot of concerns about long term funding for Social Security and other entitlements you agree with your opponents estimate for how much a single parent would cost and how can the country or for that\nI don't know that I agree with that what I Do believe that if you were to go to a single payer would make the system better and more efficient for people and I think it is important to move towards a single payer system the notion that\nSocialized medicine and all those are the exact same arguments that Republicans made against Medicare and the first place so it's kind of funny to see those old uh cherries tried it out again here half a century later\nUm there is a path forward I think on this and we need to make sure that we protect the health care for our veterans\nWe need to make sure that people who are getting their health care through work and are satisfied with it and keep that choice\nWe need to make sure that people who are in Medicare Advantage which is a private subset of Medicare that that continues and we make sure that people who are in labor unions have the ability to continue to get the benefit of the health and welfare plants that they've paid into\nBehind that there can be a government support that allows insurance companies to try to change their business model to make you healthier\nRather than try to deny you care which has been the business model for far too long they're forced into it because of the role of the government I think we should have a single payer system is going to take some work to get there and although it may move some of the dollars into the federal accounts\nBy lightening up what people have to pay through private markets there's actually less spending by Americans on health care under a single payer so it actually saves money in the long run it just goes through federal accounts\nThis Clinton's going to be provoked you'll start with Mr White house or do you support legalizing marijuana nationwide and and I do believe it's each have the ability to legalize themselves I think that should be up to states ...\nYeah I I Would go slow on this let's see what the experiences in Colorado and these other places that have legalized that I'm very worried about the effects of it particularly when Rhode Island has been so hard hit by the opioid crisis they had yet\nOr something else that could adversely affect driving in effect a our young people in particular I'm worried about that so I wouldn't be cautious let's see uh all the expense that's\nInvolved and caring for people who have have have this issue or as well as the medical side of it so I I don't I wouldn't rush to judgment on legalizing it\nMistakes landers sexual assault seems to be in the news every day do you think sexual assault in the United states and if so what what you do in Washington to address it I'm Sorry I couldn't pick up the first part of the sexual assault seems to be in the news every day do you think sexual assault as a problem in the United states\nAnd if so what will you do in Washington to address it\nSexual assault of course is a problem it's a it's a terrible problem and uh the me too movement has exposed that ah there's too much of a going on and too much going on under under reported and but at the same time we can't forget the and the Kavanaugh hearings illustrated is that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "city": "Providence", "day": "20"}
