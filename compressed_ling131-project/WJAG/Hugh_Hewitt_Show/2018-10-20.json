five that's AAA eight to five five two to five\nRyan is starting this hour off from Indianapolis, Indiana Hey Ryan welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThey they think take Michael sure well see I I have a step daughter she is holding the fifth grade and she does okay in school but she struggled all it was focused attention but surely where she really I got a hurdles you really\nDon't want to start a business for were the other great selling a channel that she may but I also want to do it but it per se\nSo your your phone is breaking up can you speak directly into it you're cutting in and out can you hear me better now yeah sure\nOkay uh my ten year old she prayed\nI don't know I got a we heard we heard I got up to that point I started breaking up though I wanted to make sure she's making can that she's making chaotic exactly okay\nI Want a percentage of the Trump should go talk show in part of our cherry\nHill by question it as a not for profit company or shut up their regular L O\nI showed up as a sole proprietorship here over complicating candle business within your old\nOkay to shut up as a sole proprietorship you're probably not even gonna make any money you make a little bit it'll be fine pay some taxes on it and if you wanna funds a Roth IRA for her or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business the point is not the business\nThe point is what the kid is learning that they're learning work\nThey're learning interface with customers on how to treat people ah they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... these are the lessons are or what is important\nThe accurate if she makes some money that's just a bonus\nRight but what ... what are you by ... by the way this kid is wired and a lot of us that are entrepreneurial or a a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much will pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know so\nI'm sure you know but I ... if you start with this started like a hundred dollars a year or something you may want to do it in all asleep but if you if you're making under a hundred grand where the profit\nAre getting ready to have a kid go to college is bigger you shop\nAnd understand\nWhat college costs because\nIt is one of the most bizarre things to learn the\nThe distance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive goes I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty thousand a year spread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of college is the same cost it's just not\nAnd it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can't afford and as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education that puts a curriculum and the high schools and colleges across America we're now in forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff\nOf staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nThen what happens from time to time as the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come a long shot in the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the rams the organization is that we've had about four million students go through\nOne of the coolest things that's happened lately is the University of Wyoming has decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens\nThe college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers in our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good\nNow Tyler Moore is with me on the line and Kyle is from the University of Wyoming usually associate vice provost of enrollment tile Wyatt go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a if a player to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide from practical\nApplicable things for students to be able to apply that college search and and and be real savvy consumer of higher education\nYeah 'cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes we are we have the lower resident tuition or any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the ... so like your cheaper than my University of Tennessee or your cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was behind this\nI immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it so more and like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and the university math guy\nAnd a cowboy that can be anyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters here we're talking about a curiosity and attendance boldness\nAt pursued that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and vote for opportunities to make differences in the world we're talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog\nYou know it's not a cowboy isn't\nWhat you are but it's who you are\nWell and you guys are the cowboys\nI mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right\nThat looked at your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so it's just good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love it\nIt's a great motto or does it says so much in just a few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you got sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\nAs a coming up soon the the\nHigh school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nAs of coming up soon the the high school curriculum but cause the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool Kyle thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are state that is very practical where state that very\nMuch um applicable in terms of being smart with our money we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunities to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation in the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're you know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nI'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nThere's sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI've talked to a lot of Provo is around the country I'm my own chancellor and vice chancellor of the ... Tennessee and it's a constant thing the ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process at searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition if a doctor or renting institution we're near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north or south\nWe can be a solution that provide students and incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping\nA student be successful not just students access\nAnd part of that is not racking up a lot of dead at the end of their\nDegree completion I meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we had a little over or twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here at a call themselves cowboy\nYou know that's a good size school that's not too big and not too small that's that's that's just right as a Goldilocks or they'll just right\nVery cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on whether ...\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nI Love it I Love the motto and I think the world doesn't anymore cowboys in so many watch [laughter] good stuff I got a little picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but a bottom line is lesser mascot and so now\nIt's a that's very cool stuff I Love it and what a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or university and you'd like to do something like that maybe don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something\nEvery high school in the states some states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but uh um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to at the in the building where I used to go to high school the other day and snow middle school so I had all the forty really bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me that's the hardest speaking you'll ever have I'll just tell you um but\nUh his Anthony O'Neill's got tough job you know but a pretty cool it's pretty cool to go back over there and you know if it wasn't and by the way that the school has our curriculum I furniture to them on the sponsor on that one [noise] but see that's how you doing just that easy one [laughter]\nAh the world needs more cowboys I like it and this is the day Ramsey show\n\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy in a Q ... when getting your mortgage you really think he cares about your lungs are money goes
