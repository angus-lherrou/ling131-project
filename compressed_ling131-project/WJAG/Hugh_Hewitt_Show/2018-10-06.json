living in the abuse aren't you\nIn your head\nYeah I mean my kids and I we we weren't homeless for a while we we've started there are a lot and I read he tried to get custody of them I had to go to

shortage America was the lead your Kimberly Israel is in Alexandria, Virginia\nKimberly welcome to the day Ramsey show\nGay thank you so much for taking my call sure a lot that blew my\nMind my question is is my dad is Seventy five years old\nSteel works He works in a steel plant\nMakes about four fifty to six fifty a week\nUm about a couple of years ago he got sick I found out that he had a paid\nHe's behind on a lot of itself had a somehow ... got a fifty thousand dollar loan from the bank\nAnd ah he doesn't have um\nAttention he gets about Fifteen hundred\nAnd so the security\nAnd I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do\nAt this stage for him um I Do provide hands I took over all the bills and I did provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that\nFor him to buy food and what are you doing with the rest of the ...\nI'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all and I'm paying all his death the sale has about a Fifteen K left on the equity loan ...\nTen thousand on a credit card mhm eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the edge\n[noise] I'm putting everything was a turning out to auto\nEverything on on that much money does that amount to\nWhat is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about\nA thousand a month\nThat's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get the right\nTo aid on a car eight on a house and she won a credit card\nOkay All right and you know if you divide that about four thousand a month\nI think you're done in a year\nOkay and your first goal would be to get him debt free\nYou're done with a dead an ear right rankles get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and he's still working at a steel plant that I understand that right\nYes I was going to come a moment and it'll come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year\nMhm and that way you that free and if he's a hundred percent debt free house and everything you can probably make it on his Social Security if you had to write okay not yeah\nNot ideal not what we want but we can probably get there and uh then the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free\nThen let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses but we get past that then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement it's clear that debt and to have that emerges on employers\nAnd is still the baby steps in other words\nOkay that sounds good well I'm asking is why at a bank loan um someone at his age\nThe K and all\nYou know four and a and it could be paid off in twenty forty three and knowing that\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid\nAnd the second reason is counting on my house I've got to lean against the house right\nWell that's true then show the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral is part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is\nYou know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry\nI mean they'll they'll loan anybody to breathe or not breathing money you know what I'm saying the lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid show there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nOkay and so the industry is you're stupid\nIs what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would have offered a dog that credit card so I mean in dead people get credit card offers show is you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations\nTim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how're you\nDoing on friday I got a record retirement okay\nI'm I'm fifty two here about a year mhm and um I don't you don't have a four one K. all pretty good\nDid you hear about a year ... and um I have a bench and then I'll have a while we carry all pretty good mhm I click here but if it to be better to file for Social Security and weight\nWhile before it touches on gay or take well we have for the whole time and they really\nYou can run the math out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it say words if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes or you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it by not taking after four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier\nUh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh that would definitely have [laughter] yeah so you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death page of a male and the U.S is Seventy six\nAveraged ... deaf I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight but once you've lived to be sixty is higher than that because that those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the ... tables right now and so um\nThat that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so the question man like you were joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire I taught how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nWell I'm paying for ... I when I spoke to the lady she said I can ask your question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my for my daughter who's thirty one I'm fifty two and\nUm I've been a dreamer I guess for a free spirit as you would say from listening to your show addict now for the last two weeks [laughter]\nI Know who you were before that it's All right but um my wife and I sat down and we've never been able to agree on money um she's the shaver um the spender and just I don't you know I don't know what the money situation is where I go and spend it [laughter]\nAnd um [noise] five we've set aside step one we've got a thousand now we've put aside the shaving she wants to say more than that but [noise] she I'm she's always ran the show and I've been kind of just kind of go along with her at this point um\nWe paid off to credit cards and we paid off on the credit card my question is is\nBy doing so many things right now I'm In the one thing I'm concerned me it's about down the road is my retirement and I've worked for a company for Fifteen Years and I've got\nAbout ... eldest daughter pack was the total money make over a book in there\nYes it is I started to read that I haven't read it\nWas total makeover has every detail about the seven baby steps as the seven baby steps on steroids\nAnd so it's going to walk you through first thing you do\nJust save a thousand dollars to get on a written plan you and your wife or an agreement and we're gonna we're in agreement that we're going to work this plan together okay and once you do that then you're first goal which you squeeze out of your budget as you say that I was in dollars if you've already got money saved than we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except for homeless than your debts smaller the laws\nYou attack those are caused by getting rid of those that famous now you've got the ability to invest\nAnd then you start at the time and it's been used to\nShow that book is going to walk wherever they make sure you and your wife for more than that yeah there\nPlus face if this is a hectic time of year but here's the deal\nIt's not an excuse to lose track of your spending especially when we made it so incredibly easy for you with our sorry budgeting tool called every dollar with every dollar you give every dollar a name at the beginning of the month and then you track the expenses against your budget throughout the month it's really that easy\nSeeing how that affected other people in the hopelessness that they felt ... and I'm just let them know that there's another way to do it better plan\nIt
