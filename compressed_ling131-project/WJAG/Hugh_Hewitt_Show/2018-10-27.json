I'm not exactly sure what to think that they are not the beneficiary combat it or how to handle it mhm\nOkay so he took the shot when your husband was a trial\nYeah this is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's quite annoying dollar\nOne that should be canceled\nOkay there's a whole life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight yeah yeah and like my parents you know I found out the beneficiary I doubt I mean it's a great guy I'm not worried about\nYou know that it's like I don't care as a guy doesn't matter of a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very and like going down on you know a wild one but it's strange how\nLong have you been married for a long you been married five years you know five years they've not address this issue that strength\nThe strength you know it really I mean they should you should address the issue that\nThey should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on a half a million dollar policy that's a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term\nTo create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a poor right of return that when you die they keep your money so ... life insurance is a horrible financial product\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you've got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and said that\nUh I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want anything to paying for something I Do not only that but you have all the time say\nWell it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed\nYep 'cause you know ... as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nYeah I have a question regarding up part of my retirement savings sure come a thing called a pension from my company and that\nOverall is about\nEight percent of my total ... or ... ...\n... oh well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that that would be about eight percent of my total assets you know and and my question is whether the cat has a lump\nSum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter]\n'cause we're all going to die okay when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch of yes and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it might it might go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there is this Robert benefit is the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live\nAre as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's a if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve\nWe've got an account for you over here two hundred eighty five thousand you can invest it you can make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you can take that two hundred Ninety five thousand you throw it into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family\nOr better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family\nYeah I guess that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but ... so\nIt's still one of your dad in you know you got survivorship on it but when both of you know the same concept applies so the bottom line is it's got a decent\nBut low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die\nMakes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take vengeance lumps arms and roll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast duck mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth sending system are making\nA yeah it's a\nCloser to close that and that's probably about four oh\nWell in their total total network to assets house and so forth\nYou know the area Well Don ... congratulations\nHow old are you\nI'm sixty three white ago\nHow much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry or hungry range from both my\nAh my family and my wife ...\nWhere are you a millionaire or that was before that happened\nA millionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents were eligible young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern or because of the amount of heritage is ... maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nSince I was home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm ... I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now it's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter]\n[noise] well uh certainly you got to a live well below your means when they are a modest lifestyle which we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was new people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing is I think if you can limit\nIs saying that that should do in a way that's good I like that [laughter] big\nBecause every every everybody listening right now is\nHas done or will do stupid things but then you can minimize those things ... along the way and live a modest lifestyle will blow your means I'm no void\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if they're listening to me right now\nIs probably a probably even higher if they stay minimize those stupid you know maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you\nAnd it's that simple math on that works to your benefit a at a Wal alive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand ahead\nA thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me
