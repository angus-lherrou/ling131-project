pretend\nIf you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight and so it's still a good deal\nBut you're going to yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand\nSo that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but at the end the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have\nIn addition to

shocking to them because they were raised like regular people but\nHad a lot of wealth in the background and\nAnd um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about\nBut then as we presented to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot I will do we hit the lottery has asked for me and my house we sort of the lord\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God\nAnd that takes a little of the ... who off of it\nSo they need to be emotionally maturity and share it with him and we do it
