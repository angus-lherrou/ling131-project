something wrong in their lives to be given such a great burden\nYet to think this way\nWe'd be wrong the disciples were so you'd be in good company and the gospel of John we recall the account of where Jesus killed the blind beggar in their travels de Jesus and the disciples passed by and saw a man who had been blind from birth\nAnd his disciples asked him rabbi who send this man or his parents that she was born blind and Jesus answered it was not that this man send or his parents but that the works of God might be displayed in him\nThis account serves to show how wrong we may be in our thinking for this man had a God given purpose\nWhen a life is created when we are blessed with such a great gift we may see it as merely inconvenient not worthy of having right now as this new life is in a way of the plans we have made for ourselves\nThroughout the world about fifty five sixty million God given lives are taken by abortion each year\nThe arguments for abortion range from not wanting to raise children with birth defects to those concede due to rape yet those cases are the absolute rarity among those who choose abortion\nTwisted in the devils\nLives as we are we may\nLonger see the value in lives created by God his children no less as worthy of protecting\nSin has caused us to become towel a sub seen life as having great value from the one who gives a dead as we are in our sinfulness we placed little value in lives that are no longer able to contribute to society or to us more rightly said it\nWould be good could bring a disabled child into this world possibly brain\nWhat purpose does grandma or grandpa in their frail bodies offer or one with a disease that will keep them requiring care for a long\nTime stripping them of their ability to be active citizen\nEven though it was my actions that caused a life to be created my life isn't ready to share with another so I'll just make this problem go away\nIt isn't really a life until it fully enters the world we hear today and until then we have a right to choose to do whatever we want with it\nWe need not look hard at a mirror to see how broken we are our thoughts may even shock is it time looking at strangers seeing how they are dresser are thinking of what little value they contribute judging their life as worth less\nThan our own but what if we are wrong what if our sitting written reason cannot be trusted and we were to give God the final say in our lives\nRemember how we were once created in his image oh\nThat image has been shattered but it is helpful to see how our natural inclination to hold cell value above others in this world should be seen\nAs a sign of sickness you see\nAll were and are created in his image I'll be at a shattered remnant of it and God loves that so much that he wants that all would be saved and if his value for all of us just so great even broken\nThe God loves us so much that he wants that all would be saved\nAnd if his value for all of us is so great even broken and simple as we are there must be something to each life that he grants to exist and therefore we have no business pronouncing a right to choose its existence or not\nAnd as Christians we cannot be complacent about this issue we cannot claim to seek God by his words to be followers and to not speak out against the hatred towards his creation that exist today\nPro choice is sitting in God's throne and making decisions that only he should make euthanasia is also the same\nSure things are broken in this life and we can expect some tough stuff to enter our lives yet using evil for good as God does all lives how purpose\nWe may not see it as clouded as our eyes have become by swallowing the devils lies but there is much to be gained by knowing the one true God as he is\nYou see God is a servant king each action is one that is meant to draw us into a deeper understanding of who he is and how valued his creation is to be seen\nThinking we know better in seeking control we'd be left looking at an eternity of darkness death and torture in choosing the devil as whom we should follow\nYet wanting none of that God in knowing how we could never perfectly fulfill the laws that are best for us since his only be gotten son to save us\nAnd with him living his most perfect life Jesus then traded his life for our dead ones ones that deserves nothing but God's wrath and separation from him\nTo see how lucky you are you must see how enemies as we are God's still loves us enough to provide the fix to show us that even our lives still hold precious value to him all lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and wants us in spite of our own the facts maybe then we can see how his love extends to every one everywhere and that they too are valued and deserved to know of his love also\nThose who God creates are no accident regardless of how they arrive in this world the blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect to be burdens are precious in the eyes of God\nThose who need our compassion and service are there to teach us and they exist as lives that we may grow in love by and that is the real gift\nGod grant says to learn of how we too may love and in doing so may receive love and return\nFollowing him we can expect is sinful broken world to bring with it trials in hardships yet we are made stronger and blessed to be in closer communion with him trusting as he draws us into deeper understandings of his plan and purpose amidst the chaos\nNow if you are listening\nAnd you have gone against that which God wish for you to have taking a life and now find yourself surrounded by the darkness of that decision and feeling the pain\nI encourage you not to hide in the shadows where the devil once you but instead to bring that to the one who loves you the most your lord and savior who seeks to save the center the last the broken\nThe one who's forgiveness knows no limits in seats to embrace you again in his love\nAmidst darkness storms in trials Jesus Says I Am with you always even to the end of the age and in that there is much to be thankful for\nThe life giver our lord and savior seeds to give us life eternal in him he wants to share of his love that you would share his love with others also\nMay we always think of God's created children however they arrive in this world and wherever we find them in the age of this life\nIs full of value and purposes God declares us to be for the whole children are a heritage from the lord the fruit of the room a reward may we thank the lord always for valuing our lives enough to save them\nBut there was nothing greater to be thankful for today than a father who spared not even the life of his son to save ours\nAnd trusting in this most precious work of Christ we will arrive home again to share in a life that never ends\nMade that piece which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in your lord and savior
