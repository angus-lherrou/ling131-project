crucified will solve all of your personality problems all will solve any of them immediately but this I say with complete confidence\nMaking the cross of Christ your own will change your whole outlook on life it will bring you into a relationship a friendship with God the kind that God wants to have with you it will give got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be and that's pretty wonderful\nConsidering what God has got to work with in the case of most of us\nIt's pretty wonderful all around a godsend his son and then he died to bring us back to God\nBecause the glory and the wonder of it which caused St Paul to say to all of us Christ did not send me to see how many I could baptize but to proclaim that gospel and I have not done this by the persuasive notice of clever words but I have no desire to Rob the cross of its power\nThe preaching of the cross is I Know nonsense to those who are involved in this dying world but to wash who are

listening to Duluth ruin our and we just heard the message from Dr Oswald Hoffman first preached in Nineteen fifty five talking about the rapid pace of technology and joined you're in the studio by Dr Tony cook director of us ministries or at least for an hour ministries\nRapid pace of technology is nuts mood at all as\nI remember when I was a kid I Lived out on a farm and the middle of a cornfield we didn't have air conditioning we didn't have cable TV we didn't have a cell phone we didn't have an answering machine at one point we didn't have computers you know anything like that\nAnd to think of where we are today it was like I was living you know like life on the prairie [laughter] something like that and then then all of a sudden those technological advances started and they started to you know kinda multiplies ... speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking\nWell I'll just let the next generation deal with that I can\nTo start and they started to you know can multiply in their speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking well I'll just let the next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out I had this thought that well I'm sure that's just kind of for kids I really don't\nNeed and and now today you know\nHow it's it's kind of permeated everything so yeah a technology I think is a an amazing amazing gift but it it does make your head spin and it also brings questions of of morality and and usage and in how we're using things appropriately or or inappropriately as well\nDr Hoffman speaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better and that's the same thing we could say today what does that mean for Christianity for the church\nBut it's interesting er here at the losing our we use technology a lot to um to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out into the world\nBut I'm not someone once said that the Internet is where religions go to die really yeah and I it's kind of an odd what do they mean by that well I think that the the point is that\nWhen you have a faith of any kind um that's talked about on the Internet you're exposed to all the other ones ... and you're exposed to people from all these different belief systems that they know this is the right point to notice is the right point or my way of saying here's the proof for this or whatever it might be\nI think it's partially because of the fact of um exposure and as I go back to the beginning of this when I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody other than the six hundred people who lived in my town you know but now every religion every bought every philosophy that exists in the world comes to you\nAnd I think for many people that is a challenge and they don't know how to necessarily think through those things so I I think it's important on the one hand that as Christians that we use technology in a way that gains a hearing for the gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd that proclaims that gospel in a way that um is clear maybe even more than it has been in the past because\nWe can assume that people understand the message of the church anymore I'm with all these competing messages that are there so on the one hand technology is this great tool\nFor us to use to communicate the gospel but also it presents a challenges with other ways of looking at things sometimes that can be a challenge\nOr just for people who might not be as as strong in their faith and thought about their faith that might challenge them as well I'm not that we should pull out of technology\nBut I'm understanding who we are in whose we are and being able to articulate our faith clearly as we confront these diverse messages I think is extremely important with all of this technological change\nAnd as much as technology continues to change what remains the same is God's love for us in Jesus Christ than we've reached that message each week you're on the program and that's kind of beauty I think of Christianity\nIs the goal post really never move [laughter] itself a Jesus has already kick that ball and and that game has been one of 'em and\nFor us the message is the same the message that because of Jesus Christ\nThat the love of God is here for you that the kingdom is here for you that there is a place that has been prepared for you by God in God isn't your enemy is not against you he wants you to be with him forever in his kingdom and that comes through\nThe crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and wild things are changing you can never change that that's something that his his historic is something that happened and it's something that regardless of what you're facing you can always go back to and say this is the one thing that makes a difference\nAnd then that crucifixion and resurrection we find our identity then as as people have got\nA and this is the kind of the beauty of it it almost a ... not only beauty but it's it's like a beautiful mystery to me are identity being connected to Jesus that in our baptism that death that we talked about that that that saves the world from saying\nWe are connected to that death so in our baptism we die and we rise with Jesus and our identity is directly connected to the identity of\nThe son of God and so when you worry about who am I\nA in these changing times or how do people perceive me on Facebook and all these other a technological platform\nThe real question that we should be asking as as hot as God's Ears and God sees us in\nJesus our identity as him in him we have a diet and risen with him and when he looks at as he sees through that death and resurrection of his son and he loves us any cares for us any for gives us and he wants us to know who he is\nAt the same time that message is not an easy one it's perceived as foolish both by those who take religion very seriously and by those who don't Yeah Dr Hoffman talked about that the uh the foolishness of the message\nThat the that is being preached and yet that is the message that contains the power of God for saving us\nYeah it's interesting 'cause we talk about the Christianity is foolishness I'm On the one hand a person could say that and you think well that's a horrible thing to say I'm sure that's not correct but if you ever take time to look at it you know I guess it [laughter] um it it's foolishness to our human\nWay of thinking really\nThe why is this person in the world would not have come up with this as a solution to the to the problem is and you know so you think that okay sin came into the world and the solution is that God is going to sacrifice his son Jesus and that belief in that\nJesus in in that son of God and his sacrifice is somehow a Tony for us\nThat doesn't make sense it just doesn't make sense and and so when you try to think about it a cognitively with your mind or academically or treat it like math or science or you know something like that in dissect it in the end you kind of step back from it and go\nRegardless what the Democrats but Democrats didn't weigh one\nVote garage which ones are more

most of us\nIt's pretty wonderful all around a godsend his son and then he died to bring us back to God\nWas the glory and the wonder of it which caused St Paul to say to all of us Christ did not send

Greeks and intellectual panacea but all we preach is Christ crucified stumbling block to the Jews and share nonsense to the ... but for those who are cold weather shows are gentile\nChrist the power of God and the wisdom of God amen\nYou're listening to the loo through an hour and we just heard the message from Dr Oswald Hoffman first preached in Nineteen fifty five talking about the rapid pace of technology I'm joined here in the studio by Dr Cooney cook director of us ministry cigarette Lutheran our ministries\nThe rapid pace of technology is not slowed it all has it\nI I remember when I was a kid I Lived out on a farm on the middle of a cornfield we didn't have air conditioning we didn't have cable TV we didn't have a cell phone we\nDidn't have an answering machine\nAt one point we didn't have computers you know anything like that\nAnd to think of where we are today it was like I was living you know like life on the prairie\n[laughter] something like that and then then all of a sudden those technological advances started they started to you know kind of multiply in their speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking\nWell I'll just let the next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out I had this thought that well I'm sure that's just kind of for kids I really don't need and and now today you know how it's this kind of\nPermeated everything so yeah a technology I think is an amazing amazing gift\nBut it it does make your head spin and it also brings questions of of morality and in usage and in how we're using things appropriately or or inappropriate as well\nDr Hoffman speaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better and that's the same thing we could say today what does that mean for Christianity for the church\nBut it's interesting er here at the losing our we use technology a lot to um to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out into the world but I'm not someone once said that the Internet is where religions go to die\nReally yeah and I it's kind of an odd what do they mean by that well I I think that the the point is that\nWhen you have a faith of any kind um that's talked about on the Internet you're exposed to all the other ones ... and you're exposed to people from all these different belief systems that they know this was the right point no this is the right point or my way as and here's the proof or this or whatever it might be\nI think it's partially because of the fact of um exposure and as I go back to the beginning of this when I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody other than the six hundred people who lived in my town but now every religion every thought every philosophy that exist in the world comes to you\nAnd I think for many people that is a challenge and they don't know how to necessarily think through those things so I I think it's important on the one hand that as Christians that we use technology in a way that gains a hearing for the gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd that proclaims that gospel in a way that um is clear maybe even more than it has been in the past because we can assume that people understand the message of the church anymore I'm with all these competing messages that are there so on the one hand technology is this great tool\nFor us to use to communicate the gospel but also it presents challenges with other ways of looking at things sometimes that can be a challenge\nOr just for people who might not be as strong in their faith or thought about their faith that might challenge them as well I'm not that we should pull out of technology\nBut I'm understanding who we are in whose we are and being able to articulate our faith clearly as we confront these diverse messages I think is extremely important with all of this technological change\nAnd as much as technology continues to change what remains the same is God's love for us in Jesus Christ and we've reached that message each week you're on the program\nAnd that's kind of beauty I think of Christianity is the goalposts really never move [laughter] you know it's a a Jesus has already kick the ball and and that game has been one of 'em\nAnd for us the message is the same the message that\nBecause of Jesus Christ that the love of God is here for you that the kingdom is here for you that there is a place that has been prepared for you by God in God isn't your enemy is not against you he wants you to be with him forever\nIn his kingdom and that comes through the crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and while things are changing you can never change that that's something that his his historic is something that happened\nAnd it's something that regardless of what you're facing you can always go back to and say this is the one thing that makes a difference\nAnd in that crucifixion and resurrection we find our identity then as as people have got\nA and this is the kind of the beauty of it it almost a ... not only beauty but it's it's like a beautiful mystery to me are identity being connected to Jesus that in our baptism that death that we talked about that that that saves the world from soon\nWe are connected to that death so in our baptism we die and we rise with Jesus and our identity is directly connected to the identity of the son of God and so when you worry about who am I\nA in these changing times uh how do people perceive me on Facebook and all these other a technological platforms\nThe real question that we should be asking is is how does the gods see us and God sees us in\nJesus our identity as him in him we have a diet and risen with him and when he looks at as he sees through that death and resurrection of his son and he loves us and he cares for us any for gives us and he wants us to know who he is\nThe same time that message is not an easy one it's perceived as foolish both by those who take religion very seriously and by those who don't Yeah Dr Hoffman talked about that the uh the foolishness of the message that the that is being preached and yet that is the message that contains the power of God\nAt the uh the foolishness of the message that the that is being preached and yet that is the message that contains the power of God for saving us\nYeah it's interesting because when you talk about the Christianity is foolishness I'm On the one hand a person could say that and you think well that's a horrible thing to say I'm sure that's not correct but if you ever take time to look at it you know I guess it [laughter] um it's foolishness to our human\nWay of thinking really the wiser person in the world would not have come up with this is a solution to the to the problem is and you know\nSo you think that okay sin came into the world and the solution is that God is going to sacrifice his son Jesus and that belief in that Jesus in in that son of God in his sacrifice is somehow a Tony for us\nThat doesn't make sense it just doesn't make sense and and so when you try to think about it a cognitively with your mind or academically or treat it like math or science or as you know something like that in dissect it", "show_name": "Wisconsin's Morning News", "year": "2018", "city": "Norfolk", "day": "21"}
