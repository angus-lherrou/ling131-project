I've got a patio\nThat ah it's cut off a certain point but yet we've got a deck over chop ...\nA day or two bladder I've got mud brick you know maybe Eighteen\nBut yet we've got a deck of workshop where the uh the deck porches splattered I've got mud brick you know maybe Eighteen Inches up all great\nOK okay what have you tried to get it off ...\nWell that's my like go to the pressure wash right but I don't know that you're probably taken away border of I used the fresh\nAir not if you don't you know might go to on that might be a pressure washer to Dan but yeah you just gotta be\nYou know how to use a little common sense on the amount of pressure you use from the pressure wash or what they mean by that is I probably wouldn't use like if you used a twenty four hundred PSI pressure washer\nAnd you used a twenty five degree nozzle and you were Eighteen or twenty four inches away from it you'll be fine\nUnless I really had really soft brick or really solve mortar a guy I mean I'd probably go that direction but you were going to say my problem is so good [laughter]\nWell I mean by a fresh washer that's like a twenty seven hundred fiesta as I think that'd be a problem still\nOkay so if you have that let's backing off to a forty degree now so\n[noise] forty degree yeah okay\nSo you guys have already degree nozzle and then you still say Eighteen to twenty inches away from it and I it it'll probably be enough pressure to go ahead and take it off you may have to play around ... you'll be fine if you go to a wider\nSand or of that uh nozzle that in terms of a cleaner oxygen needed bleach would be the cleaner you would use\nUm United valley yeah and you hear me talk about one in there's different degrees of it\nI talk about the masonry defender dot com which is ...\nThey have a masonry cleaner on that website which is a high grade oxygen native bleach so if you want it to their ... so and yeah it's a battery mix was water you'd spraying on splashing on mopping on led said about ten minutes rubbing rinse\n[noise] okay All right hey thank you so much crime rate is\nVery good about things they care Bye bye good point by him two\nWhen you use a pressure wishing that I Love using pressure washer and people that have pressure wash or they love using pressures to\n... game little toys little fun but you can do a lot damage you if you don't use it properly\nSo if you have like a twenty seven hundred and eight all up to like four thousand PSI early morning in\nAnd you don't want it I mean if you get thirty five hundred PSI pressure wash or twenty five degree nozzle start hitting a concrete driveway your twelve to Eighteen Inches away from that concrete you actually etch that concrete\nBut if you rent twenty four hundred twenty five degree knows well he changes the way you not\nBut you might want to seal after that so you can't be just a little careful with it but you can use it changes to a wider fan nozzle\nBack off a little bit how close you are\nBut even if even use the water for a a pressure wash Ron brick inspect the brick and he said missing mortar and that is a problem\nYou got to make sure that you don't have missing motor ever\nOn your house like in a couple of good stories about that too but a pass we'll get to Dan Dan welcome\nGary thanks so much for taking my call you have a great detail\nThank you sir

mixed or the ones you have to mix in ... in its self leveling for the most part\nUm or\nIf you wanted to you when they usually use the two by four you get yourself an eight foot to buy for use as afloat\nYou pour the floor level are on there and you just run that two by four over which will spread that evenly and level it out\nOkay I Will I been guys on line using trials and I didn't I mean that looks more like our then\nYeah well you know if you got a two by four I think that's the perfect way I mean that's the big long float get somebody on the other end of that just run that over perfect\nPerfect 'cause you know it's the floor in Europe put on there's you know it just needs to be level just means dirty and level and that will certainly accomplished that task okay in ... and ... sometimes people have an inch inch and a half that's a problem\nYeah yeah [noise] um how 'bout how 'bout the craft is the soccer field that with the level or\nUm while you're gonna have to it it'll probably just crack right through I mean but it'll be level right right you know yeah you're going to anyone over then\nI didn't know if there is a different uh [noise] a different product\nThat I just remember that that solve cut their is designed to be the weakest joined a slave in case you have some movement it'll\nCorrect in that crack mhm and if you put Flora level or overt it's going to correct so but that's OK your floor is going to be over but you wouldn't even know will correct\nOkay so I was just concerned with using that much lower level in that middle crack a crock pot why in deep huh how wide or they uh well at the top of them they got to be a good half the time of course in why real guts yeah\nWere you analyze and all that was something oh\nOkay or any ideas you suggest [laughter]\nI think what I Would do is if they were that white I just haven't seen them that way I Would get a backer rod in a backer rod is like film rope\nOkay that comes in different sizes half inch five eighty three quarters inch in just push it down in there get it down below the surface and then run your level or over that they'll just keep it from\nYou know going into nowhere land right ... you went waste the floor level or so it's just sick simply a backer rod it's called back a rod cost saver things like that\nOkay I'm kind of almost looks like it's a tall or close to an actual sock\nPass okay All right let's put it won't matter just put that back or ride in there if it's real deep though just saved from wasting the foreign level [noise]\nSounds great thank you Gary All
