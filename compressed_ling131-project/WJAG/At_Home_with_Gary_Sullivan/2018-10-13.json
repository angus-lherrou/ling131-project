to buy one ... are they in stores\nYes you're absolutely the I'm probably the biggest consumer or customer we have to her and the coach light would be Costco and cut the coach lights in the Cosco stores and us and Canada\nAnd then for flood lights um we're about halfway through the rollout with all the Home Depot stores in the U.S over within the next two weeks every Home Depot store us and Canada will have the flight in stock as well\nOkay and um somebody says is there a phone number for the first of all I mean you got to have the Internet in your home correct absolutely yeah\nThis is a wife I based product so you use your um use your phone's Bluetooth a feature to to set the device up but then once the device that set up and basically the device where the cameras are connected to the cloud so you've got to have ... for that\nRight and um yeah yeah so this is why it's a smart home\nYou got to have a wife I for a smart TV too right you got to have fun yeah All right so what happens I've got my coach light I got my maximus coach light up I got a camera what happens if I have two lights by the way\nYeah well ... we have another um another product called the companion light guy basically all of our porch lights come with companion lights and it's the same uh actual fixture\nA same designed same finish that are in in essence it just doesn't have a camera on it but it pairs with your light with the camera so if you've got a a left and right a light\nOn your front door you've got lights on your house as you walk up the sidewalk towards your your front door that you all want a map that you want to have these products will match and be the same light fixture you can do that and it's called a companion like\nYeah I guess if you had one coach light and you actually at the camera facing towards the driveway and the other one right on the\nPorch you could do that again and again you know a limitation you can have as many with cameras as you want is that if you you know you don't always need cameras on every light but you want to have more lights that sort of match and um for the design of your home and and so forth and have the other lights where you need lighting up so we offer the companion lights um customers like that\nNow here's a question if my daughter has not in my home town and she said enough to the beach she's not gonna ever phone with her can I can I be paired with her\nLife and cameras should not watch our house\nShores I mean here's a couple different ways to do that and I mean certainly um\nAny any customer can share their their log in and password with someone else that's the easy way we again then you can't take it back so right well we ... what we've offered or what we've been included in our ... is is called share camera where you can actually share one camera to cameras with someone else\nFor some period of time and then they can see their your camera along with theirs and then you come back from vacation or whatever then you can ensure that camera so it's a way to share my you're\nSharing contacts on your iPhone\nYeah men in but the beauty of that is as you're not actually pass along your log in the past where it's temporary and I'm In it and you can delete that sharing a anytime you'd like to\nGo so what happens when a stranger or friend or foe walks up to the door and I have ... most cooks like their whatever\nSo the first thing that happens is you get a notification someone's at your door and there's another feature cold medication or I'm\nA greeting someone someone comes to your door you can actually have a automatically set up in the in the app you can have a greeting play for that person\nIt can be a barking dog it can be a time you can be sorry we're not interested today we've added or over the weekend we added over Halloween reading so you have something seasonal and then they automatically here that greedy when they walk up if you want that you know if you went to and you can turn it off or on okay now\nOkay I mean I think of that and most importantly recording starch okay so no matter what happens there recording starts because the motion sensor was triggered says recording starts am I watching that on my cousin and if you want okay yeah so you get that you get the like if you want to watch it live you can still goes to the club okay and\nSo is there how long do I have access to the club cloud to watch that\nVideo yes so depending on your level of service if you're if you don't have any kind of a paid subscription which does not require that device works at a hundred percent without any type of paid subscription\nThe um the video will remain in cloud for a minimum of two hours okay if you have any kind of a paid service and he can lessen the cloud for up to up to a month if you if you have some kind of in the services very inexpensive you know one of the thing I might mention to um I don't want to forget this this is very important feature\nIs that when they're recording starts um you can watch the person live but when the clip is actually loaded of the cloud we actually put ten seconds onto the front of that video okay one of the things we've noticed is that the the beginning\nAnd the videos of critical kind of the the video so um we put ten additional seconds on the front end so you'd actually miss anything\nVery good marketing is my guest he is with maximus lining Randy Diane Sheila please hang on I'll get your calls right on the other side of the break your at home with Gary solvent [noise]\nAnd you have questions area call I've

I mean I don't know how to share\nOkay well ... actually today\nMarks ready to go with your ... question he he may I think he's got an answer\nYes so one one feature we do have um that's important is that we ... we do send the alert to your smartphone when your cameras on line or off line\nSo if the power goes out on your home\nNo matter where you are there'll be a mess he gets into your phone and it says that the the cameras off line so at least you know that it's off line for some reason which is usually it's easier either their wife eyes out okay for the power's out but we don't offer um any type of supplemental power at this time we get that question it's something that we're learning at\nUm interests but we don't we disappointed does need power to to operate\nInterests you yeah all kinds of issues here [laughter] that's wonderful though [laughter] All right um I just had a thought and just that just ran out of my brain so we'll go to Tom tom welcome\nThank you Gary thank you thank you so much a question about them if it offers any kind of a local storage the adult video store the cloud\nYeah so we were strictly a wife byproduct um there are other products I'm On the market lower tech products that offer local storage and um there's just so many limitations with local storage could you know mainly the biggest says you can't really\nYou can't really view the the independent which one you have you really can't do it when you're somewhere else where you get a full with the actual card if some sort but there is no local storage it's all it's all cloud based so this allows you to to view the activity from any place at any time in the world basically\nOkay well I just I just thought with a storage being fairly cheap maybe there was a way to plug in like a it was the hard drive or something like that on a different note on the wife I network inside the house that might you might be able to videotape so\nWell that's a good that's a good suggestion so you're saying offer an additional storage um keep it why pi base but offer some external storage that's and that's a good um it's a good suggestion I mean you can you can download the videos and for them and save them um anytime but it is a good suggestion appreciate them or write that down\nThanks some ... to go um\nNow we're going to go real anti technical okay because it's the Gary question I got all the cameras going on I got motion detectors can I just turn the porch light on of course\nThat's a great question yeah so beyond the the camera functionality to video functionality it's a smart light so I'm within the ... um you can\nUm there's two things you can set a schedule for the light you can turn it off and on on demand ticket and you can also satellite schedule like does to dawn or a specific time you'd like to like to go on or off\nAnd then the other the other features what you'd like to like to do in this motion you went to lead to go on when there's motion all the time just a nighttime or whatever but yeah so yeah so it's a smart light in addition to having the camera capabilities\nYou can have a lot of fun with that if I Know I mean there's all kinds of features that's awesome that's awesome [laughter] All right mark kind of cut his my guess he is with smart security lights by maximus lighting\nWe'll come back with your calls at eight hundred eight two three eight
