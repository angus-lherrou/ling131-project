you\nBrian kill made\nBreak he'll be meeting the television so much is going on I hate to take even admitted off a welcome to the latest out of the brain ...\nGreeted by Martha ... hit a short time you know more than ... shows the story starting at seven o'clock eastern time and we'll co anchor most of our election coverage this year and um\nAnd I was on with her last night talking about Andrew Jackson America New Orleans out in paperback\nAnd just talking about how the president's handled the press president has got infuriated by the way he's being characterized after that lunatic and Florida was found to be mailing out bomb making material to his people perceived as a his targets of his of his words in attacks vice versa and then a couple of days later we had the horrific shooting and assassinations\nThat took place in the synagogue and then the president get blamed for that as well as his rhetoric and it's his supporter well the one guy is crazier than you could possibly imagine it's probably the craziest person out institutionalized in the country who's full family said he got crazier every time they saw him\nAnd who is how bad trouble with the law before the president's even running for president let alone got elected president you cannot leave I'm responsible for the actions of three hundred and thirty million people sixty million of which voted for him next\nTo synagogue shooting the president's rhetoric really a guy that hated the president goes into the synagogue to shoot Jewish people who are worshipping\nAnd that's the president reflects poorly and the president\nI mean I I just can't believe the standard big three now with the\nThings you need to the power of three Brian big numbers\nToday is an important day in us Iranian relations tell us why\nSo we are now just a handful\nBrian big numbers hearing\nToday is an important day in us Iranian relations tell us why\nSo we are now just a handful days for all of the sanctions that the previous administration had relieved against Iran a snapping back coming back into effect it's having a real impact on a rainy and leadership\nThat is the secretary of state Mike Pompeo was kind enough to join us at the top of the first hour talking about Iranian sanctions how he's trying to get the world to go along with it how private businesses already leaving that country they're trying to hurt that country economically to force them to the table to become a normal member of the family of nations that are trying to pressure on\nUh the problem is there's a lot of people around the world who are mad that the U.S pushed them to sign onto the steel and now we're backing out of it but that was John Kerry's deal not Donald Trump steal the numbers\nYou have a birthright citizenship if you're subject to the jurisdiction you're either a citizen or a legal resident but not if you are undocumented or a diplomat or a tourist\nCan we have an honest debate about anything instead of labeling somebody a racist or sexist\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us it's ridiculous and it has to end\nSo Donald Trump is just looking to create chaos and create anger and get his base out or has he talked about it before and they just want to do some good reporting and trying to break some news when they sat face to face Here's Michael Anton cut fourteen\nBeing based that belief on a misreading of the very first sentence of the fourteenth amendment which all persons born or naturalized in the United states are citizens they leave out part of the middle\nSubject to the jurisdiction there of the either leave it out or they say something to the jurisdiction just means you have to obey the law whatever the ash obey the law if you're a tourist coming from England or Canada or anywhere you have to obey US law while you're in the United states that do you make your children a citizen or a U.S citizen\nSo there's an argument why can't we have a good faith or even more than ... just walked in more than we got to go to a break but I just want you to weigh in\nOr you amazed that we just can't have an argument an excuse me a a debate on something that's really a gray area in the constitution you have to live with someone racist or does in a phobic\nYeah I mean I don't know how we move forward at the country if you can't have substantive discussions about evaluating things like\nThe constitution I Know the whole purpose of the Supreme Court is to evaluate questions of constitutionality based on current events and based on what's going on in the world and you have a conscience debate over how closely to adhere to the letter of the law in the constitution or whether or not it should be adapted\nFor circumstances but I was fascinated last night when you look back at the history of the fourteenth amendment how much just feeding discussion there has been over the claws are in you know with regard to the jurisdiction there off and I found it really interesting history lesson for myself and I think it's something that is worth discussing and Nikki she can't demonize each other just have the conversation\nMartha ... back in a moment she's on the story at seven o'clock tonight\nChallenging

Yemen on not who the rebel fan nobody who's oh I could understand there on the doorstep but they have not been careful about how they're doing it\nAnd then when the locks up all ah all these other Saturday family members into the Ritz Carlton he seems to be a guy\nThat is a little volatile let's say the least\nSo I asked the the secretary then you just told me you're not going to break but are you going to reevaluate their relationship because of his recent actions\nWere and we we've got to see where the facts ultimately lead us ah we we we truly have a responsibility to America to the American people to ensure that we have a good relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia or to general ... point to the people of Saudi Arabia\nUm are an important partner for the United states and we're working to make sure we have the right the facts right I've spoken to the king a couple of times I spoke with\nMBBS I've spoken with the foreign minister my direct counterpart algebra or numerous occasions I think the Saudis share our view they understand that they've got to get these facts out in the time was not on their side and doing so\nIt's a factual ridiculous those comes out they strangled him with limited he walked in the question is what did he have the most thought about what did he have the Saudi Arabia\nBesides being a critic did he have something specific that the Saudis so they can take this type or risk and risk a relationship to kill them and this ham handed way and ... and destroy his body maybe burn it was asked said\nWell you know I mean to me the question is is it because they're on the radar for being you know for this young leader of being a reformist that this kind of behavior really stands out and is this you know Middle East justice that has been carried out\nMany times before without any other country really batting an eyelash\nI I think it is very interesting it feels like there must there was a very deep personal dig against ah the crown prince that may have led to his really divisive action against this individual if indeed he was aware of it\nUm there's this is an amazingly fascinating character or on the Saturday scene here who has gone down her so much attention\nFor being so forward thinking when it comes to allow women to drive and women to the theater but then when women rise up they're cracking down on them as hard as ever so it is um I think this is this is someone who in some ways um pull the wool over a lot of people's eyes in terms of of what kind of leader he will be um\nAnd I think that we need to be very very careful we cannot you know if if you want to be a a reform around the world stage and then you have to give up you know the the kind of brutal activity that is not indicative of the kind of leadership that we we can really obviously be on the side of\nThe ... forget how bad relations was in Saudi Arabia and the administration of President Obama\nThey basically you could have been worse and allowing a Mubarak to get outfitted when he sewage second if you're going to allow that to happen you know what I'm going to watch your back and that was a bad message said\nWith the Arab Spring the Arab Spring was a disaster this president said uh was in a I'm not on buddy who ever hope for the best of whoever you want to lead lead we're not fighting your wars and that this person is pretty being consistent on that would open\nA too sick it around in Syria we're leaving would be a disaster weaving\nRight now in Afghanistan would be a disaster so he's instincts were to get out but the reality is he can be convinced are you seeing that Martha\nYeah I mean I think that when you look at the situation it's clear to everyone that not having a good relationship with Saudi Arabia is not an option\nAnd obviously the crown prince or if he was aware of what happened to democracy so he knows that but you know I think that that when you listen between the lines of what secretary of say palm pilot saying I'm you know this the relationship is evolving and it needs to be clear that we cannot abide this kind of horrific murder\nAnd that that needs you know that kind of relationship needs change but as you point out the dynamic that we had under the prior president was a you know a very Iran leading dynamic and we have had to recalibrate back to the alliances that we had in the middle east over over a century over hunting decades\nAnd um I think the relationship between Saudi Arabian Israel is is also one that really\nCannot be jeopardy are those who are going to do more to know because Martha needs to lighten up going to be all serious\nThe relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel is is also one that really cannot be jeopardy All right we're going to do more to know
