the hunter Cory ... as he was just stood up with the like he was it was a plant fake but when you look at the wine nobody was going out for a half\nAnd it looked like how she felt was cult following

almost wanna throwing their section is seen as being tackled where they basically yell fire and tried to get something out of it\nAnd it was just going to be like a shot twenty five yard field all too and it's a shame because the bill tearing Johnson he died for his first career interceptions the Tennessee thirty seven the bills picked up a fourth and one of the Tennessee twenty seven ivory ran for two yards\nAnd then we're setting up for the field goal so we'll have to wait till after the game to see\nSo what that was all about Tennessee what the football on their own twenty two yard line just picked up a first down they have three forty six left to go here and a quarter to try to get themselves down the aisle and pick up some points for halftime\nAlright thank you very much Paul Hamilton

have also thrown an interception Joe Flaco got picked off\nBy the brown deep in Cleveland territory as it appears they were going in for eight ten nothing leave but a Cleveland coming away with the

already our money watch ah so the chief hole there and take over on down and about inside the five yard line so get a city with the ball now looks like they didn't convert on a third now so they're going to put it away I think it's their\nFirst part of this gay but they are up ten nothing and they will have the ball to start the second half\nHas been a very fast aren't for the lions at home today against the Packers seemingly everything going the home team is weighing nothing going to visit his way here's any cap at Ford Field\nYeah that's a perfect summary they're rich when we're both in the twelve o'clock hour I said this game was going to be highly unpredictable and with all the question marks on both sides who would have thought that it may think Crosby would admit to feel both won wide lap\nAnd I don't think off the right cross fire\nThe lions right now taking advantage of leading this one by a score of Seventeen to nothing\nA couple of hackers turnover as one was a Aaron Rodgers getting back on a third down which he gave a lion great field position which led to the lions only ... thirty nine yards the other alliance tours are like Eric one from a yard out twice and the lion the\nBlood blood touchdowns are both came off of a Packers or misuse or miss field goal Andy turnovers though the Packers right now doing their bath impression of a lion the trouble lions

Thirteen to twenty four hundred and Seventy six yards passing touchdowns his first interception of the season\nAnd meanwhile like four to seven Fifteen eighty yards and ... as well that led to that latest defensive touchdown by Kansas City Tony nothing Kansas City league one minute left here in the first half\nFine and he did a very nice ... little ... gone up ... for those women interception return for a touchdown got a general writer in Cleveland where we found a scoring changes Darryl\nYeah Baker Mayfield getting his first shot at a two minute drill and it was successful and the minute Nineteen seconds he took the brown Seventy eight yards and fix plays kept saying Nineteen yard touchdown throw to rich chard Higgins and the browns or in front six to three not seven to three that's because\nThe awful brown special teams units strikes again kicker Greg Joseph missing the PAT off the up right\nSo we've got six three but the ravens trying to score here before the half sixteen seconds and counting they've got the ball at the Cleveland thirty\nNine thank you very much general writer so very low scoring first half as you might expect against that ravens defunds\nIsn't the ravens often that hasn't done much so far today Alix Collins as forty two yards rushing on six attempts but again not much movement so far by the ravens are who are trailing biased corrupt six to three all they have is they Justin Tucker forty four yard field made deals numbers for the first F twelve of Seventeen\nAnd fifty two yards and the touched down in a moment ago we're that sort of scoring in Cincinnati let's go to the update from Jason Earhart\nThe dolphins special teams coming up with a\nBig play the final thirty seconds of the first half\nTo Kim grant returns to punt Seventy yards down the right sideline takes it in for the touchdown they initially really mad at the two but after further review he was able to take roof sideline and take it in so Seventy yards on that touched down the dolphins surprisingly leading the bangles here fourteen to nothing\nAnd the Bengals have blown a couple of opportunities have been in the red zone twice but not able to cash in on anything yet they'll get the ball to start the third quarter but the dolphins in command at the half your at Paul Brown stadium fourteen nothing\nOn it's been awhile first half in Charlotte and the Panthers if there's extended their lead over the giants let's find out about it from Kevin Casey\nRich and just moments ago Graham go his second forty seven year old he'll go on the day but a couple of wild plays have already unfolded a first colon Jones recovers a hotel Beckham fumble punch in the end zone but\nThat can make support he takes a lateral from Eli Manning and then ... back and throws a fifty seven yard touchdown pass through sake one Barclay and uh who was open\nAnd wide open and just outraged the defenders to the ... so kind of a couple of ... and this one already just over a minute to go back one oh nine to go in the first half it's Carolina twenty the giants ten\nRight at the half right now are the bills and the tight and so Ryan suck up your goal\nRings tendency to within one from fifty four yards out at the gun to close things out in the first avenue again a very quiet first happened\nYou know they're not really having too many problems run in the ball as the titans of rushed for fifty nine yards so far on schools carries that's almost five yards per Kerry and mark is Mario to seven uh fourteen sixty four yards he has been intercepted ones but\nAgain just not getting a lot of ... out of this team there one uh one of those two ... field goals was brought about by a big special teams return so\nFor some reason that team cannot move the genes at all and right now in Cleveland they just go to the half and it's the browns on top by a score six to three years Justin Tucker just had a field goal Tim blocks so good end of the first half were clean\nOr they may feel touchdown pass just a couple of moments ago\nAnd uh uh Nineteen yard past the kick failed though so it is still a three point game there are also right now the giants with a minute left in the first half trail Carolina by a score of twenty to ten uh Cam Newton so far eight of nine nine passing for Ninety two yards\nEli Manning is twelve of twenty for a hundred Nineteen yours but it's been an old old back I'm\nFifty seven year on past us acorn Barclay that has given the giants\nThere one touchdown gram granola couple a field goal so far Curtis Samuel with a twenty five yard reception from ... in which he broke a couple of tackles very nicely also the parents are special teams coming up with a big play after a while back um junior was back in ... return and had the ball hit off his leg the Panthers recovered in the end zone\nFor a touchdown let's go to George separation Pittsburgh it's been an interesting first haven't Heinz Field George\nThe rich and we're going to the to the intermission here with such a a blown opportunity for the Steelers they lead Thirteen to ten and now here at the half\nBut just seconds ago it looked as though the Steelers were going to put more points on the board they had the ball at the Atlanta seven yard line Ben Roethlisberger or on a third downplay is scrambling he's looking for somebody in the end zone\nAnd uh he doesn't seem to have any one open but he tries to force a pass to Antonio Brown despite three Atlanta defenders covering brown\nThe ill conceived passes intercepted by the falcons and the Steelers getting no points out of it and uh they go to the half leading by three and it looked as though they could either get a touchdown out of the uh out of the play or perhaps just settle for a field goal but instead at the half here at Heinz Field\n[noise]\nHi own bullies\nHere's rich I could find some eight games and we have\nA lot of close one so far the bills and tightened say one point game three points separate the browns and ravens as well as the Steelers and the falcons however the dolphins have moved up to touch downs on the Bengals right now and the jets did not start off well but at the half things looking very good here's rich Pitino\nWhere it's like I said it better myself in that missing persons report was looking for Rob Anderson I think it came in because\nYou're not only has ... touchdown passes thirty five year old touchdown pass and also he has a Seventy six yard touchdown pass what receptionist for a hundred twenty three yards that's what he did last year when he's playing well for the jets and it opens up so many things on the office just Twenty one and\nThe um the Broncos out of seven and leaderless game and that seems like you know seven hundred light years away because the jet defense has made some big stops it has forced Denver field goal to make it for change hands jet Scott\nScored into the half and get the ball to start the second half so offensively I'm here at the\n... when you remember that just having Twenty one points in the first quarter all three of them are fairly long touchdown place it's been a long time to just ... and they're loving it right now to have you done for twenty wants tax\n... very much richer it's going to Christian veteran Kansas City it's been all chief so far against the jaguars Christian\nWhile we're at halftime chief twenty nothing over Jacksonville the chiefs didn't waste any time in this game uh open up with a Seventy three are Dr Patrick ... before you are touched that wrote a cap that Dr added ... Harrison but you're twenty two yard field goal to make it\nA ten nothing at the beginning of the second quarter then midway up midway up for thirty market the second quarter back to back turnovers by both Kansas City in Jacksonville first Petra homes is picked off his first interception of the season and then on the very next play after Jacksonville takes over borders is set\nUp by the four tops of the ball the chief takeover midfield and the patch wrongs after his first interception not radical it all\nComes back with a forty or pass play to a Kelsey to get up to the nine\nThat she would add to feel go there to make it Thirteen nothing to do\nIt on the southern drive right next play another turnover Bordeaux second interception this time picked up by defensive end Chris Jones a twenty or twenty or return for the touchdown that made it twenty nothing Kansas City so ... here in the inside of minutes ago in the first half Jacksonville takes over\nA make their way to the Kansas City three yard line nineteenth seconds to go with photos of\nPast picked off and they ended up by Stephen Nelson and it's a touch back so the chiefs Neal on it and go into the\nInto the locker room at halftime leading twenty to nothing Patrick hopes Thirteen to twenty four hundred and Seventy six yards passing the interception at a touchdown run like portals his throat to interceptions as I mentioned he's ten or twenty two for one twenty six chiefly twenty I think over Jacksonville were half dot\nIs this the best you've seen the the chief so far this year as good as they've looked so far you know considering the opponent tonight\nI think you know when you look at last week's game they were to battle with Denver and they had the you know overcame that ten point deficit in the fourth quarter came back or any other\nBattle today they the scoreboard shows you know there are up but it's been a battle I mean that that is not that that's not an easy defense to play and so uh you know they they've had they taken their lumps today but they've\nThey battled and like I said it in ... in a pre game you know they they just they're they're executing so ... ... split Patrick ... throws his first interception becomes back with a big forty our past play to get\nGet to the dying to get that feel go so you know a couple of feel goals today couple touchdowns twenty to lead over Jacksonville there the other half way to their ah average of thirty six points per game and and this lead now the sun is shining here in Kansas City well we'll see how that factors in the second half\nCrazy weather day so far in Kansas City let's go to Charlotte right now Panthers and giants at the half getting ready to start the third quarter to seven point game here's Kevin Casey\nWhere it's not crazy weather but crazy football so far we've had a couple of crazy plays you know the day started with Beck and with some a somewhat controversial\nComments a but do you think you'd have to go on back them up ... colon Jones recovers it after a mad scramble for a touchdown cabinet and also a twenty five yard touchdown pass Curtis ambulance and then go back and picks a lateral from Eli Manning\nSomewhat critical of you are or some maybe some people construed as ... you know not so positive about it you are ... so he takes the lateral from Eli then he just he just throws a touchdown pass\nQuarterback rating higher than he lives right now back hard and came Newton's right now\nUh so he gets a sick one Barclay for fifty seven yards but the score a couple of grand piano field goals and a couple of field goals for the giants so far so we're up to where we are the are\nGetting ready to a lot of buffet the ball down for the kick off of the third quarter it's twenty Thirteen the Panthers leave the ...\nOn and it's a much quieter story in Buffalo third quarter underway with the bills barely in front of the titans your ball Hamilton\nWell the bills are driving they got into Tennessee territory thanks to a career personal fall chow she almost running towards the sideline quite honestly I think he put on a bit of a performance as Korea put hands on him and he wound up with a penalty and then the next play tackle the dark and goes after Korea\nHe winds up with a personal fault with the bills and a third in twenty two and they just went with a quarterback drawn decided upon the ball\nInside the five yard line though so the tendency is going to start at the five year I Lived with nine fifty left to go in the third quarter the score seven to six right before half time suck up at a fifty four yard field goal to get the Tennessee Titans within one point at the half and\nThis is Ben you really haven't missed much if you haven't watched this game at half time they've tightened said a hundred and Eighteen guard\nThe bill had a hundred and Thirteen Josh path for forty eight marry or did pass for sixty four so it's really hasn't been a lot of excitement if you if you enjoy off ants if you enjoy grind it out the fans where there's not much going on in this game for you [noise]\nNine fifty left to go a third quarter titans to start on their own five trailing seven to fix\nMy artist been all lines so far in Detroit we told you about that turnover laid and the lines in another chance and they've extended their lead here's then he kept\nVery bizarre Marvin Jones the recipient of Matthew staffer touchdown pass first touchdown pass for the first half\nOf the game for a staffer to came at Fifteen seconds left in the first half of the lions up by a score of twenty four nothing that came off of Aaron Rodgers second strip ... of the game or that gave alliance great field is this an inside the final two minutes\nAmazing Crosby missing three field goals for the Packers today from forty one forty two and thirty eight the hackers also\nHad a punt early on in the game for the lion's go off of a locker cornerback Kevin king that the alliance turned into seven points that is an absolute disaster for the Packers who by the way which are out a gaining the lions two hundred to one sixty at the half go figure\nA Packers hunter JK Scott still has not touch the field and his hackers troll this one twenty four nothing I head scratcher here in Detroit and\nGo back to that a step on the ... they had in the first have is that indicative of what kind of deeds been physically for the lines\nIt really has been an golladay it's been a really nice to pry third round pick out a northern Illinois and twenty Seventeen show signs he might have something last year and this year he's making Calvin Johnson that plays a from the first game through here and again number five it's been a very impressive showing for golladay but yeah that it's been a microcosm of how the game as has gone for the lion\nIdentity cap in Detroit let's say the Jason Earhart in Cincinnati\nOr some more points here for the dolphins let's get another call from Jason\n[noise] yes the Bengals made any halftime adjustments so they certainly aren't working their first drive of the second half the last nine yards he had to punt the ball away Miami get good deals position at midfield in turn that into a forty two yard field goal from Jason Sanders\nAnd the dolphins on top of this game now Seventeen to nothing they've dominated and the line of scrimmage here in the last quarter and a half the Bengals often are really not able to do a whole lot of anything not given the whole lot of time and the new running room there for Joe mixing dolphins in control right now leading this game\nSeven see nothing nine twenty five to go third quarter from Paul Brown stadium\nJason you surprised at how ah how much lack of office or lack of anything right now coming from the bangles and after three in one storm\nYeah I Am they've every thirty one and a half points over the first four weeks they look to unstoppable last week and the first half at Atlanta\nAre just not sure what's going on here everybody seems to be out of sync today not able to get a whole lot of time to throw the ball down the field and yeah it's a give credit to dolphins though defensively they've made some place or the Bengals have had a couple of decent drives but the dolphins able to hold so well right now love Miami taking it to the bangles\nThank you very much Jason your heart that said the George ... Pittsburgh it's been an interesting first that between the Steelers and the falcons used George\nRichton forty eight to go here third quarter the falcons came out\nOr trying to build some momentum but the Steelers shut them down and this has been an interesting sort of\nA twist to what we did not expect to see the Steelers on defense with for sex in the first half CJ walk with two of those sex rich and they put a lot of pressure on that Ryan he has not had time to sit back and dissect a secondary there was very suspect coming into this one so the Steelers defense held\nThey get the ball now at their own Fifteen with their first possession of the second half we'll see if they are able to ah\nContinue to sort of pressure Atlanta they are putting points on the board they've been very successful rich and sort of between the twenties but we'll see if Pittsburgh now gets a chance to put up some points\nLeading Thirteen to ten ten forty to go you're in the third\nDon ... very much George Zimmer reason Pittsburg was said to my long ago in Philadelphia where the Vikings come to town at the back to back clunkers and take on an eagles team that is starting to put it together with Carson when smacking quarterback for the last couple of weeks following the ...

the third quarter it's been a very fast moving second half so far here's George summaries\nRicher right to forty five to go here and the third quarter Steelers have extended their lead to twenty to ten and eighty five yard drive by the Steelers James Connor impressive throughout the drive Ninety five yards were Connor now in the ground sixty five yards in receptions\nAnd uh he has been impressive for the Steelers the touchdown came on at nine yard touchdown pass from office burger to Antonio Brown those two were able to finally connect\nAnd right now rich just seconds ago the falcons putting on the Keystone Cops imitation trying to pump the ball and or the Steelers were able to ah they didn't have to block it because the punter never really got it up so I'm not sure\nWasn't able to well they did they did block it I'm Sorry he picked it up after the block and after the block you ran around a little bit and then he got tackled the Steelers have the ball now at the Atlanta Nineteen yard line they're going to try and extend this lead but again to thirty seven to go here and a quarter Steelers not getting the ball back leading twenty to ten\nMickey George one of the biggest surprises so far today is the way the lines of handle the Packers will miss several opportunities among them in the kitten game let's get more from Danny cap\nAt two Aaron Rodgers fumble three minutes field goals and finally the Packers get on the scoreboard a three hour touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers Markey [noise] Elvis handling got the hackers on the board they convert on aid to yard conversion hour or two you're confused me a to point conversion or to get themselves within the scene\nAt twenty four to eight and then the Packers actually had the lions or a three and out on the ensuing drive but then a little mental Arab by Tony brown quarterback\nFor the Packers who broke up the third down paths that was going to force a lion funky got up and that over the receiver and taunted him drew and an sportsman like conduct that gave the lions at first down and now the drive\nWithout the midfield for math African company eight forty seven to go on the third quarter lions with the ball in the same point lead at twenty four to eight\nNine thank you very much Dan let's go to rich Pitino metlife stadium is the best of the jets to look since the season opener

jets host and he just a driving again\nClose to ... fields um is Twenty one tent jets eight and change left in the third quarter\nStudying so far the jets a rush for about two hundred and twenty yards and ... well a hundred and sixty five yards rushing including the Seventy seven yard touchdown run let's go to ball Hamilton in Buffalo right now it is still in a very low scoring game of the bills have just extended their leaders Paul\nTurnover led to that the bills were able to deal Lewis who doesn't have a whole lot fumble was forced by shot off and Porter jumped on it at the Tennessee forty nine\nThe bills they only could get twenty seven yards and had to settle for a Steven house go forty yard field goal to make the score ten to six in favor of buffalo the only touchdown we've seen in this game came right away on the first try for the bills\nWhen they were able to score a Josh Allen ran for a touchdown and made it seven and nothing at the time since then it's been all field goals and we only have one forty two left to go here in the third quarter the bills off it's been very methodical they've just insisted on was shot McCoy we talked about that in the pre game\nWhether it works whether it didn't it has worked it seems like maybe they are starting to wear Tennessee down with a run a little bit ivory has picked up some key for found a couple of those\nAnd the last Dr McCoy did get some pretty good runs but buffalo stalled when Alan tried to run outside and scramble on a thirty five and lost three hours and they had to sell for the field goal so one twelve left to

Hamilton in Buffalo the titans in closer to the bills Paul\nTen and a half minutes left to go fourth quarter and the titans have close to one point Ryan suck up his third field goal of the day this one from thirty nine yards the titans put together a six and a half minute drive fourteen plays\nFifty four yard they had a touchdown marry or the scrambled on third forehead Nick Williams wide open in the end zone not appealing fight and nickel yams dropped the football was right in his hands and he dropped it so\nThey had to settle for the fuck up we'll go to bat for the titans to cause they picked up a third ... got a sharp got Fifteen Mary rode on third and fourth scramble for five and got a first down so it was a good dried up their best of the day for Tennessee\nBut that drop killed him so it's ten nine\nAnd we as I said we have pen and a half minutes left to go here in the fourth quarter and the bills we'll see what they can do if they receive the kick off\nAll right thank you very much Bob Let's go to Jenny cap in Detroit the Packers not dead yet here's Danny\nPackers that temporarily within ten points but the other one under review and will likely be called back the fact of the matter is Marcie Valdez handling a reached over to the end zone fumbled the\nBall and recovered it in the end zone or however ... shows that his elbow with down\nAnd the referee saw the same thing everyone else that they're going to call him down at the one yard line but nonetheless it's only a yard away from the Packers making the potentially a one or game which is fascinating when the Packers thrilled twenty more out of a hat Roger marking felt the Atlanta three are touched on average per se drive of the third\nQuarter hair on their second drive the third quarter of looks like the Packers are going to score once again twenty for a for the moment why and lead this one hackers of all I had the one with a minute thirty forty going the third\nDanny if they score do you think they go for two here\nI'm Sorry can you repeat that read if\nThey ... do you think they go for two\nYeah they have to the point and that would certainly be the the ammo here they were down twenty four going into that they want her to the first time so clearly that's the plan they actually had a fourth and for thirty on this Dr rich and I'm sure amazing crowds you wanted to go out\nThere and try it feels like the fact that he's missed three already ah prevent that from happening and the lions leopards metal wide open Aaron Rodgers ran a little quarterback drawn forth for to gain the yard and give the hackers a first down to move the ball into the red zone so ah the actors doing what they need to do on this drive without may think crossed the red\nLine thank you very much steady Kevin Detroit a stunning turn around and Cincinnati the bangles in dolphins are now all tied up here's Jason air hard with the story\nYet rich momentum as wearing an orange Jersey right now the Bengals have scored the last Seventeen points Michael Johnston with a defensive touchdown there was a bizarre player\nRan tannahill kind of attempted an awkward past turn sideways you hit it off the titans helmet\nBall bounced back in the waiting arms of Michael Johnson who had just missed the sec earlier in the play was standing by himself ran it into the end zone and Randy Bullock ads the extra point we're all tied at Seventeen here the Bengals in trail by Seventeen at one point but the moment I'm certainly in the bangles favor at this point still ten fifty to to go here from Paul Brown stadium new ball game\nAll right thank you very much also a new ball game in Detroit the dub Packers did score and they just did go to\nSo twenty four to sixteen uh right now uh as I think it said they they scored they went for two would certainly look that way so uh we'll give you a more clarification on that in a second but in the meantime\nLet's go to rich ... at MIT life stadium Broncos and jets it's been the jets in control all\nReally has this third quarter the jets of territorial control things but really when you look at the game with the jokes would have twenty fourth time we was fifty four seconds left and the third quarter\nThree ... two guys that really were missing in action at least for the last week or two I say a call ... Seventy five yards rich that's\nYou know in comprehensible unbelievers substance a hundred and twenty three ... to ... touchdown passes\nSandoval has let me off as close to I'm Wondering if such an but he has learned a lot of third down here which I think just something to just we're looking for defensively they have kind of held the Broncos in check ever since that first Dr that\nGave him a stepping up and leave and that was ... heard all of us still budget defense and Rob Anderson and I said a cold well really the three three things that I put the jets that you'll fourteenth point we thirty seconds left in the third quarter jets lead a twenty four tons of a\nBank you're rich what's going to Christian better in Kansas City where it's been all chief so far they bought the jaguars are on the board Christian\nRed fourth quarter now twenty three seven Kansas City lead the Jacksonville Jaguars get on the board with a T. J. yelled at fourteen yard touchdown catch for Blake borders but the chiefs\nAnd they come right back uh five place Seventy five yards and they find themselves first and goal at the four ... kill got behind the Jacksonville Jaguars ... has a for thirty six shark passed by compatible homes a jailer Ramsey of the coverage and made it to the twenty nine from there now they're at the uh for your lie to get a first and goal for Kansas City\nAt the four up twenty three step in Kansas City keeping the pressure on Jacksonville\nNon beg you very much pressure let's go to Pittsburgh right now where the Steelers have turned it around today against the falcons in a batch\nOf disappointing teams years George\nA rich right now the falcons have tightened the the the the gap there now trailing twenty seven Seventeen the falcons put have touched down on the board just moments ago uh met Ryan a key third down conversion to Holyoke Jones just Holyoke Jones's first\nCompletion of the day first catch of the day that took it down to the Steelers Seventeen and then two plays later running back Ito Smith to yard touchdown run caps of Seventy Seventy five yard drive for the falcons and are they are now within ten points twelve thirty on the clock here in the fourth quarter\nOf the the falcons had put themselves in a deep hole with a a a punt the got locked\nAnd then James Connor was able to a few plays later a run that in for his second touchdown run of the game he's having a terrific game for the Steelers near a hundred yards rushing with two touchdowns but the falcons have crept back in to this one and it is now twenty seven Seventeen rich twelve twenty eight to go your fourth quarter\nAll right and it's now twenty nine seven chiefs they have scored again or creme ... from a couple of yards out twenty nine seven Kansas City in front of the Packers did get a touchdown they did go for two and came up short so they travel by ten right now twenty four fourteen and remember\nUs three missed field goals today by Mason Crosby so this one could have a much different outlook kid Crosby been ah his usual self but\nUh some reason kicking indoors has not been kind to them today he lie manning has just been picked off let's get more on the giants and the Panthers you come up with the big play after a turnover of their own from Kevin Casey\nHi own bullies [noise]\nHere's rich Ackerman time fourth\nQuarter and as I mentioned we have a lot of close games and in those close games where you've had a lot of turnover in terms of scoring let's check in with bottles and in Buffalo where the three in one titans have pulled in front for the first time today here's Paul\n[noise] yet they have and we have three oh one left to go here in the fourth quarter twelve ... than in favor of the titans but the bill now have the ball with a first down at the forty five is\nWell Shawn McCoy just on a third grade and joked maybe half the kind of the defense out a little swing path and got the first down for buffalo\nSo the bills just trying to get themselves and feel rage to try to get a chance to win this game it was a turnover that gave Tennessee the chance to take the lead for the first time in this game Andre hall pop the ball in the air went right through his hands on a third downplay\nInvolved with intercepted the adoring Jackson he gave for that's set up by Tennessee around midfield I'm thirty eight from the twenty nine marry or that he was set by Jerry he was humble the ball and it was a left hash mark\nThe ball made it all away from the hash marks the out of bounds knock out a little help from Taylor they said he didn't get it out\nBut um he was right at the out of bounds they are and what he did it so they said no he didn't bat it so that turned into the field goal for suck up fifty yard field goal is fourth of the day\nAnd we are up a two minute warning Christopher he just picked up first out for the bill there after all forty four yard line trying to get in the elbow ranch and don't forget ... inherited a bunch I mean if he needs to go from sixty probably can so uh we'll see what kind of opportunity he may or may not get here\nTwo minute warning Tennessee twelve buffalo ten\nOn that All right thank you very much Paul Hamilton saw two forty seven left the bills have a shot here or down by two the Bengals with an incredible fourth quarter comeback so far against Miami let's go to Jason Earhart in Cincinnati\nThere it's the Bengals have scored the last twenty points in this ball game a game in which they trailed Seventeen nothing midway through the third quarter they now lead twenty to Seventeen Randy Bullock hitting a twenty yard field goal\nNice Bengals drive their ninth place sixty two yards took four minutes off the clock now it's on the Bengals defense to make a stop and getting ready to kick off to the dolphins just three thirty to go in the ball game here one day and age agreeing with a hundred yards receiving today he's broken the Bengals record for most hundred yard receiving games with thirty two of them\nThere was a twenty to Seventeen three thirty to go from Paul Brown\nStadium you know what's been the difference in this fourth quarter so far for the bangles ball you know\nWhen they look like\nIt'll the third quarter to hit a third down they started going to number Eighteenth hey Jake green and the you know when in doubt you've got a weapon like that go to a man that he had a couple of shoots third down catches to extend some drives and of course they got lucky with that a defensive touchdown the uh certainly that was bizarre play when Sandy hit the uh the tight end and the health meant the ball bounced back\nBut uh I guess the way the old adage says it's better to be lucky than good so the Bengals trying to hang on here from Paul Brown\nFor luck is the residue of design [laughter] there you go by ... and narrow it in Cincinnati that's going to George ... Pittsburgh where the Steelers have scored to extend their leading the game they really need that or really needed to have here's George\nRich seven fifty nine left in the fourth quarter Steelers now have opened up the lead to thirty for Seventeen over the falcons the last touched down by the Steelers a forty seven yard touchdown bomb from Ben Roethlisberger threw Antonio Brown\nHe caught a brown and simply racing down the sideline and that is brown second touchdown catch of the game Robert Alford victimized Antonio Brown there and before the game we talked in the pre game rich about how Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger said they had to somehow get in sync well they have done so today\nAnd I'm sure a feeble secondary of the falcons has helped that enormously but\nWhat we're seeing here is the falcons defense was really starting to the key on trying to shut down James Caan or because he has a hundred and ten yards rushing and two touchdowns and they started going to single coverage in the\nRockies burger finding Antonio Brown Steelers taking advantage of the falcons defense leading thirty for Seventeen just under eight minutes to go on this one is\nDying baggage or just go to rich casino admit life stadium is still a lot of time left but boy the the jets look good today against the Broncos it's been either one thing or the other or one way or the other for the jets so far this year and today they've been really good rich\nWe really have best uh I mean I Know the opener Detroit pick out a lot of credit for a great game but\nI think this is the ... office of he was the seasons so four and certainly the first time you've done it before the home crowd here they lead it by a score of twenty or twenty seven to ten and you know one of the things that I just was thinking about as the Denver was driving and they just give the ball on down\nThe down Seventeen points out rich are a lot better now than I Am so maybe you can help me figure this one out\nYour down Seventeen here for concerts inside the time you need three scores\nHow do you not feel go there and make it to scores they went for this war down and have to give it up on down so they still need three possessions now to tie this game would nine or five left if they could still go they would have to possessions to try to gain a I don't know about that\nThat was over I don't know how well that's kind of you know play any way the jets offensively big games from Rob Anderson I say a crow well long touchdown pass Anderson of thirty five and the Seventy six and then the Seventy seven yard run by a crow well and that has given the jets a twenty seven to ten lead\nAs we have nine all five of us to go on this one red\nGiant and cruel well having a huge day with a hundred and eighty yards including the big touchdown run let's get a Christian veteran Kansas City where the chiefs are cruising again make it look easy as they had to five and oh\nYeah but if you're there are pretty comfortable lead here thirty to seven she's late night sixteen\nLeft in ... uh about five minutes to go through as a third pick of the day off at a fumble so four turnovers today for Blake portals Patrick homes had one pick but then we just picked off moments ago his second pick of today are today look like quarterback edgy boy I uh picked him off midfielder third down of forty two so\nJacksonville with a ball again or I should mention do ... are all in all these a day for him despite throwing to picks are able to operate the ... and and uh you know build a sizable lead here they did have one day if it's a score but he's twenty to thirty eight\nThree hundred Thirteen yards and then those two ticks time left in this game boy portals me once I mentioned three interceptions got the one touchdown pass the teacher and yelled and a Twenty one or forty one for two eighty six but as I bet you are twenty three point lead nine minutes left in this game Jacksonville with the ball field might just be out of reach but\nUh they had the ball out we'll see what happens ... minutes to go thirty to chase\nWell right and just as the Packers were making a comeback the lions pull away once again with a big play and still a lot of time left on the fourth quarter but the lions comfortably in front here's ... more\nClients up three scores now Matthew Stafford heading heading Halladay on a five yard touchdown pass with an exclamation point to ... only four\nCats but he has made very athletic plays with anything to show the budding superstar in the wire and lions receiving corps ahead of that with a twenty four yard run by carry on Jonathan the electric working for the lion's now his Seventy yard but he\nOn that twenty four yard run injure his right ankle getting picked up on the sideline likely will see him like air one back into the lion's on their next dry meanwhile Aaron Rodgers moving the Packers down to feel a little bit of crop and fortunately for the hackers however\nHackers are in the red zone now they have the ball down to the lion twelve yard line we got nine forty five to go with the fourth quarter\nHackers with the ball trailing the lion thirty one or in\nLine and the giants in ... traded interceptions so just as things look bleak for the giants they come up with a big play in and out deep in Carolina territory down a buy\nA score twenty seven to sixteen third and three here for the bills and they just move but over the hash mark to make it easier to set up a game winning field goal with ten seconds left so I'm not sure the down in this oh the distance on that field goal but they're going to bring on Stephen how she got\nIn the meantime let's go to Kevin Casey in Charlotte told you about those interceptions\nJust a moment ago with more on that one here's Kevin\nRich are just over eight minutes to go on the ball game and Camden n Eli Manning trading interceptions most recently as ... demanding is going to go back in junior high and the end zone for an apparent touched down there is a Frank down but it\nLooks like it could be on the deep and so if this stands the giants are right\nBack into this game I was just telling you about the training of the interceptions by a and Mike Adams picked off like manning twice so far today [noise] and they is it legal contacted the call on the deep end so make this a touchdown for the New York giants it's twenty seven twenty two with an extra point coming in a way to go in the game\nAll right and you wonder if the giants will go for two here to kind of making a three point game uh we'll see in just a second but Beck him with a a touchdown reception today and a touchdown pass\nA forty six yard attempt for Steven ... with the game on the line here a with four seconds left in Buffalo this one has not been a pretty one but\nWhat a win it would be for the bills in how ... is good he gets the drawn so Thirteen twelve the bills in front of the titans and the Packers have come right back is a day of just scored with nine minutes left to make thirty one twenty looks like the ...
