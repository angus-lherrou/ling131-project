F. C. global so he's all about making money earning money and he also is also about a business but obviously with us\n[noise]\nAll right uh he's gone so if a businessman can be successful in the White House can you be successful in balancing the budget and bringing some fiscal sent to the state of Connecticut I Will say this\nThe most people I Know now my son works in Connecticut most people I Know are extremely unhappy with what's going on there and nobody blamed Republicans because I've had absolutely no power wouldn't have been a window man who was extremely successful as an executive in Connecticut\nShe couldn't breakthrough but got close by both she was talking about the fact that you were the c._e._o. of D. F. C. global last\nUPS you mentioned before that and we were C O G O G A G corporate finance why would you want to put all that knowledge into trying to balancing or to getting into politics\n[laughter] it's a good a good question I I'm a Connecticut a group and then I went to the public schools uh\nWent to a local college Fairfield University students been great to me and I've been watching it being ruined by horrible economic policy I've got three daughters pony for Nineteen sixty I don't want to have to get on a plane to see my grandkids in Florida some ...\nUm is all about the economy here I'm an restructuring businesses for Thirty years stood up to them I think is a forty billion dollar\nBudget that needs to be restructured so it's ... my little house and I just felt it was time to make a change um fortunately for me to a recording of good with a ... or ... or go now it's down to two sort of messages ... people are ready for schools don't want a politician eighty five percent of the people we called and not on a politician\nI'm you look at what ... do up in Massachusetts it's it's a great ... how to be running for governor as\nWell I mean you've got one resent Iran Johnson's one of the most effective centers are from business in of course the price of the United states much of this year in many politicians is we're trying to run the government like a business is business where he's actually making a lot of decisions himself a Bob Bob Bob stepping us Keith thanks so much for joining us\nSo does it bother you at all these other story that came out that our deficit is now a seven hundred and thirty billion dollars I\nDon't love it I don't love it we have to finance it rates are going higher the debt will cost us more period full stop don't love that we have to find a way to spend less\nWe we we did bringing additional revenue but it does know strip the automatic withdrawals from our checking account\nWell yeah we're good at that what we know how to do right\nAnd be the president would say because I needed the money for defense either trade off on some of these social programs jury at some point maybe it's a re election of President Trump someone's got to go in there and a bipartisan Simpson Bowles way again and present some type of political cover way to make spending more sustainable\nSo you're saying no Medicare for all is that what you're telling me\nI mean that's one thing I mean I think that or if you are you know how can you or just saying even the defense department says we have enough missiles we have enough written tank so\nOkay so it's not really about defense it's really about the entitlement programs that's the thing that really drives us over the edge of the question is how do you manage that right\nOr is that about having people as they approach their elderly year's\nFall out of these programs up earlier I mean you don't you get into them later in life because our lifespan is so much longer I think that's a closer answer\nWith this idea of Medicare for all does not work and why does it work because of the money the dollars and cents a we can't afford that and why why why would you at Tel corporate America to stop\nGiving your employees healthcare insurance this is a program that his work since World War two hundred and fifty three million Americans get their coverage through their employer for the love of God don't put a knife in the back of that well\nWe love it a new scope we got great health care and I love it and if you will to visit to say I got news for you don't have to spend on health care they'll high five you and say thank you very much I guess what the quality will go down nobody resources in Medicare they all need supplemental I Know that for a fact that's right and so that's for some people that was never\nMeant to cover the whole country but there is a legitimate nonpartisan issue health care remains number one jury have you seen a model that works\nI think this idea that there is an easy answer like government funds everything is stupid\nAnd I think every market will have a different solution and for us I think it's a lot of different pieces of the pie coming together it can't be one thing it can't be just a big old governor fat government program that covers it that's like oh that's such a great idea no it's not I\nDon't know how that works I Can't make that work in my head\nWe've got to get these companies to compete against each other for your health care dollars we have to and sent private citizens to know what they're paying and to complain when they're paying too much we've already got a program ... health and Human Services secretary this week saying look we're going to get these prices on drugs down and part of the way we're going to do it is when you advertise your drug on the television you\nHave to say how much it costs as you're sitting there going to have exposure and just about everything starting the new year I heard the president's insisting and for the big form is resisting\nThat's right they don't want to do it they got their own plan it will be fine go to this website click five buttons go some will eventually will get you the answer to your question I don't think that's the way to do it\nI think informing people you know information is the key to this and getting these companies to compete with each other they're having you know success at the margin with small things that ultimately will make a big difference there more generic drugs coming to market their getting faster approval for drugs this is all going to help\nYeah I Want you to hear what President Trump and tell me if you're comfortable with that said ...\nWhat a bigger threat\nIs the fed because the fed\nIs raising rates too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because you looked at the last inflation numbers are very low\nThen put on there I mean I'm not in my hand and I was ... owner blaming anybody I put him there and made me a thread maybe it's wrong but I wanted to get it wrong\nI put it so couple of other people there that are most oh have you with do without him very happy with papal\nShabby with people he was a guy there is going to remarry can't do anything about it no fire it out\nBut he has a point and how are you really enjoy the\nTime evidently you just scream about the fed where we were all going to be okay but it does it bother you at all that the fed might look at it as a become more of a political Oregon that everything that they do raise rates are not have\nTo become a political Oregon all they do is ignored him down and that's all they have to do and that's probably what they will do but I think he's got a point I think that we may be at you know look inflation not an issue right now right\nAnd the president's looking at camping down the growth of we have why would we want to do that at this point I think the fed overreached when it said we're going to look at two things not only are we going to look at and it not only are we going to look at inflation but we're also going to look at interest rates would look at these jobs are going to get shots\nThe fed has no business looking at jobs in my view and that was the decision they made like two presidents ago\nSo here's the part of the United states moments ago speaking with steward Varney on trade with China cut fifty one\nRather stopped talking with China again all ready for you I don't think so and then I told them\nLet's go speaking with Stuart Varney on trade with China cuts fifty one\nI'm going to stop talking with China again or are you ready for you\nI don't think so and then I told them they want to make a deal and I said you guys aren't ready to just not read it because they've been taking five hundred billion dollars a year out of our country it's time that we stopped okay we rebuild China you know that better than anybody you talk about it more than I Do I say\nAnd it's up to and you see what's happening with China's a whole different ballgame so now they're paying twenty five percent tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars hasn't affected our economy hasn't costs have gone up inflation so low\nVery low hasn't had any impact that we see except for one billions of dollars are pouring into the treasury\nSo um\nDo you dispute that fact if terrorists were bringing billions of dollars into a to a treasury because I've heard that that's just beautiful\nWell when I ... is that it has no effect on prices we've already got company is warning that they're going to have to raise prices because of tariffs that's already there I'm Sorry if I add on steel and\nSeal also and in other ... Proctor and gamble I mean like mainstream and when you get it they can\nAnd can't then when you get into the language of the terrorists it's going to be food stuff is a lot of stuff you pick up at the grocery store okay those prices are going to be going up you know the reality is a lot of stuff he would buy to put under the Christmas tree with those prices were probably locked in in the summer\nBut stuff that you might pick up Tuesday night at the grocery store may go up Sam\nRight or the jury you know how is using it it's pretty obvious he's using as a way to get you to the table I'm going to punish you with this and get you there I'm going to take your car away and then ask you how much you're going to pay to get it back then act like you're giving it\nI think that's true I think what's interesting about that is this is can be hard\nWeighing in the president's favor the Chinese economy not doing while the stock market hair rubble you're on how they are more yeah you're unhappy with an eight hundred point and sell off on the Dow will go to China it's much much worse right\nUm so he's got a lot of things we're working in its favor he has to be able to rely on Europe he has to be ... able to rely on Canada or Mexico other Asian nations he's got to pull the world together against China super difficult it's a high hurdle but you know this is something that needed attention\nIt did and Chuck Schumer agrees Europe agrees early on they said Mr President why are you fighting with everyone wants to Korea Brazil or breaking up NAFTA European Union and little by little they've come into line\nThe framework for the use air but I'm not sure what's happened since evidently Japan is on his way to be is ready to be executed in a good way that deal\nBut now if you can organize the world against China most of all deceptive intellectual property that's the key isn't it and it's also up to our businessmen not to be money hungry to the point where they sacrifice technology for their families but it's American security overall\nIt as well as American security it's also America's future right I mean basically what China has done and and that race of the turtle and the hair Dave jumped to had Twenty years because they were able to steal our best ideas and that hurts us and we need to stop that\nRight I Want to hear what to do with the president just told steward Varney about cutting spending and regulation cut forty nine\nBut we've cut regulations more than any president ever and you can go for years and years as a matter of this tremendous regulations that we can be cutting still and we're doing it you know it used to take Twenty one years to get a highway bill\nYou know bad case but it would take Twenty one years we're trying to bring that down to two and maybe even one and by the way if it's not like we're not going to prove it but we're not gonna take Twenty one years to find out whether or not we can do it\nBut uh that's pretty much what he thought gee you've you've gotten reports too that he has legitimately cut the red tape and regular\nYeah I mean there's no doubt about it I mean the ... you can like there are studies that show the number of regulations that existed pre and a number of regulations that existed after and there are fewer and I really think that's why you see at these companies\nBeing so much more aggressive\nAh and and going out hiring ... you know spending money because they know that this big weight on their shoulders of regulation has been lifted and that they can do more things you know when you know that the White House is on your side it makes life a lot easier you're not always on the defensive you're not always back on your heels trying to figure out how to fight back\nAh Lesley there's another businessman looks like he's going to get in the race Mike Bloomberg regrets at getting in the last time ... ah what kind of uh what kind of not politically but what kind of resume does he bring to the table that could give Donald Trump trouble", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Norfolk", "day": "17"}
