and the facts and it's also got a two year old from the kicker out of the longest one forty eight yard field goal\nSo a lot of fans for the Texans little off and for the jaguars and score of Thirteen to knock on right now he's turned Thirteen Jacksonville nothing at the half\nRight so to Sean Watson playing hurt so for helping the Texans is they have the Thirteen nothing lead at the half late first half Vikings in front of the jets let's get more from my man cue so\nRich and the slow moving versed half to get grilled the Vikings tend to seven\nThree forty remaining here in the second

half after that touchdown pass a lemon of Twenty one for Ninety seven yards\nGets up also punted four times in this game and I think the lack of a passing it\nAnd after that touchdown pass he's eleven to Twenty one for Ninety seven yards\nGets up also punted four times in this game and I think the lack of a passing game has a lot to do with the winter conditions here lots of wind or not that cold just very windy and it's affecting the passes and ponds are so far in this first Paso three twenty seven remaining\nJets have the ball first and twenty on their own ten yard line they travel Minnesota

New England got him back on the game\nWas a a a recovery actually a a Cordell Patterson who's the guy that followed earlier he returned to kick off Ninety five yards you'd just out ran everybody in the bears did a very poor job of covering it and that got the patriots back to within three earlier Julian Edelman caught a nine yard TD pass from\nBrady on the first drive of the game ... park he also has a field goal for the bears so now trail the patriots\nTwenty one Seventy fine thank you very much less so it's been awhile first happened stole a just under four minutes left let's go to make is in Tampa Bay the browns often says been sparked by their defense or actually well there is has has been very little office I should say but the deepens has put them in very good position to score here so let's go to Tom from or\nWhat we're late in the second quarter of Tampa Bay leading Cleveland Browns by a score of sixteen to to it appeared that that might change because the camera and break caught a pass from Seamus when soon after record of the phone with the ball was recovered by Cleveland on the Tampa Bay Nineteen a couple of plays later\nBigger Mayfield hitting around the left and to try to get the ball in the end zone and he ... recovered by Tampa Bay and now the buccaneers have the ball the possession of the ball on the ten yard line uh they're Eighteen seconds left to play\nIn this the first half time time is out on the fuel is an injured player being attentive to at this point it appears that everything's going to be OK is an awful lot of players gathered around to see who may open on Alexander as we look down on the field at this point but nonetheless\nA time out at the moment is the players are now reorganizing themselves to finish out those first half the second quarter for the most part has been all about Tampa Bay to Sean Jackson scoring a touchdown dream as when some scoring a touchdown\nAnd that accounts for the difference Eighteen seconds to play in the first half its Tampa Bay sixteen Cleveland to\nFine thank you very much Tomlin said to Philadelphia where they're at the half of the eagles in front after a very quiet first half Here's Michael\nAnd they've all those growing income and then the second quarter eagles taken a separate nothing labor costs when Sullivan yard touchdown pass the house on Jeffrey they've got this up and play Seventy for your job because of the score coming with about six thirty is 'cause they go in that quarter a thirty ... a forty six yard field goal by Jake Eliot panther\nIs trying to get a field goal late in that first half of the first attempt by ... didn't get started there was a false start penalty poster five yards back in the temple low wide right as a wind\nKind of pushed that went to the right some of the goal but that also attempt to get it for another fall started pedaling the Panthers end up having to punt the ball so fortunate the balance inside the eagles five yard line Philadelphia and unable to do anything with that\nAs the first half came to the close of numbers for your car someone's Fifteen obey team to on an eight to one touched down a camp dude and for nine just twenty four yards and so the second half about to begin here it goes up by a score up ten nothing\nVery quick moving game they're also we have to have Texans jaguars they're getting ready to start the third quarter as well and the browns and buccaneers have just gone to the hassle the browns unable to capitalize on that camera and break fumble sixteen to to the score Tampa Bay in front\nAlso they have in Miami it's the dolphins and the lions here's jak arm priest or\nHear about a minute and a half away from the start of the second half the Detroit Lions on top Seventeen seven Miami port within a\nField goal at ten

so\nI think that first half rich when as long as the Yankees Red Sox game\nFinally reaching the half Minnesota on top ten to seven\nOr not a great offensive game for either side\nAt this point the Viking scoring on their first driver the game Adams dealing catching eight thirty for your touchdown pass from Kurt cousins for a seven to nothing lead in the first half cousins only twelve of twenty three for a hundred and four yards the jets did get in touch down on their third drive\nIt was an eighty six yard dry sand Arnold uh twelve yard touchdown pass a Chris Herndon that tied into seven Dan Bailey had to twenty six yard field goal to make it tend to seven he didn't try to\nUh forty two yard field goal as time was a winding up in the first half\nA it went wide left and it was clearly influenced by the wind that has played a significant factor in this game today it's influencing passes and kicks credit to the jets defensively rich they played a very strong game\nBut the jets of hurt themselves with seven penalties in one turnover both teams not very good on third downs jets over sex Vikings owed eight on third down Donald in this game age of Seventeen four eighty six yards and he's even had a couple of a\nBad snaps with the center spent so long so I'm not a very pretty first have but the jets were in the uh all green color bright uniforms that you love so much\nThey travel by three ten to seven here at halftime\nThank you very much Mike let's set the Roger socked in Jacksonville very quiet first half of the jaguars who are yet to find the scoreboard third quarter underway here's Roger\nHi Rich right now midwife third quarter and the Texans have delayed and now the Texans have the ball\nJaguars quarterback bike portals has run in to try and get a first out and bought a ... way for the second time in the game\nThe Texans pick up the ball right now for ... seconds or um jaguars territory threatening to score from the twelve yard lie\nAnd looks like Sharm often just for a touchdown pass for the Houston Texans and the end zone so that makes it the Texans mind\nPaying the jaguars knocking Texans also scored back in the first half on I run implied Lamar Miller scores on a five yard touchdown run so far Lamar Maillard joined the bulk of rushing for the Texans have Seventy five yards rushing for the taxes on the first half alone\nFor the jaguars not much of an off ramp fail to get a field goal or touched down\nLike ... was such for twelve sixty one yards passing shah walks on his wife or the Texans have shot up from a farm for a lot on\nMTR passing and the first half for the Houston Texans the Texans scored of that on a second touchdown pass right now the Texans over the Jacksonville Jaguars\nTen fifty left to go on the third quarter if she just turned my pain the jaguars not paying\nYou know this is a big one in the AFC South today is already had the titans losing\nAnd of course these two teams coming in three and three and the jaguars going off that nice start but since uh uh suffered back to back losses of look bad doing so and right now are down twenty to nothing today after the Andre Hopkins touchdown reception\nA moment ago let's go to scrub scene in Chicago the highest scoring game so far has been the bears and the patriots here is less\nThan it's been a patriots turtle or is it really helped the bears out but then they got back into the game and in fact the patriots have a Twenty one Seventeen halftime lead the biggest played there was a Ninety five yard kickoff return that come from a Cordell Paterson who himself had been forced to fumble ball away from uh\nUh the patriots to Houston cars in the bears what happened was Mitchell Trybulski have an eight yard touchdown run needed a little spin to the right and then spun clockwise going to the left and they say that he ran about Seventy hours to get eight yards but he did scored a touchdown also Julian Edelman one of two touchdown passes by Tom Brady\nThe other one that it came to running back James White five yard that actually broke up the\nScore and they'll put the patriots back in front Twenty one Seventeen earlier Josh Howard it's or to to run up for the bears so than all kinds of mistakes the one bust out on the kick off that was sent out there by parking was returned to Ninety five yards by Patterson so I guess you could say Paterson given\nPatterson take us away half time here at soldier field patriots Twenty one bears seventeenth\nFine thank you very much less than of course a Sunni Michelle carted off in the first half so a very big loss for the patriots were already without ... let's go to Tom Akin's in Tampa Bay and it was a surprising first have their third quarter underway here's Tom\nThen the third quarter is underway Tampa Bay leading by a score sixteen to tune the buccaneers who won the cost and deferred their choice to the second half\nFirst on all fronts bought things turn quickly as dreamers Winston fumble ball were covered by the Cleveland Browns on the Tampa Bay twenty six so the browns have an opportunity to get back in the ball game so far this afternoon the only thing that has worked on all fronts for the browns is the running game Nick Chubb leading the way in that regard\nThicker Mayfield is thrown some passes and this one looks like it might come up with some points\nIndeed it has a in the left corner of the end zone Laker Mayfield throwing a touchdown pass so Cleveland Browns taking advantage of that turned over\nUh the twenty six your bar rather make it a Fifteen yard pass from Baker Mayfield we're trying to figure out who the receiver was at this point\n\nFifteen yard pass from Baker Mayfield we're trying to figure out who the receiver was at this point\n\nAnd nonetheless Cleveland is getting there\nIt's tough to figure out what those numbers these days in the ... they don't stand out as much it's\nDavid and joker who caught the uh the touchdown pass and I'll tell you what you you are so right above the Cleveland uniforms they are difficult to pick up in terms of identifying the exact player but Baker may feel lost in the past in the air and the left corner of the end zone\nAnd the point after touchdown is good so Cleveland narrows the margin right now with Thirteen no one to play in the third quarter it remains the buccaneer sixteen but now the Cleveland Browns nine\nHours trying to figure it out on TV and I couldn't figure out whether it was an eighty five or an eighty six can only imagine what it's like they are and you need the binoculars\nA ... and then some\nTough things project in the browns cut it to a seven point game point after is good they're buccaneers in front by score of sixteen to nine but here come the browns trying to rally\nSpeaking of rallying the bears the dolphins rather going to have to do that against the lions after the big overtime win over the bears a week do right now they are behind in midway through the third quarter Miami where we go and check in with Jacqueline for Easter\nHemorrhage Detroit now on top twenty seven they had a golden opportunity to make that lead even larger coming out of the are\nComing out of the locker room at the half they had the ball they went on a twelve play sixty five yards drive they only got a twenty eight yard Matt Prater field goal out of it instead of a test and it kind of got away on a Thirteen yard\nA catching run into the hands on that was called back for illegal use their hands by their off by the up and said why men on on that place so they could do anything on the insurance for downs and prayed or what the follow through a field goal\nFor the game Matthew staffer for the lines Thirteen of sixteen for a hundred and sixty six yards and one touchdown broadcasts where all of the dolphins\nTwelve or Fifteen for just a hundred and Twenty one yard she also he too has a touchdown on the ground that's the difference Detroit twenty Russia's for a hundred and sixty four yards to leading ground gain or carry on a Johnson eleven for one twenty including one Seventy one yard and the second quarter\nThe dolphins just twelve Russia's for thirty yards and Albert Wilson as the dolphins are going down looks like Kenyan Drake\nGets into the end zone for forty six so be it a forty six are touched down or fifty four I Can't tell which side of the midfield they were on but the Kenyan drink with the a touchdown for the dolphins in apples and now that within twenty to Thirteen pending the point after in\nHey Jack on what has been the problem with the dolphins deepens today unable to stop the room they gave up the big play but still I mean the the lions have been picking up yards on the ground that left and right on them\nYou know it just everything not even just the run Richards to pat passing as well\nEverything that that we're trying to figure that out last week there pretty much shut the bears down but they they just it just seems like math Patricia as one step ahead of the dolphins are you know the dog coaches whatever he's calling his working and you know look out reforms picking a four five six started to carry\nAre you

receptions two of 'em touchdowns I think that that's a good ratio when you want to renegotiate that contract\n[laughter] ...\n[laughter] I I Do it all for you [laughter] but that first one they'll come in the first couple of minutes of the game how much did that live this team do you get a good big early touched down on the road against the team that is played well this year\nHonestly they they play very well at home and not just to be able to come out that for driving and you know and that and you know that was kind of a statement drive that we're we're going to know coming here and do our thing and really just came down to as efficiently\nNow at the five hundred mark on the season you know this team has come back it was a little bit of a tough start how much do you think the ship is right and right now\nUh I think that uh you know it's a it's a lot of right ... and [noise] you know I don't want to speak up to her I just want to enjoy this victory but you know we work very hard and you know we just want to wait for the city\nAbsolutely and it's a great fan base there is no question about that a diehard yup absolutely you know you had those there's two touchdown reception but also the ability of this team to run the ball today carry on Johnson had a terrific day a hundred and fifty yards including is Seventy one yard run and the Garrett blunt how\n... how much did that open things up and what was the key for the for the running game today\nWhen the running game has gone like ... everything up for us the wrist hide and you know everyone else and that's the credits at all on a you know\nCarry out the guy I'm\nEspecially we got a nice trio with with him to erotic so you know when they're doing their thing and it allows me to do my thing and all of our series the gardening and\nYou know it just kind of runs like a world machine\nMiami in the first couple of weeks of the season could be a tough place to play because the heat and especially the way\nSince the stadium has been recon figured was that a factor at all did you have to battle the the heat and humidity today at all\nBut he's definitely always affected a specially with how hot it is here and you know it is getting caught up in Detroit now so we had to simulate heat and you know best prepare ourself when our bodies as well as possible and really just trying to stay hydrated even even throughout the game\nSo during the week it's turned up the heat in the facility or\nNo no no\nWe we try to do is raise our body temperature by running a laptop thing going straight into are often each time the office at it as serious coming up so we tried to play with our body temperature and why we're retired\nA very interesting well certainly work today is the outlast the dolphins thirty two Twenty one congratulations on the big day thanks so much for a couple of minutes greatly appreciate it thank you\nAll right Michael Roberts after a big day three receptions two of which one for touchdowns including one that was the springboard to this victory today\nIn Miami so interesting way to prepare for the heat did not think about that I wasn't sure exactly how they did it but very well explained by Mr Roberts it wouldn't be a Sunday if the browns weren't and over time and that's where they are right now in Tampa Bay where we go and check in with Tommy can\nHandle the browns won office first here in the overtime they went three un out the Puerto Rico quip kicked the ball well down the field printing Tampa Bay deep in their own territory but now dream was once in a company moving the ball a little bit they're up\nTo about their own thirty five yard line Winston has been most affected this afternoon through the air is thrown passes to eleven different receivers and no one's really overwhelmed with your digit numbers but\nThe air attack has been ... kept trying to Tampa Bay moving the football this afternoon the the buccaneers could have won the game in the very last player of regulation but\nChandler can zero missed a photo yard field goal as time expired earlier in the ball game he also had missed an extra point or perhaps kicker auditions will be taking place tomorrow morning one never knows around here because the bucket mayor seemed to have a never ending crisis in the kicking physician\nRight now we're in overtime six forty one left in this ten minute period\nAnd the grounds and buccaneers are tired of twenty three\nFine thank you very much time and let's go to Mike man cues so two minute warning it has not been a good day for the jets\nBoy this game seems interminable right now as the jets down by twenty here's Mike\nOnly positive as they get still look at those big green uniforms that gets [laughter] we are at the two minute warning Minnesota leads thirty seven to Seventeen and this is just not been a good offensive\nGame for the get you can blame got passes bad when\nYou know penalties and and what not but it ultimately depends on how the quarterback navigate through all that and Sam had a rough day today fourteen of thirty eight has been intercepted three times in than is a couple of the sanctions were off the fleck the balls that might have been caught\nBut nonetheless they go down as interceptions he was fourteen as they mentioned for thirty eight hundred and fifty nine yards will cook cousins had a good second half of Minnesota especially overall twenty five for forty two hundred and forty one yards two touchdowns a TV is Marie has a couple of touchdown runs\nAdam feeling nine catches for a hundred and ten yards and that seven straight games over a hundred yards receiving a feeling so right now with the two minute warning it looks as though Minnesota will win for the fourth time the season catch all fall to three and four\nMinnesota thirty seven jet Seventeen\nYou very much Mike ... and the patriots hold off the bears thirty eight thirty one on the final play the game from their own forty five Michel ... deep to Kevin White\nBut he comes up one yard shy of the game tying touchdown so one yard is the difference in the end\nFor the bears who fall too for a three and to make that three and three now on the season with back to back losses thirty eight thirty one was the final the patriots win therefore ths in a row or to extend their winning streak they had been wanting to they are now five\nAnd two on the season saints and ravens are underway and right now middle a little more than midway through the first quarter New Orleans is threatening also ...\nTo um the seasons saints and ravens are underway and right now middle a little more than midway through the first quarter New Orleans is threatening also under way or the rams in forty niners in Santa Clara their school is just forty five seconds in on a fourth one a pitch to Alvin ... goes to Bluey\nAnd he ... and the ravens recover so they're able to get more on this one from Craig heist in Baltimore\nTrade act and that was a long drive because the saints have had it since the beginning of the game as they took the opening kick off now\nFour minutes fifty seven seconds to go here in the first quarter we are scoreless but they had threatened they got it down to the poor yarn line on the fourth and one from America from field and the ravens have recovered the ... are just outside it looks like from my vantage point just outside the\nAt sign the shoreline so yeah that's hard to find that sick but that was just a long drive by Drew Brees converted three fourth\nDog W. A. G. G.\n\nY. own bullies\nHere's rich by\nSylvia one game is still going on the two minute warning and the extra period and browns and buccaneers is the browns could have two ties in a season\nI don't remember anybody in my lifetime having two ties\nAnd I'm getting older so\nWhat the last time a team had two ties\nIn the season but right now they're two minutes away the buck sub the ball with the twenty three twenty three score Chandler Ken's RO mistake forty yard field goal the end of regulation that would have wanted for Tampa Bay he could get another chance here as a but it is a third and twenty nine\nFrom the forty five yard lines so even if it was from here it would be sixty two unless it's ... like once again\nUh I Would think this one's a tough one to make in the meantime the Redskins and cowboys have scoring change will get there in a couple of moments in the meantime let's head up the turnpike to Baltimore where the ravens are hosting the saints and here's Craig heist\nTime back in right now we're scoreless one quarter in the books and if he said yeah that's pretty fast quarter you're absolutely right because things are wound up having a ball first in this game they went twenty plays a and sixty nine yards took ten or three off the clock but came up\nEmpty during that drive they were three for free on fourth down but then another point down at the bottom line for\nA turn into an aborted play around with Michael pierce picking up above the ravens giving him a first down to six they move toward midfield had the pond after Thirteen twelve\nWas no good and the same now with the ... as the second quarter began don't have a third down in seven at their own sixteen we are scorn us here in\nBaltimore oh I'd say fifty nine your attempt are coming up in the meantime ah somebody through a challenge but I'm assuming it's the buccaneers that did it\nOr maybe looking for a better spot or I'm not sure actually could have been maybe maybe receiver did not have position on the third downplay but in the in the end of in the event of a field goal will keep you posted in the meantime let's go to Ryan Leon rams niners and the rams just on the scoreboard Brian\nYeah there have been turned over the have happened for both teams already rich but the rams on the school board first just moments ago thirty five yard field goal from like a crime that will get course Craig's are on and the ramp at age seven play drive the biggest rival Twenty one yard conclusion\nFrom Jared gall to receiver Robert words you get a chance and the forty niners are first or second actually not read it went down to first for the miners he got an ankle injury is return is questionable\nBattered unfortunately are committed a dial in they were trying to throw the ball being tackled and throwing a diving interception and that resulted in rams ... points against so well off candles would at least three to six thirty forty going first quarter\nFine thank you very much Ryan and let's go to Aaron ... the Redskins are on the board early in Washington against the cowboys here there and\nAs you said Redskins have struck\nFirst in this game this game for control of the end of the step for the eagles lost earlier today it was to prevent to filling in for the injured ... Thompson you're catches a stream past the point where you are like they could all the way in for a touchdown kept they fix play fifty two yard Dr\nAlex Smith through for for thirty five yards and the touched on the drug Adrian Peterson for Kerry's for twelve yard\nAnd the cat we've got the ball back actually present Smith just went off on I tackle on his ... will have to see if he's good at the record\nFor twelve yard and the cat we've got the ball back actually present Smith just went off on I tackle on it because it will have to see if he's good at the record of on the line or getting a little bit shallower there oh nine forty six left in the first quarter the Redskins lead feather nothing\n... thank you very much Aaron poster in Washington right now the buccaneers just one for the fifty nine yard field goal\nAnd Chandler cans Errol hits this one so you missed from forty at the end of regulation\nAnd and then at the end of overtime he ends the game with the buccaneers walking off with the victory after the fifty nine yard field goal\nTwenty six twenty three was the final so no two ties for the browns we don't have to worry about that they dropped the two four and one on the season the buck solve the three games skid which is a huge\nSigh of relief in Tampa Bay after the two of those start they came back with three straight losses as they made a change defensive coordinators Mike Smith out marked up they're taking over and for at least today it paid dividends as the buccaneers hold off the browns who use a big second half comeback with fourteen points\nIn the fourth quarter but the bucks can breathe a sigh of relief today knocking off the browns by a score of twenty six\nTwenty three two more games left the day after these three that are going on right now and actually the one today but Bengals and chiefs tonight the chief coming off their first last falling last week in New England on Sunday night and back in the spotlight once again\nAgainst the foreign to bangles and of course the giants and falcons will conclude week seven tomorrow night to day began early today in London with the titans and chargers and the titans and struggled as they had a fence of Lee in the first half\nThey had not scored a touchdown for the touchdown in eight quarters coming into this game they stretch that ten settle for two Ryan suck up build those in the first half and then ultimately scored a touchdown and the third quarter and we're down twenty the Thirteen late\nWhen Marcus Mario to drove them down the field and with thirty three seconds left he took it himself got stopped on the one yard line thought he was in thought he broke the plane but replay showed he had been tackled just shy about a half yard shy the goal line so then they took it in and uh\nA Mariel touchdown pass took the titans to within one instead of going for the extra point to tied the game and try to force over time\nThey went for all left it all out there and Mario to pass one incomplete\nBut there was a defensive holding call on the place so they got another chance and Mario to again coming up short within completion\nAnd the chargers hold on to move to five and two knocking off the titans by a score of twenty to Nineteen Texans today winning therefore straight and taken control the AFC South twenty to seven over the jaguars who lifted quarterback Blake board does\nAnd replaced them with Cody Kessler the immediate turnaround was a touchdown but not much else is the Texans role twenty to seven and head coach bill O'Brian talked about the things that went well today first thing\nWe tried to control the temple of the game to the best of our ability the effects did a great job I'll festival you we made yards at a running game is a very very tough defense go against\nUh probably top five defense in his league if not the top defense so um you know we we we feel great about our defense you know so uh you know is how we decided to play the game or relative to the other question you know that's an organizational\nThat's going to stay within the organization or give credit to just Shaun thinks she's a very tough individual um sacrificed a lot over the last couple of weeks to to put himself in position to play great teammate loves to win loves to play and I think the world of the guy\nYou know every year is different I don't think any year has anything to do with any other year that doesn't there's no comparison there's no like if you go through this league and you think you're going to try to compare to what went on last year this year that year two years ago\nIt's just not going to happen so I think that our defense is playing really well right now and it has to continue you know we've got to continue to play a good defense\nOr Jay Jay's obviously having a great year cloudy had a big day to day for seven that's been really good for us and it's really helping our back in our backyards making plays on the ball that has to continue you know it's just one game you know as one game and it has to has to keep it you know keep going in that direction\nAlright so below Brian after the Texans knock off the jaguars to grab control of the AFC South at four in three with four straight wins cowboys and Redskins and the Washington Let's go back to Aaron ... or more\n[noise] Hi guys Redskins with the seven nothing lead over the cowboys here seven twenty to want to go first quarter skins go fix plays fifty yards three minutes Thirteen seconds they're opening drive\nTwenty three yard touchdown pass from my house but the ... on a screen and then throwing cowboys possession they go for fourth and wanted me to feel DJ swearing your stack Prescott takes the football right away from it recovers to fumble Redskins now have about forty five of the cowboys already up seven up\nAll right thank you very much Aaron poster in land over today the renewal the rivalry between the cowboys\nAnd the Redskins and it's the Redskins who draw first as they have the seven nothing lead rams getting a field goal from ... on top of the forty niners by a score of three to nothing saints and ravens right now are scoreless as for the forty niners right now they have driven forty eight yards in just under three minutes\nAnd are inside the thirty yard line so CJ bathroom company trying to get something going against the best team in football right now the rams are currently six and all the titans today as I mentioned came up just short in oil in regulation or against\nThe sand or the LA Chargers twenty to Nineteen was the final talked about that a to point conversion attempt that winter rye however uh you know Mike rebel might catch some heat for it but his players liked it and Marcus Mario to talked about the two point conversion of temp afterwards\nI Love the call I Love that he has a confidence and us to make that was the next year\nThey did a good job covering it I should have done a better job may be extending the play known as the last play 'em there's definitely more I Wish I could have done without being said it a good job of covering metropolitan", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018",
