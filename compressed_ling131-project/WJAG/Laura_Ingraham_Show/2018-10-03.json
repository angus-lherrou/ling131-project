smart enough to be watching the stream a bright kill me Joe dot com welcome back so you started this whole thing with your interviewer Brett Kavanaugh yeah\nI mean it's a remarkable alright what a week um as a you know I Know I feel like the ... and all that I spoke to um that Monday morning last Monday\nThe rec having a that was on Thursday with kind of simmering loaded beneath the surface he was obviously very upset very stressed out very uh intensely concerned about the entire situation as soon as family but he's trying to keep a lid on it and I feel like by Thursday he\nHad been advised or maybe it was his own decision to let that led just pop off and that's what we saw in there\nAre obviously a ... but people are saying that he went over the top and they're worried about his temperament now among them is somebody he really has to win over and that is Jeff Flake cut Thirteen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the remarks or the initial\nDefense that a judge ... capital gave a ... was something like I told my wife I Hope that I Would sound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly maligned but\nThe interaction with the members was sharp and partisan and that concerns me\n[noise] so where do you think flake is with that [noise]\nWell I I'm going to say that I think like it's still open minded um\nI'd have to write him about this last night he believes that Jeff Flake is still open minded\nUm but he was clearly disturbed by judge Kavanaugh as a performance and I and you know he's especially it's a pretty clearly he tried to walk back a little bit after that it said I was talking about the judge I'm Talking about the whole situation\nI think it's grossly unfair no matter where you stand on this to come after him for his temperament in that hearing if he had gone in there all controlled like he was on Monday morning people would say he has no passion if you were accused ... how could you just sit there and answer the questions like that\nThere is no satisfying some people on this issue clearly and you know when you look back at what Clarence Thomas said to that Judiciary Committee he was as angry as Brett Kavanaugh was their different people so it's expressed in different ways but he went after them and slammed to them\nFor their political nation of his process in no uncertain terms and nobody is saying that judge that Judge Thomas shouldn't have been serving on the court all these years [noise]\nUm I I think it's grossly unfair and I think given as judicial history it's it's very unfair to suggest that because he has personal feelings about what he's been through that he's going to throw all that are out the window as a judge 'cause he we've already seen by the past twelve years on the circuit court that he has a very um\nAppropriate judicial temperament so you know I I don't know I don't think that some people would be happy with his response either way\nAre you telling you have a son in college I Do are you telling him right now if he screws up these not going to get on the Supreme Court [noise] have you ... have\nYou know my son's about this and them and my daughter as well to be honest it it's it's really incredible when I look at my younger son um who is about the age that Brett Kavanaugh was is when these uh charges have been leveled against the impact that to think that you could be\nWell as we are pretty amazing astounding if Dr Ford was like that because she didn't want her name out there and we know that she uh wondered at him and he's just like to fly or what what about Dr Ford has not panned out\nIt's hard to imagine just like to fly her boyfriend of six years says I never heard you on a flight never claustrophobia she lived in a one entrance five hundred foot square apartment never mentioned sexual assault but that's up to individuals they caught you\nMention it to anyone until twenty twelve and then it came out in the therapist discussions and that it's in the notes so that that's consistent with her story that she didn't share it with him in the late nineties\nYeah so that is uh something that popped up and now we also understand too could into the boyfriend\nThe ex boyfriends deserve an axe to grind the doctor for it helped a friend of hers prepare for a potential polygraph exam Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraph work and help with clean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nWhen asked did you did have you ever take one or prepare for 'em before said she had\nYeah I mean that if that if his story is true that the potential for lying under oath and it was interesting question when it came up when the prosecutor after that question did you ever health anyone for parents that she where she's coming from here and now it appears that perhaps they had you know some of that testimony that led to that question I thought that was very interesting so with\nThis next story is fascinating because I have an oddity who feels like he's on a road Stormy Daniels which is odd things say of feels like I got another client and this guy's going to blow everything up yeah she did a her credibility she goes out there and says\nWell your your your Brett Kavanaugh was by the punch bowl Denise by getting though we\nStill don't know I was standing there at though handing solo cups around standing there at handling girls drinks who came to the party to go to a party I Would assume\nParty said he is even confirm these there and she's a college person and then she stood outside a doorway when there was group sex going on and he might have been somebody who has a reminder of\nImage she's got so many ... and she was asked you know why are we at the party when you're in college and they were in high school and she said oh there were people of all ages there from like Eighteen Fifteen to like twenty five I think she said you know and then I mean it's just so her story has so many holes in it\nIt's incredible I I Can't figure out and then he said oh can you know some of your friends who are with you there verify that you were there and NBC called all four of the friends they couldn't get one of them to verify her story\nOr Alan Dershowitz was on he said that I think that outbreak capital should be confirmed but he wanted to see an FBI investigation first Kavanaugh's speaks she speaks he says I think they're I think he's in it you know I think you should we confirmed but I still want to see the FBI investigation\nAnd I would start and I didn't know where it's coming from the time which I think that's the third accuser for myself why\nI think the FBI to investigate every single one of her claims\nAnd if it turns out if it turns out that she made it up out of whole cloth that she never met Kavanaugh that she was several years older than\nThat she along with others or by herself simply made up a story the FBI should conclude that she should be tried for perjury\nAnd she should be sent to prison this becomes a very important education moment because we have to teach the women of the world and the men of the world that there is no genetically linked\nAspect of telling the truth\nI think that he makes an excellent point and I think this is what we all need to get back to the idea that all women should be believed is a false\nPremise we need to strip away gender some questions of truth\nIt doesn't matter who's the man and who's a woman in his toys what matters is who's telling the truth and you know there's a lot that we still need to discover there's a ton of these stories out there but if you strip away you are at least on the right course to figuring out where the truth lies\nYeah and I think that's where we're at a now when Donald Trump junior was asked the question are you more worried for your son or your daughter about this in the future he says no doubt for my son's here's what Donald Trump senior said cutting\nThis is a time when your father\nOne your husband or your brother when your son\nA terrible things yourself in a person was never meant that I did things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job mom I don't know what to do\nThem sad situation I think you're right I think you know\nAnd who do you worry about more your your daughter or your\nYou know what I worry about them equally when it comes to this and I would say that one of the big lessons for young women from this whole thing is\nAs hard as it is if something happens to you you need to document it right away you need to tell people what happened do you need to tell your parents you need to tell the police you need to have whatever evidence you can possibly grow up in that situation to prove\nBeyond a reasonable doubt that what you say happened to you that is my message for young women and I think it's a very important\nFor young men they need to be extraordinarily careful because we're living in a time in this meat you moment where the pendulum has swung too far and where an accusation becomes an indictment and that is not the judicial system that we live in in this country\nExactly a and by the way the other thing I Want to go to Theresa W okay the business in other words you wanted to bring up a few Theresa Martha ... so you're getting said first show at seven o'clock you want to talk of the protesters\nYeah um my issue with them is like with the women have accused him like the protest or in the elevator\nJust because she wants to come out there and screen everyone thinks oh my gosh something bad happened to her how do we know that I feel like\nI Believe in the uh liberals when they said they will do what ever it takes to keep a Trump appointee off the bench what makes you think that these women\nAre the type of people that could do that because we saw that on TV we saw all the women wearing them Johnny we saw what they were doing and we heard what they were saying I mean there was a woman\nI Can't remember what ... was she was on TV talking about very gross things that you know go along with women's bodies every month and it's almost like they were wanting to blame all men I just don't get it\nRight that's the kind that come out and they say that this happened to me we don't know that it's All right\nThey retire again I I Would say the either yawn that\nYou don't know whether or not you know the women in the elevator went through these experiences I'm going to assume they did I I I think they probably did\nUm but their experience does not translate to this situation\nThese crimes are individual crime there not a broad brush that you have all men with each one of them he needs to be determined on its validity and so do you know Jeff Flake and Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Christine afford\nTheir situation that they're all determining the truth is completely separate from every other one of these\nSituations where Bill Cassidy do when he was confronted yesterday listen\nMore when I was\nJust like everyone they're the\nAre you OK as a person to go so far no charges for\nMore\nTo the phones\nI hadn't heard that exchange that is really remarkable and it's a it's a very evident of what's going on and it's not you know I I used in a very interesting also to see the president tapping into this about you know your son your husband\nBecause that that's a very bold strategy to president never shies away from saying that he something that he thinks is tapping into what a lot of people are feeling in the country\nBut I Do think that men are the majority of which are good and and don't spend their time assaulting are attacking women\nFeel under siege I and we're actually going to amend pal tonight we did a women than all the other night out for moms and we had people on both sides of the fence who felt that you know Kavanaugh was was guilty and and other women who said that you know that they didn't feel like the charges have been proven to never going to talk to men are about how they feel about about this issue\nGreat uh Martha ... going to host a show at seven o'clock tonight we're back to wrap up this hour Brian to meet you [noise]\nChallenging conventional
