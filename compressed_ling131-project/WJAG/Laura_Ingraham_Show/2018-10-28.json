and mortgage confidently\nWe gave began earlier today with the eagles knocking off the jaguars twenty four to eight teams Carson wins through for three touchdowns in the eagles when right now the Panthers on the move on top of the ravens by score a fourteen to seven\nThe bears coming back to back losses leave the gym spy a score of seven to three the Bengals capitalizing on some turnovers by James Winston and Andy Dalton is thrown for a pair of touch down where I should say one touchdown pass\nAnd Joe ... has run in the other the Redskins in front of the really giant seven to nothing they're off in non existent once again so far\nToday the chiefs got off to a slow start but now in front of the Broncos didn't seven the Seahawks where they form team seven lead over the line from Panthers have just scored again\nChristian McCaffrey take ... twenty seven game right now with Carolina in front and the point after bending and the Steelers have scored so let's get the details on that we go out to Pittsburgh where they're wearing the great unique today here's ...\nRich just moments ago the Steelers intercepted\nBaker Mayfield a Joe Hayden with an acrobatic catch intercepting may feel that the Steelers Thirteen yard line ending of Brown's drive it was a third in Eighteen is a Pittsburgh forty four maker Mayfield went deep and show hating the Steelers the former Brown's corner now Steelers corner makes the interception\nAnd uh the Steelers are leading seven to six a few minutes before that Ben Roethlisberger was scrambling and was able to on the run find Antonio Brown wide open racing down the sideline forty three yard touchdown pass from her office burgers rent Julio brown\nAnd the Steelers lead at seven to six seven twenty to go on the clock in the in the second\nTime that was a beautiful play ball Joe a tremendous play against his former team as George mentioned just a couple of moments ago I told you about the chiefs grabbing the lead for the Broncos let's find out hey and how they did it here's Christian better\nHey rich how she felt top now ten seven over the Broncos three forty seven\nLeft here in the second quarter the chiefs are had that feel go Harrison buck or are they able to get in the end zone the Broncos come back and attempt a field goal of the five yard brand of it ran us and maybe he misses wide writes them kind of opened the door for Kansas City a little bit of a momentum switch here especially defensively\nFor Kansas City they seemed like the Broncos kind of\nA dominated defensively here in the first part of the game it a little bit of a switch Kansas City defensive coming on now because on the last Denver a possession case Cain up sac twice ... sack by random speaks for a loss of Thirteen made at second Twenty one that came up on a third eighth in case there was sacked by Reggie rag one\nAnd contact with the Broncos they cover it up but they had to put it away so now the chiefs back with a ball and a midfield and driving of course they did add a touchdown of Travis Kelsey nine yard touchdown catch a on a fifty five yard drive for placed tight re kill forty or catch on that drive\nTo set up that Travis Kelsey a touchdown so right now ten seven Kansas City with three forty two left on the clock here in the first half\nFine thank you very much Christian let's go to David Schuster in Chicago the bears out in front of the jets here's David\nRich sounds like there's some pretty good games going on in the NFL today unfortunately not want to hear it to be perfectly blonde escapism basically boring seven three bears we've got four minutes in change to go\nHere and the opening half the only play that really got the fans out of their seats was the Seventy yard touchdown pass from ... to recall it was actually just a little screen pass and then he did the rest scampering off into the end zone the jets they have all of the forty two yard field goal from Jason Myers for the bears Cody parking Mr forty yard field goal and that's\nPretty much the game in a nutshell rich really not much to talk about seven three bears for Nineteen to go here in the opening ...\nBut that big play has been the difference so far but said do Denny captain Detroit Russell Wilson had started strong finally Ronan and completion used any with more\nOut of us all Wilson here now in the first half or we're closing of the two minute warning rich Seahawks of a fourteen to seven land trying to make it a to score games they have the ball down\nAt the lions Eighteen hardline Russell Wilson what kind of eleventh today for a hundred and thirty nine yards and to touch down the heart\nThe best team and turn over a margin the season with the second best team in the league and turnover mark and with the last seven they have the turn over a margin that plus one today after the lion bumble the kickoff return near a building with a history of fumble return that led to too quick scores for the Seahawks Russell Wilson with a couple\nOf touched on that one at ... o'clock it and one to David Morris fourth season though he's also getting some help from Chris person on the ground sixty one yards rushing to quarterback today read to combine the pain\nOf one team won so that's why the hand moving fast as it is hoped he was running the ball relatively effectively as well why in the season all three losses coming in which they've given up a hundred and sixty seven hours or more and right now the the hawks are coming off of that a hundred yards rushing mark\nAnd there's only two forty five to go here and the first half the heart of third down even lion territory\nI have a horse to seven lead with two at thirty five to go air the first\nTime so the lines defense trying to hold right here the giants defense comes up with a big play and ah then it gets they get paid back for it hears with a bike Moriarty with more\nThan ... richer right now it is Redskins on top of the giant seven nothing three nights he left to play in the second quarter but as you say the giants so great defense and play forced the Redskins into a field goal which they just miss it does to Hopkins forty one year and feel

minute left in Charlotte and just over a minute left in Detroit that might have changed by now so let's go to camp in Detroit at Ford Field the sea hawks and the lines Denny\nAll right the first half has expired here in Detroit to\nThe heart with a Twenty one to seven laid on the arm of Russell Wilson eleven or twelve hundred fifty one yard three touchdowns one to five o'clock and wanted to David Moran one dead Dixon playing his birthday and if they're coming off the injury list a Matthew Stafford seven uh Thirteen for a hundred and eight yard but the reason the lions have and unproductive\nToday it's weird to say this but\nThey haven't been able to run the ball carry on job than just seven Harry for twenty two yard haunt me really jamming up very un Jonathan animal lying and often mentioned a couple of hours ago the listeners that weren't around on the history of the game of the criticality of the game can be summed up\nLike this after seven games uh only eighty eight percent\nA playoff game ... playoff games have had a winning record after seven ... back in Nineteen Ninety these things are all three and three so this is kind of a make or break at him and that the physical sense that the only twelve percent opinion that had a record of five hundred or blow after their seventh game I've gone on to make the playoffs dating back\nIn Nineteen Ninety something to think about the heart of this one Twenty one seven up\nAnd as I hear the Beatles birthday blaring in the background or whose birthday is that that identity\nOh it's a mom and ... just some random scoreboard thing if the buck to Jackson power means getting the national airtime happy birthday to pay for college and yeah just the stuff you pay for it and nobody in particular\nI Gotcha okay in any event happy birthday to one and all especially my good friend Steve ... the devils play by play announcer ... celebrating the birthday today let's get Christian veteran in Kansas City as we're going to the half time a gun and before the Broncos get some points on the board Christian\nRitual just as you recover to me the Broncos are putting supports the Borgias five seconds left on the clock here in the first half she's still late sixties thirteenth point after\nPending so should be a you know just a to point game here just momentarily the or is he a touchdown play case to Tim Patrick for twenty four yard touchdown that capping Seventy five yard drive for Denver five play Seventy five yard\nDrive it answers Kansas City who just had a Ninety two you're driving a place every walk and a Thirteen yard touchdown catch that made it sixteen to seven after her some butter missed the point after but as I mentioned the Broncos come back with a drive of their own and Seventy five yards and five place and and able to put some points on the board\nA with a case Keenan touchdown and make it sixteen fourteen or five second thoughts on the clock patch of holes in the first half Thirteen and Seventeen\nHundred and Seventy two yards to touchdown he can't affect twice in the first half center twelve a hundred and twenty nine yards\nAnd that touched than sixteen to fourteen chiefs played were getting ready to go after\nIt sounds good Christian veterans tight on there and a couple of scores late in the first half the chiefs\nOr did not get the kick after their touched down as the point after failed and then they pass from these cuts it to a to point game as they do get the ... on that one from Brent McManus so a to point game at the half\nOld and then they pass from these cuts of to a to point game as they do get the chicken on that one from Britain McManus so a to point game at the half\nIn Kansas City late or actually they are now at the half in New York the giants and Redskins after a quiet first that bought the giants able to get some boys before heading into the locker room here to tell us about it is Michael Moriarty\nYour interests were at half time here rich as do the giants seven at three uh at halftime Al Smith Thirteen of eating for nine yards Eli Manning Thirteen sixteen for one hundred fifty four years and one interception your right to the giants did get on the board there to close out the first half on a thirty seven year he'll go for a kicker ... grows on\nA show they do get on the board as I said the on the rich previous position they missed the forty one year I'd feel though for Dustin Hopkins so again trying to put some more points on the board the loan touched on the game came in the first quarter\nAs Alex Smith a short pass a seven year passed to Adrian Peterson in the middle of the end zone and that really it was it for a for the games as far as we are at halftime Redskins going for their third winning or oh giants looking for their second one of the season if possible on right now ... the Redskins Seventy three at half rich\nHi thank you very much Michael\nMoriarty adds giants metlife stadium I should say let's say the George centuries in Pittsburgh who who's yeah we've had a scoring change right before the end of the hat here's George with more on that\nRich eight seconds to go here and the second quarter the Steelers have scored another touchdown\nAnd uh some some ... it looked like it was going to be a field goal but at the Steelers decided instead to go for it on fourth in one from the Cleveland for yard line and rich they got the first down Ben Roethlisberger find juice Smith Schuster at one yard line and then the next play he throws a screen pass\nTo Antonio Brown who goes into the end zone and look for a second like it might be intercepted and taken back for a Cleveland touchdown except the you know a second means everything in the NFL and it got through the hands and write to Antonio Brown who goes into the end zone\nFor the touchdown and there were watching the instant replay right now it goes through the hands of the Marius Randall the safety for the browns would have had nothing but a pay dirt in front of him but instead it goes through his hands to Antonio Brown Steelers go down and they leave now fourteen six eight seconds to go first to have\nA high and has been an interesting first have there the browns jumping out to the six nothing lead and giving up a pair of touchdowns\nOr in the second quarter and of course this one right before the end of the half that can be a crushing blow Antonio Brown second of the day let's go to Kevin Casey in Charlotte late first half the Panthers trying to put some more points and the board before going into the locker room here's Kevin with more\nRich Twenty one Seventy\nAnd we lost Kevin for just a moment so while we have lost him let's go to David Schuster in Chicago\n[noise] All right rich or not exactly the most exciting a first tabs in fact a pretty boring actually seven three bears here at they have the only touched down in the first half Mitch ... Seventy a touchdown pass to to recall it wasn't even that exciting because basically with little dump off on a screen and then come basically\nWhen uncovered into the end zone ... over all five of Thirteen for a hundred and sixteen yards after the touchdown pass his quarterback rating was one fifty six\nBut then like the stock market is starting to slide big time it's Ninety seven here at the half at the ads for salmon Donald he's only six of Thirteen for fifty four yard so obviously off that's not really prevalent by either team and the opening half ... half seven three bears\nSign thank you very much David so a very quiet first half of that one big played to recall on on the screen past\nTaking in all the way for the touchdown over so many yards and that's the difference so far and right now in Cincinnati it has been an interesting first that boy the Bengals have stormed out today after a couple of law says it has been a much different story today it's like they've had a\nSip of water from the fountain of youth Jason Earhart\n[laughter] it at the meeting they hit Monday must have paid dividends already two minute warning here at Cincinnati the of angles of twenty seven six after three consecutive touchdowns the buccaneers\nDid get on the board a sixty or touchdown pass through the Sean Jackson but the Bengals get it right back they march right down the field and he built and hitting age eight grade with a Seventeen you order and that made a twenty seven six interestingly enough\nBoth kick herds of missed an extra point so I guess that balances itself out and he dealt in a hundred and Ninety two yards and appear touchdowns in the first half and Joe mixing fourteen carries for a hundred and fourteen yards he has to be touched down so big first have for the Bengals skilled position guys against two minute warning twenty seven six Bengals and fall brown stadium\nYou know Jason you talked about Joe mix and needing a big day and how this was going to be he was going to be a big part of the office of game plan but uh as you mentioned fourteen carries a hundred and fourteen yards\n... eight hundred to old seven eighty five fifty eight\nEight hundred ...

sever east right now in Pittsburgh getting ready to start the third quarter the Steelers in front of the brown George\nRichard dramatic turn of events there at the end of the second quarter gives the Steelers of fourteen to six lead over the browns the browns have jumped out with six to nothing lead then they missed the field will that would have given him a nine to nothing lead\nSteelers comeback Ben Roethlisberger scrambling Antonio Brown forty three yard touchdown pass and then at the end of the the first half the Steelers with an impressive Dr rich from their own Thirteen\nAfter a Joe Hayden acrobatic interception and catch\nAnd Ben Roethlisberger leads is often it's all the way down to the one yard line\nA well he got 'em down to the fore yard line it was fourth in one from the floor with Fifteen seconds left the Steelers decide to go for it they get the first down and then ... burger with a one yard touchdown pass Tony around that went through the hands of the brown safety Marius Randall\nAnd brown catches it for the touchdown those things seemingly happened to the browns more than anybody else\nInstead of a pick six it's a touchdown for the Steelers they lead fourteen to six with the third quarter just under way rich\nYou know this was as such close game last time it doesn't have that same feeling this time around even though it's an eight point game right now uh you know what ... is the difference between this and the first meeting so far George\nI think the fact that the Steelers have been able on defense to to Ben but not break the browns get down to the third yard line\nAnd then they're just unable to do anything the or the Steelers secondary has been pretty solid and they've gotten pressure on may feel who has only been ... once but uh but they haven't been able to do much against the sealer defence when it's been really critical inside the red zone\nAlright thank you very much George several recent Pittsburgh underway third quarter Steelers up by eight it's a big lead from the Carolina Panthers right now is ... made me look foolish that's not hard to do though let's go to Kevin Casey in Charlotte with more on that one\nI regret the happy about two minutes away from kick off you're the third quarter twenty four seven the Panthers leave the ravens great tapper Cam Newton fourteen of Eighteen for a hundred and forty seven yards two touchdowns they go to Greg Olson\nFor eleven yards and to Christian McCaffrey on a deflection for six yards McCaffrey also had a ... eleven yards rushing touchdown DJ more\nThirty nine yards rushing Ninety yards receiving so Carolina really spreading the ball around twenty four seven the Panthers lead the ravens at the half\nTime they have slice through that defense very easily so far and I think that's what's most surprising the ravens defense had been so big in their best rush a relatively quiet so far today against the Panthers who I make twenty four seven lead at the start of the third quarter let's go to camp and Detroit third quarter underway sea hawks in lines any\nDirection speaking of slicing through deep and was on command Russell both in eleven or twelve or a hundred and fifty one yard is three touchdown he takes the Seahawks out for their first drive the second half of Seattle on that first half was four or five on third down conversion attempts they run the ball effectively they pass the ball effectively\nAnd they've jammed up the lion\nWhen they've tried running the ball the hawk came into this one with the twenty fourth rank Rushdie than the but they really fucked up carry on Johnson and company lions had the ball to start with first half picked up a first down on a Stafford path and then had to hunt so right now\nLine of defense trying to hang up and just the two possession boom hot for here it's going to be very hard at the math that for an alliance coming back to Lebanon forty to go and the third quarter the hawk Twenty one lion Seventy\nNine so Seattle which got off to the slow start this year rallying so far and having a big storm so far today in Detroit let's go to a soldier field in Chicago third quarter on to get underway and what has been a very ... games so far years David Schuster\nYou're being too kind I don't think all of them as he does not descriptive enough for this game up both quarterback so far rich are under fifty percent completion\nSoap opera percentage that basically tells you the story as it still seven three bears are the only touched down in this game ... Seventy yard touchdown pass to rhetorical now that sounds good on the surface but you got to remember he\nBasically dumped the ball off I'm a little screen passing cone went on encumbered into the ... the overall eight of Seventeen for a hundred and forty seven yards I get most of that on that one completion Sam Donald six of Thirteen for fifty four yards the jets off at school but anybody to sleep at it all up at seven three bears it's a younger so far here and the third\nQuarter alright so not much going on in Chicago a and not much going on metlife stadium either with the other New York team a calling at home today against the Redskins let's get more from Mike Moriarty\nThat trade uh ten forty nine left employee here in the third quarter it is a solar scores of Chicago Redskins on top of the giants seventh and three little more action here\nUm the giants had the ball to start the second half of what has been the case with most of their position they were forced upon in the play that proceeded that he like many again easily ... as the Washington has got through the giants support softens of wind show right now the Redskins do have the ball on their first possession of the second half\nOf that law into the game did come in the first quarter for Alex Smith to Adrian Peterson a ship and yard a short pass to the end zone in the first quarter and Adrian Peterson did move into ninth place on the all time rushing less passing Tony or set\nA with a Russian the second quarter as well so a little history here as well as ah the richest trying to take a longer lead us they have the ball up seven three ten minutes exactly left to plan a third quarter\nRich thank you very much Mike and it's been a one sided affair in Cincinnati today where the Bengals have just been crushing the buccaneers let's get more from Jason Earhart right\nThey're rich halftime here in the queen city the Bengals leave this game twenty seven to nine bucks get a field goal in the last play the first half from Chandler cats\nJason air hard right now the rich halftime here in the queen city the Bengals leave this game twenty seven to nine bucks get a field goal in the last player the first half from Chandler cat in zero but\nAt the big story of the half has been the Andy Dalton and the Bengals often they moved up and down the field coupled touchdowns to totally avoid a couple of facts one to totally avoid won the age of green and a couple on the ground from Joe mixing he's over a hundred yards rushing for the buck such Amos Winston has two hundred and seven yards passing in the first half however\nTwo big interceptions that's the difference in this ball game as the Bengals rolling right now with the half leading twenty seven to nine\nOh thank you very much Jason and right now we bring in ... case in LA lots going on in LA today five games including the world series in of course the rams and the Packers Chuck how are ya\nWell rich great to be with you again yeah it's going to be Seventy six degrees that kick off our there'll be a large tree digital green bay Packer fans here to welcome there Packers against the seven and know Los Angeles rams the rams have been on the road\nFor four months if they last had a great experience on Thursday Night Football against the Minnesota Vikings when they defeated the Vikings thirty eight thirty one in that game\nJared cop who's twenty six I'm thirty three for four hundred and sixty five yards at five touchdowns and are teaming up with a running back Todd early who will leads to lead in a in a rush hour ... rush impasse you touch downs with fourteen\nIt'll be a trail of Southern California and she will look to stop that Rahm off and it's\nSomething that you can play their home games here in memorial coliseum for the U.

Seventy yard said\nTo recall him for yards Anthony Miller overall ... on the day Fifteen of twenty eight for two hundred and seven yards meanwhile Sam Donald has gotten his team into the assault once

likely that is but right now the bears advantages fourteen that twenty four to ten\nMatthew Stafford with the lions down fourteen trying to rally but that rally seems like it is a been futile let's get more from Denny cap\nSeahawks still a lead this one twenty four and five and tend to go Matthew Stafford as the lions were trying to drive and make it at one possession game got him from behind fumbled Frank Clark the former University of Michigan offensive and that up and gave the the ... to the ball back but the the hawks won three and a rough the wealth and sat\nOn that last driving now Seattle hunted away\nAnd uh the lions will have the ball at their own Nineteen yard line to start this dry for forty six to go and that's one line is down by more than they have all three of their time out of left a but it's looking for Detroit here at home a mass exodus by the fans after that\nA battered fumble a couple of moments ago this place that no bigger than fifty percent capacity at this time I got four forty five to go regulations Seattle by fourteen twenty eight fourteenth for forty five to\nDanny what's been the biggest difference today for this team that started out with the first quarter of the day then gave up Twenty one and the second quarter but has managed little since that first touchdown drive\nYeah the first few possessions of a hand literally took up the entire first quarter of the the first possession by the sea hawks and the first possession by the lion both teams ran the ball relatively effectively\nOn their first to drive than both quarterbacks we're completing passes at will in fact the first thing completion of the game came with two minutes left in the first quarter a but since then the the hawk the event has really done a fantastic job especially upfront a front fix really stacking up\nA line through the night carrying on John than a much room to run for the lions and Stafford I really didn't go the have the the the hawk\nOr back for which has played really well without the life of a camp chancellor and Earl Wilson and such they have a they performed very very well\nAnd a staffer really didn't test them enough early on it was almost like they were trying to throw the ball to open up there on which is so backwards for the lions are very than are there I ended up ... just really struggled to get anything going\nOn there you very much then he kept in Detroit's got a Christian veteran Kansas City where the chiefs holding on against the Broncos up ten Christian\nYeah rich holding on good word a thirty thirty to twenty chiefly seven thirty eight here both office is it really kind of stalled here a little bit\nIt was up ten Christian yet rich holding on good word a thirty thirty to twenty chiefly seven thirty eight here\nBoth office is a really kind of stalled here a little bit uh last couple possessions for Kansas City an interception Patrick Patrick ... chief had to hunt or their next possession and then for case Cain um he uh fumbled coffee at the ball that came after the patch from homes\nAh interceptions so didn't really costs Kansas City but then a case of just through an interception uh since she's had the ball right now looking at a third and sixteen so they're in a possible scenario where they could part that the interception pot pot thirty to twenty\nKansas City so the ... kinda stole here\nBut the chiefs midfield a look at it puts him points in the ... start to put this came out of reach which just seven thirty eight\nTo go in the game than Iraq it's two touchdowns today they gave for him it catches a hundred and Seventy hours and they get to touchdown passes for him perhaps Kelsey also caught a touchdown and cream hug and a credible run a twenty three are touched they're catching a shovel pass a again like last week hurtling an offender carrying one in the end zone a\nMust see a for the highlights treatment with that touchdown and then as I mentioned by Trump's for touchdowns today twenty six on the season so she's right now with the ball looking at a third sixteen up to it over the Broncos thirty to twenty seven thirty eight left here in the game\n... thank you very much crushed inventor let's go to a metlife stadium right now it's still ten point game and the giants and had opportunities they just have not been able to cash in against the Redskins whoever really put the pressure on Eli Manning exploiting not all fence of line here's my\nMoriarty yeah you're right rich five twelve left to play here and they gave it as the giants trailing by ten Thirteen to three to Washington change do you have the ball first attend\nOn their own fourteen she can get something going here late um the last score for the Redskins was a a seven forty seven your drive thirty nine yards a dozen how could feel go off with a fifty three order on the day the loan touched down in this game did come in the first quarter to Adrian Peterson a ship and your past from Alex Smith to Peterson\nA as well as the Redskins looking for their third one of the road so I right now as I said giants looking to do something late here but uh right now many has two interceptions of the day which myth history of one touchdown pass and the Redskins trying to keep hold on just lead in the NFC ... as I said going for their third went into\nGiant somehow looking to pull out a second here most of the stadium I Would say by half of it is now in the parking lot\nOr and or has booze have rain down on this giant often said defense ah throughout the day so a giants chilling Thirteen or three five twelve loved to play here in the game Richard\nPryor and anybody calling for ... to make is a NFL debut today that will not happen he was an active so ah he is not active today so in his ... who's been pressured all afternoon insect at least five or six times that I could count\nOr maybe even more than that but the even in when he wasn't ... well even when he wasn't sacked he was certainly pressured\nOften let's go to Jason Earhart in Cincinnati the buccaneers of added a field goal but still I have a ways to go here in the fourth quarter against the bangles well look terrific today\nSo rich as we speak there's going to be a Seventy two yard touchdown for the buccaneers and they're going to be within a score here in a second that was on a ... a secondary and fourteen play it looked like a blown coverage nobody out there\nI Believe was Mike Evans all by his lonesome down at the Bengals thirty yard line and he's going to go and it's thirty four twenty five at the extra point is good it'll be a once in a war game the Bengals office has done nothing and the second half three three announced Thirteen yards total often no first downs and\nIt's all happened since they lost their loved guard Clint bowling so that was going to be a big loss on the offensive line they\nCannot move the ball they're gonna have to do something to help the defense extra point pending here nine fifty seven to go thirty four twenty five Bengals still ends up\nJason I Know you're just sitting in a blue moon coverage there but if some of these points to come as far as you know a big deficit in and you know a little uh bend but don't break but that doesn't always happen as we begin as we know we've come to see\nWhether you're a ... a couple of big one just to blow uncovered there but yeah they have certainly allowed Tampa Bay to move the ball they've held him to a field goal a couple of times but uh it let's not forget the ranch it's Patrick you hit the are they called it fits magic the first couple of weeks came out of the bullpen here to start fourth quarter and he let them to a field goal in a touchdown so stay tuned to extra points good one score game now\nNine thirty four twenty six so a big comeback here by the buccaneers down eight with just under ten minutes left in regulation after the extra point is good let's go to George Senate race in Pittsburgh the Steelers more than midway through the forth trying to add to their lead over the browns George\nRich it's six twenty four on a running clock here in the fourth quarter and the Steelers leading twenty six to twelve at this point are trying to run the clock down James Caan or has been given the\nThe Russia or the last four times and he is up over a hundred yards on the day a counter now rushing for a hundred and three yards a touchdown Antonio Brown catching to touchdown passes\nA game that really are rich was very close and the first half but then the browse were unable to make big plays the Steelers were and that really has been the difference here in the second half it's been a lot of James Caan or on the ground for Pittsburgh and again the Steelers leading twenty six twelve five forty

from last week in Philadelphia carried over to this week\nUh which is no going into the game that we had to start a quick uh last week we saw it as close started fled the mood is we we couldn't do that it gets it gets team though are motivated us to start this\nWell this team it was a very good team coming in especially defensively but it was you know this unit that shine today what was the big key against Joe Flaco forcing them into two interceptions\nOr just for the month started from the first part of this Wednesday we came up and ready to go to the game plan or we had a good part leading up to the game and then we've got to the game you know it just made it easier for us to go out there and play\nAnd this there was some great balance for for this team today as not only the defense played well but the ... also did its part when everything's clicking how dangerous can this team be\nI mean as you can see we're very down to the ravens there are good things are very physical team came out here looking at all and it was like you said especially well especially in as well if you get about especially in the unit of great supposed to go in and they'll say very well and that was so ah but I wouldn't be very dangerous\nAbsolutely gram granola sixty three your game winning field goal a couple of weeks ago than a fifty for your time today that was set up by Greg Olson reception

twenty eight fourteen when in Detroit today and joining us Tyler lock a toddler rich Ackerman how are you [noise] I'm doing good how 'bout yourself I'm All right you know it was a strong start for Russell Wilson but down seven nothing when you finally score just forty five seconds into the second quarter how much of a\nA lift was a a a weight was lifted from this team\nOh I think it was a big weight I mean obviously\nAre being able to have rush out there and be able to do to the ADA helps us to be able to access or I did a great job you'd have to throw the ball on the line or able to catch it but a big I think I think the biggest thing is is that first set it off and that was the thing that we needed at once we got that wherever it down the road\nAnd I have to ask about the celebration if I'm if I'm not if I'm correct in saying this was it the they hit by pitch by Nolan Ryan that set off the brawl between hand Robin Ventura [laughter]\nOh I don't know all of that I think you know if the world's theory okay we decided we decided to try to do something that sometimes happens in baseball that everybody can kind of get it and understand and we did it and I think it was a great celebration a lot of people like it\nIt was unique that's for sure who came up with who choreographed\nLaw I think it was me David more borrowing and Dr\n... of course your quarterback and former baseball player as well and Russell Wilson saw\nHim he was my first baseman on that\n[laughter] very nicely done a ... in all seriousness though now how big is you know to get this went on the road today against the team that was really starting to turn it around and now you guys are over the five hundred mark you know how much of it was after this team today\nI think it was real big but it goes back to our preparation and we did a great job every single day if you have to prepare it ourselves ready for the day every day was a bad day and I'm not saying that like it literally was\nI spend a lot of people having the best practices that they had they been here and it correlate it back to the game and I think once we do that it allows us to be successful and allows us to put ourselves in a great for this because we want\nWell was a terrific performance today congratulations on the winning a and very nice celebration", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city":
