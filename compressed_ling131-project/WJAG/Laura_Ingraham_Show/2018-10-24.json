I I Would think that would be a good idea for a President Trump to dispatch someone not and his government\nSomeone the Saudis trust I mean ideally would have been George W. Bush someone like that but he's too old maybe Bush senior maybe a former ambassador someone they trust but to give them the no nonsense message you guys got to clean up your act\nAnd um and and and complete Leslie or cut thirty six President Trump\nIs sort of became a nationalist\nAnd really we're not supposed to work you know what I Am I'm a nationalist [noise]\nHis critics say that's code white now she says no it's America first I Want to put my country first right\nThis uh does anyone think that President Trump speaks so suddenly in code you sleep they they are attacking flipping bluntly right on the book\nI think patriot as a better word a it is parallel to the America First debate I mean I think the President Trump uses the word America First and the literal sense that most Americans hearing it means we're putting America's interests first\nYou know as far as from a legal perspective and I actually know law firms that are going to be watching your monitoring on election day in Florida and work with them closely um I think his bigger issue more than on the falls is what's going to actually happened on election day we do have problems in Florida from time to time with\nUm with what happens election day from a voting perspective and I think unfortunately for somebody like Scott and his supporters they might not get everybody they want\nTo the other one is very intriguing is wrong to say it is again a congressman who has the president's support is able to win a typical primary against that I'm putting them put them in the established Florida Kennedy many people thought it was his time the ... the President Trump backed the wrong horse\nOr no and and I mean we got to talk about this because it was about Hamilton anyone is saying that you know who lives here dies and who gets free tickets for Hamilton I mean that that's the questionnaire today with with Andrew Gillum apparently somehow getting himself free tickets I Hamilton\nWell Andrew Gillum the Democratic candidate who want it very difficult primary and he has a showed himself now that will lead it almost every poll that's come out and today a new revelation\nYeah yeah I I think that I think it's gonna be closer than it is I mean the Santa's as an Iraq veteran it's got to really like well I'm good looking family I my understanding is that I'm the president likes him on and and you know the president\nWe had a very uh ingrained politician in our state and that and putting them Adam did not come out for the president during two thousand sixteen early Enron did and present remembers that stuff so ... presidents loyalist I think that's what's going on here I Do think this happens it's going to win\nAnd again Gillum can't get out of his own way this this ticket thing is something that seems small\nBy voters again and I for a quarter three I think about it\nText message emerge that show what he said on Sunday in a debate did he got him from his brother is just not true when an FBI agent posing as an influence or a text message Andrew Gillum and says I have you I've gotten you uh Hamilton tickets and he says great\nSo those are the tickets worth hundreds of dollars you can't get that as a politician you can't get favors like that as a politician\nHe seemed to have not told the truth about it and accepted it and it shows that the FBI agent is fading him to do this what does it say about the investigation that might be taking place on the Tallahassee mayor\nYeah um well let me say this hundreds of dollars I it says in Tampa Hamilton's coming for the first time in the spring and it's over a thousand dollars for tickets\nOr was it a Broadway play yeah yeah well no it's a Broadway musical it's common so I'm\nPutting a living on ... on\nThe orange show I my understanding was that was the target show but the long and short of it is is that for somebody like you know I'm In Tallahassee having the reputation is I mean take it out of politics we talk football out\nFor the state's at its own problems with with a bunch of stuff there Tallahassee has become one part of Florida is looked at as our swap our microcosm of a swamp what I'd like to see and other people who support Republicans in the state\nWould be to Santa's coming out stronger against the state swamp than the D.C swamp I think he's trying to hide them rather than the ground game which is important in Florida\nWell I don't think he's really outlined what he would do more he just points out that\nA Gilman reality once Medicare for all Gilman reality once upstate taxes give 'em reality is not that a good job as mayor of Tallahassee what he has his great charisma great presidents and African American candidate who ran a crowded poll because he was backed by Thomas dire\nAnd he was backed by George Soros so now you have a charismatic guy and you have another guy a veteran who is a made a difference in Congress and he's been unable to separate himself because he can't believe he's running against somebody who seems so anti Florida\nYeah ... and Brian look at going because when you say Medicare for all the same Florida I mean I Know we we have the economy on folks over age sixty five in the country we still do\nYou start talking about Medicare for people that are under sixty five yeah that scares a lot of voters and to your point the Santa is not explaining that piece to health care if you gave Medicare to all the folks there living over sixty five in Florida right now they're Medicare their Medicare Advantage plans I work without their businesses all the time are going to get diluted\nThat should be a major major talking point and you're right it's not being discussed in part of it is nobody really just gotten understands healthcare\nRight and it is remains the number one issue of concern caravan aside\nA scandal aside a healthcare number one we're in between the Obamacare plan which is actually the Democrats are running from and it being taken apart by Republicans who don't have a plan\nYeah and and look I mean it's in the news today with what the president's doing with the Recovery Act that is a major band aid on the biggest piece of legislative malpractice and presidential ... malpractice I'll probably ever see in my lifetime and that was Obamacare why\nReally simple Obamacare for people that I didn't understand it expanded Medicaid that was three quarters of Obamacare was expanding Medicaid Medicaid what's supposed to be for folks that were disabled had Down syndrome like my sister in law passed a couple of years ago [noise]\nSupposed to be for the elderly poor Obamacare opened it up to single able bodied mostly not working men under the age of thirty five\nSupposed to be for the elderly poor Obamacare opened it up to single able bodied mostly not working men\nUnder the age of thirty five what did they start taking if you go to a clinic that takes Medicaid in Florida and it's a pain management clinic in the last ten years tons of opiates so now they're hooked on opioids they're addicted on opiates and what's the president been locked weapon thank God it was a byproduct person piece of legislation\nThe oh the Recovery Act where you try to now get Medicaid coverage grasp what this does to help these folks on Medicaid get off the opiates we got 'em out\nRight or if you what are the numbers like if we had Medicaid for all for a country\nBecause that's what Bernie Sanders is asking for free education and medicated for all I mean do you have any idea how costly impractical that would be or impractical\nOur country right now it's almost twenty percent of our gross domestic product everybody knows as it is health care if you were to shift healthcare to medicate for all\nAnyone in the audience who is a Medicaid patient would be able to tell you the experience they get into the doctor it would be completely different than the experience that all of our listeners who do not have medicate today half\nIs a different type of medicine that's practiced and it's scary and nobody talks about the actual care compared to the numbers in the covered right\nThe uh good pretty on it was a primer hotel it they're not going to do anything that's going to sustain itself unless they work across party lines I suspect\nThat there might be of sense in this country right away for them to try to get a health care program on a bipartisan way because if you don't have bipartisan as soon as you lose power that other the other party's gonna take it apart\nAbsolutely and the and look one thing that I can tell you that a lot of people really like right now are two things one direct Madison used to having an Amazon Prime subscription there's an ability to get that now in the country and get it a low rates in going to see a doctor when you want to it's a free market private enterprise\nThe other thing that people really really like they like when their employers are doing wellness programs and giving them back money for staying healthy and staying in the workforce you don't hear about those things you know she'll be bipartisan\nYeah a health clubs are eating right things like that a lot of times a day revolutionize the workplace to make sure if you want to stay we want you stick around and we're going to give you an idea what would be good for you\nYou know number one employer is doing it nobody is talking about this apples actually got its own if you work for Apple in California they have opened up their own health practice you go to Capitol doctors while work for Apple employees in California it's part of the benefit of working for Apple\nAnd I'm sure you book those appointments on an iPhone five on your watch absolutely or on your watch hey Brian great to see
