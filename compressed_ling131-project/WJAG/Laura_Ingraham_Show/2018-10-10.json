Iran has been done and that was just break you I'm Talking about who's got greater motivation off this nomination Republicans or Democrats LA's Christ are well dad but why I think the GOP just woke up and we'll stay up all the way to election day number one that\nShe told me probably six months ago she said you know maybe at the end of the year at the end of the two year period for the end of the year I Want to take a little time off\nA here we go uh the ... the United states gets a word that Nikki Haley will not be sticking around much longer but the fact that he brought her into the oval office and they complement each other with such sincerity why all the wild speculation sometimes is controversial things you just can't figure out there were unprecedented and then there's this\nUh especially on the governor's level to make it a good outcome for Democrats so we just got to see who who who is really going to show up how many people\nSo he would would present a of the population being that we are in in this unprecedented time of anger and passion right what do what would be a number that we have not seen in a while at the midterms what can we expect and what do you expect\nTwo thousand fourteen in the last midterm election we had the lowest voter participation\nBut any election dating back to Nineteen forty two\nIt was thirty four percent\nIt was bad it was real bad\nUm and that worked out well for Republicans in a lot of places Republicans generally do better at any given Republican Pence devoted to higher frequency than any given Democrats that has to do with income that has to do with educational attainment\nThe richer and more educated you are the more likely you are to vote 'em and that for a variety of reasons and some reasons we don't even probably no but that's the way it is until the Republican base has more reliable than the Democratic base generally speaking a lower turnout affairs generally are better for Republicans than they are for Democrats\nUm ... ... if we see so for it to be for it to be getting back to the way it used to be it would go to forty anything above forty percent participation would start to look like a huge change\nQuick thing a Taylor Swift hope has asked people after she went for Bill breads and she has to register to vote she got two hundred and forty thousand people to register and forty to\nWait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait a correlation is not causation\nUm I have seen the story a bunch of places and we don't know that that's what that was and by the way you know why else there were so many democratic voter registrations in that period of time why it was the end of the voter registration period and Eighteen states so of course there was a huge increase in\nThe number of like the story they say the entire month of September there was a hundred and Ninety thousand yeah\nSo you don't want to give her credit\nWell I'm just saying it's not it it's not because Taylor Swift said on her Instagram please go register to vote it's because it's the end of the ... it was ... it was the end that would be like saying Taylor ... on a a April Fifteen\nTaylor Swift said everybody should file their taxes\nAnd then it was like look at all of the tax filings that came in on this day oh my goodness so there is there is a little bit of the I'm sure that some people

I called him unstoppable you're at is that a friend of mine is\nBecause you get it really gets it he sees that African Americans and by the way Hispanic and Asian [noise] I've never done better his his gun and they liked it\nAnd I remember you know instead of Tim Scott has had great conversations with the president on this but ... but he said you know the president who really hasn't made an overall a as a made an overall program\nTo go out for example his his heart secretary was here and his secretary a deputy secretary was talking about all how the private sector's getting involved in Detroit and they're getting money to rent it to destroy a lot of these homes and rebuild them ... fresh yeah\nThey don't talk about it Darrell Scott on the outside not on the on the payrolls whose guys doing great things in the city I'm like why don't why is he talking about it it makes no sense to me\nBecause it's a it's it's hard for Democrats and this is when they have to have a message and this is where it it's much more effective\nIf you can give credit and then build upon it it's like best practices right where you know you take something someone else is doing well and you kinda do the same thing um and Democrats haven't figured that out they think that\nBeing bombastic and doing an impression of the president is going to win the presidency and that's not the way to go you have to have\nA message not just for one things fall apart but also for when things are going well and we'll see what happens in the midterms I Know\nThere are a lot of people in the media who want there to be a blue suit ... we still don't know what's going to happen right I Want you to hear how Hillary Clinton is desperate to be a leader amongst the Democrats and tries to explain some of their obscene behavior cut thirty ...\nNot the civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nClinton ... he can start again\nHe's holding the country hostage number one until they win and number two if they win it has nothing to do with her it is in spite of her she ... her party\nParty was you know she talks about leaving the White House dead broke she didn't get into the White House and the DNC with dead broke because of her\nWell also President Obama would not raise money according to down to Brazil's book every time we raise money it was for him it was never for the DNC over the course of eight years in Debbie Wasserman Schultz enough protest because she had the power and the big SUV and the driver well he did the opposite\nThing she raised money for the DNC and then she\nTook it for herself fresh good yes that's my comment and that tells you consolidate so many superdelegates here is a Jeffrey tube and cut thirty seven\nI think Democrats are ... they are afraid of everything it's like oh we can't have Hillary Clinton talk because it'll motivate the Republican base we can't have Iraq Obama talk because it'll motivate their base we can't talk about impeachment or to motivate their base\nYou know what Hillary Clinton got three million more votes than the other guy in two thousand sixteen I don't see why she shouldn't be campaigning around the country I don't see why Iraq Obama's shouldn't be campaigning\nShe has an enormously important figure in history she got sixty plus million votes I don't see why she shouldn't speak out\nSixty plus many votes she still couldn't win the presidency because she's a ... if if I were a Republican I Would say bring her out that'll be fantastic she is so much fun to campaign against uh she said things that are hypocritical an asinine and sell an incredibly\nHelpful to analysts like me who have so much fun pointing out the absurdity tone deaf but her husband isn't and he sees slowed down quite a bit\nHe lost his fastball he certainly lost his fastball he's thinking like well for friendly now I Would say also a Brock Obama is out there but he just we're over the last couple of weeks I don't know how much he helps him to help his ... he doesn't want to help the he was two hundred and eleven candidate\nHe does not like campaigning for other people and he thinks that's enough to be like if\nYou pay for\nThe candidates chilies\nAnd you know and and if that's enough that's not the people have to go out and knock on
