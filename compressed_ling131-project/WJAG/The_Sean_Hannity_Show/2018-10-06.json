welcome to the Dave Ramsey show bread what's up\n[noise] I think for taking my call wave sure how can I help\nI have a question um uh we uh my wife and I are just getting started and baby step to ah we've got about Ninety thousand in ...\nAnd we currently have a three vehicles two of them are mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have a\nA commuter car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to call a trailer\n[noise] her car she is a it was about eleven thousand on and it's ... percent interest [laughter] we could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise] um\nBut we just didn't know since the car loan as ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of\nSome of the dead or should we or should we keep it because it's ... percent of\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay off the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars worse\n[noise] um the truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ten\nOkay because one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay you're not violating that though so we're good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand\nOkay but that it that includes the car and I wrote down the car and what is the Ninety thousand on\nMostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five a year making one forty and be debt free in two years my answer would be yes\nFive to to drop and we'll talk about your life and your\nMoney Taylor's with us from Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you [noise]\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all things somewhat her for taking my call I've been looking for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college one from our one year old mhm\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby stuff for about a thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I could Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have no equity in it\nUm and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a chip five twenty nine I think for him and then kind of\nGrowth stocks mutual fund to I don't know if you work goes from there okay um so my question is what are kind of my\nWhat do I do with this kind of piled cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses her for um you know every any given mom because about twenty seven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her\nChild so I'm pretty much the only income right now I'm so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of it\nUm my wife stays at home with their child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shake shack throw it towards my how they all do that every year or\nPut it someplace else we teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation than if you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too is dead free but the home you've done that three as an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nUm because that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans\nNow uh what do you make\n'em so I'm about Seventy eight year is the household income\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nNo I have a I have a pension\nUm that I put a about\nA hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the car does well I'll tell you that mandatory\nOkay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have I just opened up a Roth IRA and with a better man which is one of kind of the rubble and hide hundred for me I'm I'm\nFamiliar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo shortcoming they're they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money and row boats at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do with some or you know in certain situations and so forth but\nWhat I Would do just go to mark bastard die Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... best in business I don't care what you do okay doesn't affect my income at all\nBut I people have always asked me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each\nUnless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred as eleven thousand and that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stocks mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you have the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine okay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and so you you know if they teach you anything that\nMakes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that and that's maybe step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different in ... in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget\nAny extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last baby step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr which you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house and then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I find that my budget them all the ski jumping around that house you're probably gonna that house paid off in three or four years at this rate\nThat is what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nHi Dave I'm great how are you guys are better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have are currently two hundred and twenty three thousand ain't got a hundred and Ninety three thousand is pretty abnormal it's currently with the U.S department of treasury on it as a result of having been a dishonorable from a service academy at three years ago\nUm and the remaining thirty case like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously a much smaller so my question is I'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue paying off the smallest at first or should I\nI'm just kind of started to save rapidly for the hundred Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amount of people um\nYou know um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWow so you might learn to you guys are the only guy on the side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can who got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections\nOkay when you start doing thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're going to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either after the surge through and lip service or you're assigned to the recruitment and death\nOn and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it goes over to the U.S\nSo you have the option of serving\nFinance and accounting service initially and if it goes over to the U.S treasury though you have\nThe option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enroll for a period of time and it's for given\nA yes or harbor my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half\nShow like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news in the short story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business\nYou have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash Dave\nEver had you know but it can happen it can I have no so what happens\nIs is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situations solvent\nYeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nWrite I actually last January took myself off you know\nOf of her checking out because\nHardware I Do ... more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\n[noise] well he was doing drugs you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case you know so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want\nTo participate in her healing\nFinancially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life and make good decisions independence from drug addicts and independence from mom of intentionally\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and that the perpetual but to do that was yeah I've been out but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you like going to see last time not because she was healthy but because she was on a healthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life she's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't\nShe's going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially\nHere we are again broken you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating for the people that habit and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people\nThat with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nOur now she has to be medicated she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want him just in a you know all the rest of their lives\nAs I Know I mean they add control there she definitely has a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as as semi ... nearly mentally ill and she is voices if she's not on a couple of different methods she does\nHer own her only shot then is what we're talking about but our goal is this girl will be forty four and all this to be a memory\n... can happen\nYeah and it happens to people all the time so what did she say right now when they call her ... do you get nothing\nSo she does take up the phone you know\nYou might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them\nWhen they call you on the show you get nothing\nSo she does take up the phone\nYou know you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them\nBecause you're just a you know because they're going to just I don't think I should be talking ...\nTelling them to be either one of the American long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're going to badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs go and then we start negotiating in trying to work our way through the debt right\nWell my husband thinks that it just goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate\nAnd I are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah\nOkay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how their their during our pliable\nToday but she's got no money and you're not giving her any no so they get nothing\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof and give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nUntil let's say ... showing a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight and get there they say look at the Kennedy work at a deal\nYeah or you know they were Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm no backup and work and again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that in the settlement in full will do it and get an\nN. riding and no electronic access to your checking account 'cause whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a filthy industry\nAnd so you got to treat them like rattlesnakes because they are [noise]\nCovering person here\nWho's going into a rattlesnake then\nShe starts making some money you got to walk with or emotionally on that\nBut you can you can give her the cheerleading support that she needs without giving them money\nAnd I think here who writes do all of\nThere's good news show she can make it out is what you make good choices [noise]\n\nOkay things are getting ... where it out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the personal financial info up half\nOf all Americans now we have breaches affecting
