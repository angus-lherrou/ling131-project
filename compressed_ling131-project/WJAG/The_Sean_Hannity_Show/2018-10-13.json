O. five got a beginner babies to say but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I feel like a ... lot doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand okay show can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school\nAnd stop the studio is\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on these little property as we in the past couple of years okay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into bed I Would rather put get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason they plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college tutor Lex two years old yeah\nWell ... maybe steps for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income and the retirement five is kids college which you are in our cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt\nTo pay on your mortgage is yeah which is in an indirect way that's what's occurring you fall\nIt's just a lot of our concern that we should just have a a a three three maybe four month and merge see farther than yep\nAnd then I ... didn't stop taking out student loans and\nClear 'em out and do the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there is money above that then we started throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two so it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn the house this time but then and then around your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about we're all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies okay uh fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen yeah yeah and for what is the only ones only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year from now when I was going to feel good and my son is still take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay I knew there was one in there somewhere to make that math work All right uh yeah still I'm just going to blink along on those minimum\nAnd take your college without that first once we got college without that\nThen we find money we throw it up to have to probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\n... how about ... back in the four oh one K. or not\nDo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now\nNow okay yeah well no so did you get your emergency fund right merge and she found is maybe step three and then babysit for his Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat your order of attack baby steps four five six in order\nTo actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like ... but four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then of course money left we keep going down the list in the next thing on the list is mortgages ... is that so there's still a prioritization even though it's ... says that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before shipping tree or two and three I guess technically\nYou're given five or ...\nYeah yeah yeah and you have any skipped three to yeah [laughter] yeah so yeah you're\nAround with your back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\n... the it's an honor to talk to you how can I don't buy them for you [laughter] okay\nUm we had our house currently on the market right now we live in July for to pain [noise] um I Know there is not an email in our area [noise] um we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [laughter]\nWe've had only one showing we've had\nHundreds of head on line [noise] um what we're struggling with peers and we paid one day for the house\nThe average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine good\nLord what is wrong area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural Pennsylvania\nWe have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half million [noise] um and then ... and so that that occasion 'cause it's on lake we're on water on a on a dream but I'm\nA military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know you're not in in Harrisburg proper them no no I'm In like northeast yesterday a near up here in New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very limited market\nYeah but I I I mean three or six to nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in I mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff\nRight and you just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than a is there\nAnyone in that resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is there a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere the kind of specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but\nOne of the half step down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives are that are not\nNot purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort\nArea the higher end stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town to get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter] so why are you moving\n[noise] we need to get it or we have an hour drive to work like I Can't do it anymore you know OK Kid you know we're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices are promising\nA you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at\nThey're looking at it on line\nAll their workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through them and they realize where it was I walked away\nThey were not client's location kill them it was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours here for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer for mass to\nI mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one\nI mean do I pick another will call yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that\nWhen someone comes to look at that ... million dollar house and just gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the person that can do that\nThis that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you and that a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area\nAnd they and they don't have the potential buyers and you need to it's a very unique\nSimone rule somehow resort situation oh I'm Sorry\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nTheft has become an epidemic data\nAre being recorded every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy the I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked out when\nThey become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans to find out really quick how unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ... id theft plan to our benefit package was such a smart move the Sanders plan covers all types of ID left takes over all the work and\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple\nAnd me wasn't that way on one of those\nAds [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to de France eight or nine or a hard thing to beginning so I mean I'm\n... ... what's your all income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the force anyone which really only not wired\nIt was really difficult to figure out something that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that mhm but it also kind of oil down to the are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get ... and and what we want to show and and so we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart as you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that you know well and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's the beach with a lake that kind of stuff with the income you've got no debt\nYou can do anything you wanted to them and you can go to like in Europe if you want I mean it's you know you can do whatever you want to and it's and it's not even\nAnywhere near as expensive as those houses are so right it's um you know you are your freed up to still have incredible uh family memories doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say is interesting\nVery interesting\nShow or so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the debt\nSo our our whole debt is um\n[noise] by paying by virtue of paying those off we were able to pay off the home that we live in ... and so we we use the cash derived from that ... plus cash flow and some savings\nTo pay for our home that we live and okay so it was just three properties yeah that's what I was all your real estate I mean that's all your debt whichever properties okay the home you live in is worth what one point six wow you guys are amazing\nCongratulations boil and obviously holding back then and clearing that that's a big part of the equation there yeah 'cause that's secure and amazing fan I'm slowly\nAmazing so you're sitting there with a net worth Whelan access or two million

second guessed and even even having so much of our network tied up in a house\nUm so but it feels great you know it's it's a it's a first step and a journey\nYeah yeah well I get give yourself a couple three years to think on that one you know where to go you're in great shape don't worry about it because your net worth is going to continue to grow and the house is going to continue to grow
