da da da da da da da\nDa Silva says the leak and they use you know get the thousand dollar emergency find any use forty six hundred to pay off the shelves yet but now with the baby I didn't get that that I was wondering what how we should kind of attack that\nWhat I Would suggest you do is push pause on the total money make over okay in pile up cash as big pile as you can file between now and the time by becomes\nOkay and um and then whatever you are piled up and and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital in everybody's fine in April that event is than behind us in any worries\nAre threats or anything we would have had about that is behind us right yeah um well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but I you know eight eight years yeah there is now but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery\nAnd everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household

you they better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we purchased our life insurance and we got part permanent part term and of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nA dark and turn about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and said we immediately wanted to get rid of the term or sorry the permanent and you have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about oh a permanent insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you have\nTo do is it they'll bad shall we still didn't get the term he doesn't\nKnow much about Dave Ramsey\n[laughter] okay they Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clearing the lesson you heard me yeah when you never tell you under any circumstances to use life insurance\nAnd investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhy would say you need more new financial advisor\nThat's what I Would show you you don't have a financial adviser you have a life insurance salesman\nOkay the selling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do is put to four hundred thousand just of term H. and then the money we were 'cause it was like three hundred\nDollars a month which I'll do a lot yeah um and just go ahead and open up our ra ra\nOther than just that term H. and then that money when you were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month but I don't why yeah um and just go ahead and open up Iraq Roth are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn that it would mutual funds\nOkay that's exactly what you learn in class wasn't\nYeah so you already knew what she said\nYeah he did language\nTells me one of things either this guy's a liar or he's ignorant\nHe's a family friend isn't T\nI'm actually one of our friends did apparently gave him a number of years and four as well\nYeah yeah okay\nSo I I don't know which it is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I have never in my life\nTold someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nNight [laughter] and now the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever like on ... and I can policy within ... eighty with hand\nOkay\nWhy don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys overcharged you for everything he sold you\nOkay [laughter] okay and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nHey that sounds like well Oregon ... I'm In the end of this week\n[noise] All right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um the people who sell\nInvestment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance are not happy with me\nThey don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business\nRap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing\nWhen you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return\nRegardless of what they quote you\nAfter they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your body\nAnd that's where you should be when you die\nWith cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a better rate of return and when you die they keep it all\nThis is a bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more\nThan you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class\nTheir crap and that's what\nDave Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is alive owned myself\nI have never owned\nWhile this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever now I did get a horrible northwestern mutual\nWhole life grotesque\nOld school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives\nWhen I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him I had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it\nAnd since then I've never told anyone to buy anything other than Fifteen to twenty year term life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you\nThe best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any kind of syrup broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible deal\nWhether it's your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind of\nLet her broker shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deals and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from his hand\nAnd I don't own Zander insurance on our own any of it that's the other a lot is always told them\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement\nBut the reason he done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds and they don't sell your name\nTo listen to people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed them it's real simple takes care of you guys\nYou the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much so just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again\nYet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance out by the way a broker you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with ... with the help they usually a north local providers\nFor your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance you can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies\nInstead of using what we call a captive agent in the business captive agent can sell for one company like a state for him\nBut among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business captive agent consult for one company like a state for a major\nOr nationwide and ages\nOr Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent was nationwide that's nationwide and you know but um and they're both good guys I like both of them\nIt's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys\nWhen you when you use that insurers it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you this is the day room she should\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this one\nIt gives you a different set of peace 'cause I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere 'cause I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on them home with a mortgage\nSo we just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms and in down times\nEnjoy to not have a ...\nAnd more named country wide on my back bank of America on my back\nCan't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just just oh I think I Would probably have an anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us in Pennsylvania hey Carl welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up\nHey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping he can give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently paid our house off yeah why do you go yeah we're happy about\nThat a decided to you know Phil Austin investments just to do that people kind of\nSaid well why would you do that well the other people's money you know low interest\nThat's right and I tell you what the peace of mind this great fun and I have a good problem I have as we were able to sell some stock options and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollar suit that I'm trying to figure out what to do with you about about the same amount in a four O. one K. which I have\nTo be in the market um I'm a little nervous about possibly also investing this amount of money in the market and I'm [noise]\nMy foot homes we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy a rental properties no outright mhm and uh and do that and maybe diversify a little more than I Want to hear what your thoughts were on that\nOkay um I think it's excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you\nBut it's a higher hassle factor yeah it is you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know but you you put put a renter in a house they go out on ya [laughter] and so there was a ... you know you've got the hassle of buying it you gotta pay the taxes you gotta pay the\nInsurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national factor I've got a bunch of it\nI'm not by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot and both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return\nBut it requires management by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else do what you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so\nMy real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit to the you know that appreciation schedule in other words\nThe actual cash on cash return the ... minus expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual return which is called the intern right of return the IRR okay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples\nHigher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return\nAre are not casual cash is about ten\nOkay or a little less and some of it okay but uh I our our total with the increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the real estate ... on the other maybe double what on that I'm making a mutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it I mean ...\nYou know even though I don't management and my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally deal with a renter or something like that\nNo I don't management and my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy are broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning whether and to see how the properties are doing we check on them and he's telling me the stories all the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real estate do they have\nTo ask if our question I'm sure they might play point was a hundred thousand dollar house so what five hundred thousand [laughter] I have I can get five home mhm I'm all in a hundred thousand each ... now so I don't I don't want 'em out right all the rents minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else to wander you buy three\nAnd four fifty percent yeah\nWell I don't ... you know I don't I think I Know your answer there on a\nLeveraging like I'm not going to leveraging the I don't I ... I Want the extra pain in the butt of dealing with a banker on top of this right and on top of that I got risk and it just takes all the joy out of this whole discussion um what's the average price point in your area nationwide it's a little over two hundred thousand\nYeah probably about that I mean I can get a three bedroom one bath three bedroom two bath for about a hundred maybe on it and twenty ... family home yeah\nI'm probably gonna bump on up in the hundred and fifty range in you and do three three one fifty one Seventy five is Robyn there are rather than ... ones and the only reason I'm telling you that is get a good by on whatever you by whatever it is not above ... but the higher the clash runner\nOr the more they pay in rent or they users are dealing with generally speaking\nAs a general category it's not always true\nI mean there's some wonderful people to read it every\nYou know people ... a month [noise]\nYou know it's a different [noise] different types of folk that you're dealing with their lives and my\nBoth myself I'm not talking about somebody shut up on me\nBut I'm just talking about Tom Shaffer you want to be\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped\nYou can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team\nThey have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've accepted thousands of timeshare owners this year alone they're the best in the business because they simply have more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit teams so confident in their acts of service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund called eight for for nine nine nine ... and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine or ... or timeshare exit\nTeam dot com Dave\nRamsey a news talk WG a\nThis Sunday the chiefs returned to arrowhead to take on the Bengals [noise] this is a new game to\nGame six kick off at seven twenty she's in Benghazi mail here on the radio that catch\nAll of the hard hitting action on your hope for the genes in northeast the double DJ jeeze what five point nine and that led to take a look at the midtown health center community notebook midtown health center quality medical dental and behavioral health services affordable health care close to all the Brunswick\nAmerican Legion auxiliary will host a pancake brunch coming up Sunday November the fourth and rent an eight in the morning till one o'clock in the afternoon at the Brunswick auditorium free will offering will be accepted again fringe like American Legion anniversary handshake bright Sunday November fourth one\nGuy watch whether power by Nebraska public power district and brought to you by Mars body shop\nOctober is public power money\nAnd it's time to celebrate the benefits of getting energy from a locally owned not for profit utility like local control because utility board members are publicly elected and live in the communities they serve customers have a voice in the decisions made by the utility\nIncidents board members are customers themselves they understand the impact of their decisions\nThis message brought you buy your local public power utility ended up ... now we're district always there when you need is\nHi I'm Jim ... owner of Mars body shop in North fork harvest comes exposure or more here this year has tend to be more common this time of year my staff and I are geared up and ready to repair\nYour vehicle we work hard to get your vehicle back to you as soon as we can and most repairs are fixed within five days or less we work with all insurance companies in all repairs or guarantee at Mars body shop we'll repair anything from ... in ... big or small if it fits in my shop we will repair it off and Mars body shop eleven hundred\nBenjamin avenue in North fork [noise]\nNo huge age sky watching whether the whether I weather center clear sky tonight with a low of thirty to southeast early wins five to ten miles an hour\nClear skies and quiet again tomorrow level off around sixty eight tomorrow night oh it's a little off around thirty seven year old just airtight for news talk W.
