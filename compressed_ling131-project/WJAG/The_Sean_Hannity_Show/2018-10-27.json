taking my call sure what's up\n[noise] uh\nI'm a listener and I I uh late in life on keeping my home will affect my will building capabilities in the future and how I should attack upcoming student loan debt I'm thirty one years old right\nNow um [noise] what do you want to know\nYou want to do what his upcoming student loan debt\nAlright so uh [noise] four years ago to get a promotion at work I decided to go back to school and it didn't pay off I landed the promotional two years ago and now the loans are kicking and then if I were to got a hold of your show earlier I Would have been paying 'em off sooner but\nI Will I Am get free or two years ago we had our first child and we use\nNo you're not you're a student loan debt\nHe well yeah [laughter] okay so I'm I'm not that free now\nI Am a student loan that they are\nEager and coming up in the Seventeen months I got to start paying for\nA no it's not coming up it's there it's just whether you've got to pay it when you have to pay it so what's your household income\nUh it went from only twenty five when we were both working to Seventy five now my full income\nAnd how much of a promotion did you get in return for going into debt fifty grand\n[noise] well I was getting a lot of overtime and the path so it was kind of a lateral move but it was it showed on paper thirty percent\nIncrease my base ... it didn't show on the paper called your check not yet not yet\nWell are you I mean so so far you've got nothing for your fifty grand\nTrue true ooh and I've all I've always felt pretty smart with money so I I have a positive net worth right now of four hundred thousand between my four one big assets and I'm home equity so I'm not I I'm not terrible but I just want to know\nWhat kind of way gas that's do you have that are not home equity or for one\nUh I have a hundred thousand and vehicle fifth wheel toys like larger items worth more than ten Fifteen dollars\n\n[noise]\nFive [noise] five two to five Andy and fresh or in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped by because there were in the neighborhood from Anchorage\nAlaska [laughter] not really but things were going by guys are yeah thanks for having a excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go\nThere we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp for officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nThe camp will be a uh the the operations of\nThe camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... ... all and we'll be rented or on we currently own property\nCurrently on that property and we'll be living on it up\nTo him and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be a non profit and then the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a\nYou know you need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a lot building\nYou need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the tenant they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the non profit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer ... interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nUh I'll keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do so let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on their hands of the land is owned by the nonprofit you see what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a in so treat the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that\nAnd any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying it's a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it in mind but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you said you would go to insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash wrote what happened in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means in insurance where they find somebody that I write you a policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs to this much and this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it costs this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can\nYou know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in his shoes is but the main thing you want to ... do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from you cannot contract away liability\nOkay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building\nIf you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk I but I hold harmless is\nThat what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest right it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case they're not after writing a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the hold harmless but I\nI Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and having attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so yeah I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you hey thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five at two to five you're jumping we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a ... fan and and I knew now so I Apologize if it's something that you've touched on our website and find new to the baby fat and I know that number wind have the ads and dollar\nAn American the fine mhm\nMy question and you ever think Kathy saving more than that and and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happen mhm I stay at home I Can't\nFunding and how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get back to baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an honest stable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off\nHow much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years oh no never happened I mean really lucky we haven't been laid off\nIt's never he's only been working for three years and never happened to us we really lucky we've never been laid off and then they get home pretty quick I mean within a couple\nOf weeks some couple of weeks to do something and he's going to find something to do when it comes home if they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up in five of his buddies were laid off last week I Will push pause on the whole told them want to make a little baby step thing and this pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about it as well we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program\nAnd um that would be baby step forward\nAnd I do that first in a Roth IRA and then I Do it in a Roth T. S. P. after that\nIf they're matching and don't think they do but if they're matching on the ... going to start their with Iraq with the match that'd be the plan\nMichael thank you for serving your country really appreciate is going to talk to you Martin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how is that\nWhile I was a one of your opinion on regards to um to whether it's just all my rental property to pay off my primary residence or and path any other debt also that I have\nA much other data got\nJust two cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nYou've got your your debt free but two cars in two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nI'm fifty thousand on balls each or total on both total\nOkay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty okay you gotta lotta car and um\nSo what do you own your primary and what do you owe on the rental\nMy primary to fix the and it's worth about five fifty mhm and the rental and um my rental Ohio one fix the end is worth about I Would say or thirty Philip has four fifty but I if I'm at a little bit less okay\nSo I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right\nAnd so on you know if we state taken say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental first probably go ahead and pay off the rental or might pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know you start doing what forty fifty grand a year and that\nStuff let's see here we got three\nFour uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car um or you can sell the rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had in question whether to to do that and and path most pretty much tell the rent on pay off pretty much all my dad on it but I also have in mind as far as like I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in two years she's going to go to college\nI don't have a house payment you can catch law that right okay you know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore right now my credit card check that out there next time you get right by a car\nYou have paid cash for it I'm All right you never are all money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that's that's the planet you can get on track\nYou can't sort or ride this out of debt horse\nIt doesn't work can't shorter routed me got to ride him or not\nAnd so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything cash flow college and then save up and buy me some other rentals with cash or go alone out there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have to go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of\nFrom the day you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have and go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff that you got to stop it you got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle than yeah dumped the rental I'll pay off the cars would pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap\nBuild your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you got junior college covered a by just don't want to start in a savings account does the junior college junior colleges do it in their build it up build it up build it up build it up\nAnd work your way right through it and then I'm\nA ... then once that's done then you just start saving up paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby steps here are the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the soil that ...
