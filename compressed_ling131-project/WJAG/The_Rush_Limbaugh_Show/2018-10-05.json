S. N. B. C. today\nA she wanted to the river [noise] and I just put at the bottom of the book it's about somebody I very rarely comment on because they don't cherish phony folk conservative is named Jennifer Rubin\nA yogurt is Jennifer Rubin it's amazing the transformation this woman has made a Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger\nJennifer Rubin it's amazing that transformation this woman has made the Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger during the Obama years\nDuring the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative bloc and then when Trump gets elected she became I think what she's always been just the died the cast in the wool liberal\nAnd now she has the still the conservative columnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative and MSNBC reversed or that way but that's not the point I couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name\nShe says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time of the month\nNow\nThat to me he goes to the deeper than what it just sounds like you're on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative saying on MSNBC the female Democrats senators were being so emotional almost hysterical behaving as if it's their\nTime of the month does anybody think that would fly there is no way a male\nCommentator anywhere can say that about women senators are women witnesses or any of us or but here's Jennifer Ruben\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six day and that they would not forget that\nAnd if they would realize the need to continue to vote in ways that would continue to support enable Trump to be successful and she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition that elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in them in terms\nOf the words in her study of things just continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there\nDon't know why\nI Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the catalyst because of how Trump voters that per se and specifically the conservative populists coalition perceive the way he's been treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populace coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they edit things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that\nThe targets of rage have somewhat diminished until Kavanaugh came along in Rio waking these beep and fired them back up so she says this is what I see in a nutshell what happened to Kavanaugh\nHas served as a reminder Anna highlights to the people that voted for Trump why he's successful that it's all about being strong it help remind voters why they supported\nHim and the other Republican president would have walked away from cabin all by now energy would have been lost but it's not\nEnergy as high now that's again that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate today heading into the two thousand sixteen or two thousand Eighteen midterms now where I\n\nLive she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think that people voted for Trump are deeply involved with things now maybe there are some exceptions\nAnd you have some people to vote for Trump to just set up with Republicans and Democrats and found Trump interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion that Trump\nDid so for very very very\nPrompted is set up with Republicans and Democrats and found Trump interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion that Trump voters\nDid so for a very very very specific reasons related to Trump's agenda which he\nHounded every day multiple times a day Donald Trump told everybody when he was going to do trade deals the wall immigration rebuild a military bring back the economy\nI Would think people have voted for Trump knew that that's what he's going to do and I would also think that people who voted for Trump would realize that he needs more than two years to do it\nBut is her insistent know that kinda stuff it evaporates and wanes you know people's lives do on the news changes but the this Kavanaugh circus has re\nIgnited the coalition that electing Trump\nAnd this is to the detriment of the Democrats or don't see this happening\n\nShe says the Senate could indeed say a red wave the house she's not so sure of\nI found it interesting analysis and I I'm One of his share it with you she points out the Democrats are spending money and house races out there like we've never seen before and that Republicans aren't and that

we have nothing to do with it when this whole thing is an orchestrated screenplay\nAnd that's why I time will turn over any of the cycle or the therapy and the polygraph information for the Judiciary Committee to look at\nAnd the Republicans notice too\nBut the power of the Democrats look at the Republicans that are quivering and a little afraid to go ahead and can confirm Kavanaugh this democratic machine is a scary scary bunch Democrat machine includes the media in all of these\nPsychological deranged protesters that are out there threatening and in some cases committed violence we got one of them who has just been arrested for doc saying a bunch of Republican senators\nThat is ah that's tech lingo for releasing their documents boxing means to discover all of their private information name address phone number\nBank accounts all that stuff and making it public and the guy who in turn for for for Sheila Jackson Lee\nAnd I think worked for Feinstein is the guy that did it and don't forget Feinstein had a had a Chinese spy on her staff for a year driving her around I'd be minds be legitimate to ask why does the Chinese spy actually a spy\n\nLet me put it in a different did Feinstein know that he was a spy and and that's why he was there\nI don't know I'm just tells you we we have been again subjected to a gigantic\nReal life Netflix drama this thing has been scripted it has been choreographed it has been rehearsed\nIt had an objective failed and this was the reason we're learning all this the objective\nWas for Kavanaugh to withdraw\nThey thought that they would get Kavanaugh so intimidated and making him think them all of this was so futile that in order to spare himself this assault he would withdraw his nomination\nThat the ... that the Trump when withdrawing so s disparate him the embarrassment they miscalculated both ways\nSo now we've had a procedural vote we're gonna have a real Senate confirmation vote tomorrow on a\nTotally

there's no way\nBecause being deployed several times ... would be to accuse me of war crimes\nNow Raasch is not there so it's not I'm not going to present a problem with our solution and here's this solution after Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh that'll then he should pile slander charges against white snake Ramirez or any other activists liberal slander\nFor the new standard will be\nGuilty until proven innocent and I can tell you this right now my military brothers and sisters have not hot and dry for that sort of write for this country\nDamn right that is exactly right I don't think Kavanaugh would be able to sue them I don't think that uh once you start getting into the government government officials and so forth are\nKind of you know you got the first amendment which protects political speech and you can produce an ad that says pretty much anything you can lie about whoever and whatever you want and there's not much you can do about it the the uh the remedy for that is more speech\nWhich in this case Nichols more money to counter the lives that are being told I found frustrating thing that drives a lot of average people out of politics even to the point of not voting or not caring 'cause they think why should I I don't know who's telling the truth probably nobody is\nI Can't keep track of it any way is not worth me the banks and it causes it causes a lot of

because it is\nAll of what you've said slanderous liable as a but there isn't there isn't any recourse you know the it's the old saw successes the sweetest revenge I'm telling you this folks I think you ought to be prepared I let's let's do a little hypothetical\nWhat's presume that it's tomorrow at five thirty the votes over and Kavanaugh's confirmed\nIt asks you a question do you think\nThat the Democrats in the Senate\nThe Democrats immediate meaning the media\nOr do you think all of these deranged psychologically out of whack protesters are just gonna say\nWell we gave our best shot we'll wait till they nominate somebody else and try to destroy them or do you think that they will continue in their effort\nTo wipe capital out and destroy them believe me shoes door number too\nEspecially if these clowns when the house they are going to immediately amount to things impeach would've Trump and therefore impatient capital because if Trump shouldn't have been there and the first white than his nominees shouldn't be either this is not\nGoing away there's only one way that it might there's only one way that it might and it's a huge long shot in the business\nAnd by All right by all of his just by all with a world in which God that is present\nThe Democrats ought to have their rear ends handed to them and these upcoming elections by all the ... just by all that's decent they ought to be wiped out this ought to be the biggest mid term landslide defeat any party has\nEver experienced this party deserves to be punished at the ballot box like no party ever has\nAnd in a decent and just world that's exactly what happened what happened in ...\nRight now the Democrats are expecting this gigantic blue way if we're not going to win the house and plus he's already talking about being speaker\nThere even dabbling about the possibility of winning the Senate and then they're telling everybody what they're going to do and I'm telling you better if they do when both those you better get as much active enjoyment\nOut of our current economy and your current liberty and freedom as you can because they are going to start immediately erasing it by raising taxes\nRaising corporate taxes committing this country to all kinds of worldwide climate change garbage\nThat is going to redirect American resources\nThere are going to reenact the Obama agenda and they're going to put it on steroids and that'll mean wiping out\nAll of these trade deals all of these new jobs the Democrats want government to be front and center in everybody's life they want every voter to think whatever they have came from government came from Democrats it didn't come from you it doesn't come from your hard work it doesn't cover yourself or a minus it comes from them\nAnd you're going to learn it and love it and live a by golly by gosh or else you're going to be punished\nThis party deserves to be so soundly defeated in November that we haven't seen anything like it or if they lose if they do not win the house if they do not win the Senate if they lose seats in both\nThen that might make some of the leaders of the party\nReef think their current strategy but if they win based on this\nIs going to get even worse than it's been\nThis politics of personal destruction is going to be amplified and every Republican it's going to be targeted and every political media
