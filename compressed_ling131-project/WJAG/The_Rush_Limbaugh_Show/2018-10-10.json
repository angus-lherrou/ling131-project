think the closest [noise]\nPopulated landfall area could be but that's just my wild guess one thing about these storms are reporting a wins it a hundred and fifty miles an hour and they just showed a neighboring cities and what the wind gusts are the ... the highest wind gust right now around sixty four sixty five miles an hour in the Panama City\nPanama City beach area these one hundred and fifty mile an hour winds are in the ... they are not the entire storm\nA I have not tried to to to minimize the impact here it's just that the reporting on these storms and the education on these storms in general is I think one thing it's lacking such as the way they colorized the graphics of these storms to make it look like hell on earth\nWhen any any hurricane the strongest wins are in the eye wall and a little\n... you know extended from it but\nThere's not too many places are going to get a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds today wherever I wall hits and maybe twenty miles depending on the size of the I Will not from there it'll fall off\nNothing nothing a\nHundred and twenty five is no slouch if you think that you've experienced Seventy five an hour winds well that's not bad like and it's the effect of a hundred and fifty versus audit Seventy five months if not twice\nWhen you're in it if there is a multiplier effect\nOf massive wind speed so that if if the fastest the highest when you've been in is Seventy five miles an hour and you think OK\nA cat for its gonna doubled is it won't it on the ground miles per hour it is but the impact of\nA hundred and fifty mile an hour winds versus Seventy five the just the destructive capability alone is a factor of three or four\nOr so hundred and fifty miles an hour is dead serious that that's where the storm surge will be or the worst of it\nThe further you get from the eye of depending on the structure the the more they wind speed decreases the rainfall pretty consistent throughout a much larger area of the storm but the devastating the worst when the storm\n\nAre only in the eye wall area and people can look at these storms in the graphics while hundred and fifty miles an hour a look at those winds all that's all I met a whole building it now it is it not trying to downplay the or the damage I've just I've learned all this uh we live in hurricane alley\nAnd every time one of these things I moved here from Nineteen Ninety seven and I quickly they can make consumer hurricane expert I became an expert in how to interpret and watch the media I became an expert in how to analyze the graphics that they use\nAnd I became an expert in where the actual worst damage of a hurricane is you do not want to get a direct hit\nEverybody well yeah of course Russia everybody knows that yeah but but outside the direct hit the damage or the strength of the of the hurricane diminishes quite a bit\nIt's always the direct hit that that is the most destructive and then it it starts to decline as you get away from
