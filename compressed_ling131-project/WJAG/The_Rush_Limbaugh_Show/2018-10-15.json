George I don't think anybody I don't think anybody wouldn't even think of this I don't know why are you asking me I just want an answer quit stalling you states\nWill eventually Romney answered it\nAnd it didn't matter what the answer was it allowed the media Romney discusses states banning contraception [laughter] that's all it took and the Republican war on women\nWas reborn and that's what this pre existing condition garbage let me see what the real issue with\nThe real issue that is raising its head out there that the Democrats don't want to talk about is\nImmigration illegal immigration that remains\nThe issue that color lessons\nRevolt Republican voters\nNo matter what other issues they have that is the issue it has been poll driven and tested\nIn terms of being a very helpful to Republicans and of course the Democrats don't want to talk about it after ...\nThey're trying to gin up all this stuff about pre existing conditions Leslie stall here trying to do the same thing\nBy suggesting that Trump is hostile to our good friends in Europe it just sounds so hostile\nWhy what you want to sound so hostile it's like when she was talking to Jose Jose Roderick why would you give them in short that's the stuff they give cancer patients so mean that's not who we are still you're still hustle and Trump's at what cost all\nThe way they treat us is what's hostile we're not hostile\nShe says yeah but you can't deal with it\nWithout he says we have been the stupid country for so many years\nAnd that you find that you're willing to get rid of the western alliance no I like NATO NATO's fine but you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO\nYou know with all the sudden this interview secretary of defense Mattis came up\nTrump's that I Know more about NATO than Madison does [noise] I don't work man is as far as the deep state is concerned is\nNATO any\nArmy general wouldn't be NATO So Trump\nAs many fair magazine says\nAnd it's surprising admission\nSixty minutes was out matched by Trump the president talked over Lesley Stahl at a rate of what was a blast of rhetoric that seemed more rally at an interview\nLeslie stall will not be happy to Vanity Fair they all live for puff pieces and Vanity Fair particularly news people because they enemy fair\nYou know is is Hollywood star celebrity mecca magazine\nAnd if you get mentioned Vanity Fair\nEurope done massive crossover you've crossed over from news do entertainment\nSupposedly doing both not to be disturbed by Vanity Fair that's not a bullet point that's not a resume enhance\nSixty minutes aired an interview with Trump rare for its status as having appeared outside of Fox News or conservative media\nAppearing the same weekend as first lady Melania Trump on twenty twenty this one seem to represent a new level of media blitz thing I'm not part of an administration that's already seen its head and get plenty of free promotion during rallies broadcast on cable news\nAnyway they go on to crash Leslie stall and trash CBS for letting Trump\nWalk all over them\nTo just continue to dominate\nWith real lent lists rhetoric CBS let Trump get away with the same kind of persona and the same kind of stuff that he\nSays as he says\nAt his rallies they say Leslie stalls interview with Trump was an undeniable get\nScarce on mainstream media since around the time he appeared on tape what Lester Holt at NBC and indicated he'd fight\nHe'd been scarce on mainstream media since around the time he appeared on tape what Lester Holt at NBC and indicated he'd fired call me in part due to the Russia investigation but he introduced seem governed by two motives both of which played in the hands of a media savvy president\nWho's refusal to play by typical rules of

if you can't\nPlay your usual journalist games and dominate him and get away with re characterizing what he says looks like or thinks\nVanity Fair is just admitting either they're very very frustrated

big busy months in ah your highlighting manufacturing this month closes\nAdams writes for the last October as always manufacturing\nMine and here in Nebraska that's important you know we're a state the gross things we make things\nI think everybody probably knows agriculture is our number one industry here in the states but manufacturing second biggest industries about fourteen\nBillion dollar industry here in our state and uh it's got we have almost a couple of thousand companies that create nearly a hundred thousand jobs and growing in fact we've seen year over year that manufacturing jobs you it's four and a half percent\nAnd that's fantastic news 'cause he's a great jobs that help people support the family and it's a great companies like ... who here's Lincoln is manufacturing the cargo doors for Boeing triple seven acts\nIt's that companies that cloud in Omaha actually was\nDoing some tourists last week and went to a framer manufacturing in lion and make a variety of different a farm equipment uh we went to Brooklyn rather and ah he sings so you just have these companies all across the states are occurring job opportunities for our young people\nAnd it's one of the things that's helping his guards that you know for two years in a row now he's won the governor's come from the site selection magazine for most economic development projects per capita of any state in the country and it's been manufacturing company\nThat has helped us when there's a lot of manufacturing companies are making those investments\nAre you know we're also last week I tend to be

again it does show that within that national recognition and that helps us attract those manufacturing jobs like we've seen over the course of the last year so it's one of the things that we do is highlighting manufacturing month encourage young people to take a look at those\nCareers in manufacturing is a lot of high tech a lot of computers it's a you know not be as the old manufacturing plants might think him from his grandfather is\nHigh tech and computer rated and so that's one of the things we really want young people to know about is great careers take a look at it because he's got lots of job openings in our great career opportunities and the\nMood to me you correctly we have not only a current and trees growing but also\nA lot of new ones in the pipeline is well that's a yeah exactly we ... you know for example how we got a company called agar plastics\nTo do the first us expansion or Canadian companies into the first us expansion in Sydney and can considering the

thanks a lot James' appreciated and yes we had that a forum at temple Israel and we did talk about Israel Israel is\nOne of our great uh allies especially in the middle east and the countries that we have a lot of great relationships with\nAnd with regard to trade and it's funny that you should mention that because I was just on the phone today talking with the consul general in Chicago ... uh from Israel about uh several different issues one of which was a trade\nThat says they are actually doing a an egg trade exchange um later this week in Omaha are looking at such a huge issues such as a irrigation and so forth and\nThe consul general has expressed an interest by Israeli companies and investing in Nebraska helping create some jobs and\nThe number of different fields so we think there's a lot of opportunity to be able to expand that and in fact it was eight and Brad Pitt company W. R. reserve out of the things that was able to ship the first kosher beef Israel for the first time in about Thirteen Years a couple of years ago\nWe actually sent lieutenant governor over there to uh he's helped load up the beef and then he went over to help I welcome when arrive in Israel and my understanding is actually that's still the only company that his shipping coach will be from the United states over to Israel\nSo out there were because we were helping them as well so it's it's a great trading relationship we'd like to see that relationship get even bigger I think we've got great opportunities like our Nebraska beef here see look stand up on that but there's going to be other areas too\nHigh tech advanced manufacturing sorts of jobs that we can look to like get investment here in our state to help create so I'm looking forward to continue to work with Israel to be able to expand that relationship was a great ally and we want to\nWork on making that trade

central office for each district rather than our taxes happen to pay for a full superintendents multiple support for the\nI have well thanks a lot Brandon I appreciate that question on property taxes that is certainly the number one issue that people can talk to move out to a free pass a you know five years or so since I've been running and is one that I've made a focus for my minister ration every year I worked with a legislature to introduce legislation on property tax relief\nTo my first year we increase the property tax credit refund how would increase that fun by a over sixty percent and that's down for dollar tax relief from the states to haul property owners in the states if you look at your property taxes are saving you'll see that there's a lot of credit from the states that that property tax credit relief on\nFor four to four he's earned twelve forty six to Lincoln is drawn if you own your own with Governor the records\nAnd yeah and how can I Do a healthy say\nHey yes I was actually just calling figure out\nUm I Am a father of a couple of children are not custodial father and I'm trying to figure out why it is at\nHealth and human resources and the health for South for department at\nOver ... over backwards for the custodial pair\nBut that non custodial parents pretty much has no rights\nOr when it comes to finding out about\nWhat's going on with their shelter\nWill John I got to tell you I Am not an\nExpert in the difference between his studio parents and non custodial parents and what the respect of lights are\nBut why don't we do this why don't you call in to that number that I was I was given out before to David and we can connect you with the person in nature just\nTo kind of fair doubts this specific severe case and and see what's that sort of options might be available for you on that one and maybe get a another set of eyes looking at your case versus a some people may be looking at before so I don't want you to give out any specific here over the air but if you call into my office number and that number is four o two\nFour seven one\nTwo to four four four o two\nFour seven one to two for for a living with your uh you know your contact information and we will find the right person in a church has\nTo be able to connect with you and talking with a little bit about that there was planning to Silvio non custodial and what the you know direct patients and writes a failed should be for that and get more information 'cause I hate to tell you anything had as give you a bad information here on the air so if we could to handle that way I think that's probably the best way to just specific information is going to be threats\nOkay thank you very much for your call John and uh we're winds open right now if you'd like to give us a call with your question or comment\nPhone number is ... feet hundred eight to five five or six five four four to four he's doing twelve forty toll free across the grass to or if you happen to be your Lincoln or two for nine twelve forty we do have some winds open right now and your questions or comments\nOr the governor is welcome you had a um an announcement this morning about some new holiday\nWhere your license for livestock some updates on what's going on there yeah so obviously agriculture is our number one industry here in the states\nAnd one of the things we're looking doing my inspiration is cut the red tape\nAnd so we know that ah if ah somebody ... hauling livestock step that trucker out there and that gets pulled over or gets into an accident or some sort of emergency that the work on the farm to come to a grinding halt\nHow we also know that\nThose tractor trailers share the road with the rest of the public and so we've got to protect the public safety\nAnd so when we did is I asked our state patrol to sit down and work with various groups like we support ag but also recipe Adelman pork producers a Farm Bureau\nAnd see if we could come up with some standard operating procedures and some checklists\nSupport ag but also rescue ... pork producers a Farm Bureau\nAnd see if we could come up with some standard operating procedures checklist so that everybody would know how this is going to be handled going forward or if a trucker attracted a tractor trailer\nGot pulled over or had an accident or something\nAnd I had to livestock day to take care of so for example if a state truckers going down the road and maybe he's overweight or maybe passes hours and gets pulled over a he's not supposed to be driving for us and if he's got just dry goods and\nThat's one situation because those writers don't have to take care of\nBut if you've got animals so you've got a although the panels than the fact that the water if it's really hot out is going to create health hazards it's really cold out and create health houses and so we want to make sure that we're seeing thoughtful about how we're implementing those rules so that we can do it in ways that\nThose the livestock animals are being thought of as well\nAnd so that's really what it was about a state patrol working with actors to figure out what sort of a combination so we make to not only make sure we're keeping people safe on a highway and enforcing the law but also being mindful of the health of livestock so\nMaking some accommodations like if somebody you know to get pulled over and uh they couldn't drive anymore take 'em to 'em I say I'm a sale barn someplace that goes on\nWithin like thirty minutes rather than just to a way station because it's appropriate download cattle that a sale barn but not as a way station that kind of thing\nSo that's really what we're doing is working with agriculture reinforcing some of the things he's done already whereas you know we are\nPassing a law about covered farm vehicles to cut the red tape there so that farmers and ranchers to move with limited ... feels without having to have a CDL or we've worked with a ... D Fifteen president announced that last week which is very exciting\nOr we just got his approval from human CPA for\nThirty which will allow us to do a test with our state vehicles on\nThirty demonstrates mileage and maintenance and all that sort of thing and they can dispel some of them that's out there about ethanol and we've also um you know push back against waters to us and that's in power plant or John swing regulations on the Obama administration and now the Trump Administration has reverse so\nWe got involved in a lot of different areas that would help us farmers and ranchers is just another one of those areas will continue to\nWork with them to try and cut that red take\nOrders cool comes from Lyndon word genesis standing by some of them is doing it with your question for the governor [noise]\nWell we have\nSome blood going Dennis are you a are you there but yes I Am not a very good I'm here I'm afraid you got the same connection James got earlier than what I Want to go and ask a question and I'll I'll I'll get the answer and has put to find\nOut I was just a serious a master cells I certainly the or the ads are really play the farmer in on the fact that you that it's all about the the overhaul in a city or is it that it is that they do I follow\nOkay hey thanks Dennis I appreciate\nThat call into the question was if I couldn't hear over the feedback is a dentist was from India was asking you know who is actually filibustering these bills legislature\nAnd I don't want to give out of centers name off the top of my head because I don't want to be wrong I so I Can't remember specifically but I Will tell you just broadly speaking um that we do have centers who don't believe that we need to have to actually\nAh I've we've had some centers out there who was you know publicly stated that farmers don't pay enough adapt and so I'm either typically the ones a lot of times you will see it in Omaha Senator Lincoln center that is part of the syllabus her\nUm but it doesn't have to be universally somebody from Omaha Lincoln a busy weekend as we can look that up for you if you want to call into my office and I we can get you the centers names of who I was leaving those filibusters I just don't want to give it a gives misinformation out um but if you call for oh two four seven one two to four four\nFour oh to force him one\nTwo to four four we can look that up and and get to those names specifically but I I Do think it it really ... you know shows the challenge that we have in getting hackles on when we know we've got centers were going to pose any sort of tax relief bill\nAnd that means we have there could be filibustered which means we need to have a super majority of thirty three senators out of forty nine voting for that bill and that also means that we've got to have a broad coalition that we have to have both urban enroll centers\nVoting for that bill to get it to my desk and that's part of the challenge that we have to be able to get those bills liking science\nSo ... but if you call in Dennis again the four o two four seven one two to four four will look up a specific names of the centers who are part of that the filibuster half of those tax bills I just don't want to make a mistake and somebody somebody didn't do so\nThanks for calling him do appreciate All right and our next caller comes from ... Scott is standing by on the line and it's got your own as the governor\nGovernor Rick Scott how are you know the oil and I'm Sorry to hear that or if your son had the incident period\nLike thank you appreciate that is that um I Am calling about the firefighters tax credits and um I'd ask our state senator Matt Williams to go in and try to get that simplified and also a add some flexibility too because right now\nIn order to get two hundred and fifty dollar tax credits there's a piece of paper that has to go from the fire department to the city\nTo the state and it happened to get to the states by February fifteenth every year for it\nOr the people don't qualify which means that there's three different levels of people involved in making\nThe tax credit available to the individual firefighters which is unfair to the firefighters if they don't get it because it gets interrupted or somewhere along that process all so there's no flexibility in the current law\nThat allows you to go back and collect things or is that they don't get their own time\nOnce it set fifteenth February deadline passes\nOr you're out of it you just do not get it if ah the ... did not get their ... whatever reason are so I'm working for them to add flexibility to death\nOr even be able to make it retroactive put those departments who did not get paid for in a long time for whatever reason or in your previous here and also make it that really are the requirements to qualify for that two hundred and fifty dollar tax credits\nAre very cumbersome for volunteer departments to try to crack all the information that's required by that think they need to simplify it also All right hey well Scott\nA and actually if you look at what happened last year we were able to increase beef or exports from just a breast cancer there's just a rescue numbers a thief to Japan by twenty six percent\nIn Port from a raspy going to Japan by forty six percent how we've also been in New York's without your brass can be specifically how and so that's one of the things we do we think we can go out there and really sell our products and specifically\nA complement to rescue the form of agriculture because if you go back to two thousand five or ... beef up about five percent of all exports and today it makes up nearly twenty percent of all exports of USC\nSo we are definitely getting bigger market share because we do have the best pieces so\nI'm thinking I've really reference she had to talk to the federal delegation about the details about as a country of origin labeling because I'm again is a federal issue and I'm not an expert on it but one of the things we can do here at the state is make sure we're out there promoting our products we both domestically and internationally we've got programs department of agriculture to be able to do that\nBecause I agree with you it's a competitive advantage for us for people to know that there'll be came from Nebraska\nI think there's a place that was the ... I mean we're kind of have to start from scratch because\nYou don't ... I did have the things that you the\nList is is that you are doing\nMore or less you know but uh\nIt it was thin like we could\nWe could get that ... law whatever path\nAnd a bit since we're big deal you know but\nWe're not forcing it on a ... a Dana five\nFamilies that are just like the car off he cannot afford it\nThen the ... what's the for\nHas been a rabbit for several years and they they haven't have\nYou on a cell phone and they said\nA catalog and as I said you can stay in the ... behind that I don't live\nIn the end of the policy that says something\nAbout you know a\nA battle for the call it's a very good but I Know they do it and he's with cars is sometimes\nYeah well he said you're I I recommend talking to somebody that federal delegation\nTo get more details about the history of of that country working laboring 'cause I could get into since it's not the issue I didn't I I'm not an expert on so that that's where I'd I'd start by talking to either Adrian Smith are dead fish or something like that who who are probably more update on what the current status of that is\nYou know if you could give me a a draft or ... or two in the higher echelons of the cause is if it was\nThe first desert I I just feel like I was out has gotten so I don't know what needs to be best that I Need help sure absolutely okay calling to my office and we'll get to a some options on people you can call for that\nMy office is for oh two\nFour seven one\nTo two for for\nAs for oh two four seven one two to four four and we'll look or wants to be connected to the federal delegation but maybe we can dig up somebody USDA who can talk about this as well\nBut I mean the battle in her high\nIf you're a thing called jury that makes my journey thinks it's on it we have lines open right now if you'd like Saul news as governor of the richest either with requests to comment on some ... shoot he's looking through these two five five or six five is a\nPhone number of them for free anywhere in the state of Nebraska eight hundred feet to farm five or six five\nOr if you have to be calling from Lincoln area for two forty million twelve forty four to four years now and we'll forty we have about ten minutes left to the program so please do not\nWait until the last few minutes because we can only answer one question was a time and we do have a time when the governor yesterday's Lincoln journal store here than article about a ... a former stadium for you you might want to show some light on that because well\nSure I Am first of all I was just a sense of loss of your not your family and I think we had a caller who called in and says that you know she wanted to respond back to the article and paper about it because there was an article about some of the culture there and health and Human Services\nHands out first of all I Want to compliment quitting Philips who's our outgoing CEO for health and Human Services\nOr she came in and said transformative leaders are really look at how we could change the culture\nAnd a chance to be a you know and the organization as providing a better customer service is more effective more efficient and that she is taking a job or basically doing what she did for us now down in Texas is if you have to to help a big organization a lot more people and to wish her well she did a fantastic job for us\nAnd there were some people that were complaining about the culture but I also point out there or you know over four thousand quickly if I'm over forty five hundred a of our teammates and health and Human Services are doing a fantastic job everyday basis\nYou know over four thousand closely five over forty five hundred a of our teammates and health and Human Services are doing a fantastic job every day taking care of the people that were supposed to take care of you know helping to brass cause was alive\nBecause our whole model there with regard to what we're trying to accomplish this health and Human Services and I think that most folks with a new members who\nWe actually have a places where we weren't doing your job\nOr you know for example I mean of of go back to when I first took over in excess of ... this is the eight hundred numbers of people apply to for economic assistance things like food stamps\nIt was a fake news twenty four minutes to answer the phone and August twenty fourteen\nAnd we were so bad as it is that the federal government was going to penalize the Seventeen million dollars so that Seventeen million dollars a we would have had to make up\nA from our our state general fund dollars are taxpayer dollars from the brass to to to fill that hole and we went to work looking at how we can do a better job we were able to set a goal five minutes or less than that phone line with that goal within thirty of last month\nOf reaching out to all five minutes or less got one of the highest accuracy rate now in the country was those of us that I like to see race\nWas just doing a fantastic job of getting that done now\nAnd uh also Medicaid or on the fly into doing a great job and in fact some point we've actually receive bonuses now from the federal government with regard to how we are performing in health and Human Services so you can see a dramatic turnaround from being penalize Seventeen million dollars to getting out of you know the bonuses that we can invest in that system for\nSo that's an example of how we've done a better job that you can see that the Belmont disability\nWe offered his main services last year or the family just as ... as the previous five years come by and I mentioned already that or how he's shortly application but\nGetting back to the families much quicker and behavioral health has implemented our system of care to put an eight hundred number there so people get access to those no professional or whether they are in the states right away\nWith the ideas that we're going to keep kids in their homes and keep them in their school how we use the number of cases and that really intense and like in patients uh season\nRestricted treatment from some point one percent a six\nPoint seven percent that helps to save money to reinvest in the system how we served over six hundred kids were about six in his system of care keeping you know a lot of public two thirds of them will be able to keep them in a home\nIn our children and family services we reduce the number of kids who are or were pulling out of the home by about ten percent and five hundred and forty four fewer kids are system that we pulled out of your home town of San Francisco to say that we\nAh we've done a better job and your license and like I was talking about earlier about cutting down the time it takes a nursing license and public health\nHow we've gone to a Medicaid managed care model to help the health outcomes\nIn that case with our folks from anything most people get all these areas that we've done we've made improvements to how we're sort of people that were doing was creating a culture of accountability and excellence and measuring ourselves we're setting goals and we're reaching those and uh you know I think there are people who didn't want to be a part of that is at\nA you know that accountability wasn't part of what they see in the past so they moved on when we asked them to move on because it was going to be a part of directions and taking it before we were going to be a high performing organizations\nAnd um that's what we're going to do is try to make sure we're always looking to do a better job we can always going to be opportunities for us to improve and we're going to look for a those opportunities that we really got an organization that is\nUm you know doing a better job serving our customers the people in your health for business plan is to get everybody on board with what's going to be and I'm very positive words according so since he was not\nTime for a couple more calls and so we're going to be real good so you know and Rudy to farm five or six five is the phone number anywhere across that were instituted free\nFor for ... to ... forty and Lincoln or next caller is Lewis who's on the line who nor Fort Lewis doing with the governor\nGovernor how are you know pretty good Louis how are you today\nJust another day in paradise governor just another day in paradise well you're living in our parks and no
