you\nSaid I had to tell you that that like we had a connection um but what I Want to say the I heard you say last week you know there's\nTwo weeks to the lead time\nLet's see what happens and here we go I mean I'm not saying couldn't happen at somebody didn't put those bombs out but the chances of finding put out for it yesterday nine ... and I don't even know if they found any evidence yet but we'll see who they actually\nPlan for this but I really don't trust the people at all and it just so well do anything to gain power back in ... so\nIt just disgusting lots to be honest\nI only I Am so I I'm I'm I'm happy to hear you say that with events like this happen I always wonder what the\nAh reaction is going to be from people who are actively engaged in in these events each and every day and informed about them and the reaction gives me a gives me great solace and comfort because your reaction is pure commonsense\nIf somebody really wanted to hurt somebody with a bomb there's ways to

was it nails was it a shot when we don't we don't know any of this yet none of these bombs would have been capable of taking out a building they were not big enough to be\nBombs and just structural damage if they went off they could have killed some people are given their size so but none of them did go off and they were discovered a mostly and distribution centers\nBy the by the post office and I'll tell you what\nIf this is real\nWhoever did this is going to be named by the end of the week and we're going to know who it is I agree if it's if it's really at\nThis point I felt this trucking and people I wouldn't put it past and they pay somebody off I really do distressing and the Democrats um\nSo anyway we have a lot of like ten days the recipe what else they put out there next\nWell exactly exactly and this is why I was telling people back in June and July of polls here really don't matter a hill of beans I think however the polls now do\nNot so much in accurately without any doubt predicting winter but the polls today can be highly influential\nAnd decisions and action taken by political people\nNow I just I I Love Tonya thank you very much for uh for calling\nA ... and again for mentioning Bob Ford it really is one of the finest dies anybody could ever meet [noise]\nI look at the psychology\nOf people and I'm not a trained psychologist\nBut I Am fairly\nExperienced here at analyzing predicting understanding the left\nAnd I know their mind set on many things one of their mindset on power is that it's there's that that they are entitled to it and whatever it is denied them by way of elections they really really resented and they resent the people who made it happened which are the voters\nSo today's American Left as angry as it can be at people who voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him and compounding hatred when those people will not abandon him the left is making every\nEvery effort it can to distance Trump voters from Trump\nThey've tried everything they know how to use to damage Trump to force him out of office than force Kavanaugh out of the nomination to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of it's worked the degree of frustration they are feeling is something you and I cannot relate to\nWe can try but the degree of frustration they're feeling and having lost that election in two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory\nAnd subsequently everything they've had the most powerful influential people in their movement all coordinated working together to destroy Donald Trump\nAnd it's been like you know spit balls at a at a at a battleship they haven't Denton Trump I cannot tell you\nHow frustrated they are it is easy for them to take out Republicans when ever they want they are able to do it and if not take them out damage them tremendously\nBut they haven't been able to even score on Trump salt\nThey began this movement\nOf promoting\nThe media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fact they and they created a whole cloth something that does not exist a national attitude of hatred for Donald Trump\nThey simply took their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes and they began reporting the news that way\nEverybody hates Trump but now that they've seen trombone action they hate him to despising they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became a narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led\nAnd him to despising they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became the narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them to hyping this blue wave\nThat it was the only commonsense view and a half now that now that people have seen trumping action I've seen is bad manners\nThey've seen whatever is about in the left have now everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every Democrat was going to win it because why everybody have a trumpet everybody hated themselves were voting for him well\nIt isn't coming to pass the blue way if\nThey said the existed maybe never has\nThe blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now we're learning much of that was made up much of that with soap operas scripted media narrative\nNow we're getting down to the nitty gritty now or two weeks away from the election and there isn't a blue wave or Republicans look like they're going to gain seats in the Senate even in Democrat Paul's and the blue wave in the house it's looking iffy iffy and now with Republican turnout\nDwarfing democratic turnout in early voting early voting is where the Democrats get to run their frogs schemes folks early voting Israeli illegals vote in the dead and vote and all these other things that's purposely set up and the Republicans\nWhy it appears there are more sophisticated than Democrats ever considered the Republicans are not letting the

certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual\nRisks for pollsters ...\nThe mainstream media does this every election cycle\nWhere it was all this down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's gotta be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge\nAnd guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it\nIt's a good reminder that even mid October surveys can miss late change the story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again it probably won't don't worry about it Bloomberg's but it did Clinton in ... and it could go either direction Democrats can still win big or they could lose ... what what is old isn't decision all of a sudden\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires\nAnd these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats the step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as weak and then ... there's a translation for this in addition to what he's saying here you Democrats have got to stop\nOpposing Trump just to oppose Trump's so here's a caravan here's a mob of people\nThat are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we've we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and pay for this if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ... folks\nA lot of people in our size have jumped say George Soros yeah maybe\nBut if Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying is Venezuela if it's Venezuela it's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates in let those people and for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively half say they were in favor of it\nThey are that demands it what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore Avon lady is saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security that's doesn't help us a mob of seven thousand ten thousand people starving engaged demanding to be let in that doesn't help us\nWhatever not say all this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickle kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\nMy point is [laughter] none of this\nThe way it was planned no blue wave I ... don't misunderstand I don't know what's can I'm not saying that the Democrats may not win the house but I\nI don't think they're going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it\n'cause I never fall for left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary groups think narrative of the moment whatever it is\nBut it's more than that there is nothing happening in America right now the argues electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass\nThere's no reason to vote Democrats and even giving people reasons to vote for the ball they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's a boy he tweet she's a bad guy is whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice and the Susan Collins all these monsters nothing the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one I Believe are decent society is under siege everyday are decent society\nStandard good old normalcy is under assault everyday led\nBy pop culture and leftist in Hollywood in Silicon valley and the drive by media we're under assault every day but they have not overturned that yet they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal\nThere's just nothing out there\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats\nBecause the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republican\nUh I just I don't see it\nWe'll find out if my instincts are off the charts you're not in less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters\nNot in less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip this scenario
