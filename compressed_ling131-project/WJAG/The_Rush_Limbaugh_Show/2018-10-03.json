don't believe he's minding your own business one day in a letter from a constituency who said I don't want to be known I don't want to be named and I don't want this taken any further\nIt just it just it doesn't make any sense\nUnless\nYou put it in the proper context of what the express purpose of this is which I happen to believe is forcing Kavanaugh to resign to withdraw or for Trump to withdraw from I think it was beginning to unravel\nBecause Trump and Kevin all have hung in\nAnd buy unravel I mean be exposed\nFor the phone is that much of it is any weight\nSuzie I'm Glad you called thank you thank you very much Miami, Florida next Robert your great to have you\nHey Russia was from a lifelong will soon I've been listening to you for Thirty years [noise]\nUm I just want to thank you for everything you do for the country and especially your leukemia and lymphoma found that you do once a year which the fantastic it I mean a lot to me thank you sir [noise] my question is what's what do you think is going on with the mother pro because it ... if you\nDon't well now that's an interesting question what's going on with the mother probably here's the latest I heard of the ... the the story actually has a sentence in it\nThe special counsel's office of Robert Mueller to third us choir most in\nMost most honest man I don't know what it is shedding prosecutors\nShedding per se that when your cat or dog sheds that means they're losing hair a mother is losing prosecutors\nMeaning their their their ... the\nJobs all those ... they're going to run their their their moving away and going off to other things\nThere's less and less for his team of Trump haters\nTo what to do I've just repeat what I said at the very opening in the program\nI don't think this tax story would have run today\nIf Mueller we're still hot on the trail and had something and if the Ford story weren't beginning to unravel the New York times story wouldn't have when I saw\nOn drudge this massive New York times for my first reaction is remember folks I Am a student of the media and the left\nAnd nothing happens by accident the times didn't just finished the story\nBy deadline last night there by making it able to be published they'd been holding it\nThey've been working on it for a year they've been coordinating with the Showtime network they've been producing a documentary for the past year documenting how the times found it\nHow they reported it how they prompted how they wrote it the fact that this thing was released and published last night for today\nFirst reaction I had was Kavanaugh thing must really be unraveling 'cause it's time now to turn attention to Trump from a new angle and it's not really new its taxes the latest\nNews correct me on this Mr ... if you've seen something more\nRecent but the last story I saw on this is Muller\nI don't know what to believe in if that Muller is showing various people Roger Stone emails texts and asking them what they know about\nIt we're down now to Roger Stone\nIn an investigation that started with everybody thinking Trump cheated with Russia\nAnd Muller was the guy that was going to find it and when we got Trump's tax returns we were going to see\nThat it's important\nThat enabled Trump to hold onto his money and get more of it Trump's wealth is directly tied to illicit activity with Russia while there isn't any Russian anything in the New York times story\nSo [noise] um [noise]\nWe're getting down to the nitty gritty I'd done you know ethics say that a special counsel should not right and release a report within this close proximity to an election\nI'll be cause of the impact that it would have and they of course are ah unbiased end of the only objective in the Justice Department and they're not about affecting the outcome of elections I which is all they've been trying to do it for two years\nI wouldn't be surprised if they released a report you know a couple of days before the election which excoriated Trump for irresponsibility excoriated for a bad attitude excoriated for having a really really shady friends and all that but does it accused him of any\nIf it's not supposed to happen before the election that's when it probably will happen\nIs the way these people operate but but maybe it won't\nOutside of that I'm like everybody else I don't know what Mueller has I don't know what he's going to be a lot of the what he's going to report 'em ... zero not at all I Know is\nThat the drive by media decided to try to make something else a bigger story today than the Kavanaugh story\nRush Limbaugh going the way on the net where you are listening to rush on news tone [noise]\nGood news you are not stuck with your health care plan really you have a choice and it's a
