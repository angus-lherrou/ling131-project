Grassley Grassley\nSaid hey there's nothing new in this everything in this we knew which was eminently predictable\nThey still haven't the FBI was unable to corroborate anything any of the witnesses upset folks\nAny of the allegations that witnesses have may they haven't been able to corroborate walls he forged testimony\nThey weren't able to corroborate Ramirez they weren't able to corroborate\nA sweat like they weren't able to corroborate that this is now the seven FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh\nThe left is out there but they didn't talk to Dr Ford trunk and Kevin ... that's right that's that's not part of the deal they testified under oath\nWhat more can the FBI or do you think the FBI really thinks these people don't change their stories from what they've testified under oath\nBesides that Dr forge testimony changed any way in terms of the timeline of the reason the FBI didn't talk to Ford or Kevin always 'cause they've talked to cap it off or how many times over the years\nUm but they testified under oath and so the the thing is no reason to talk to them and go out and talk to people they claim can corroborate what they're saying the FBI couldn't find any\nSo I'm watching CNN too they've got CNN and Fox on it and here and it was probably ten minutes ten minutes for the program started and I began\nTo um\nGet the impression that the Democrats think they lost it gets a little CNN report it only looks a little to me he was describing Jeff Flake\nJeff Flake said this is very thorough this is this ... this investigation is very very satisfying to me and the CNN reporter said Jeff Flake today actually\nSounded like a Republican and that presents a problem\nJeff Flake it sounded like a Republican they last friday he sounded like a Democrat but today he sounded like a Republican and they went to Susan Collins Susan Collins says hey you know I look at this I'm very satisfied this was a very thorough report and investigation\nNow here is the payoff NPR without they pulled it themselves and they found that exactly what I had been saying has come to pass the capital hearings are backfiring big time on the Democrats\nAnd NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll out today found a big swing in public opinion among men following the hearing with at ten point increase in those saying they plan to support a Republican candidate in the upcoming midterm election right now\nI'm so this this is happening and they only primary changer difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and the and the ... reaction to it\nI've even seen stories today among the never Trump or conservatives that this whole thing may actually re unite\nThe conservative ... well we will ah will see about that but\nClearly there is a reaction is and and it's it's it's it's route\nThis is so easily understood it is\nThe worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives many people you know even as Lindsey Graham found out the other day there are a lot of people a day that they have no idea that Hillary Clinton ran an operation to destroy women who surfaced\nSaying that her husband Bill Clinton had abused them or rent them or mistreated them or what have you Lindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park and he got booed because the millennials in the crowd had no idea that that's who Hillary Clinton was\nThe same token those people will not live to Robert Bork and many of them are not old enough to remember what happened to Clarence Thomas Anita Hill so this is their first\nAnd\nThat means it is the worst smear campaign ever that they've seen just anyone be smeared more than anybody be smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared we think that it can't get worse but the left will always make it worse\nKavanaugh has been smeared\nUnlike anybody since Clarence Thomas\nBut he's been vindicated to he's been vindicated by fact he's been vindicated by evidence he'd been vindicated by witness cooperation seven different FBI investigations he is vindicated by a life well lived\nWhen you boil all this now and I think it's going to be really hard for any Republican vote against the guy\nBut I wouldn't be surprised if some Democrats\nSenate Democrats\nAre privately behind the scenes are urging Rick House Republicans are go ahead and vote for capital as a way this is backfiring on them\n\nDon't know that it's a wild guess and only time will tell when we get to the vote but\nThe FBI investigation that the Democrats want it appears to have provided cover\nFor both Susan Collins and Jeff Flake we don't know where Murkowski is on any of this of course there's the red state Democrats senators that now have a a big decision to make so well

JAG [noise]\n\n\nAn NPR reporter uh just [noise] just treated that Senate Judiciary committee Democrats are firing outage Chuck Schumer his office stone faced\nThe meaning is they're coming out then they they're depressed or there are no expressions on their faces they're not happy in a stone faced their shell shock there or something\nOr other now\nDid the Democrats on that committee actually believe Christine Ford did they really believe what she was saying\nTo I don't know how anybody could\nHonestly folks that went\nOut and I I'm not even being part is when I say this she can't remember where when why the people she says we're there weren't there and yet these Democrats all boy first did the Democrats and that can be really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days\nWas going to somehow produced corroborating evidence that would wipe out the cabinet nominations\nThey really thought that because my my thinking all along has been they've known that this nothing other than the way this is all this has managed to all they've got if they really fought\nThis FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations in countless other interviews and written questions having produced well that is shocking to honest to God I Know I Know I'm I'm sometimes naive but I fought this has been a scam\nFrom the get go and that they're all in on the scam\nAnd that the gamble was delay hence the late release of of of Dr Ford's letter\nDetailing all of this so they work out a Schumer's office and they're all stone faced maybe they thought that they had flake and maybe they thought they were going to get Collins Collins inflate of come out and what they have said so far remembered the votes not going to be the Saturday now so\nSasse said last night on the Senate\nFloor we all know that the president cannot lead us through this time\nWe know that his disposition only unable to restrain his impulse to divide\nHis mockery of Dr Ford last night in Mississippi was wrong\nBut it doesn't really surprise anyone who is\nMr ... senator Sasse I have an alternative view and are not going to presume that you are listening but maybe somebody who knows you\nIs I Need you to consider something senators ask you\nAnd numerous other say that President Trump mock Dr Ford in his rally south haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggested that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism against\nThat he is doing this is who he is he can't help\nMr Sassaman I guess the other way around I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump has a behavioral patterns strategically happens it's called pacing and when he briefly explaining it began in setting up what's to come next\nWhen President Trump originally spoke about Dr Ford why did he say compelling testimony reinventing he couldn't turn away from it\nIf she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's gone he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's ally then his death need to go on Trump's and all of this and everybody's a wow this is really unusual for\n... no it's not unusual\nTrump gets himself on record not every time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approved Washington establishment way and every time he does it\nDo not some of you panic or maybe you don't have any more but when he first started doing this light Paris climate accord yeah yeah there may be something here we're going to look at it they don't always going to vote no doesn't matter\nYou can remember countless times where the president's initial statement on an issue as seem to dump detail with what the swamp things\nBut then a few days or are we go by him\nAnd the president becomes really is and he starts speaking out against it after he's put himself on the record he does this for credibility and he does is it something called pacing\nAnd it relaxes the opposition\nIn any number of ways she's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford he knew right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove\nAnd what he did on Monday Night was not mock her\n\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEverybody because of what Trump dead at that rally everybody was forced to look and listen to that little riff on Dr forge shaky uncorroborated I'm provable testimony to drive by us we're never gonna\nTell the truth about Dr Ford the dry buys\nOr the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally\nBut because he said what he said about her he forced the drive biased to cover what he said\nIn the process the drive buys reported what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving me the vapors given the favorite who am I got Trump is always uses horrible because it is in your main he's not fitted\nWhat Donald Trump did recounting the absurd inconsistencies in her testimony\nDonald Trump calling her out on everything has been play now on all media when all day yesterday\n\nReporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday\n\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr forge testimony the drive by media did not report on on the none of the cooperation being possible they did not tell their audience is\nThat the foreign people foreign place in the room when her incident happened claim they weren't there nobody knew that folks other than you\nBut people don't watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr Ford couldn't backup ... she was saying\nThe people that watch the mainstream media had no idea that the foreign witnesses Ford claims were there all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of our good friends Dr buys were not reporting any of that to Dr ... reporting what the Democrats senators I\nBelieve her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned the woman was telling the truth the head back up she had cooperation and capital\nWas guilty so Trump goes out\nTells the truth about her she doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't she got home she\nGets it on the record to drive by half to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard it look at it this way thinking for the millions of people who had never heard the truth\nAbout Dr Christine's Ford and her full of holes testimony think of a million just never heard it until Trump went\nOut and characterize that for everybody think of it this way think of the thousands of voters in Missouri in Arizona\nIn Michigan and Maine and West Virginia North Dakota Alaska who now know the truth who never would've known the truth had Trump not\n\nDetail that for people in his rally\nCollins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski they knew\nThat there was no collaboration they knew that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses this is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does\nIf we had an honest mediate millions of people would already know that Dr Ford story doesn't add up\nIf the media ever told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protest today are not nearly as large envelope in voluminous\nThe people these protests since she's telling the God's truth they think it's gospel\nThey don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told them the Democrats senators haven't told them only Trump did another reason why they hate him\nBut we don't have an honest meaty and sold millions of people had no idea of all the holes in the Christine balls the foreign story\nNow they do and here's a little cherry on top since Trump did that\nAnd the whole media reported on it and Democrats senators and the like we're asked about it what comes three days later today's f._b._i. report saying no corroboration for what Dr Ford said\nSo Trump said that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another never Trump or his goal literally insane but if Trump had in the Senate and nobody would know at the Trump did say it millions now do know and here comes the cherry on the top the FBI report we couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right\nDrive by media wrong Democrats senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally it's not like he's lucky and stumbled into this stuff this is Trump strategy and it's all related to the pacing\nOf how he originally or initially

do that is not the\nQuestion the question is what are the Democrats are going to do if Kavanaugh is confirmed that's what I think maybe the bigger question and in the interest of discovering this what's going to the audio soundbites\nWe have a group of protesters occupying senator Collins Susan Collins of Maine office and during the protests one of the protesting women made some remarks\nSaying\nWhy man without the fans here\n\nLast night I got an a train that anymore and they asked him I mean I I heard your hair are finding the story but you know and then you turn a blind eye Lindy Lindy is your story\nWe're not really I mean you\nHear me vote no on the confirmation\nThat I don't know how they intended to use it I I still think this like a lot of people agree with you that this woman has gotten away and not been thoroughly investigated she got away with an anonymous letter\nThat she didn't want made public suppose it does anybody really believe that either does this woman act irritated that she's been made to go public with this she doesn't add irritated about that to me and she wants to be helpful while she's terrified I I I just I I\nI think in this climate they tell you the truth out their pets\nTo try to poke holes in her story and just sixteen if the Republicans had succeeded in exposing her as a liar I think the Democrats were the last\n\nI yeah I think they would have gone Betty\nAsks the Republicans not at her I think they wouldn't cues the Republicans brow beating her and making her said different things because they're all on record as having said they believed her before they even matter before they even talk to her they said they believed or in fact I don't even know why\nThe Democrats need to see the FBI report because they said they believe her from the get though\n\nThey're not even open to the possibility that she's telling a story that cannot be corroborate and haven't been this is\nLewis in Los Angeles is we ah stay with the phones Hi Louis great to have you here hello\nHey how're you doing roast is my first year left and then I started lifting you Sean Hannity everybody and\nI just thank you for for for basically Yellen would I Want to go out loud all the time you know you guys stay and I'm thinking in and my first year or I've never really been into politics I never really cared a in a sense of you know it just kind of like a they're going to vote whatever but this was really bad this was\nSomething that that changed that family that a lot of sun we got we got a big family and and it was like how can you just try and Roy someone\nWith no kind of cooperation no kind of\nProof no kind of and then Trump said yesterday and I'll say like this\nHe basically yelled out what I said it was like every day she was saying but I don't know what I don't know I don't know I don't know so it was like well what happened\nWhat written down that's going on here you're you're you're saying these allegations but you don't know certain things that are very important like who took your home they should have been traumatized before you know if something like that happen you would have been like a mafia near a big call somebody get to them or\nSomething so it just after that\nJust like I got to vote I got to vote for rights I got to vote for ... for or just got our values in this country which are being\nReally this this has awakened us that much\nYes yes that that you know not that not that women can't believe that but both men and women can lie to say that this order certain nobody can can rely on women can't\nNo no you said earlier wait ... years you nailed what this is about earlier you correctly identified that the United States Senate\nWas attempting to destroy this guy you didn't know who he was some pilot cold but you saw a guy trying to be destroyed his wife his career his future destroyed and nobody had any corroborating evidence for all of this was gonna destroy him that's what got you in here\nAnd and I I mean like the gentleman before I went on to other people to talk my wife we watched it was like wait a minute like you're not add up I'm Sorry when you're looking for and if it was like look you know something else if it wasn't you know what I mean it just didn't add up\nAround here we have Lewis thank you thank for the call we've got other anecdotal stories but it dovetails with what we're seeing in the polling data we're seeing the generic ballot advantages Democrats\nOr had now gone in the latest Maris NPR poll and a twelve point advantages now two points which is statistically tied that's the margin of error or in in all these other generic ballot Paul's which I think er\nI don't think the Republicans have ever labs in one of the news and the Republicans when Congress on time\nSo since Nineteen Ninety four anyway\nYou people realize when the Republicans want to Ninety four was the first time in forty years that they ran or control the house since then they've lost control and won control back but I Can't I don't think there's ever been a generic ballot poll ever\nThat shows the Republicans I had I could be wrong I doubt it I don't recall ever having seen one\nBut now we're seeing voter enthusiasm shifts\nTo the Republicans and Democrats are are losing some and believe me if this all his real at this polling data is accurate if it's the same stuff that Democrats are saying it's affecting them then there's this from the Atlantic now the Atlantic is a left wing publication as is most us medium\nThe headline but this story conservative women are angry about cabin on and they think other voters aren't to\nHere's a poll quote in the two weeks since the claims against capital of first emerged many feminist groups have called on\nSenators and the American public to believe women who come forward with allegations Kamala Harris the progressive Democrats senator from California captured the settlement when she questioned for during the hearing I Believe you and I believe many Americans across the country believe\nYou but the writer of this story whose name is Anna Greene said the women\nI interviewed however resented the notion that people's accusation who's should be believed on the basis of their identity alone this makes me furious because I think that's taking advantage for the worst purposes of something that's real in our culture a woman said\nWomen are not a monolithic block most of us are not going to take to the streets with pitchforks and torches that said there was a large large percentage of us who feel very very strongly about the way this process has played out conservative women are angry about Kavanaugh they think other voters are too\nConservative women living suburbs [noise]\nThe reason I ask that is because the Democrats claimed to have a hold on college educated suburban\nWomen well they may be losing that hold too if some of this polling data\nIs correct let me just say this if everything were just and it isn't and I know it but if\nEverything were saying\nThe Democrats would be destroying themselves right now as they did back in two thousand two when they did the ...\nThe Democrat Party\nIs in a same world the Democrat Party is engaging in self immolation right now with the treatment of Kavanaugh\nThe backing of a woman who's\nGot no evidence hasn't had a you have a corroborated and thanks to Donald Trump now more Americans than ever know the truth of her story\nAnd the truth of her story is that it's for the whole\nIf Trump Heather went on his ranch gone on his rant on Monday Night the drive by would've never reported that because they had not reported it\n\nThe Democrats are not the majority they did not win the Senate if they win the house the advice and consent role does not give them the right to determine who goes on the court and who doesn't that's for the winters\nBut the the behavior the Democrats have engaged in here the public political murder\nOf a highly achieved brilliant guy\nWho never did anything that anybody anywhere near the way he's been described\n\nPeople bringing forth B. S. allegations like this wouldn't be as flies in and there's no evidence to back it up\nIn a same world would be paying a price so so high they wouldn't\nEven engage in this kind of behavior but the Democrats think they speak for a majority of Americans because they have in the media on their side and they think\n\nThat they have succeeded in making the majority of Americans hate wake Kavanaugh and hates conservatives and Republicans\nAs a as well\nWhen we don't live in a say in the world\nYou know we don't live at the same country right now but uh it's still possible for the Democrats to pay a huge huge price for this given the standard time tested American moral code\nAnd are sent and set of values the Democrats\nShould be halfway finished with their self destruction\nIn the middle of this\nI take a break we'll be back in a minute don't go\nWhen he was simply really on the E R B word newly arrived on news going [noise]\nHave you been dreaming of that new kitchen bathroom or home edition but not sure how you can afford it on here with Gabby Maldonado one newsmakers she's cofounder of American financing\nI'm On and pay over a hundred dollars to have this done now in color it when it's convenient for me and it takes less than an hour people compliment me on how great my collar is in my hair is incredibly saw in healthy looking\nExperience beautiful multi dimensional ammonia free salon quality color for under twenty five dollars and joined the hundreds of thousands of women who have tried and loved Madison Reid\nFind your perfect shape at Madison dash free dot com and get ten percent off plus free shipping on your first caller use code Trump that's code Trump try it love it that's the beauty of Madison read\nI'm chip floria ... after the bell per week days here on a on seven eighty and won all five point nine FM W.
