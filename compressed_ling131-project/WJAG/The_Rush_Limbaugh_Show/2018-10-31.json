and do we barely had time to work very hard time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terrorist threats in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they had the Muslim ban there is no white guy band\nWell there you have it on my friends' there's there is Don Lemon um we need a white guy ban to go along with the travel ban and the Muslim ban because the biggest terror threat in this country right now is white men\nIgnores all of the people of color or protest marches antifa who inflict damage and harm on people of course the black lives matter\nThat you see a\nInteresting about this are noteworthy about it is this is what is really thought of non lemons not alone here he just happened to be the guy that set it but that happens to be\nThe driving impetus behind much of extreme liberalism they certainly that is what's driving militant feminism angry women they think white men of the problem\nDon like the followers of black lives\nAren't Republicans in that group\nLooking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matters of orders and look at how many of those cops murders have been candid\nAnd explained away\nIn the sense well they're cops and they missed reading their racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me the Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shot up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound to people\nThe school is almost did die it's amazing these people that way they talk and the things they conveniently forget\nOr don't even register maybe in the first place [noise]\nFive cops in Dallas to thousands sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or they Republicans\nNope many of them are very loyal Democrat voting bloc\nMuslim Americans in fact maybe and even more reliable Democrats vote than black voters\nAccording to Forbes magazine of the three thousand three hundred and forty two people killed by terrorists in the U.S between Nineteen Ninety two in two thousand Seventeen Islamic terrorists are responsible for Ninety two percent of those murders and yet Don Lemon on CNN says the problem\nWe need a white\nMen than there is no white guy ban\nBusy no one was ever blame the left no one must ever blame the news media ... all one must ever blame the rest of the Democrat Party for any of the attacks\nDone by their rabbits like Occupy Wall street like black lives matter like ...\nIt isn't

David Rodham Gergen last night on CNN\nAnderson Cooper three sixty of the program a question the Senate got killer was motivated by anti Semitism but also this obsession on the caravan in the invaders echoing language the president himself use it doesn't seem like the president stepped back from that if anything of presidents pushing the gas pedal down further\nWhat is not mentioned here at the synagogue should have at Trump\nConsidered Trump a sellout precisely because he has a daughter that converted to Judaism that's not mentioned no Trump is ratcheting down he's he's had been pedaled through the metal and here's the opinion of David ...\nWe ought to go back and think about you know how Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma say I'm Nineteen Ninety five and ... he doesn't go after the terrorists he doesn't sort of make a you know beat the drums\nOr to go out and stop the terrorists all around the country and tried to heal and there was a turning point as president say he was embattled when he went to Oklahoma City that turns his presidency around the very positive direction\nThis is how history revision has works there David Ronald Reagan's saying Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma City in Nineteen Ninety five and he ... he didn't go after the terrorists he didn't sort of America you know beat the drums to go out and start the terrorists\nWell\nLet's go back and listen to what Gergen thanks was Bill Clinton's finest moment April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety five in Minneapolis\nWe hear so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up an upset with each other they spread hey\nThey leave the impression that by their very words that violence is acceptable\nYou oughta see I'm sure you are now seeing the reports are some things that are regularly said over the airwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech\nAirwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech right\nNow who couldn't even talking about this Nineteen Ninety five there is no Fox News the Blago her as a result of the airwaves\nOr this is where he attempted to blame me everybody you know what at the time and it was even applauded by some\nEverybody at the White House felt some have had the issue of corrections and all we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's what we meant by angry voices on the right\nMichigan Militia was a media creation I mean there might have been some guys hiking around in the woods with some guns were in Campbell gear and the media had video of it but the Michigan Militia was a non factor in any of this\nAnd you get right up but there's Clinton zeroing in on it when it's attempt to blame me bombed out so but you see\nClinton he didn't do that you know he was trying to heal he didn't go after anybody he didn't go after the terrorist he didn't sort of beat the drums install the jurors all of them he tried to heal it was a turning\nThis is again history revision as an extraordinary one more by this is Wolf Blitzer asked and judge Jeffrey to been last night on a Wolf Blitzer show on CNN\nI was the White House correspondent proceeding in Nineteen Ninety five are in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing or Clinton was president he went to Oklahoma City was he delivered a beautiful speech who was very very warmly received there were no protesters going on for you remember those days\nAnd how about you know President Obama who unfortunately had all these mass shootings on his watch in South Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places frankly wouldn't even occur to me that there would have been protests\nSee so now there were no protest for a bomb and there's no protests when Clinton went out but there's all kinds of protests when Trump goes out meaning what\nTrump's guilty But Trump's at fault that the protesters are right\nWhy weren't there any protests back in those days\nWe'll take a look at who the victims were number one but what why we're there no protests\nPrecisely because the left very rarely protest its own people they protest for no reason at all other than a simple excuse for it\nBut it also was a different time we're talking about over twenty five years ago\nTwenty two twenty three years ago and it it it was a\nMuch quieter and different time\nIt was just getting ratcheted up to where we're headed in any way

the cabinet or thing happened in a caravan thing I might save the GOP\nOr other people saying well if it was going to save a GOP it didn't because all of that momentum was interrupted the pipe bomber

if it was really the purpose\nAbout killing his nomination by any means which there'll be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really\nThe purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were so low on and so abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ... is the point of all that was to get justice for them then why is justice not\nAny longer\nAnd the answer the question is it was never about the women\nBecause none of the women had any evidence it was about one thing only and that was killing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh even if it meant destroying his family and his career his future and his life\nAnd they failed so now it's on to whatever is next and I guess if\nWe need a ban on white guys from Don Lemon the real murderers in America the real problem is white men we've got a Muslim ban we've got this bad we don't have a ban on white guys that we need a ban on white white guys white men have now become the primary issue in America according

responsible for Senate guy should Trump responsible for the Trump responsible for the airplane crash next week when they get around to that\nNone of it is real none of the news\nIs real it's all manufactured\nSo what does it mean\nWhat does it mean that we're not getting any updates from the drive by media about all of these women were so mistreated by Kevin ...\nWhat does it mean that the Democrats are not being asked by the media whether they support Kavanaugh's impeachment wise it's all been dropped\n\nWhy have the media given up investigating the story they obsessed over for nearly a month\n\nFor weeks September and October that's all the media talked about\nWell where's the follow up if Kavanaugh was as they say that story should not have gone away the women still suffered the women did not get justice capital got confirmed where is the news where is the continuing investigation will it doesn't exist because it was all made up of the capital\n\nClassic Democratic Party media operation\nSo is the aftermath of the pipe bomb story and so as the aftermath of the Jewish synagogues story it's all media manufactured not the stories themselves in this case but the coverage

about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were\nAllowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they handed to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nYou had to learn about American history you have the promise that you were going to do your best to learn the English language if it was restricted because it was predicated based on the fact that we weren't in charge of who was going to live here\nThe world was not in title it was entirely different vantage it back then but even then\nI read books I remember conversations with my grandfather who lived to be a hundred and four he was born in Eighteen nineties\nHis life spanned\nPre electricity to going to the moon in his life he saw all of that you grew up on a farm and the goal plow fields before school every day\nCome home after school work the farm and so forth and like all the stories everything they didn't sell is what they got to eat\nUm he was one of the first in his wedding it was the first to ah to go to college it became a lawyer\nBut he\nFrom the horse and buggy days and no electricity to\nManned spaceflight landing on the motives bottle\nAnd I remember I was I was home in Missouri ooh I guess Nineteen Ninety two years after the program again so they Nineteen Ninety and he's around Ninety these these ah close to a hundred years old and he's asked me so\nAnd he's around Ninety these these ah close to a hundred years old and he's asked me so what what are the big ... was it was hard of hearing but it's not you couldn't\nHear the radio easily so one of the big thing is being discussed here programs the immigration we call it pop pop you would not\nBelieve it I mean I I I'm dealing with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't run this was\nThis was folks this was all back in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know\nI remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days Ellis Island you immigration has been\nA polarizing subject to this country for as long as we have been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nUh efforts to image shown\nNew arrivals from western in Eastern Europe\nAnd he was telling me that there were so many people didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe ever people it's his point was the arguments haven't changed the issue has been something that is Constance\nBut the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety when we were talking about he was talking about legal immigration\nHe was saying back in the early Nineteen hundreds away they've you know the controversy there it was about legal immigration and even with legal immigration there were people who are opposed to opening up Ellis Island then preventing masses of humanity to come in\nAnd for reasons similar to what her step today the differentiating things today is that legal immigration is seldom even discussed and we have both\nPolitical parties in predominantly one of them now advocating from Austin is advocating for illegal immigration and then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples of racism and bigotry so forth\nSo while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial thing\nImmigration and how we manage it\nThe idea that illegal aliens should be automatically granted citizenship or amnesty upon their arrival\nThat is what's new to this debate and that is what the uh the Democrats or the American left today are are advocating and they're doing so on the premise that America is responsible for the economic plight of these people that we\nAs a superpower have taken an unfair portion of the world's resources we've gone around the world and take and what we want\nAnd we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and so it liberalism economics is a zero sum game if the American people are wealthy than somebody has to be poor out there and so therefore the American people are guilty\nOf something\nThat was an unequal distribution of wealth the laps as in all of these countries in Central America South America so poor compared to us and it's not a coincidence got to be our fault somehow so it's only fair that these people are fleeing a rotten economy is in war torn strife\nThat the United states allow them in as a means of apology\nAnd it becomes a definition of compassion and the real purpose behind it\nIs to transform America and to kind of nation it was never intended are founded to be and that's the difference is legal and illegal immigration subject has been around that's been controversial for as long as it has been happening\nBut the idea that illegal immigrants have legal claim on whatever they want in this country that's that is what's new and the education they make so many young people think that that's just the thing\nIs also relatively new\nMost powerful man in talk radio junkie I

people who've grown up and been taught\nThat Republicans hate X Y and Z and oppose X Y and Z how do you deal with that how do you you you're dealing you you think people being stupid or blindly obedient or whatever\nThey don't they think they're very smart they think they're really up to speed they know that Republicans or whatever and this is the Democrats have had a this is one of the

and people over fifty why do you believe that\nWell you believe for a lot of reasons people over fifty are prone to heart attacks why would they lie about what's what would possibly be political about that and they think science is infallible science doesn't why science is trying to save lives so people end up thinking of caffeine\nHabit over fifty you're going to be more more like they have a
