the Harvard law school dean way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard you lay the Kagan who now says I don't think he should be on the court I I'm not sure that isn't going to do the court any

is apologizing Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this Trump is right this is not done what North\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely non just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up\nWith this and that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of it the history on the child's life wailing immaturity is the result of the liberals socialist mindset on people young people immature children don't get their way already suffering psychological disorders of one way one\nKind or another that video a video of these kids on Saturday afternoon literally blowing up the doors of the Supreme Court they get in to try to stop but real swearing in they were literally calling if the doors\nThere wasn't any humanity and miss this was just raw hatred and fear\n\nCoupled with massive site disorders\nOf it promoted not denounced all of it promoted\nAnd encouraged by the powers that be in the media and the Democrat Party and the ... of the left\nAs I've been saying what a decent people do in response to this decent people are we're we're not going to become them\n\nThey have as an objective a real one nation and total human destruction of their opponents that's us\nDo not doubt me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of us that are here on the periphery but do not doubt me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation\nWell how do we find that decent people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents going to try to beat them but we're not going to become who they are we don't have an image to become who they are so given that how are they stopped it's a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything including\nFacto career and life political murder\nThings they don't want to stop people that they don't want how do you how do you opposed that how do you beat that back do you do it with decency to do it with politeness do you do it with manners I'm Sorry I'm going to cut it\nSorry never Trump or is bought the

preservation of what I call our way of life\nUnderneath the umbrella of decency\nSo we're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against that from the highest\nLevels of power in the country Donald Trump\nFearless leap pushes back on it are caused amount identifies them\nThey're not used to this they don't know how to react to it\nMedia is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are\nI mean everybody's accused the media being biased over the years but nobody accuses them of fake\nMaking it up\nParticipating in the open and want to ruin nation of people do that he ever accuses them of that not not I mean we may hear but at the highest levels of government never happened before there's Donald Trump doing it\nAnd from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night\nThis really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\nAnd\nWith that I must say that use are under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank\nYou saw [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise]\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness and courage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens

the president of the United states taking time out to tell those two young daughters of breath and Ashley Kavanaugh your father is a great man\nEvery father wants to hear that every father loves having his children told\nThat he was a great man few ever are afforded that\nOpportunity with Trump did it last night\nThen proclaiming Kavanaugh's innocence I mean that is can the taking all the poison the arrows at every Democrat launched it Kevin all the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee in every member of the media tried to ruin Kavanaugh\nTo openly proclaiming him innocent\nHe can't do that that was in a corner law he doesn't know but they had him guilty didn't say\nHe was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\nI Want to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that risk being bullied boarded written a letter to die and find so I don't think any of it was spontaneous\nAnd I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or she was also a storage\nBut somebody suggested she write that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump yesterday and why the United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination or the Kavanaugh would pull out\nAs far as ... as it got\nIllustrator jihad no
