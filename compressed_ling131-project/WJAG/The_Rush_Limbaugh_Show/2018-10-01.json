kinds of people are drinking\nAnd they make excuses for them because the pressure is so intense\nBut you don't find anybody testified that Kavanaugh's been us\nFall down beat him up drunk the last twenty five or Thirty years do you or even beyond that\nNext they said he he may have committed perjury if he lied about the people on that kind of wonder Andrea he lied about what those terms mean if he is committed perjury\nHe is gone we need the FBI to look into that we need the FBI look into whether or not he beat people up on yells campus and we need to we need to really track down this judicial temperament of his why you see the way he acted on our committee hearing on friday he was yelling and screaming and that's not the kind of temper we want from a judge\nOr my buddy Andy McCarthy and makes a great point if you want to test if you want to see Kevin O's judicial temperament there's a place you can go\nAnd it is called\nThe DC circuit court of appeals where Kavanaugh has been serving for years and all you have to do is go there and study\nHis work and then to the courts prior to that where he was a judge\nAll of this is the ... the leg\nTo lay they hope to find new

Washington establishment by the American left in by the media on adults are rated\nThough loaded Raul poisonous hatred Brett Kavanaugh\nIs going to be destroyed in the process of damaging and getting rid of Donald Trump\nThey want to delay this beyond the midterms because they are convinced they're going to win\nAnd when they when the hand the Senate House and Senate that can pitch Trump they can paralyze the rest of his administration and if uh if if if if Kavanaugh what happened to get an according to go to the gym to Gerald ... who runs to the Judiciary Committee for the Democrats in the

these new charges all these new suggestions for investigation all these calls for more time all it is is delay\nThe next time you hear\nHeaven knows reported very frequently in college and gotten rock and hit people in the face\nSubstitute one word for that delay\nThis is all about continuing to delay it which is why it is and he is as it has always been at some point the Republicans would love to shut this down\nAnd call for a vote no as anybody else like me concerned\nI mean the FBI leadership many of them are gone but a lot are still there and it's done it's level best\nTo screw with Donald Trump\nWorking with the intelligence agencies we had that cabal conducting assigned was cool\nTo get rid of Trump during the campaign and then destroy his transition may have been trying to destroy

Carlos danger and in a matter of three days reviewed a hundred thousand of them to find there was nothing there\nSo they can do whatever they're going to do in a day or two if they want to but then what happens if the FBI looks into all of this and reports by the way they reached no conclusions and if they do they will do\nA lot but if you're in the real issues there that the the forms and the results of interviews if they\nProduce no evidence\nFor Christine Blasey Ford if they produce no evidence for any other\nAllegation if they cannot produce anything that says Kevin all did it whatever it is\nDon't words if this investigation clears Kevin like every FBI investigation here to for has you think the Democrats because oh okay well good we got our wake now we can vote you think that's

issues of the girl fun to be paid if you recall during the doctor for testimony the prosecutor asked her how\nTo think for her legal fees and her security on if you met her to find me page and those three pages of rare hosted a million dollars and I happen to be some kind of ethical issue if you could just accuse somebody without any kind of cooperation evidence\nAnd then go public with that and raise you know that that amount of money as it is a very very properly thought it was a lot of weird and fences there for people who can make accusations if they think they could raise a lot of money or if your crowd crowdsource\nLook this is a toughie uh in in a strict capitals sense she has identified a market and that is there are arranged lunatics\nWho want her to be right who hope\nShe's telling the truth they want her to continue to speak and tell you they want her lawyers to continue to strategize and screw Kavanaugh\nThey're happy to pay for it this is how they can be involved in politics beyond voting there are more than happy to me it doesn't matter to them as she can afford her lawyers yourself it doesn't matter to them that her lawyers are working pro bono because this is a political case\nSo she's identified a market there are people that want to support her with money so she starts in the Gulf on me page I actually think somebody sent me a note\nToday that uh go fund me go find me is not new money laundering is essentially money laundering operation for the Democrats much like the unions were a because\nThere's a lot of this money going to go a lot of this money is going to go to these two lawyers who are then going to be where they're already involved and Democrat\nParty politics so it's just it's a it's a new form of fundraising that's not call fundraising

join the conclusions\nAbout her from it um\nIn terms of whether she's being truthful or not or if you wanted to draw a conclusion that the Gulf ... pages of\nA way to get Democrats soccer's I eat voters to pay for this so that it doesn't cost people who already have a lot of money anything than you could\nTry to make that point that the Democrats are using these poor people but I don't think you're going to be able to find a way to stop this too widely you jump in Sarasota, Florida Hi great to have you here saw what's up\nRussia just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea it's kind of a fantasy I don't think it would ever work but\nYou know the left as always behave like bullies and they'll do anything and they've never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington so you know when you know ethics and your dirty tactics I often they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that\nYou know you never have to suffer the consequences yourself like a bully there's no reason to stop when your tactics work there's no reason to stop and say bully is ever stop until they get punched in the mouth that maybe it maybe it's time that you know we don't want to become them maybe let's say for a year\nBut instead it was a standalone grams set it it was great it was impassioned\nAnd that was the end of it\nIt was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican and solve grams impassioned\nAllegation of the Democrats\nWas followed by agreement with Jeff flakes\nTo me that the FBI you allowed to do one way of investigating their fight normal fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with\nWith like you can't do these things as one offs if you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country and what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're going to have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis\nBut it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past were some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated we shared it with your way to go and it dies except for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just has to be honest and he was Lindsey Graham didn't have to worry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the when did\nYou notice not one of them on the Democrats I carried away with\nAbout what Graham said none of even got mad at it not a single one of them even wanted to refute if they didn't care and the only thing got a rise out of them was when Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys Lincoln but no they said they didn't Lincoln Mr general we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they did oh what about an investigation ha well Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate some of these other things that needs to be followed\nUp on their needs to be follow through but I for one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired because all they are for her the way\n\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible and there's denial how why is that so hard she didn't have any evidence she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in may so\n\nNone of that stabbed Bush's credibility\nAn attitude doesn't give us credibility pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility\nDemocrats are always in pain and suffering over something\nNow want to go back to my production\n\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out Kevin on that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held a pay\nBecause voters are going to be fit to be tied it being led down again then the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became conventional wisdom this keeps up Republican\nVoters are going to get kicked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons and they hate seeing what's happening in the capital and they don't want to imagine that happening to their own can there are going to show up in droves ... I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\nIf Brett Kavanaugh just think about this is a hypothetical\nI'm not predicting if Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\n\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day where Kavanaugh is\nNot confirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be ...\nAre you going to be so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad you feel betrayed because if that happens like that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he has not confirmed in the Senate\n\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say you see what happened to Kevin off we're in the majority and we couldn't get confirmed you'll need to come out and vote for us how does that work\n\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans to come out and vote to keep the majority\nWhen Kavanaugh was not sworn in everybody thinks that what voters\nWhen Kavanaugh was not sworn in as everybody thinks\nThat what voters are going to remember in November is this the unfairness that Kavanaugh the dirty tricks that Democrats are playing\nBut stop and think Kavanaugh is not sworn in\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man there's so many out there were guaranteed to get their votes weren't gonna there's going to be a Republican away because\nOf what happened to Kevin and then a Republican start campaigning and they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kevin Oh you mean that he's not there you mean you didn't get sworn in Europe that majority\nWe know it's a very small majority what are the majority and he's not sworn in and you want us to\nHow does this work folks my point is it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be so ticked off in Seoul man they're going to show up and vote like they've never voted before but is that going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\n\nRepublicans have been asking for the majority for a long time\n\nThey keep working and voting mostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump\nTrump alone will be able to make the case Trump alone will be able to\nTurn that Kavanaugh defeat and the turnout but the Republicans in the Senate and house I don't know how they do\nVote for us Kevin ... was defeated vote for us so it doesn't happen to the next nominee is that really effective I just don't I don't\nI hear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout we have to do something so that people get fired up I've been hearing this since I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call here in sort of rush Clinton needs to win\nDidn't people to see how bad the Democrats really are people see house dogs they really are you kidding we lose and then tell ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here with Kevin Kevin on doesn't make it difficult to really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up the base\nThat doesn't make any sense to me it ought to be the other way around\nThis is another\nTrick I think it gets played on Republicans your base is going to be really fire enough you have an odd doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how the hell\nIs is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it well\nRush voters are going to be so mad yeah yeah what the guy got real road we'll wrote it in our guys couldn't stop it and and we're supposed to say well okay\nMan we're really loaded now that's going to really caused the turn up the ...\nSorry about that I don't think it works that way\n\nWhat people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's gonna happen is that voters are going to be out there saying\nEven what we both Republicans and Democrats still run the town\n\nAnd it doesn't equal show up keep elected re it's got to be the other way to win this we have got to be the Democrats not lose to them\nAnd by the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of uh people who think their expert political analysts and they all well not all but I mean a whole bunch of them have this theory that the way they get the base all fired we want to let them destroy\nA great life great patriot a great American his whole career his future maybe his family in order to win the midterms how does that work\nYour football team loses\nMake you want to become a season ticket holder or is it one day when if you want on the bandwagon and you want to be on the team why do we

think that investigation is flawed in\nAny way but this one\nYeah this is all rigged yeah they're they're they're ignoring things they care to find out what happened at Christine foreign B.\n[noise] here's a here's Christie in Durham rant ... rates happy as we head back to the phones how're you doing\nI'm good thank you so much I'm so excited that get to talk to you think we are being played rush and I don't know if anybody has brought this up for that but I've been thinking about this forever and ever and I'm so glad I got to ask you about it I'm just in case you have brought it out but has anybody ever thought\nBut he has brought this up or not but I've been thinking about this forever and ever and I'm so glad I got to ask you about it I'm just in case you have brought it up but has anybody ever thought that the reason she looks so credible because she was so emotional and [noise] you know ... and nearly jumping out of her skin is\nBecause she freaking went on national TV ... convinced of going national TV to continue a lie that if this horrible have you ever had someone lied to you and are kind of a little nervous and shaky you know so I I went on TV [noise] see I got to exactly what I you know what role for\nAh that they knew movement at Tommy Lauren calls it and they finally get there and you're like\nShe's smart enough to know that all the people she was looking at you know that this is not true\nWhat you are doing\nIs understandable you're you're putting yourself in her position I'm Wondering how you would be\nAnd you're gonna be terrified you'd be scared to death\nOr and you might\nBetray that your voice might be shaking and you might be forgetful and you might be nervous and jittery ends up more\nFor people under trained in this kind of thing yeah but I don't buy that that's who she is for a minute\nThink this was re earnest and script and she knew what she was going to say and so forth I think\nIt was practiced a\nShe's from Santa ...\nThese people are left wing activist now I'm I don't want to appear to just out of hand reject your theory I Need to ask you a question\n... honestly and there's no wrong answer here did not misinterpreting tone in my voice I'm actually asking for you to help me was she credible to you because\nOf her demeanor and her boys had her up speaking a technique and her parents nervousness did she come across as credible do you believe in you know\nThat's exactly what I just said she came across as someone who was sitting in front of a bunch of people telling a lie and the reason why she was able to have be ... shaky and nervous and looked like someone who had been raped because she knew she was lying on national TV\nOkay I I I heard that I thought I thought you said the reasons he comes across as credible is because she is out of the people identify with suffering and pain and all that but\nShe she's a waiver and scared out her mind because of what she's doing\nWell and she went to this to do something really stupid\nYou know she didn't have to have a conscience for that\nYou'd think leftists left is cats survive with conscience is\nShe is\nWillingly\nAnd not just following she is leading now\nAn effort to destroy\nLiterally destroy another human being\nHis life's work\nHis past and future\nYou got to have no conscience\nTo be doing that and and she\nHer description of what happened to her\n[noise] well\nI couldn't do what she's doing but not because I'd be nervous\nBecause I couldn't live with the guilt\nIf I were participating in an effort that had an entire political party depending on me to pull it off\nTo destroy another human being\nIf it weren't true I couldn't do it\nAnd I don't think they have any problem doing I mean they are trained they were trained in this\nKind of political tactic that's what being a leftist is they are not docile like you and I am living their lives in politics happens there'll be a part of it politics is everything in his their identity [noise]\nAnd\nTo come forward with a story like this\nTo know that you can't offer corroboration or proof you've got to be really certain\nThat nothing's gonna happen to you\nYou got to be certain that the party is going to protect you that your lawyers are going to ... you got to be certain of Republicans aren't going to do it in a way to you and how do you do that you appear to be a woman in distress\nWho has been abused and so forth\nAnd since everybody knows Republicans have women and having a having a war on women you can be assured the Republicans aren't going to lay a glove on you know not even going to try but at the end of\nAll what have you done you have destroyed the life the achievements the future and the family of a fellow human being\nIt's about time people learn what we're up against them who these people are and what not learning what they're capable of its admitting it because it's happening\nWay way too often I have to take a break I appreciate the call thank you uh Elmo job will be back here before\nSince we you know Russia and Iran news on the [noise]\nGood news you are not stuck with your health care plan really you have a choice and it's a great
