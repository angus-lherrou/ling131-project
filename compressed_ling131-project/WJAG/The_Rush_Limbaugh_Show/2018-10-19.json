I voted for Trump I'm an avid Trump voter and them America First and most historic sense and I'm an American patriot so take that in contact with my question your\n... how can the United states the allies with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with the Saudi Arabia and Israel how can we be allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released\nAnd twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven also Israel has attacked us in the past like a used his liberty medal of honor fair can you clear that are forming\nWell on the Saudis side yeah the uh the the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody you know Jonathan Pollard\nIt was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted him back\nOn harmed we said screw you you know where your benefactor spy on us and I said yes we knew ever going to continue the spike is we can't trust anybody where Israel and particularly when Democrats are in the White House that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with you because your question here\nIs really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that\nIt was either all Nineteen or light Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers\nWere Saudi I remember I was talking to William F Buckley junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up and I remember him getting frustrated with me about it\nHe said what does it ever doing anything I Want to understand the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally and yet these hijackers come from Saudi Arabia are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind this\nI said how can we say that they're not\nThat is when I began to try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi of the Saudi royal family to Islam\nAnd that's what I started asking experts\nAre at one of the people I talked to was Andy McCarthy again because he has tried\nAs a United States attorney\nAssist the United states attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the blind shape case\nAnd it was Andy who said that he finds the blind check was just acting out and being a radical uh inventor of various aspects of Islam\nAs part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he he started reading the things that the blind shake believes when he\nFound out none of this is made up this this this call for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there in the car on if you read it right\nThis is exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he\nHe told me was so\nWhen you then realized that the Saudi royal family\nWhen you then realized that the Saudi royal family\nIn charge of\nWorld wide Islam because the holy sites or their mecca and a Medina Medina\nI found that it is absolutely true\nThat the Saudi royal family\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind\nWorldwide Islam while in Saudi Arabia\nThe branch of Islam that is I for just\nTo make it easier here and being understood terrorists Islamic comes from ... from those you heard me say this yesterday beg your indulgence\n... hobby Islam is where they really radical clerics and the moms are who are\nWelcoming anybody they can into their in their mosques and just literally converting them into\nSuicide bombers terrorists and what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi royal family\nStood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating you don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world promoted while hobby is\nAnd that's what I went back to Mr Buckley is I I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers\n\nWell that's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin solve Mont\nMohammed bin ... wants to if we didn't believe him\nHe wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam\nAll the cause of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely dependent on the sale of oil for all of its well he wants to branch out\nHe wants other people investing other industries individuals investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars are Petro dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley than the typical places in other countries as well and part and parcel of his reform is the\nI don't know what word abandonment or the uh distancing from or how does it\nAccording to have been some on Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still\nThe branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell this brings us to your show gay again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in\nAny Islamic country much less Saudi Arabia where mecca Medina they do not want ... watered down they do not they want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed didn't tell them on represents a bit of that that's fascinating that he's been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nWith the death of shaggy this has brought to a screeching and now there's a story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wonder well who determines these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different why they've got kids with every one of their wives\nSaw Saudi king could have twenty sons\nHow does he determine which one's the crown prince how does your determine which one's going to be as air it's not just first in line they have a council\nThey have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines the when the age of the crown prince the air's end in what order\nThen sell them on Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current king\nSolomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says it they went off it's true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin saw him on as ground friends\nNow many people think that this was up to the king the king determines what your his sons is gonna be the next king but it's not the case so\nAll of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cabin up all these plans for reform\n\nTo

I don't think that's going to happen these done too much into little time\nYou know I don't either get on the leaders but it was it was his\nTheory as to what the purpose of this caravan is uh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions if we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for\nNot serious money and certainly not serious construction there for his theory was\nThat the Democrats are trying to demonstrate there is never going to happen and Trump doesn't even care than it ain't going to happen\nAnd what better way to illustrate isn't four thousand people
