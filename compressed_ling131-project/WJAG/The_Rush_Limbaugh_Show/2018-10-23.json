there a brand of reading glasses don't blur when you're looking at your computer screens anyway readings folks great to have you we have for the first time\nWell it's tough to say first time we have an official there is no bones about it no mistake about it we have an official complete and total alignment among the drive by media\nNow in the last two weeks before the midterm elections the mainstream media is completely ... they are completely in sync\nThey are totally coordinated it doesn't matter where you go in the drive by media today you're going to see\nEverything under add a subject heading or an umbrella Trump spreads wise and stokes fear I had an election\nThat graphic has been on CNN Ninety five percent of the of the time today\nSo much so I took a picture of it here to make sure that I Would remember it verbatim Trump's brand lies and stalks fears ahead of election Washington Post headline Trump and Republican several on fear and false ... as a mid term strategy\nSame paper\nAll through the two thousand sixteen campaign said that Trump would end up being another Hitler that Paul Krugman or New York times said would cause an economic collapse from which the country would never recover\nStill covering this the the Washington Post still claiming Trump this plan to take away all of your civil rights\nSuggest robust enthusiasm among early eight Republican voters it couldn't put a dent in Democrat hopes for a blue wave\nRepublicans typically dominate early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have the advantage when in person early voting so for example the entire early voting patriot in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is complete\nNow that\nThat is somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states it is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is that for Democrats are drawn up in the early ...\nBecause of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for a bad on election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and again this is NBC those\nSo the question here ... hard to\nApply this to actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not according to conventional wisdom conventional wisdom is and conventional wisdom has been the Republican enthusiasm is kind of suppressed\nThat Democrat enthusiasm is off the charts that the Democrats have been so motivated ever since they got screwed in two thousand sixty ever since Trump and the Russians stolen election from the Democrats have been motivated or like you can't vote for me to get out there and make this right\nAnd correct it and fix it they haven't been inspired David energized they've been motivated they been donating they cannot wait and yet\nIn eight\nKey Republican state key key battleground states Republican early voting is dwarfing Democrats early voting\nAnd violating all is that Bush norms all statistical norms\nAnd how effective this this is the kind\nOf resolve the kind of thing that's happening but nobody in conventional Washington\nElitist establishment Washington would you ever think would happen these people come up with their story they're stuck with it if it even if it means they're lying to themselves about it\nLike for example if they if they get it in their heads everybody hates Trump and that hatred for Trump has brought in and magnified over two years ... therefore there's going to be this massive\nTurnout among Democrats can't wait to vote energized when they get that in their hands and they believe it and then the exact opposite happens and they don't know what to do about it and they get non plus and a little concerned about which is where\nThey are now and I've shared with you yesterday there's a there's a lot of stories [noise]\nUh about the blue wave not happening that

lose the house eighty six percent chance and Democrats wonder how does all this fit together\nWell it doesn't obviously\nIf Republican early voting is out distancing Democrat early voting and Democrats have always owned that\nMust mean that something is drastically wrong here something is\nTerribly wrong in the formula\nFor this kind of Republican enthusiasm in an off year mid term
