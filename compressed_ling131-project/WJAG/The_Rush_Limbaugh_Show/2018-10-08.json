together a winning coalition of a sum total of every\nMinority group they can find they were going to combine all these minority groups and make that the Democratic base because white working class voters were becoming less and less\nDependable because they weren't buying Obama an Obamacare and because of that they were becoming racist a traditional Democrat little guy voting bloc they\nIt's ... this is simply an evolution of that\nSo I'm a white working class was told to go pounds sand by the Obama campaign two thousand eleven now in two thousand Eighteen\nDo we need white women it's an
