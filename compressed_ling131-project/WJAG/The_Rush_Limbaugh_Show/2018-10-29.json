Bush Republican\nNow he's gone off to the dark side on ABC\nI Would put specific responsibility on the president that he has an obligation to try to rid us of much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years as helpful Methodist\nOh yes he says oh Trump's fault all of this is Trump's fault\nAnd the media wants to be exempted from any impact it they they don't want to think they influence opinion and shape the outcome of elections but\nThey don't want to be held any kind of responsible for what people do the same time it seems in Congress to me here when they when they get called out\nOn this they deny it this is a montage Tom boss search who a former national security adviser and Stephanopoulos\nAnd they're married Jordan of the Washington\nPost I Want them to be calm but I don't think that the American viewers are looking at in terms of murder\nIt's really a nice to be able to go listen to someone and be able to get a lot of wisdom out of what they're saying and I mean no matter what people say because I was I volunteered for the Republican Party to go on at the county fair to go work their booth\nAnd I had a lady walk up to me and say did your parents have to be here and I said no I Want to be here because I'm I Want to help my country get better and tell people who to vote for and I'm just try to make California which is not good be better\nThese were adults and ask you that question\nYes there they were um it was she might have been in our forties fifties maybe she asked oh the your parents are paying you to be here I assume\nThat it was kind of rude I mean here you are your do you look sixteen or do you look a little older than that\nWell I'm Fifteen I don't know I mean I look like a teenager\nOkay so they won't buy him as a teenager there and they still feel\nThe need to insult you mildly and their world but I'm sure there was no you couldn't possibly have a mind of your own if you were doing what you were doing\nYes and I'm sure she wanted to say you're brainwashed but she probably didn't have the guts to say that\nWhile I'm curious about something and I'm very flattered uh I'm vibe to no end in mind flattered year that that you would want to be something super an exceptional having listen to this program why journalism\n[noise] ah well I like journalism and I want is a way maybe one day have my own organization for military families who have had servicemen\nKilled in action but a journalism because\nI just I Want to get my voice out there and change 'cause I don't like the way I mean Trump is making America great you know I Believe that\nBut what about if someone gets in office after him and then I go in there Twenty years later it's maybe going to be a huge mess 'cause of the way America's millennials are going like my sister\nAnd I just want to be one of those who gets up there and says\nI'm done with this I Want to change it\nOr good for you are there are a lot of people a lot of parents who have kids your age and younger\nWho are really scared about the future of the country has always been the case for my whole life I have heard people say\nThroughout my life but they don't want to have kids who would dare want to bring kids into this world that some I remember hearing that when I was Fifteen myself so it's nothing really really knew\nBut I'm sensing today when people say there is a people who have kids not so much do that are thinking about people who have kids are really really worried about their futures\nBecause of the way the west\nHas become more radical and more anti the general concepts of America it's scaring people what kind the country or their kids going to grow into I mean there's always going to be an American about what's going to be are they going to be free\nAre they going to have to conform to some of this extreme wacko left them in order to not be hassled build up their lives there some genuine fear about is if you want to tackle that\nMore power to you and journalism needs people like you in it\nWell and I don't that's like what you're saying I don't want my kids are my younger sister to grow up in America where\nThere's just a bunch of people that don't even belong in this country hurting and citizens going around trying to do bad stuff too I don't want to grow up in a country where you can't even have a gun to protect yourself or to hunt with or\nA a country where veterans are put behind illegals I mean I just I that's the one that makes me so angry as the\nWhy do you think that's happening why do you think so much attention as being lavish on uh the people you referred to as the illegals coming here who are not citizens but just being a granted access to so many things given so much why do you think is happening\n[noise] ah well there's a lot of reasons for one thing Obama made it all just come hallway and you know um but I think just because they think they see what we're going to go there and nobody's going to stop us you know well maybe the military is going to stop them this\nTime no I understand why there ... why do you think there is so much a tolerance for it why do you think so many people are wandering them here and in and want to do nothing to stop them from from getting in why do you think there's so much tolerance for the illegal well aspect of this\nI don't well a lot of the people who are voting they don't know anything about why\n... [noise] I don't know where to stop why would they ah I don't know why the people are wanting to give away their money to them by I think that they're saying oh well poor people you know their country's war stricken\nWell you know America has to help their people to they can't just give away money to these illegals coming and they're like well that they may bring jobs here how are they bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at\nI mean they're going to go work in ... agriculture or something 'cause I Know there's a lot of illegals I live in California and there's a lot around where I live but\nI don't know the answer is that they worked cheap number one for the people don't want the river cheap labor cheap labor is the answer the other side of it\nOr you're talking about people\nAnswer is that they work shape number one for the people that want the river cheap labor cheap labor is to answer the other side of it are you you're talking about the people that don't want to give the money the people who are behind these policies are damn wells making sure that you and others are going to give your money they're not going to be giving there but the answer\nThe answer to the question is because the left wants power and power to them is more and more people in capable of self reliance\nMore and more people in capable of helping themselves and the best most concentrated group of people that fit that bill are a bunch of poor ill educated or uneducated people don't even speak the language\nFlooding the southern border you get 'em in their human beings we're a compassionate country they have to be fed they have to be taken care of the Democrats want the credit for doing all that they want to get these people registered to vote as quickly as they can they looking at him purely and simply as voters\nIt's not about compassion and it's not about giving them a good life it's not about any of the things that they want you to think it is it's strictly about creating let me put it this way\nRarely the Democratic party and do not doubt me on this and you would you do you do research or journalism career you will find that this is the case of the Democratic party needs a permanent underclass\nOf uneducated or poorly educated people who are not capable of economic sulfur lives because they can't speak the language\nBecause they don't have any education those are prime democratic voters\nThose are the exact kinds of people the Democrats want to build a majority around because they won't be for ever grateful I eat dependence on Democrats and will constantly be voting for Democrats no matter what else happens that's\nThat's the reason behind it nobody will ever own up to it nobody will ever admit it\nBut what they are really is just on documented Democrats not to their undocumented citizens or aliens undocumented Democrats that's their status right now and the objective is to get them documented to get them registered and take care of them\nGive them health care make their track here make their trip pure worth it\nBy giving them exactly what they're coming for now some of them are going to be able to take care of themselves\nSo I'm not going to get here and I got to run rings around people some in any group of people that large are going to have a wide disparity in some of them are going to be quite competent\nBut\nThose are going to be the self starters and those are not the fabled Democrats are interested in I just really hideous I guess I guess I guess really hideous because Democrats want people need people who are incapable of self reliance\nAnd that's not helping those people at all that is not compassionate Democrats want you to think that's all they are and they are not of it it's the exact about they're using these people and hoping that they never amount to much\nThey don't have much faith in them anyway but they are great voters great dependent voters and thereby eyes so that's what this is about look I'm Glad you called rarely or exceptionally well spoken your home schooling is working and you're I Hope that you hope you do get into journalism is journalism needs people that that are

the synagogue shootings yeah now I\nI normally watch Fox News but I always try to watch a network program every day just so I can legitimately compare the two\nSo I'm the ACC news reporting they quoted a study showing a rise in anti Semitism in this country now when they sat is neither my wife and rocket remember there ever recording this before even after the ferret\nBut says I'm In this country now when they set this neither my wife and rocket remember there ever recording this before even after the ferret contour my comments\nI'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue more than one person commented that if we started this winter weather and I couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make sense\nBecause of their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were um about armed security for\nThese you know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive they never worry about where is this\nGoing to end but if you if you do things that give people more safety more control if you give people a greater feeling of security that liberals can't lay claim that all of a sudden they fear where is it leading to where's it it's absurd where where's it hadn't\nAll to advance advance the agenda of essentially canceling the election results from two thousand sixteen and finding a way to get Donald Trump out of office and it was to people\nDemocrats Republicans monitor its independence
