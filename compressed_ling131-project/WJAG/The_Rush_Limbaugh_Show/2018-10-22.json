where the cowboys play with a hundred thousand people in there\n\nSo you think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have in March up through Mexico mad walk out could really they are those people really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald

of you by the way how many of you when you joined a crowd of of of of Seventy five thousand people at a Seventeen or Eighteen thousand seat venue and yet they do I wouldn't I wouldn't if I drove by and saw the crowd that been from the get go home watch it on TV\nTried to find it on TV but these people want to be there and you know who they are\nThey're not the elites they are the people who make this country work they are the people that the Washington elites this day and\nThese are the people say they hate Trump for the same reason I don't like these people their average working people there from the working class there's nothing you lead or special about them and so there is a disdain for them but they are showing up and winding up in droves\n\nAnd it's it's it's a huge missed story now along the lines\nOf this grab audio soundbite number seven team\nI Am not sure folks that that I Believe this I'm trying to find the story that attaches to this\nThat play play the sound bite when I look for the story it's a it's it's mostly apparently got got the um\nA treatment that the the turtle when Republicans are getting here they were she was rudely treated and she was protest it and and so forth I and I'm not sure I Believe this is legit but let's play the sound bite this is from Wednesday in coral Gables which is where the University of Miami is\nA policy was entering an event to

the seat currently held by Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros Lehtinen and pillows he was confronted in heckle by protesters in here is a portion of what it's\nMeant the policy right here right here [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] Hi [laughter]\nOkay were you able to hear what the protestors [noise] okay I'm not sure I buy this just like\nNo no final meal just light bill and Hillary are going to go do or what\nThey're going to do a theater slash stadium tour and we're going to charge people and get in to hear them reminisce\nBill and Hillary and therefore San America today Baba and they're going to charge people to get Trump doesn't charging but again and he's going to charge you could probably make money off this they're clearly picking back piggy backing off what Trump's doing and they want to get in on the action and they want to prove to themselves and the Democrats they can draw crowds too\nAnd they aren't going to pay all there are not going to be Seventy five thousand people waiting to get into here the Clintons\nUnless they're paid and that could entirely happened and I'm telling you there aren't going to be anywhere near the kind of crowds to hear or see the Clintons as there are Trump but they want to get in on it\nBut there's something about this doesn't jibe with me [noise]\nWashington Post has a story far right hecklers confront below sea call her a communist that Florida campaign of in their recall mayor communist the communist\nSocialism sucks socialism sucks this sounds like what leftist when conjure up a protest if they thought Republicans one show up in protest what Republicans would say how many Republicans have you seen\nA protest if they fought Republicans one show up in protest what Republicans would say\nHow many Republicans have you seen show up at a Democrat event start shouting time in that country needs to know how many times have you seen this\nTell me\nTell me how many times have you [noise] it doesn't happen often\nI Know it is Miami and you're thinking Little Havana and all that\nBut I'm just telling you like the Democrats want to get in on the they're taking heat\nFor all of this garbage that they're doing they're taking heat on the way they did Kavanaugh they're taking heat for forcing cruise in his wife and others out of restaurants nobody's in favor of that that's not getting any support what's not building a move but it may be set to satisfy the already existing lunatics\nThat make up a Democrat base but it's not growing it\nAnd so I think I wouldn't be surprised if the Democrats staged this whole thing\nTo try to get sympathy for pillow see much like all these attacks on the turtle and his wife and Ted Cruz and all these other Republicans that have been forced out like cures to Nielsen it just reeks of copycat to me\nIt just reek like Bill and Hillary want to get in on the action of Trump's stadium chores [laughter]\nAh the Clintons I was [noise] I I I just [noise]\nAnd I saw somebody on Fox is that I can damning this treatment the\nPillow see just falling right in condemning this treatment below sea this woman that I saw has never condemned the way Democrats are treating Republicans in this matter [noise] so it count me in the group of people think this could very\nLikely be a put up job [noise]\nI mean it's all I got all the coverage it's got the right angles to it and so forth so and if it's
