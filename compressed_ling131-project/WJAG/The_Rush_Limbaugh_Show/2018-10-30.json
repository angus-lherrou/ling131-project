week away from the election and why don't you think it's gonna happen\nI went to an event\nOut there last night I might not have not been going to too many events but I went to an event last night I Can't tell you the number of people I ran into these are the owners I went to a donor a bunch of people\nI think there's going to be a red wave like you can't believe I Try to test on\nI rather than joined them in their enthusiasm I tried to talk them down a little bit I just wanted to test whether they were being emotional or whether they actually fought it out\nSo I rarely do I got to be a red wave and it's gonna be big it's going to shock everybody people are going to be starting just like they weren't two years ago I said okay well I Hope you're right but let me let me give you some facts on the ground forty\nOh yeah we're going to get to the birthright citizenship is it just a second here but I Want to set it up with this man this is great what Trump is doing on birth for all this is exactly why Trump was elected as my good friend McCarthy any recording said you got to have somebody that's willing to break the furniture\nYou have to have somebody willing to turn things upside down and if you're actually going to get things done and the left is beside itself the day the NBC is headlined Trump\nTrump Trump tack on birthright citizenship is just the latest attempt to rile up the GOP based everybody's saying he can't do that that's the fourteenth amendment he can't universally with an executive\nOrder reverse the pork either men do we want to discuss how maybe he can he's going to run into activist judges that'll that'll turned him down here but the point is\nThat you need somebody like Donald Trump does the fourteenth amendment is what grants citizenship to anybody born in America and it was intended it goes back to the Eighteen hundreds it was intended\nTo grant citizenship\nJust claims and their descendants now how would you how do you think modern African Americans they would feel if the fourteenth amendment\nWhich was used to grant citizenship to their slaves and their descendants now being used in grant citizenship to anybody that gets into the country just for the purposes of giving birth here\nPossible they're gonna they're gonna win the Senate if they don't win the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about unreality not in terms of media lingo they'll call it whatever they want\nIf they emerge victorious\nBut all of these events were designed to cause this blue way were designed to create this massive voter intensity and the turnout\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented\nRepublicans seldom show up this while in early voting\nIt's hard to explain it away\nBut I think inclusion isn't there has been no blue way there is not even been a blue ripple\nThat you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip\nSome blue bubbles are bursting\nRecall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support longtime blue congressional districts and major coastal cities\nSo this guy is of the firm belief that a conservative red wave or Republican red wave is coming and is on the way [noise]\nMany other people are either I've I've heard some people that were rush look if you got to be very very careful those forty five Republican retirements\nThat's that's such a\nToss up ... don't know how\nTo factor all of that that's more retirements in a single year than wherever used to having to factor in\nHere and the power of incumbency and those forty five seats has been or has been lost I think by the way the political professionals\nAre going to be hyping the fact that as things stand I this is probably what you're going to hear from a lot of places things stand now looks like the Democrats might when the house by two maybe for the\nAnd that's going to be designed to get you\nTo not get lazy and overconfidence\nDon't don't be dispirited by any of that you hear the evidence that there is no blue wave is the is the\nThat is prevalent throughout the drive by maybe because their efforts to derail Trump have failed\nEvery one of them including the big one\nForcing Trump out of office because he supposedly co loaded with the Russians Robert Mueller was supposed to have delivered to go with\nThe special counsel mine now all was supposed to have core Trump\nTrump was supposed to be on the way out by now\nDo not doubt me that's what everybody on the left held out in great hope\nFor the special counsel investigation\nBarring an actual report they had been hoping and praying for a week [noise]\nThat would be indicative that the report does say that Mahler found hard evidence that Trump and putting cheated and stole the election from the clutches of the hill derby\nBut there aren't even any such leaks\nThat's the big one that has blown up\nDo not doubt me on this\nBy now Mahler was supposed to have delivered the guards drive by media was supposed to have delivered the leaks\nSo now it's off the plan B\nAnd plans see and so forth and that's why I say that kind of it's obvious panic also argues against the fact that they\nIn a in a blue wave let's take a brief time out will come back we'll delve into will get started delving into the Trump claimed that he can defy the constitution and and birthright citizenship with an executive order it would not be defined when the constitution\nThat's how CNN headlines of the story would not be defiantly constitution and that's

lot of never Trump or is in there and that's one of the reasons they retired I Would be remiss if I didn't mention is there were a lot of them I don't know about the total number forty five but a lot of them quip because they were just fed up\nThat Trump won and that Trump was leading the Republican Party and they don't want anything to do with it some of them are committee chairmen and decided they wouldn't go to go back just regular house bozos because it's such a calm down you know to have been a committee chairman then go back to being just a regular venture or back venture\nIn their ways and this this ... in their place many of the Republicans have got the primary nominations to replace these never Trump hers were retiring are Trump supporters\nThere Trump and so the the total number forty five resigning is not ... in and of itself a completely negative\nCharacteristic the power of incumbency still can't be denied it's an amazing thing I think it's still true house races in Ninety eight percent of them the incumbent wins every year\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes result\nAnd in some cases it's even worse than that the left wants those changes the left wants this country over thrown from the days of its founding\nOut to the left or America's it legitimate to tip morals it's in decent because we were a slave nation and we discriminate and the original white privilege was the founding fathers\nThere were no founding mothers only founding fathers they're bunch of white privilege rich white guys they set up a country for themselves and their descendents so goes the argument leaving everybody else\nAnd it's time to overthrow that and change it and it's a serious movement and it's it's a ... you can trace the educational roots for this back to the Nineteen seventies Nineteen seventies as a\nAn offshoot of radicalism in the sixties is where\nThe changing premise of education for America's kids actually began but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here in the details of the story Donald Trump\nAnd let me just give you the New York times version they're headline Trump claims he can defy constitution and end the birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump offered a dramatic if legally dubious promise in a new interviewed a ... a unilaterally and birthright citizenship ratcheting up his hard line immigration rhetoric what a week to go before the critical mid term elections\nTrump's vow to enter the right to citizenship for children of non citizens alum authorized immigrants born in America came in an interview with ... was released yesterday Trump did not say when he would sign the order\nAnd some of his past promises using executive action have gone unfulfilled but whether he follows through on his threat or not the issue and joins a string of actions intended to rush the matter\nOf immigration into the front of voters' minds as they have the polls next week folks\nAs I said throughout the first year of Trump's presidency this is what pushing back looks like\nIt was never going to be clean and it was never going to be quiet\nPushing back against the liberal order of the day was always going to be noisy and it was going to be potentially violent dangerous\nAfter all these are people who do not accept\nElection results anymore\nAnd you know what that means\nYou know was held this country together all these years is the\nOf a lecture results yeah have a heated campaign you may have political parties and elements that really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who\nHad a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago\nYou can go back to two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections and shock\nGeorge W Bush's first midterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive by center left what convinced that they were going to sweep the house the way they were going to sweep the Senate away with people were set up with the Florida recount remember all that\nAl Gore got jobs the Democrats got cheated and Democrats were loaded for bear out what happened to Republicans won an added seats in an off year election\nWhen the Democrats they accepted it for the most part and they started talking about how well\nWe're gonna have to modify some of what we believe a lot of values are basis because exit poll showed that values were a large factor in why people voted Republican\nWell fast forward it two thousand six than there is no knowledge with the Trump won they do not accept\nThe election results that's what these past two years have been about and are going to remain about they don't accept Trump's election as legitimate because they didn't want it\nWe've gotten to a point where the radical left simply because it doesn't feel good about this is willing to overthrow an election and its results and the way this happened\nTop levels of the Obama D. O. J. we're used to overthrow run a sign of cool to try to throw Donald Trump back out of office and reverse those are actual results it's unprecedented\nPat Buchanan has these out today that uh reminds people Nineteen sixty eight\nFeatured even more violent unrest that we have yet seen this year but we're getting close\nCan always go back in time and find a period where it was worse than it is at present you can always go back inside the civil war but it is\nA seminal moment when a political party\nAs its official position refuses to accept election results\nAnd that's where we are and that's why we're where we are they refused to accept it\nFor whatever reason they hate Trump they don't feel good about it they disagree whatever doesn't matter why just the fact that they refused to accept the results\nIs a horribly dangerous\nBecause what if it keeps up what if the only time there is peace in America is when they win elections\nYou know I I predicted some time ago that they're going to figure this out at some point and the natural conclusion to figuring this out is well let's just eliminate elections of elections or what's holding us back let's find a way that will lemonade or\nPeople laugh to combine rice it's never going to have to do not\nEver say the left isn't capable of anything ever\n\nSo now he Trump\nRather than being intimidated by their refusal to accept this election or rather these feelings hurt Trump doubles down triples down every time they hit and he hits back\nWith additional\nEnergy and verve and I'm telling you this promise with an executive order to end birthright citizenship is huge and it's why he was elected\nWhen things are going terribly wrong and they are in our country right now when things are terribly wrong and out of control\nYou have to have somebody willing to go outside the so called boundaries and Trump's doing it every day and willing to do so because this is what pushing back\nThis is what defiance this is what changing with the ... looks like it was never going to be pretty it was never going to be why it was never going to be clean\nRequires a strong stomach and strong fortitude and there's I don't think any elected Republican other than Trump even if they have made the promises\nStrong stomach and strong fortitude and there I don't think any elected Republican other than Trump even if they have made the promises Trump made I think all of them would have caved by now\nBut Trump hasn't he doubled down All right I'm going to just I'm an addition executive order I'm going to end the birthright citizenship let me read the or the fourteenth amendment ... begins\nAll persons now the fourteenth amendment goes back to Eighteen ... I think it was ratified by Congress and agents sixty six it was\nPassed by Congress ratified by the state's two years later so agents sixty six it was passed by Congress ratified with estates Eighteenth sixty eight and its original intent\nWas to grant citizenship\nAnd their descendants\nAnd it was part and parcel of post civil war era of America fixing itself\nIt was a good thing uh our constitution was written\nSo that mistakes at the founding could be corrected\nThe vast majority of people do slavery of the founding was was terrible but they needed the union in order to fight\nThe revolutionary war they needed the southern states they needed unity to do that so they had to accept slavery but they'd built in safeguards to wipe it out in the habit of agents sixty eight the fourteenth amendment begins this way all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction there of our citizens of the U.S ended up the state where in\nThey reside it was clearly intended\nReferring to slaves and their descendants the parts that birthright citizenship\nA freaks after delete\nArt naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that rub\nYou are not naturalized and you are not subject to the U.S jurisdiction if you're here illegally\nYou cannot be you're under some other countries jurisdiction if you're here illegal you cannot possibly be naturalized well\nThe birthright citizenship crowd which wants to water down American culture and destroy western civilization\nConveniently leaves out naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that Rob\nSo your born here or child absolutely is not a citizen and this is what Trump is saying Trump is finally pushing back against an assumption that has been made because it was the least\nHalf of resistance if you will but now if you have to make or break time\nAs my friend McCarthy says you need somebody to break the furniture\nSometimes you've got to remodel house I got a quick\nTime out a little long haired next segments going to be back in a mosh Limbaugh more in the way I'm lucky I met one to run on new on\nBrigade coverage at five twenty friday evening rock Ninety seven five K.

with it in the Nineteen sixties is when we started extending birthright citizenship to anybody\nWho happened to be born in the United states and it has become one of the primary reasons that illegal immigration happens\nFor obvious reasons once an illegal immigrant family gives birth in\nStates that child as a citizen and it's a hello\nDozens once an illegal immigrant family gives birth in the United states that child as a citizen and it's a hello citizenship everybody else in the family eventually and then you get into things chain migration and and all of it and it's it's one of the force multiplier is\nGeometric a proportion advancement in terms of the numbers of illegal immigrants\nSo the leftist saying that Trump is just doing this to rile up the base it's just that an issue for one

why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up eventually so that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and they'll get their okay\nYeah it'll it'll have to get there that now Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate a look\nWe're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nThere there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject\nOf immigration and so Trump and his\nRoots of an executive order is good but there's the you know there's going to be a judge that's going to bring it to a screeching halt everybody knows that\nI mean that'll happen within hours of Trump signing the executive order everybody involved\nNo is that is going to happen that then begins the process and it probably will end up at the Supreme Court unless Congress does right legislation in dealing with a constitutional amendment\nOr it may take more than just the statutory act and the left\nAnd they've got plenty of judges out there are going to be using every damn one of them to try to shut down\nEvery effort here let's see this is how folks this is how we ended up having a chance to win\nBy shining the light on the left in who they are and what they do by forcing them out of the shadows and making them do it\nSanctuary cities isn't good educational tool people can find exactly what these people on the left of the people responsible for it as the people that are believing in sanctuary cities for someone out make 'em defend it make a run for office ... stalling the virtues of sanctuary some made the left\nSpeak make them behave make them stand up and support what it is they believed him and so this conversation starter on the fourteenth amendment and ending birth rights that made them stand up\nAnd make polo sea and Schumer and whoever else solve them make the case\nThat in a buddy born in the

politics forcing the left out this way and as it happens in the media goes more and more bonkers because they know what's going on\nAnd it's it's forcing everybody to see that the media is in the media the media is the Democratic\nParty and all of these things are why the people I talked to who think that there's not going to be a blue wave think they think more and more Americans because of Trump are finally seeing liberalism in action\nAs opposed to having been told what liberalism is and who liberals are they are now\nSeeing it and once that happens it's it's harder for the left to

living under the bastard possession of a bunch of American culture since the Nineteen sixties\nAnd it's come to her head and this is the moment in time where finally there is a symbol and some serious push back I mean this is serious Donald Trump is engaged in serious push back\nAnd this is what it looks like this is not just rhetoric Donald Trump is not somebody just talking even he himself said the other day in his campaign rallies during the campaign it was just words we're going to make America great again we're going to do this we're going to do that but now he's got a track record\nHe's

telling you there's there's there's nothing\n[noise] there's nothing any illegitimate means to accomplish their objectives is perfectly fine with\nThem and we have to be\nReady to oppose them on that basis the evidence that they refused to accept the results of the election that's what all of this is about when you strip all of this down to its bare essence it is the left and the Democratic party let me to you who have refused to accept the results of an election\nAnd we don't have a lot of history of that\nThat's been ... can tell you how to think or tell your window go start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd now we've even got never Trump conservatives or out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down to you know what I keep the essence of things that\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the\nReal anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express and the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting from there to be tied\nYours the reason that this is all going because you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and now\nYou're blowing things up and you're shooting people\nJust deeply darkly insulting it's not promoting civility it's not promoting unity\nQuick phone call before we go knock at talk in Connecticut Patty you're next time I want to welcome to the program\nOh thank you so much for taking my call I think if I'm not sure what to do every day for the true thank you so you're more than welcome thank you I went\nTo a point out the

kicked season citizens that are houses either they've never taking away their Social Security and have the left promised democratic voters for fifty years that that's what ...\nThis is that what our houses either they've never taken away their Social Security and have the left promised democratic voters for fifty years that that's what Republicans were going to do now they're doing it with preexisting conditions are right\nHere they've thrown out here and making promises to connect Cape and they don't keep well they don't tend to\nJust promises they can't they connect Cape and they were selling something that isn't even viable because Medicare requires the private sector insurance without the private sector insurance there's no Medicare Medicaid for a great example the veterans programs\nYeah but see what what you're illustrating is is\nSomething that in talking about today they the mallard ill education of people since well I don't know when you're when I get to the Nineteen seventies early seventies late sixties but essentially\nFacts\nAnd reality had been replaced by what people feel if you feel it it is if you feel is right if you feel it in the water you're justified the facts are irrelevant the fact is in fact in government up actually\nConfuse you and get your mad and and and you you turn it all out and so if you feel\nThat a big bad company Jordan did not\nMedical coverage just somebody who is sick you are being bad reading company and I'm not going to vote for anybody that supports this big bad being companies do you tell us first you're talking about pre existing conditions more right\nWell let me ask you a question you don't have insurance and your house catches fire and you're going to try to buy insurance for your house do you think somebody should know that would be really well same thing with preexisting condition\nWe're talking lines you were talking about health care everybody has a gallon Jean right they're going to help everybody has a guaranteed right to medical care and everybody has a guaranteed right to opt barring home and everybody has\nThis is what they've been raised because that feels good so they end up believing it anybody standing in a way of it being dirty rotten SOB so all the Democrats have to do is go out and and and tell people\nRepublicans want to take away your healthcare you if you're sick and you've got cancer if you're sick you've got some of the Republicans want to take away your healthcare\nDoesn't matter whether it's right or wrong or why are people oh my God Almighty I get off it

I don't know if I couldn't believe what you're telling me about him anymore\nSo I said well what happened\nWell it clearly wasn't this on Fox News Sunday Chris Wallace contrast and front page headlines from the Washington Post the day after Steve ... was shot in Alexandria, Virginia by Bernie Sanders supporters with the Washington\nPost headlines following the capture of mail bomb mastermind\nAnd Trump's support her she has her say Huck and not surprisingly the post made sure to emphasize that say arts political views were mentioned in the headline while a guy that shot up skill lease was not mentioned\nPolitically at all and it's Chris Wallace holding each do headlines up in pointing it out the say Ken line red bombs suspect outspoken supporter of Trump\nWallace said that the headline really surprised him he expected the Washington Post headline to read something like suspect arrested\nA closer inspection of the article finds that it does not even mentioned the ... was the bombing suspect until the fourth paragraph instead the first three paragraphs read like a psychological profile of the guy talking about his support for Trump and all the stickers on his van\nBut on the other hand the headline after the ... shootings sadly congressman shot\nIn Virginia and didn't mention his name it didn't mention his support for Bernie Sanders and the front page article did not mention um anything infected foot noted his support\nFor Sanders and it barely\nLike one of the asterisk mentioning that the guy was highly critical of President Trump\nSo here's Chris Wallace holding up the I. V. if evidence of media bias here that he said surprised him\nLater on in the in the show Jason Riley and the wall Street Journal was on he said if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter and if you want to know why Trump won't give up social media of this is why these two headlines or why and the ... right you folks it every day Donald Trump\nWon't give up social media this is why these two headlines or why and it's exactly right you folks every day Donald Trump is the only Republican tweeting\nOr informing people about the success of his policies everyday stock market good Trump tweets everyday consumer confidence up Trump's tweets at every what ever the economic news is or whatever the successes that his agenda his administration is having he tweets\nAnd if it weren't for him it wouldn't be out there are other than us of course here or in so called alternative media but but but the point is the Republican Party is not even touting the Trump administration's\nAgenda successes Trump alone is doing it\nAnd that's why he's not going to give up the opportunity to do it in and I hope we never does but when I\nWhen I realized this that Trump is the only guy like today there are a couple of tweets from Trump tweeting the consumer confidence\nAs being at a record high and and relating it how can people be voting Democrat when this kind of great economic news has been the the news of the day for two years\nThere's all\nKinds of Republicans running for election and four hundred and thirty five house seats thirty five thirty six Senate seats we're is I don't ... McDaniel is out there tweeting some things out now but where is the party in general touting itself\nAnd its achievements and you don't see it other than from Donald Trump\nAnd he's not whining about that he's unabashed he'd just tweets it out and ah and ... and he reached the truth out about the media\nAs they report on him and law and order distorts or what have you but there is an incredible incredible\nSeries of success stories that at any time in the past would have been\nA great help in use and assistance in running for election or reelection\n\nGreat news that would portray and show the Republican Party and a great light and Trump's it for the most part\nI mean really when you stop to think about it if it's such\nA one man show in many regard as such such a missed opportunity the consumer confidence news I mean\nHow can even be with all the news you see every day if you tune into any drive\nBy outlook even reading the drudge headlines you would think we're on the verge of imploding and yet consumer\nConfidence is at an all time high well that's a reflection of how people living literally living and their and their their thoughts on the future\nAnd his role bus we positive\nHow can that be if everybody's running around miserable in various stages of Faisal is a more defeat\n\nIts it's important it's very uh being positive is a hard thing to do in any circumstance were not hard wired for it human beings are hard wired for pessimism\n\nI've discussed this many times human beings have a natural tendency to defeat ism and fatalistic 'cause it's easier\nUh it leaves the victim hood which of course that's attractive because it always means somebody else's to blame for what didn't happen to you or did the failures or whatever so\nIt's just a natural tendency to tend toward the negative everybody knows how and everybody does it but it takes\nDirect application you have to pause and take stock to actually think positively about things I Do it all the time I'm I'm ... I get myself in the other over something and I'll I'll stop and remind myself\nHow unbelievably fortunate I Am an blessed but the tendency\nIs to be overwhelmed with the things that are disappointing or depressing or angry\nAnd\nFor that reason I it's easy to get caught up in all of the the negative is a ... and we are no doubt in the midst\nOf a serious serious challenge for our country but it shouldn't\nOverride or neck gate\nThe real truth that we still live in America and we still have the greatest opportunity if we want to try to make the most of it and capitalize on it yeah they obstacles may be bigger and there may be more of them but it's still possible because people are doing it every day\nAnd I think the\nElection needs to be looked at in a with a combination of these ways it's a positive opportunity to continue on the corrective path that we're on\nAnd it it it's just better way to live but it takes application to do it when you're bombarded constantly\nWith negative things that I must you know we all are guilty of doing that in a sense because we all want to sound appropriate warnings what's important to keep things in perspective at the same I've got to take a break I shouldn't develop this even more\n... work you're wrong my news on\nWhen you put a safe in your home what would you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one brand of safe you should trust to put in your home and that's right ...\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America what it means you", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Norfolk", "day": "30"}
