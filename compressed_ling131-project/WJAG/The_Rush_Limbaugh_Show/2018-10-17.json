many days in a long time in politics [noise] I'm not breaking out the champagne and I'm not trying to scramble ... before I get my chickens right\nWe still have to improve turnout turnout turnout turnout democratic victory depends on turnout among millennials want on the phone millennials voted in the last midterm we also got to make sure that we get paid way before we can get a blue tie we need these women to when they're wearing says I'm confident not over confident\nYou asked me today well but I Do differently in terms of Democrats our target Latinos our talk of millennials\nOh okay so what what did she do differently\nShe's saying here that Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why is she saying that\nWell because she has the freedom to say it she's not\nAt the moment in the\nIn the hierarchy of the apparatus and it turns out Latinos are far more supportive of Trump Republicans than anybody know according to recent polling data\nThat Democrats are done at the number of Latino those that are signing on with Republicans and Trump the reason they're strong just because they believe that all Latino is\nShould despise anybody who is anti illegal immigration or wants to build a wall the millennial thing I think\nThat's about as voter turnout and she mentions that here everybody talks about the millennials and young people and young people that\nIt just it never ceases to be the case that election day they don't show up\nThey don't show up in the numbers everybody thinks they're going to show up in an every cycle\nThis plays out every cycle we're told the youth vote is fired up this time Mr Limbaugh the youth vote their energetic they're energized they are motivated this is a new day they\nCan't wait and then same old thing happens they don't show up in the numbers that everybody expects them to she's suggesting that that may be the case here the Democrats failed to light a fire onto the Latino thing bothered them and what the Latino thing that actually stands for is immigration\nShe is I I'm I guarantee you like many other Democrats are stunned that immigration remains such a big positive winning issue for Trump and the Republicans and it\nIs it is the issue every Republican running for office eater incumbents or running for the first time needs to be focusing on this issue there is no way it can hurt them\nOut and been in they have

NBC News fine Democrat and GOP voter registrations at the same level as past election cycles\nA but but but but but but but but but\nThe Democrats had Michelle my bell\nOut there during all do a whole big voter registration drive out there the Democrats have been registering voters in prison they've been registering voters at the DMV they've been registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere how in the world is it possible\nThat democratic voter registration levels at the same as pest cycles the Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy\nThere is so much excitement there so much motivation is so much just version of not thinking I'm holding back and yet and yet\nThe generic ballot once again is showing that this massive democratic blue wave is not as big as once thought\nNow NBC is is is very very worried\nThey're worried that something\nThat's not a blue wave may be shaping up here\nThat's what this headline news ... certainly they over a blue wave NBC News lines Democrat GOP voter registration at the same level as past cycles comparing registration activity from twenty fourteen to twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixty inch current\nHelps put these numbers in the context but it should be noted that\nTwenty four team and twenty sixteen include I complete picture\nOf registration from those years\nRestaurant the Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time what that's all you need them if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered in time to vote so it's\nThat seems like a little hope will we don't have all pooled database of numbers for two thousand ha well you've got enough to know\n[noise] so how can this be how can voter registration but Democrats are supposed to be smoking us in voter registration 'cause there's so\nMuch more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake\nThen they\nCall 'em from the Washington Post by Megan McCarthy dull trying to help the Democrats\nAre she believes are morally superior and smarter than

[laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on Muller to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it\nAnd there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump hate mongers on Mueller's team if they had the guns yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIf Mueller doesn't have any of that\nThan there is no way they want this released before the midterms\nThat's why\nThey're linking ... or has it ready they're going to try to take advantage of what they can make people think\nThe report says I remember they have two years no more than that in a two and a half years of Danny reporting that Trump and Russia colluded\nSo in their minds they're probably thinking a sizable number of American voters believes the Trump Russia collusion happens so\nMueller's report is ready to be released soon that create the impression that it's only a matter of time\nBefore Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that way to impact\nVoting in turn out prior to the midterms I'm just going to tell you if this report doesn't advance this narrative that Trump cheated and stole the

I I just don't understand that the drop by media just doesn't get it they're not gonna feel was people that voted for Donald Trump away from Donald Trump\nSaid I Want to understand it's like a you know the magnificent seven uh both guys didn't you know when those guys came up there they didn't they didn't check into who they ... what kind of Christians were Aurora [noise] uh you know if they are\nNot with a a good life they want to somebody did offend them and fight against all the things that we see a which have destroyed the country over the last uh eight to ah ah sixteen years\nWell I don't think that the media is right now focused on separating Trump from his\nA sixteen years well I don't think that the media is right now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late I don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is um I think they're very\nFrustrated they haven't been able to and if they could with the icing on the cake I think their primary objective\nNow is to flood the zone with anti Trump voters Democrats\nMade up of every disparate coalition a group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democrat Party that as a\nCombination coalition of minority here in order to just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance Trump from ah from his voters so the the focus I think is on ... up a first time participation um\nAnd that's why this this is Suzie as the\nThing is so important and the inspiration stuff in the anger so that's why I think that they have strategic may become the party of anger I think they are using this anger and they are exploiting it to generate turnout\nBased on what they think is the majority of Americans don't hate Trump\nI I think that they do move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump\nVoters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they can make that happen to be icing on the cake\nI think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in perusing the\nNews as I Do more and more stories\nThat are starting to raise red flags about the blue wave\nAnd there are some big brush them for for this or doing this on purpose or sucking you we are making you think they are given up they're making you think they're trying to despair either trying to make you think you got it in a bag no they're not going to\nEver pull that off not here not with me\nBut I don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are I Would have that much discipline to be able to have media wide threw out the entire\nLeft wing media universe a disciplined approach to run fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's a legit I've never I've never believed there was gonna be a blue wave\nI never have\nI'm willing to put that out there and I if if I end up being wrong Soviet\nI'm not afraid of being wrong it doesn't happen enough times for me to be worried about it but it's this I have never thought because common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHaven't been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooded the elections in when outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago they had been losing elections they have been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop crop up even they're stupid travel uh order the layers using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda there's some things he hasn't been able to do yet like the total repeal of Obamacare\nBut they have not been able if you you would think all of the things are true people hate Trump regret their vote a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is ... ... the ... wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal opposition to it if the Democrats\nAre right about all this but they're not write about it I I I\nThe evidence on the ground isn't there that there is a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence all over the place the Democrats are Boston and fit to be tied over the fact that they're losing\nA couple of with their their mentality but says winning is their birthright power is their birthright their entitlement but\nElections haven't been going their way how in the world stopped to think if all of this that they're saying is true Hillary would've won in the first Trump will never won in the first place if all this talk of a blue wave right now is true\nThey thought they had it in the bag in two thousand sixteen and they were revved an energized too there was one of the talk of Democrats not turning out back then anyway I'm a little long
