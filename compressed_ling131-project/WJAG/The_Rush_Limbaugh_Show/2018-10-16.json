telling us since the campaign since Trump came down the escalator\nJune of two thousand Fifteen the media has been telling it ... noted experts in the Washington establishment have been telling us that it's Trump just got a self destruct\nSomething's gonna happen in Trump's going to blow up and everybody's going to see who the real Trump is and everybody's going to be shocked and surprised and saddened and then everybody's going to want Trump's swept away but it never happens\nIt never happens in dead if we keep watching his his critics self destruct\nTrump's opponents\nMelt down now practically every day over the fact that Trump isn't melting down\nThey melt down over the fact that they can't make Trump meltdown\nLatest example Pocahontas herself you want to talk about melting down and self destruction you are looking at it\nElizabeth Warren you don't want I think I think there are there are four women here that attempted essentially an October surprise\nAgainst Donald Trump and they've all bombed outweigh Hillary Dianne Feinstein focus on us and who isn't the other there's there's one other woman they move out and things these are in October and all of these I think we're destined to to\nTo destroy Trump and by extension the Republicans\nOf course Dianne Feinstein running the balls the foreign scandal as an October surprise a Hillary Clinton and and and

and yet\nThere isn't a middle Lincoln bit of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand six main presidential election\nFor those of us shouting at me why but we're we're still food so we won the popular vote by three but yeah but\nTwo things about that most of those votes came from California the second thing is that we had a story yesterday that there are three and a half\nMillion\nRegistered voters above the number of bodies\nIn America than about orders are three and a half million more registered voters and there are voters\nWhich means there's all kinds of voter fraud potential fraud taking but but even those who thinks throw them out it doesn't it doesn't cancel the\nFact that the Democrats have been losing elections left and right

them\nIt would have been embarrassing how few people showed up\nThe ones there were big crowds they did in fact bus people in\nThe country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons\nCompanies not waiting with bated breath for what they have to say but look what I Want to return just for a brief moment to this\nThis notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites Nate Silver this is the guru\nDavid analyst on the left\nWho used to be at the New York times and then he went to ESPN and then he\nWent to five thirty eight and then he went to Vioxx and back to five or five thirty eight is his company any took into various places\nAnd the Democrats the rank and file Democrats live and die by what Nate Silver tells him\nFor example Nate Silver on election night two thousand sixty five PM\nGave Hillary Clinton playing an eighty nine percent chance of being elected president\nSo they were all thinking it was over in the same thing is happening now Democrats Seventy three percent chance of retaking the house of representatives\nDemocratic voters breathing a sigh of relief Nate Silver is continuing report that he was on um the FiveThirtyEight dot com politics podcast\nAnd the host was Jody\nAnd the question has the gender gap increased since\nKevin ... a lot of takes on Kavanaugh on the effect that he had are drawn by like male pundits who are in her most social networks right especially for Republicans where the Republican kind of consultant and pollster and an expert community is very male\nJournalists are pretty male has hasn't changed that much maybe a little bit improved\nAfter the conventional wisdom about like the effects Kevin I Will have I think are governed by that a lot in our forecast you now see a clear split between the house and the Senate where the G A piece of a chance to continue to improve but the Democrats house chances actually are back on the upswing now kind of since the Kavanaugh nomination\nA ... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats\nAnd all these house races the Democrats are showing their voters are locks\nThey're too close to call right now there's a whole bunch of them that are too close to call\nThis isn't in the bag for them\nBut they're voters need to be told that it is they've set that up\nThey've been on this blue wave business for so long that if they come off of them even a bit that causes a crisis of confidence among the Democrat voting base and they can't do that but bugs I'm telling you I'm I'm maybe I'm even asking for your input here\nVery briefly again starting in two thousand ten Iraq Obama being done the destruction of the Democratic party as an electoral apparatus they lost twelve hundred seats between two thousand ten and two thousand sixteen\nThey continue to lose seats in the two thousand sixteen race which Trump one which they thought was a walk landslide win for them\nThe last elections that approach what's coming up where the two thousand fourteen midterms Obama one\nWell even when he was on the ballot or the the um the midterms in in that year we're not the grand sweep\nFor Obama that they were ... they were said to be Obama presided over the systematic loss of seats by the Democratic party in two thousand sixteen comes along and Trump wins the presidency and the Democrats have the least amount of electrical power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd from that we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump alone\nHas provided the energy and the imposition of ... and the Democrats\nThe comeback show up and retake everything they lost all the problem with that is\nThe Democrats lost because Republicans won the Republican voters showed up in droves in every one of those men terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve presidential race Democrats continue to lose seats even though Obama won his reelection nobody else the Democratic party\nDid much\nWork bragging about\nSo the Republicans came alive first it was the Tea Party Obamacare and all of the spending to\nEnergize that then it was Lois Lerner the IRS and all the other scandals that came along Benghazi there was nothing that Obama was doing the economy was a flat line if it wasn't if it wasn't deteriorating there wasn't anything Obama was giving away nuclear weapons to the Iranians\nHe was giving away guns to Mexican drug cartels in a back door way\nTo do damage to the second amendment people want to know part of what Obama was doing every chance they had to vote against it they did\nExcept they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component to that was on twelfth and now we're supposed to believe\nThat that trend that sees the Democrats holding the fewest number of electoral seats they've ever had since two thousand in the Nineteen twenties has suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump\nAnd a hatred for who Trump visits hatred for his tweets it's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of its hatred for the way he behaves it's hatred for his hair style it's hatred because it'd be mean spirited what that\nAnd that alone is what the media and Nate Silver telling us all girls this massive Democrats blue wave\nThere is no trend that suggests Democrat blue wave\nPlus Trump is uniting the Republican Party has one more Nate Silver life here from the same pod cast continued now listen\nWe're in this weird zone we're number one I remember we ever had a split in the forecast like this I mean pretty unusual to predict the likelihood of a split is unusual\nWere also I always has been around the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenty zone in both places that makes me nervous and remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like\nThere's a forty percent chance that one of those two predictions will be wrong so you know not quite fifty fifty but\nWe call something a toss up it's forty percent or greater almost a toss up that you'll have one of these forecasts\nAnd I think this for you let me translate this\nThis guy is nervous as he can be he's sweating bullets there's a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong\nThis guy is nervous so she can be he's sweating bullets there's a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong\nHe's admitted he's never\nSeen a split like this he's talking about Democrats\nWinning the house Republicans winning the Senate he is never seen anything like that either of I don't know how to factor\nAnd we consider it a toss up at six forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's telling because he hasn't the slightest idea what's going to happen this election and he's very nervous over the fact that he can't figure out he can analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea what's going to happen here\nNo he didn't want to come up and say it that way\nYou need to have the talent and the expertise to experience that I have to translate these clowns when they start throwing their numbers around and their percentages and stuff but let me just go through this very quickly well you know we're in this weird zone where I don't remember we ever have a split in the forecast like this\nPretty unusual yeah a lot of things wrong usual this time aren't they need to be like usual since two thousand sixteen hasn't it\nTo predict the likelihood of a split is unusual we um you know I always say when we're in the age each one of his own\nAnd we're now in the eighties twenties on in both places that makes me nervous\nMeaning age twenty Republicans keep the Senate eighty twenty Democrats when the house\nAnd makes me nervous eighty twenty that's as close to a lot of it makes me nervous\nWe're now in the eighties twenties on on both sides of this\nRemember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really\nThere's no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means it like there is a forty percent chance at one of those two British is going to be wrong\nWell there is a pretty good indication of Democrats are not going to win the Senate\nAnd he's saying its impact we don't win the Senate ah when the how\nHe doesn't know he's nervous\nHis analysts telling you if it's
