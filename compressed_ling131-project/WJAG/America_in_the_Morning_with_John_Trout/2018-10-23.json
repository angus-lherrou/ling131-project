level\nComing up on Nineteen till we continue our look at the election day two weeks from today here's Jim go hand in\nThe mid term elections are very close now and we have taken a look at the electorate from a variety of perspectives we thought this morning we would do so from the standpoint\nOf the fastest growing segment of the electorate and one of the largest groups in our electric the Latino vote or there are more than ... million Latinos eligible to vote nationwide the makeup twelve point eight percent of all eligible voters and of course\nIn some most states notably places like a\nA California Texas Florida and elsewhere they make up a large percentage of the the total voting population\nWe're talking with a key late ... he was founder and CEO of ... wealthy uh helps the Latino executives an entrepreneur is to pursue a their economic dreams in this country and I'm just curious some thoughts\nAbout what we can say about this through first of all it strikes me that it is rather inaccurate referred to as the Latino vote as if there was only one uh you certainly wouldn't confuse Cuban Americans with Mexican Americans with Puerto Ricans et cetera\nYeah that's the three headed monster or many edit monster that there are so many different points of view also the difference between the first generation immigrant generation and beyond that how many different so there is no less you know block\nYou know out of certainly the African American vote has been pretty reliably democratic for the past uh uh three quarters of a century or if it's only say Ninety percent for the Democratic party that's an unusual year or the Latino vote again to the extent that we can refer to it as an overall\nVaries considerably there are times certainly uh uh for example a a former president and before that the governor of Texas that George W. Bush did rather well among Latino voters are for a Republican so that this can be done\nAbsolutely I mean look at Texas look at California uh George Bush had the advantage that he lives in Texas all his life on the third the Mexican population there along with the other Latino copyright issues there are a great advantage for him and helped carry him to the currency\nWe would also take note of a ... a big issue and it's a big issue for everybody the issue of immigration more precisely put the issue of illegal immigration which is really what's at stake\nAnd that is a a big issue again for everybody\nBut I'm Wondering the extent to which you feel it is a predominant issue for the Latino population because after all day two of us worry about\nA good schools for their kids they worry about crime taxes the whole panoply of issues that affect everybody is the immigration issue and in particular as we speak now this a caravan of some three or four thousand Central Americans heading for the United states it is that in your view\nA bigger issue among Latino voters that among the rest of us\nI think uh the immigration policy the immigration issue is a big issue but it's not as big as per se education a quality of life of crime and some of the other factors that you mentioned\nI note of the fact that we live in a world of nation states\nAre there are those we would decry that and I would certainly admit that there are downsides to the nation state but at this stage in the world a sociology ... pretty much the options are the nation state or ... or or some other form of a of tribe ballistic societal breakdown\nUh that's that's the way of the world and there is no a one world are we do not all hold hands and we do not all sing ... in that context or it is my view that a nation state has not only the right about the responsibility to determine\nBy whatever basis it decides however arbitrarily who gets into a country how many for how long and for what reasons now an enlightened country in my view will do so based on what's best for the host country\nBut that is up to the host country at an aside that I saw in California some months back that is incorrect it said immigration is right no it is not a you may argue it should be I Would argue to the country but it's not a right your thoughts\nYou know I I you you look back to that sign on site integration is right and I'm Wondering if the person or had a problem with the language where it's got to admit the immigration is right maybe it's a right to happen or what have you on a going back to your question you know\nWe definitely have to put together both sides of the I have to get together put together some policy a rule of law or such and start talking to each other again to put together something that makes sense and doesn't have people in seven Twenty years\nThat's another another point that I think is important to point out and we did a show on this uh some time back or what Mr ... just said can
