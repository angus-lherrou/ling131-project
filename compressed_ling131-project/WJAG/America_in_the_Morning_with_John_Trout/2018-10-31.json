ride that are out there and the holiday travel in the in general\nHow big a deal is that how big an industry is would for a Halloween thrill rides and what kind of a spectacular special effects are available these days\nAbout Thirty years ago this really was unheard of the only the uh the southern portion of the Bible belt\nOr Mexico land or Six Flags over Texas that nowadays you can find some of the best Halloween uh uh I I guess the facts and\nAnd different uh different events at places like universal studios are not scary farm and California Kenny ... and ... west ... um I guess I'll Halloween weekend cedar point which Sandusky, Ohio and of course Disney is going to be doing the Mickey not so scary Halloween parties which are great at both ... and\nOf course a scare winds its heroines in ... in North Carolina and or in Williamsburg you've got how this scream so there's a lot of it has become very big business and people just love going to these events\nSo I guess age appropriate message is important for many of these things right I mean you you can't a scare the daylights out of the some kid who's five years old\nThrough and the great part about the amusement parks whether it's summertime wintertime or even Christmas Time is that there's something for everyone at these parks you got the the really crazy rides for the kids you've got the smaller ride\nTo the uh you know for the toddlers you've got an caustic shows where everybody really has to audition in order to actually be picked up the food or you know the different types of food and plus for the older people they they ... now a because normally takes about four or five miles of walking\nTo visit entire park so these are these are ways that the whole family could come together in a very short period of time and and make memories\nYou've got the uh been there done that syndrome or people get bored easily and so I guess there's a a never ending escalation plus you got to go out do your competitor and the result is that I Would have to think that some of these rides\nWind up asking even things as as tough as a as steel and concrete to do things that maybe they weren't designed to do short question how dangerous are these rides\nThese rides a pretty safe I mean if you go back to the turn of the century at Coney Island where there were a lot of injuries and it's gotten much safer technology is actually surpassed or are these injuries in fact you are very rarely hear of an incident when it does occur\nAnd amusement park or any type of the year uh it's usually on the news so you don't hear them very often and you really have about a one and two hundred and fifty million sense of being involved and they say ... ad and amusement park and added that\nNinety five percent of those incidents that will be writer Aaron not the actual the amusement park but something that the writer did a that was not something that would they needed to do or were told not to do during the ride\nOverrides based on the old aspects of pop culture like video games or or movies like like say Ghostbusters or other other rides based around these things\nYou'll find a ride based on most of the uh marvel and DC Comics of course Batman you'll find several of those all around you've also got a\nAll the rides but Spider Man for example or you've got a rock and roller coaster which is\nA geared towards the Aerosmith uh people who loved Aerosmith uh it's a very big way to draw people in\nIs to make it after a movie or a comic or something that uh that people can actually uh you know in get involved and and most importantly while you're waiting to go to these rides there's a nice Q line so you can see the story unfold\nBefore you actually ride the roller coaster so that's been a big thing in in a big plus for amusement parks to actually draw people in\nWhat am I an indoor rides or does that exist and we play football indoors now\nIndoor rides are amazing and one of the best and
