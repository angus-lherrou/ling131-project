Schweitzer he's president of big government accountability Institute a number one New York times best selling author a consultant and now the producer of a documentary the documentary is titled the creepy line and it's about Google what's this about breeder\n[noise] uh it's about Google's ability not only to invade our privacy which a lot of people are aware of but that invasion of privacy and the information they collect on us allows them to manipulate us in steer us\nIn ways that we don't even know and that has implications not only for a American society bought for how we choose our leaders and the politics of the country it's at Central I think to where we're going over the next ten to Twenty years\nHave crossed the line in terms of the anti trust laws\nI think they clearly have they engage an anti competitive behavior or because of the way that the Internet is regulated or or divided up between the\nSo called neutral platforms and media companies they've gotten a free pass in terms of regulation because they insist that they are neutral platforms and therefore they have no legal liability they have no regulatory controls whatsoever\nBut the fact of the matter is they are not neutral platforms they do admit that they exert editorial control or that they do I'm a ... certain stories and push other stories so I think that this calls for a fresh look at how we deal with Google and I think\nPart of that fresh ... has to be looking at antitrust action they dominate roughly Ninety percent of global search in the United states it's eighty five and Ninety percent and that to me is a dominant position that's anti competition\n[noise] the the people at Google mistaken actually maintain the pretense of they don't play favorites uh with uh uh various postings and I gather that the that is simply not borne out by an awful lot of examples to the contrary\nWell that's right I mean just take a local search or commercials search uh about ten years ago companies like Yelp and trip advisor accused them of cooking the books and search in favor of competitors to those companies that happened to be owned by Google Google said no we don't do that these search results organic\nThere's simply reflective of the best results that that all our algorithm provides\nBut the problem for Google is that the Federal Trade commission and the Obama administration the European Union academics at Harvard all looked at this and said you're lying\nYou are cooking the books there's additional research that's been done by Dr Robert ... of Harvard th the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine or he's done peer reviewed studies on what's called search engine manipulation of fact and he demonstrates the power that Google has\nTo manipulate results even in the political realm so as far as I'm concerned that debate is over the question becomes how we deal with this power that Google has in a way that is protective of the country but it's also fair to the fact that\nGoogle is a successful company and and they build great products um and and they have certain rights as a company as well\nNow over a century ago of course there was a great deal of trust busting that occurred in this country at groups like the the sugar trust in the railroad trust them to steal trust these these uh uh the the standard oil a trust these were the ... successfully broken

and age of course I suppose a Google can operate from uh\nFrom anywhere the Gobi Desert for Pete's sake if they if they chose to do I mean I I don't I'm Wondering if geographically there are problems in considering a Google as under the quote jurisdiction of the United states\n[laughter] no I think that's a great point I mean Google would say that there are a global company they have a presence or around the world to 'em and it's very possible that if the regulatory a foot was dropped on them that they would say we're moving to Singapore and we are now a company based in Singapore and therefore\nThe regulatory you're anti trust actions of the federal government don't apply to us you also have the added problem too though the gym that when they went after standard oil\nI'm imagining that contract standard oil control Ninety percent of the newspapers in the United states at the top\nUh in in a sense that's kind of power that Google has so it's going to be a real fight if they take this won't touch us action which I think they should\nGoogle are they going to use their power to shift and control information to limit what the American people actually know about this anti trust
