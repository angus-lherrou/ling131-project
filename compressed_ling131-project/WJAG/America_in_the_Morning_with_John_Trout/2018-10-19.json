Hanna\nIs that time again flu season and so let's talk a bit about it and just while we can expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control doctor leads the gross golf a lot of girls go up or what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say oh we can never really predict for the coming season what it's going to be like how severe it is going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October\nUm but right now we just can't predict what the coming seasons going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it is going to be\nExactly for those who say well uh I was vaccinated last year I was vaccinated in twenty Thirteen there\nWas something they need to realize and that is a a flu viruses are very sneaky food with cheap strange regardless\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change on flu viruses change constantly\nUm and that's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season into the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be the thing that we're going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year\nLet's look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nYes so last season the two thousand Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's through your seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths\nUm we had one hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season and one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um\nThe activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um\nAll of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're going to see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant above flu and that is that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely\nTo develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have debts and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um those under five years of age particularly is under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nI'm older said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with some chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young adults\nCan get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there are more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this year um the two basic types if you\nWant to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have on the nasal spray vaccine shots\nAre given with a needle generally and they are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been an activated and killed so it can cause disease and then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't\nMultiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all competing to make that choice ah ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm ...\nOne of the many things that very about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status how good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another\nUm so the most important thing people can do is talk to their health care provider about what vaccines they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions we can take against flu or it seemed like every year we were told be sure to always wash your hands a lot\nWell CDC recommends a sort of a three part strategy for preventing flew um and also severe illness from flu and one of those things is to um get vaccinated every year if you're within the age group that's recommended\nI'm the second and and this is one that can help not just with flu but with a lot of the other respiratory viruses that circulate around the same time flew does um that's a\nEveryday preventive strategy is things like avoiding contact with sick people washing hands covering cops if you get sick yourself I'm avoiding contact where you can spread of germs to other people those can help again not just with flu but with other respiratory viruses and finally um\nIf you do get flu and\nYour doctor prescribes flu anti viral medicines take those medicines\nAnd I I Would like to know again the age groups considered most susceptible to the blue\nChildren under five years especially those under two within the the children age group the younger you get the higher your susceptibility has to getting really sick and sixty five an older\nAnd I think that to to find out more once you go to the website the C. D. C. dot Gov slash blue is that right\nCorrect there's a wealth of information there for health care providers um non professionals and um it can be very helpful\n[noise] are there other factors about flu that I've not brought up that we should remind people about is the season gets really go and\nI I think really the most important thing to remember is um vaccinations important tried to get vaccinated by the end of October because typically that told me the activity start to pick up it takes a couple of weeks to develop antibodies once you get your vaccines are not going to be protests\nTry to get vaccinated by the end of October because typically that told me the activity start to pick up it takes a couple of weeks to develop antibodies once you get your vaccines are not going to be protected right away um but another important thing to remember is that even if you don't get vaccinated by the end of October November December January\nEven February not too late\nDr Lisa gross cough medical officer with the Centers for Disease Control the website again C.
