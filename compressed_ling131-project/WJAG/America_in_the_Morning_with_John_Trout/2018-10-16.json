that there's such a book even has to be written do we really have to explain why we fight\nUm fortunately we do off the eight years under Obama where the president stuck with an apology tour type trying to blame all the world's ills on the United states a world which created helped create the rise of ISIS\nRemote to relieve rebuild authorized China or Russia that felt comfortable to invade his neighbors yes unfortunately it is time to remind everybody why it is that we fight than the the the stories of the heroes who have fought for this nation\nIs it always necessary to fight a war that involves a shooting at one another you you take note of for example in the book why we fight that we won the Cold War without firing a shot can that be replicated in the twenty first century\nUh yes indeed this is talk some soup called the ultimate victory is a winning without five things so it's it's psychological warfare its influence operations and during the Cold War\nSo we did a lot of counter propaganda operations and that's exactly what we need to do today we have to de legitimize the totalitarian\nMessage of our enemies be ice this'll be the Iranians or anybody else so yes it it can be done and the good news is we have done it before\nWhen you appeared on my nighttime talk show last night uh there was some callers who were curious about the U.S reaction\nTo the disappearance

the president fully understand the the Saudi Government\nOr your take on how the United states is handling that whole thing and the extent to which it is even a a vital U.S interests and she is not an American citizen\nYeah it's sort of vital us interest but it is the way that\nThe nation such as Saudi Arabia behaves off that calls itself a friend and promises to change its ways a is important I think the president has done exactly the right thing by deploying one of his toughest cabinet members\nAh Mike Pompeo first in his closet West Point and a former director of the CIA by sending him to Saudi Arabia this week he sent a very clear message to the king that ah we needed explanation even if this person is is not a U.S citizen\nThis law how a nation that calls itself a friend is meant to be have so I expect some of us has to be forthcoming very very rapidly from Saudi Arabia\nYou know in the book why we fight the current discussion about object the truth and subjective truth I've always felt that the term subjective truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nAbsolutely right but I thought it was so very telling from the uh Kavanaugh hearings how you had more than one of the Democrats that are just starting with Cory Booker use the phrase\nThe truth when talking about the testimony of adult before there is no such thing as a truce or his troops there is only one truth but this is the law you tell yourself and if you are right they post modern\nBut multi cultural relative is done on the truth is that can only be one version of the truth otherwise the woods truth\nCeases to have any real meaning\nIn terms of of this war we must be prepared to fight and win is modern more conventional or unconventional or both\nA great question you have to read the whole book why we fight to get the full of a conventional war is the anomaly big state on state war such as World War two is normally most of the battles we see today involved irregular warfare whether it's sub state
