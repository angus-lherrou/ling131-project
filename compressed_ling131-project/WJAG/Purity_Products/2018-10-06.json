since they are black they hold some solar there's some old solar each game in the brush itself so it does actually\nI'm slow down the process of and I stay in fact some people that have been stolen so it'll eliminate the problem of having ice dams yeah good point good boy bite your smart guy no it was just asking all kinds of just ask questions well that that brings me up to this\nTrees in the summertime trees minimize solar heat gay in our homes because of the shade decree we all know the benefits of tending under the tree on a hot dog is day three laws is not lightening the another good point by really on did they miss so much you're really\nOn the day I'm you've had and you had a show on about a\nFavorite tree and everybody has a different opinion but if somebody wanted a good shade tree\nUm that was real durable\nI'm ... and you can't have everything so I'm not going to say and it grows tall and like three years um but you know his decent rate of growth what would be some of your favorites\nYou know and again your show being so spread out across the country you know you really have to look and see your particular zone a year in ... and that's going to make things very little bit but I'll tell you the symmetries we look at it or are we talking about our show pretty much used a lot of the different zones use much you get down into Florida whatever\nBreak a ... and you know I think today in today's world nobody wants to wait\nYou know you don't plan forward for you you just want it and I want something with your mental realistically you know it is amazing though\nIn today's world nobody wants to wait\nYou know you don't planet forward for you you just want it and I want somebody realistically you know it is amazing\nHow fast treated or how sad time goes around\nIt does yeah robust but looking at a tree but if you want a fast growing tree lot of times they are in a very good tree to use All right so there's off to it and then Kennedy or raking or they don't last as long but there's a series of maples ... that was developed probably ten twelve years ago he only has about twelve years ago\nUm called the freemans series and I think autumn blaze is one of the first ones came up with a ... there are a hybrid between a red maple and the silver maple I Would never recommend silver maples anybody\nLifespan shorter lifespan fast growing but real weak with it you know just a lot of issues\nBut here we got the best of both worlds red maple with great fall color harder would great branching habit great structure of the tree with a faster growing tree of the silver and then they called the Freeman's selections and on and blaze is one of the first Sienna Glenn came after that\nFantasy celebration there are several of them out there right now but here's a tree really impressed with\nAnd it was the urban says the um uh the ... the municipal Arbor society tree of the year about ten years ago when that right after they first came out\nBut they forty five fifty feet high forty five feet wide so good sized tree so good for streets strictly a street tree or or for a larger yards but fairly quick pace as far as giving you something a reasonable amount of time so this particular series is called Freeman this particular series of of these hybrid maples really\nComing on strong and a lot of folks use them in a wide range of zones they do a very good job so ah actual tree there you know one of my favorites\nAnd I and I to trees that are my favorites get go which\nGrows about anywhere and baroque which grows about anywhere but they're both very slow growers\nI heard some of your experts talking about baroque um I don't know what a baroque\nIs you know there are so many great oaks advance their baroque when you look at it has a huge relief\nI was just going to guess that the one with the big Lee yeah looks like a federal a\nPretty good size cause you get hit with one you know you got hit with what it is a very masculine very bold\nVery wide horizontal branching tree rounded out crown takes a while to get any size or when they do it's a majestic tree that you'll never forget when you see it because it's absolutely outstanding but gang country great history behind ... or the fans shaped Lee's grateful color to re trees there and I'll tell you the other one is really\nBecoming more and under used but becoming more popular and that's dawn redwood now this is a regular redwoods clip destroys just like the other ... so redwoods that grow ... yep rewrite or wet so have you got a bargain though actually growing up in a moist area\nBut darn redwood and it gives you it's a it's a deciduous conifer so he loses the needles at the end of the year but\nYou know here though it doesn't have leaves us got\nNice got needles but in great shape tree great larger growing tree being used more and more all the time and then like I say the needles actually drop at the end of the season they're not as thick and breakdown faster than pine or a ruse would but that is becoming very very popular and rightfully so\nHow about the speed of growth on that says it\nAll their fan yeah once they get started there very fast grower\nSo again gives you something a reasonable time and and you think it's an evergreen and it is and how did I mention that Ron I don't I don't know I mean are you using that a lot yeah landscape and yeah I mean you'll see that in ... in Ireland plant things in parking lots you see that now as a street tree I'm given a plenty of room to grow\nBecause these are big they get they get huge but it's a it's an actual redwood any adjust so well all different types of soil isn't that great trees so CNN when used a lot more out there as well\nI guess I gotta quit looking at all the houses in the entry way and start paying attention ... we have a new one on me to contractors\nAnd even some landscaper sometimes you just get locked into a certain palate er trees and they don't look at what else is available out there you really if you if you if you have a house that has no trees it'll do your homework do investing visit two or three nurseries visit two or three guards and see what they suggest see what's out there and is what's available\nAnd of course plant that you can go you know right up to the holiday season with no problem well as long as that grabs on for a long time of year right implant anytime during the year so you know you can go you know it's up to you as long as they're available to plant so I was workable you can get out their plan and I always tell folks to things when you're looking at a new home\nGet the turf established wherever your lawn is going to be because if you want to get that's your base\nAnd plant trees and evergreens first forget about the ... the foundation forget about the patio planting\nPlant trees and evergreens first they take the longest amount of time\nTo develop and do anything for you five years minimum they started to get any effect on them so plant those first come back to your patio planned things in your foundation planting later because you know two years your foundation Bryce filled in may fill in the mail is likely to do the trees and do my evergreens first and then you're good screen plant they get those in right away\nTurf obviously very important to Burr Oak and wrote on red engaged or my two favorites for bigger trees but Don redwood and I'll get the Freeman's selections of the uh red maples okay it's a hybrid\nI think that's what I put my backyard and about three years ago I I Am very lately from a formula you know what's funny if you look at how we fall colors pass for you look at that that fall colors they last longer than things that are flower mhm you think about him yeah

got to replace it and it's really not super out of style or anything if you're going you know so that's why I say that but I I wouldn't do anything under twelve mill\nOkay thank you how do you have

the tests are up to it and it's sad that power coming ... but there's no I Can't get there nothing coming out of the yellow lab when I plug stuff they did\nIt that the power went up so I replaced it with I just I had an on another outlet and how the electrical outlet with burned out far replaced with one that was working before I went and bought another one and that one doesn't work so I'm just I'm trying to figure out what's going on\nAnd what do you have do you have the electricity coming through the wires to the outlet\nAccording to the ah ... the little being ... it'd be you know when it's hot if they have the power coming to it I don't know maybe I'm getting some venom power from something else\nBut they're not being up around it but when I close\nMy computer into it or radio no power is is I'm going to add to that um device\nWell I Would probably have a check further quite honestly by an electrician I mean if you're having power through the wires I I Can't tell you if you're

warm they're not supposed to be warm\nAnd it doesn't ... you know loose wire in a screw will create warmth in could produce a fire that's why we have companies electricians that do electrical inspections on the outlets themselves but uh you know I I don't know what's causing but if you have power\nCome in through the wires and going in the outlet I I don't know why that's not unless it's protected um gym five protected I I don't know it's one of the things we try not to get too much into is electricity on this because a lot of it is just a process of elimination an inspection
