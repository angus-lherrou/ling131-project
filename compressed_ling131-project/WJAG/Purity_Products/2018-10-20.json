think you're grinding is going to be effective and that's lab is thick enough and it's going to be successful and be less expensive\nOkay that was the second question I got is that one nice or to slabs rose uh [noise] we had two problems that habit one is that for a perpendicular construction joint the construction going spoiled then it's probably at the crack probably maybe about\nInch max someplace to just three quarters of an inch and probably about an inch and a half White House ...\nAnd that's the way from the joint or just on the edge of the joint\nIt it starts at the joint and then go back in ah probably about thirty forty feet\nOr you could do that with a type of mortar I'd talked about a political zip it mortar which has a um it it may not be enough he may have to just go with mortar and just added in east of do it\nBut the zip it mortar is designed to have the slump where it can be applied to a vertical surface okay it also has a bonding age and then it it's a three ... three pound big un water and you kinda need it like baking\nAnd I think the limitation is death is a half inch ah it's a quick ... called ... mortar\nZip it who makes that quick\nGreat great huh\nOkay and that that wouldn't work what would I Do what I had a inch or that\nYou'd have to do two layers of it okay [noise] yeah it's only a designed to go half inch thick\nAnd and other than that you just use regular a mortar\nMortar and then make sure you again you're using a um a a in a nice of a concrete it eats of that can be painted on to the existing concrete you can also be mixed into the mortar like act grill sixty six where it'll blow on to the existing concrete\nOkay and that's a regular masonry more lesser mhm\nOkay then the second problem I got what those slapstick in various areas we got cracks and they very any thing from sixteen to an ... to ah see a quarter inch how would you feel low\nUm it's probably too thin\nTo use like a year thing crack sealer so you could use and acrylic resident crack sealer again a quick creep product is called ... it's a court jug it's already mixed in ants and acrylic resident that can be just a applied into the crack at self leveling\nM. sixteens of an inch might be a challenge to get it in\nBut it is water soluble when wet where you can actually you know wipe it into the crack a is certainly feel quarter inch cracks when you get up to a half inch you'd probably be into more of a year thing self leveling crashed there but that one's called crack CEO\nRex you okay All right that takes care of it\nThey All right mark
