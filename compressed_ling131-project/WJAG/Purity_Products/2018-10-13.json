the right time to play you know get an extra seasons like rooting if you plant\nAnd that's the whole thing with that that is the bottom line of planning in the fall more roots are developed in the fall with any other time the rest of the year to proven fact September October November and into December till the temperatures get into the thirties\nRoots continue to develop so that's that the plants shut down on the top they know for the roost at that time to start to develop more so when you plant in the fall you get a little bit of a jumpstart on next spring\nAnd the other thing to think about too is if you don't like you the plane and we get you get your red bud planted a few of the things this fall mhm now those are already in the ground rooting in ready to go next spring what are you going to be doing\nSitting back relaxing I liked that I'm On the plants are you already planted in the fall and do their thing next spring\nYou know what though what\nThat red but yeah\nI Love
