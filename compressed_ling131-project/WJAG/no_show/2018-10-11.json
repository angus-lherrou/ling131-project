CBS Sports and I see what I thought was pretty reasonable question which is\nAre the browns close to being a playoff team going to be a playoff team this year and he laughed he thought that was sort of ... ridiculous I'm On the other side of this ... how do you view your football team in terms of what you guys can do this season\nUh you know I think that we can compete with a with anything ah I feel copying them our guys on I'll feel confident in this organization that as long as we can do a ... who were going to do and we're going to prepare like ...\nAre we going to go each day at a go out there if I mess up the anger ... ... a delicate Leeper\nChristian currency here on the show Christian you've been in Cleveland since two thousand fourteen you've got new quarterback you've got some new coordinators obviously last year did not want a football game you've already won two this year\nWhat is different about the Cleveland Browns into that as an Eighteen versus the Cleveland Browns last season\nWhere I think that it are are they were a free agency I'm you know the guy that you know I got on board Jarvis a high rise or Carlos Hyde you know they're very radical guys like that is a guy or how to where we are definitely a good cleared and a half\nGreat leadership um I think for office and the coaches are\nThey're all over the fact that you know everybody is here I Know you know ... or you go there like that everybody your car to wear and I think what we did putting their favorite gathered they put together like minded man\nThat's man who who's going to go out there and give it their all throughout their feet\nAnd go out there or be bought and it all together and they have to agree to you know why we're doing what we're doing right now so I was just trying to build on it or we ought to get to ... you know to lower body we want to talk with a word and going about it you say they're trying to get better\nChristian what was it like going through hard knocks and just knowing that they may not use it but then every moment of every day was on film HBO chose to go with it\nAll you know at first it was kinda weird or have the cameras around or where you are you having like\nPersonal conversations or you know uh just does not have cameras is the ... in your fans I bet it was kinda\nIt was kinda weird adjusting so that but then after a while I realize that they're they're you know you just kinda went about today went about practicing exist so they're not out there so you have to adjust to it the first couple of days after that you got used to\nBrowse linebacker Christian currency here on the show of course I don't want to get to find so so I Want to talk in more generalities here but there's been a lot of complaints about\nThe fishing this year we've been pretty hard on the officials and at least from my perspective I thought you guys came out agree just on the wrong end of what looked to me like a first down in the end of the game against the raiders\nHow difficult was losing that particular football game given all of the things that happen for that for that al even come about\nI mean you know it was so cruel to swallow a anytime you lose football game or you feel a certain type of work or maybe we know that uh\nYou know become such a way of bucket called by this football you know you have some ... you know I won't go forty so I'm about to get you know just to not make the game that close to go and um\nYou know we can't really complain about too many cars or we'd be a good ... years ago I played football without find a way where and in a way to make better players and knock wood I serve it if you're a\nChristian outside of outside of the browns excluding your own team and I know there's a lot of good choices to choose from but so far ... who's ... who's the toughest competition who's the best team in the AFC North\nOh that's kinda hard that's kinda hard to say I'm I'm In\nKansas City is clear playing a at a high level you know they're they're offering to definitely lower the bar the atmosphere a Home Depot is is that the site and watch it I think that a lot of things and again the quarterbacks door\nUh but you know a ramp up after yourself [noise] ah I I say the chief of the road right now so I'm ... forever\nBigger Mayfield obviously got the nod the weeks ago earlier in the season to to be the guy and we're to rod Taylor's fans here on on the show is well the beggars been really impressive what is it\nMeant to the football team what is bigger brought to the football team that tell you guys when some of the games\nAre he's in a better you know uh when he's out on a practice you know he's out there competing is out there you know a high energy in our guide is not afraid to make mistakes\nAnd I think that's the biggest key is when you think about making a mistake chances you'd probably going to do it but I think you go out there so loose and just saying like hey I'll Try to make the players I'm gonna make you know as football you got to make mistakes you've gotta learn from the quick have a short term memory I think that's something that you get it you know I used to go out there and just how far\nAnd I really enjoy playing the game which is out there and if you make a mistake you got to go to the next play and he's got the law is whether this\nIs all happening as back so once you get comfortable doing that now describe limit or that's what he's doing you know each and every game you're not going to get more ... more confident that guy that something that's how I especially for working quarterback could be a copy of this year's\nA you know you you definitely do work we're\nTalking the browns linebacker Christian currency here on the show a Christian you have one of the biggest personalities I've ever been around in my life as your or ... you know I'm going right your defense coordinator agreeing Williams is a is a big personality what's it like planned on one of his events is being a linebacker\nUnder his uh his command under his leadership on the defensive and\nI mean ... with ... or you know he ... record or you know he has the advantage that would be a ... you know a great correct manner and worried that [noise] but ah you know is is very very aggressive so like\nThe way he car causing the game or you could out and if this is real cool because you do you know situations that day I got to think about are ready to cause you to get a caller who after you had a game going now you know if you've ever going to college but\nJust because you you you did that chemistry and you understand each other apart the level you know you you could be around you you bring a lot of energy you makes you match or energy you know and uh it definitely definitely push you to the show on this something that was good to be correlated with ... guys\nWho to blame because they didn't even know ... ... ...\nOver the course of a two hour stint what would have more F bombs just hanging out with with with Gregg Williams was like watching the quitting parenting a movie\n[laughter] you know gee do you have to have a a doesn't know if you you have any time or this is the law [laughter]\n[laughter] ... here on the show I I'm ... and we you know we call it a a a pretty can a glimpse of it on a hot dogs\nAnd you said he's not afraid to go after guys he's not afraid to to use the words you're not going to use it at Sunday service he he's not afraid to to to be aggressive did that play well with everybody or do you have to be a certain kind of competitor in football player for\nFor that approach not to put you off\nOr you know everybody is different you know or some guys can handle that approach\nSome guy cat a but with with the grid you know you just want players who can who can at that okay\nYou know go through any type of diversity or you can get through you know how how much a gift if\nYou want you to push a comfortable position so that you can learn how to handle yourself or in the right man I Want to feel it in a panic or not you know are getting out there to receive all guys really can take it and I think that's what you do about defense on I was ever vantage with our teachers are guys who do things the guys play\nAnd may play a factor that nothing so uh I think the guys in the rural definitely can handle it but I'm not sure if I had lived there [laughter]\nThere's here on the show Christian one of the storylines one of the interesting turns to the NFL\nHas been its implementation and its interpretation of abruptly in the past the rules the helmet to helmet rule and just how as a defensive player like yourself a linebacker like yourself you're supposed to go about doing your job within the confines of the rules and we've noticed when we talk on the show\nIt just seems from a distance like when quarterbacks not just for being taken down when you guys are trying to get to the QB\nIf you have at least ten thousand

I'll love you got the ... I have a number\nYou can win a championship with events that are running game the Aggies brilliant and I hope you run into risky eight five five to one to four CBS haven't heard from\nThe guys it on this topic mentioned earlier got ... got a lot of calls for the love of the five five two on two for CBS to go back to the producer does a great job sewer go back CBS on Twitter\nMr Tom ... co producer underscore Tom the man behind it depends\nStuart we got\nSober excluding the raiders from this since ... number one right I mean you make the decision but yeah it's like they're really close to being the best team to ever squander a whole bunch of money and the hope of every single fan\nBut it's more of a it's more of a\nNot so much that is like\nOkay so excluding them definitely the rams achieves wanted to and for me third I Would put the saints they've just really press feeder off and they get marking are back now reads looks great has a lot of weapons so I'm going to go with the same circles stews name notice is you want the same way as I grew\nUp ... producer right there I'm going to be dumb producer I'm gonna go rams cheap like everyone else I gotta go ... and I know but like I don't think that is a disaster and\nShame on them for entering another season with him but I just think we're talking about the team team around him is the third best team they just have a quarterback problem I'll also say that the ... the second highest number one and plus minus right now ... says the rams no surprise plus Seventy five you know the second highest scoring plus minus the biggest I mean let me let me guess um\nRavens you got it now that the Baltimore Ravens ...\nAre usually better trivia but I knew that they held opposing teams are ridiculous number of points\nEven when they're winning they're usually never ... I made ... one week\nWhat was his duty as ... as against buffalo I think they had a forty lying points\nYeah because we're all in all ... got receivers maybe now that he's got some receivers it'll go better\nEthic rats are they going to their three into as well though right yeah\nI don't have the jak I'll just say this the Leonard for net\nInjury makes me really nervous he's already been ruled out this upcoming week and I think there is talk about him maybe being out as late as weak tent\nSo he'll come back but I just I just think he's a critical part of what they do\nI don't either jak so that's a bowl\nIt is it the way they even I really shouldn't be and the other thing is really not that bad without for net but I think for them to take the next step as an offense where they need to be where Blake needs to go to to really be good enough to get to the super bowl yes they need a healthy Leonard ... and they need everybody clicking but if they got that\nI mean would anybody doubt that they would win the AC at least at least be the next team there with the chiefs\nNot as mad at them as other people are about board all because he says\nAffordable quarterback and they've got a lot of kept issues as it relates to\nThose guys on defense they have to pay however\nI'm looking at here they drafted in this draft at\nTwenty nine so\nWhat quarterback came so they had an accident could take a Lamar Jackson yep you're not going to take medicine and author\nSo do you really believe I would've taken me there are you love me some yeah but that's me I'm the only one so you think if you think of Mason Rudolph\nFor the quarterback of that team to be ready to\nGo right now and that's the problem you have the thing is it's also very similar to the style of Blake it's almost like replacing Blake was Blake at first didn't even hoping that developed to be better but for right now actually think I'm already been a great pick you didn't even need to rush out the door but you just have something else\nTo add into the ... when when they had those inevitable times when it stagnant play can't complete anything\nWell put in some speed putting some athleticism and see and maybe you know maybe the market of taking the job from\nLike he has a real move like the problem is for sort of where they sell their success last year they had to get into what the top ten in order to get one of the one of the four quarterbacks Randall ten yeah yeah so it's just you're just right away multiple draft picks in the years ahead and you've got a cap situation that's really disconcerting over the next few years and\nThat wasn't happening they also tried to get teddy though it could have gotten Bridgewater at a discount also\nThat is true I mean but but then you're sort of you're relying on a guy that has is injury prone so there was this concern 'cause you're gonna ... if you're doing that there is this concern that your backup situation is going to do with your bag I I don't have the bottles move\nHe was actually decidedly okay last year but the problem is he's you know his ranges somewhere between a C. plus\nOn the high end and an F failing grade on the low end right I get it\nI just it makes it work by the way\nWasn't shocked me the giants win the super bowl wouldn't shock me I wouldn't you know wasn't shocked me the way the browns won the Superbowl I Would just be like oh my God how did this happen\nIt would not shocked me even as constructed that they got it done or we'd ask the trains running Nikki his top three teams buddy isn't here and we have to explain them you can't say Penn State and intervene over and over again for an NFL segment so and that will just give you a Christian courteous perspective on one of the controversy is\nA guy that worked in the show who went to Penn State says the Penn State fan but also Notre Dame fan your big tank guy can you know Dame fan and a Penn State fan at the same time\n[noise] no no way out of this a puppy that's good [laughter] I actually don't think it's possible\nI Love everything about does it change nobody ever knows what he's walked into into on the show never ever um I I Want to take a quick quick moment and we'll get back to some of the folks who joined us earlier and really appreciate Christian Kirk see a statement from the Chicago Bulls just came out\nThat tax winner passed away and you may not know

question so the big the big story line right now concerning LA and Golden State is we're just clay tops and end up two thousand I think that's really the headline I always thought he'd go to the Lakers because of his dad right right I mean it's just that simple you think that's a foregone conclusion\nNo I think that the problem is I think he's going to stay where he is\nI think that will keep them I think they know that Steph Curry and ... and make that machine work I think the guy that will leave there is Duran that he might actually do you believe he might consider the next like everyone suggesting around here I think the rent one spell the next that he wouldn't even think about it and I have for ... why not\nWell because they're a mess he has said that there is entering there that

shot right of any Senate voter I've ever seen like he gets up in the air and ... you can't block shot issues down\nBefore but here's here's my question for you so with that logic and I understand where you're coming from why has there not been a superstar I'll even give you an all star that not a trade like Milo was traded from the nuggets there has not been a star that has gone to the next in the last Twenty years Ewing was drafted their\nSpree will couldn't last in the league nobody wanted him so he was an al ... but he did well with the ... that's what I'm saying but nobody wanted him at the time no one saw ... well being as good as she was with the nicks who has gone there in the last Twenty years and all that no no no no stuffed them I was planning on bad\nLeg autumn I got a hundred

that ah that shows up for the game or whatever\nNever place he never play but he's like six forward to ten so he just thinks he's this great player\nThat you know she'll be starting do you think that that guy should be a starting in a in a basketball game that when he never plays basketball well how could play well he walks out on the corner every time we play like he's a starter a just thinks he's automatically is in the starting rotation meanwhile you know Monday and I played five thousand hours of basketball months\nAnd I play I everywhere street indoors out or you name it I play

sort of like driving in a bar and all this comes from ...\nSo I Want to ask you a very important question about ah this country mafia and politics and football oh\nDid you see the story I say in\nOur Bruce do you still not so I'm Trump the president of the United states I'm as you know\nHe's in fact in football ... do you believe that like in some capacity or another is he do you think that he's heard the NFL\nEveryone cleans out just because of you know you guys is is based on kind of goes with what he says but I don't think it's him I mean people get turned off on the national anthem just because you said something wasn't the reason that people were turned off by that before he ever came along\nThere at least five ... markets were the worst NFL ratings drops that they've ever had the worst plunge was in Phoenix Trump ... strong cardinals not so sure on\nThe team sucked that's why people were watching\nLast year too [laughter] okay\nThere was no or delusions Seventeen TV audience tank falling twenty seven percent across the area\nThe cardinals lamb divide on a record of the second straight see them as little as right there you go far enough Houston and acts Vegas drivers in Houston the region voted Trump in twenty six game but the far more likely explanation for the ratings side is that fans us interest after Jay Jay ... broke his legs so that guy get injured and\nHe was ... and this on walks in and your season again the thieves luck\nThere you go Indianapolis was a snake bit\n[laughter] I Know a drew walking was for the right to Kobe Bruce ... they sucked so that was why no one was just received sucks you don't watch\nRatings funds more than twenty percent or twenty ... twenty seventh and eighth inning and make the blast a distance that now as those markets are far better job than in Dallas down six percent\nSo uh for six games no viewers\nThe nature of partisanship in those areas may have played a role or you have factors that are hard to figure out the regional base to southern age or a vote on a city in Little Rock and Arizona is similar a grounding of politics and of course not having a good team definitely hurt\nSo a\nTrump won the election by double digits Oklahoma City a Little Rock are cowboys country ratings drop twenty percent there\nSo I'm\nThe Vikings ran roughshod over the NFL punching in France are buying last in the first time since uh nine\nBut interest there was high that's 'cause they ruining cause their wedding and then uh the effect was true regardless of politics New Orleans where Trump won by double digits the same sort of origins rising twenty Seventeen winning eight consecutive getting assuming that division rival banners that than I Do and to start the\nSt ... market or raining find Thirteen percent\nEight and it's all markets where the home team made the playoffs so ratings increase gene go figure sex in the novel markets were declining ratings own team lost at least half of its games\nDo you believe uh that that from when he started saying that the NFL had a problem because the protesters that kneeling and that they wouldn't stand for the national\nAnthem ah and then people stopped a supporting the NFL watching the NFL going down a fellow games buying NFL merchandise do you think that a Donald Trump did all that to the NFL\nNo I don't I was we just disprove your all these teams have big drops in their reading list your how big drops in there with last year I guys who are their star players are hurting we're missing in just weren't worth watching I mean if you're going to say that yes those ratings are simply because he went against them and talked about the anthem\nThat are going to believe in for the charges moving and no one showing up there for years are you blame him for all the media blackout say how'd you know down in ... to not good no\nPeople don't watch when the team's not good now that you're getting sports betting in certain areas of the country as it gets more widespread maybe some of the outcome back because of course we're gonna get more interest\nIn you know teams outside of your area if you've got money on them but other than that if the team as bad that's one of the rating flip\nThe most telling his MBA overwhelming politics is Pittsburgh with the president won fifty five percent of the vote as a president criticizes for the Steelers organization's reaction was a a lightning rod Mike I'm undecided team would remain in the locker room during the anthem for one game and a show of unity\nA football got more Pittsburgh or his eyeballs though TV ratings or Saturday Night football in the market were up whether the Steelers are playing or not their top rated Sunday night game and a twenty Seventeen against the lines and late October rated three mine's higher in western Pennsylvania then the Steelers alone Sunday night game of the year before\nIn Idaho or animals I don't I don't want that but I like I find that it is a

whipping and the and the reins pelting them in the face and and there's waves crashing onto the shore and their drowning and everything I think it's just awesome news\nYeah the anchors really care about the wellbeing of their you know audience and are the victims I'm sure they really donate\nAll all they care about his ratings but I think coverage of news events that are like this these storms are incredible I did the weather Channel's incredible that Jim can't or is that his name I think he's awesome\nBoy we've got to take it out to the agency out any almost getting aren't there like a for

you I hear a shop the Lakers tonight are trailing the warriors by one in the third in Vegas in this preseason game that doesn't matter or have you seen Alonzo ballplayer tonight\nUm I stopped paying attention to him the second he graduated from UCLA because that was the last time he was good okay so uh my\nQuestion again I don't eat as he played tonight have you watched him in this game\nPlayers are and see them but I saw another was more a girl from Ron throwing them in El you\nLook around at Fifteen and ten or in the first half I just wanted to say so anyway here's the deal\nYour boy Alonzo ball had a fourteen minutes one of two two points to rebound one is a test to steals yeah so that's it and he's done for that night second pick written all over it huh\nSo you didn't they tense evidence that was good when he was healthy eating tense evidence Evan ... good numbers\nI think when you put up the amount of shots and get thirty minutes of playing time a game and all you put his ten Seventy seven up when you were the primary distributor the ball that's not impressed with him for a rookie really\nMafia serious do you think ten feminine senator good numbers for rookie\nI'm sued

where your pajamas and where was he in crunch time and the only time they ever want to laughter is cutting edge tech\nBut he just said all of his broken stick to these aid the Sox won it matters he's only one that's ever mattered on that team for the last Twenty years when he died Sunday he left that's why you're mad that there is no other reason mafia Don me I'm wrong the only reason the Islander fans hate him because he left\nBut they were on their knees and it was like a porno let me tell you some it was like a porn movie they were all on their knees in a in a porno lining up to keep him right there wasn't one man in a world that didn't want him to stay right so what happened he left\nHe changed his mind he said he wants to be an eye on her I think he did sign with him on before state\nI think he did want to say but at the last minute his childhood dream was to be a lead and they gave them an opportunity to do it I took it he changed his mind he said it was the toughest thing he ever had to do and it's like but that's not good enough for the Islander fans they hate him forever to hate him ... got and then they start telling me like this guy that he sucks\nBig shock to just terrible player in shock the overall watch shut up\nYou cover high all of them\nThis guy sucks that the funniest thing I ever heard in my life from a trip like these guys must be hockey fans or hockey

Nichols\nOr so a lot in there\nNow he's honest he's been he's raw\nBut still\nLittle cryptic not exactly sure\nWhat he wants or what would fix this relationship no attempt to do because they go way back but with his teammates\nCan they move forward\nButler told Rachel that the situation is not fixed just because he showed up at practice\nThat it could be fixable but he didn't believe it was going to be fixed right so that's kind of a progression there he told Rachel just because he showed up it's not fixed don't assume it's fixed\nThat yes it could be fixable\nBut he's still didn't believe it would be fixed that does that mean he gets trade it\nI don't know and if you're the general manager of another team who might be interested in training for butler after what you heard about practice Wednesday and when she challenged everybody in which he let out a\nReally long should be prevented\nTease again reported reportedly although butler said the accounts are are accurate of what happened in practice he told Rachel after\nPractice they sat down for an interview two hours after\nAnd if you listen to the interview he said\nYeah what you heard is accurate so he's not denying it he's not saying that these are erroneous report coming from Adrian ... others he's saying what you've heard is accurate\nIt was wrong me\nAll my emotions came out at once\nI hadn't played basketball

dangerous the good news is is moving quickly enough that even as it drops a ton of rain\nOr now that it's over land it's going about twenty miles per hour according to the latest reports which means it's not staying in any one place for too long completely the opposite of Hurricane Florence but it's still deadly\nDamaging when flooding rainfall my best friend lives in Atlanta and she was telling me that ah they were bracing for thunderstorms and for some you know some a flash flooding on the roads and stuff and that they had cancelled a lot of school activities because of it\nThe last I knew it was over central Georgia and looking at one of the pictures and it appears to be over central Georgia heading for South Carolina if it's not there already I Know that we have a lot of listeners in Atlanta in South Carolina and of course on up the east coast so if you're in the path of Michael you can send us a tweet\nA law radio over half a million people are without power across the southeast\nAnd according to the national weather service this is the third most intense us landfall on record\nThe storm was huge as it was approaching\nThe Florida Panhandle of course Gulf shores Alabama also in that same area and it was a category for just shy of a cat five when it made landfall and now it has lost some of its intensity but again different than say Hurricane Florence which is moving really slowly but at least\nHad been downgraded almost to a tropical storm by the time it made landfall\nThat's not the case with Michael Michael is just now a tropical storm it for the bulk of Wednesday it was a a hurricane\nAnd so thinking of of those of you who are in that path and we want to help people that are affected by hurricane Michael you can tax to Michael in all caps M.

Sports radio we'll get to some of your tweets and your means in your Facebook posts coming up but were pleased to welcome Allen May former NHL left wing or Atlanta from NBC Sports Washington the capitals analyst\nAlan good to get a couple of minutes when you kind of cool to get this rematch early in the year what was the atmosphere like inside the arena as all of those memories and flooding back from last you know\nBought last year at this time the arena would not have been or numbers every person in every way\nThat they have in the building was sitting in it and they are all game there are\nI think they were waiting for their regarding or just rematch and it wasn't a special as the playoff didn't have the same at ten but once again the caps you\nKnow they brought a way to ... crowd and just been a dream that store he started off\nWell I'm Glad you brought that up because I was talking about this on my show last night where the ones that franchise it has never won at a\nParticular championship whether it be the eagles with the super bowl whether it be the ad shows with the world series or the capitals where the Stanley Cup it tends to produce a\nBit of a relief and and get that weight off the shoulders of not just the team itself but the fan base so ... how different how does it felt to start this year with the capital's being the reigning champs\n... which kind of funny about the entire thing is the fans here and it's up to ten years now\nIs that they kind of had this all was me out of food and uh you know they don't like their work for them\nMilk the cow or you know one of those too you know it was always going to be in a birth to her now you're seeing people this look on her face in the arena and all of them are just so happy with this he\nBrought them so much joy that the ANC than the bitterness isn't there anymore and then the ... play the way they were on the opposite of energy that's coming from the fans and then the way that the end of the plane or at home and it's just been two games at all\nBut it's been overwhelming are just incredible you do you in\nA way they've been on the ice and the way it's transported to the fans and just be entered in the building is I've I've never seen anything like that it\nIt was interesting too because at the beginning of last playoff run\nThey couldn't win at home and it really was them turning it around on their own eyes that helped propel them to the Stanley Cup when you look back at that remembering the oath to hold that they put themselves in against Columbus what stands out about the way they started to play inside their own building\nWas the biggest thing is that they should really one of those first two games you're calling us they dominated them for Ninety nine percent of the game\nAnd and they they got themselves into trouble but similar showing how do they work and they're being able to adapt and bigger things do not just frustrated not was not a church other ... each other as a team in every round of the playoffs\nAnd they just found a way that no matter what was drawn out them\nFor ... stick together as a team then every round of the playoffs and they just found a way that no matter what was drawing asked them they found a way to adapt and overcome an improvised or common when those game so you know it it's just that the the ... not the push to panic bought\nAny more maturity with that is really help this team girl\nYeah you could certainly feel that confidence and as you talk about that grows when it results in a championship you recognize okay that's how it's done we're spending a few minutes with Alan ... who is fresh off the NBC Sports set following the Washington Capitals win over the Golden Knights\nNHL analyst with us here after hours on CBS Sports radio I had a couple of gold from Alex Ovechkin certainly seems like he's the\nHe's the man in two thousand Eighteen and everybody envy the way that he spent his off season so what do we know about him to start the year after what was what they should do rain stretch and a few months where he just he finally got to enjoy all of the fruits and is labor\nLaw he finally got that ... million pound gorilla officers back in ... is a lot of relief but that I've never not seeing him put his best foot forward and give us all out effort and you know sometimes it was in the wrong directions but\nHe's really figured out how to manage his game now and right now he is so lucky so grateful so happy to be able to play with the center like Afghani choose ... who is going to probably challenge for the scoring leading the national hockey league this year who's about the play offs and scoring last year and they're on fire to start the Houston\nAnd you're just

[laughter] you're going to get your blood to boil aren't you you're going to get fired up you're going to raise your heart rate you could potentially cause yourself some problems but if you're Jimmy Butler\nWell\nMaybe it just turned into a really good basketball game that's my biggest question is what happens from here\nIf you are currently in the towns are Andrew weekends or you're one of the third string or is that Jimmy reportedly chose for his team to run full court within practice on Wednesday\nBecause you guys just beat the other starters\nMaybe your time than we do and you're thinking this is exactly what we need a Jimmy boatload of coming here in with everybody into shape\nOr if you're the general manager and you've got screamed at now what now I Will say when I thought about and read about mold over this Jimmy Butler situation and watched the interview that he did with Rachel Nichols\nI immediately jumped to go back and junior but ... they're two different says to me indicate that give me butler it was in house number\nOne most important thing it was in the\nThat gets out if somebody doesn't tell Adrian ... and others now I Would say that this kind of news\nThis kind of development this kind of surprised most\nHuman beings don't keep it to themselves some well somewhat the fact that he showed up for practice for the first time after holding out that wasn't going to be a secret but then according to multiple reports the gym was so stunned by the way he acted and by this this\nAs he calls wrong me this raw Jimmy Butler\nAnd as he explains that Rachel Nichols he was just so full of a motion and intensity and passion and probably some frustration some disappointment some anxiety all of that comes pouring out of him\nAnd he directed at his teammates and at the general manager who's there at least it was in house and I get it it didn't stay a secret\nBut it's not as though Jimmy Butler did that in his sit down with Rachel Nichols\nNor did he throw any of his teammates under the bus so we think it's interesting to hold up the hotel Beck and junior interview with Josephine Anderson and low Wayne and then compare that with the conversation that Rachel Nichols had with Jimmy Butler now he's not happy neither is owed out\nBoth of them are disgruntled both of them are frustrated with their organizations both of them\nAre disenchanted with teammates\nBut if you watch the Jimmy butler\nWhile he indicates that he's not happy and while he talks about a situation that he believes it's likely not going to be fixed\nIn no way does he pointed fingers at his teammates in no way does he say it's this guy's fall or that guy's fault\nNo way does Heathrow when he went under the bus now named that in practice\n\nBut it's a lot of these other rumors are true\nAbout the dissension and the ranks\nAbout the problems between him and call in the town specifically\nThese other rumors are true\nAbout the dissension and the ranks about the problems between him and currently in the town specifically which sometimes can be about alpha males sometimes can be about sharing the basketball sometimes it can be about feeling some guys girl\nDoesn't always have to be that way sometimes just personality clashes not every team with alpha males and major superstars guys who can create and who can score and who can take charge not every team measured the way that the Golden State warriors have\nDon't look at that as the the norm look at that as the gold standard because that's special what those guys have dealt with for all stars and they're starting lineup\nAnd now making room for another one in ... in that is unique it's not the norm so in the case of Jimmy Butler and his teammates it could very well be a variety of different things maybe it can't be fixed though he intends to have a really good relationship\n\nMaybe that was the communication is open maybe the organization the front office talks to Jimmy and they figure something out\nIn the NBA guys don't hold out\nSome of the reports indicate he's been frustrated with the fact that all of his teammates or not committed to winning the way that he is\n... these are all [noise] the oldest\nIntangible things it's so difficult to know for sure what would change that situation what would fix it what would make him happy what would make him feel like he was

that five hundred could put them within striking distance of the vision lean\nI enjoy that about the NFL this year I Know it's been a bit of a topsy turvy topsy turvy first five weeks topsy turvy a first five weeks but that's kind of the beauty of it is that right now\nAlmost every team is still in it\nOr is Bill Belichick says no one's been eliminated from the play offs just yet man he was in a really awesome mood when someone tried to ask him more than once about the potential for\nThis chief patriots matchup on Sunday night being about two powers that could meet again or that maybe they're the best of the the note wasn't having any that good for him more\nFive weeks and we're not even a third of the way through the season so let's not be crowded anybody champ just yet I ate or even telling me who's going to be in the AFC Championship yet raise your hand last year if you add the Jacksonville Jaguars getting to the AFC Championship and going through Pittsburgh to do it\nYet no hands in here anywhere raise your hand if you had the Philadelphia Eagles winning the super bowl after\nThey had lost their MVP caliber starting quarterback\nDogs [laughter]\nBut no he does but I Know you're being sarcastic so come on stop acting like you know what's going on in the NFL the cool thing is that everybody for the most part even if there are some teams are a little deeper holes that

difficult to watch a little bit just because living in the times we live in now Ninety percent of the episodes could be solved with a cell phone and it kind of take so you know it's\nWay or if they use their regular lane lines\nI don't know it's tough when they know about shrinkage\nThanks yeah that problem could be solved with a phone call seriously no exactly no they they it's a show about nothing\nThat's a great thing about it is that it's a a show about the stupid stuff that normal people encounter all the time it's a show about nothing I saw your tweet about how all of their problems quote unquote can be can you share it with a cell phone I was really annoyed\nI mean just because you've never lived her life without a cell phone doesn't means the rest of the world needs to rely on them all the time don't be trying to ... ruin Seinfeld don't be trying to ruin all the best show of all time well comedy friends don't we turn to ruin anything for me just because you can't imagine your life without that appendage attached to it\nIt's after hours on CBS portray the other part is ... didn't know who Seinfeld was\nKinda well I guess Chris didn't know who Seinfeld was anyway he's

followed up with\nBecause it clearly when you say something like that you know it's going to be incendiary the question I have is how do we get to the other side of these issues would chew over so many different issues all the time and I don't see that these leaders are ... and and it can be true as well for for conservative leaders and Republican leaders about when\nYou know we have the same kind of conversations about civility but no one gets the other side of them\nYou know we don't end Vance them in any way and I'm really listening for the person that's going to bring us the next level make us think differently and\nFor their you know President Trump has a lot of positives to have a lot of fault so one of the things that we do it's for news is that we're completely nonpartisan I like covering the news an unbiased way but he has challenged people to think differently about issues rightly or wrongly and I think that that's really important for the civil discourse today whoever you\nAre so ... who's a born in Saudi Arabia but work has contributed the Washington Post seems to be lured into a ... or the Turkish embassy and killed a there was word is they think he's dead they picked up into steps and it was a big set up to Fifteen men\nAre Saudi teams may have arrived taken him out we're trying to get to the bottom of it all\n... states here I mean we are to president that here's what he said cook a cook thirty four\nChildren going in America and you can be killing more here and there was everything that you are right now sir is that in jeopardy now and I really don't have\nTo find out what happened I mean I Do I have no doubt and we're probably getting closer than you might think what I have to find out what would happen\nI mean we talked with Saudi Arabians a crown prince who's really running things that you not to do long my right Joan\nWell listen and he asked if he wants that pastor out of turkey as well so the relationship with turkey is also tense right now to think about this story number one is a journalist at the operating freely in America I think this should be a lesson to all journalists and all consumers of news there are so many people here stateside that complain\nAbout the treatment of journalists you want to know what went bad treatment of journalists go anywhere else other than America\nAnd that's what you're going experience I mean it's interesting that this happened in Turkey one of the places that has the most journalists in prison than anywhere else in the world and yet this is this you know the\nTurks are coming on and saying you know the Turkish government's coming on and and trying to take a stand because they're they're not happy with Saudi Arabia so there's a lot of different undercurrents here I don't know how big of a stand the president can take on this issue I mean obviously clearly it's bad I mean what happened to this journalists you see some of the graphic\nReports it's frightening um\nBut there's a lot I mean there's just a lot to unpack them really looking forward to your conversation with Senator Corker I just don't I don't know what the I don't know what the right call is for the president I think it I it offers a lot of perspective for those of us who value freedom and the press\nAnd really want other journalists to be able to operate freely so we can all have an idea of what's accurately happening in the far flung places of the world I mean we really important for I Would assume you're talks during the Iran\nWe have a ... you know one of the big stories that was sort of I mean because it's listen it's not the most exciting has been about ... you know gas prices that's been a really big ... you know the gas prices are near for your highest we haven't seen the levels and oils and all of a long time and some I think this is an interesting fact right every recession in the last five recessions has been\nCreated with a spike in oil prices so there you know you see what's happening with the markets and you see what's happening\nWith stocks and questions about interest rates and inflation oil as part of that so we're really taking a look at that and the president had an interesting announcement about wanting to make the fuel that is more mixed with ethanol\nCorn byproduct available year round and they're you know there's a lot of strong feelings about that it can actually damage your car Brian I don't know if he knew that but some cars can actually take that blends and um so it's really it's kind of I think that this story that's happening with fuel and the economy is a really big one it's one that we're really covering this week I was wondering if because\nIt affects every part of our life even if you don't drive\nSo that's definitely one of our watching\nAnd we'll see what's going on or economy's doing good tank yesterday ... points the day because the bedrooms interest rates 'cause every little panicky or it's weird to help the war as an economy the more the interest rates go up ... to go down\nThat makes people nervous just because it's it's a way that makes them more expensive for us to borrow money you know but let's see it's hard to watch the markets is every every other day you know you got to kind of take it\nIn a month period and see what's happening but it definitely scared and people and when people start throwing around the world word recession I think we have to be careful you have to do it responsibly and we were nowhere clear that near that were near full employment but you know we've been on a ride for a little while everyone's wondering when they'll be a little bit of a breather and I think that that's a fair question to to be\nDo Kanye West is going to lunch with Jim Brown and the president do do do a prominent African American want to detain bleed activists who was the president's agenda should be a who should be their agenda and there were two black communities agenda on looking back\nAt a at the black mold over the last three ... three Republicans all are under twenty percent McCain Romney intro but no three group actually got more than the other two\nDo you ever see their rebalancing back to a party that actually read the sleeves Nineteen sixty and had the black vote up until Nineteen sixty\nI think when it comes to vote for anyone whether you're trying out black voters women voters Hispanic\nVoters I think there's a tendency to to try to think about all of them in the you know ... these very specific groups that have very specific needs and and a lot of ways divide all of us I think there's some very you know there's some interesting analysis when you've got to dig into the way people registered to vote and whether or not they vote\nBut at the end of the day I think it's really about the economy for everyone and I'll be really curious what the what the um the results in the mid term election are when it comes to different categories based on ethnicity and then moving forward I just\nI I tend to believe that people are kind of affected equally when it comes to some of these major issues with the economy like and you know can I get a job\nCan I take care of my kids and am I safe and those are really basic questions that everyone needs answered so you know I I don't I think all of that can change is it a long way of saying short short answer I think all and it's going to be changing and I don't think I'm\nJust like we've seen as you point out in history different parties represented different platforms I just don't think anyone's dependable every party should

Bennett with Bennett consulting on his farm in Illinois and Ben is breaking down his pre report and now\nI think the report this uh this coming here you're probably going to see the corn go up a little bit as far as the concern but I don't think it's going to be a whole lot I was expected the under one eighty two maybe at one eighty one point seven or eight\nBut the bottom line on this Jeff what does it mean or how much more demand does is create you think\nSure well it is a a longer term play chip and yet I think ah there's there's pretty broad recognition or that are across the industry a but it's one of those things that had to happen it's it's one of those barriers that had to be knocked down\nBefore we can can really jumpstart the marketplace for for higher level blends in any Fifteen specifically so this this has been one of our top regulatory priorities for for a number of years\nUm we're not out of the woods yet this is really this announcement really just starts the process to get the rulemaking done and and uh EPA has committed to having it done and time for next summer so hopefully we can put all this behind as a by June one next year\nAnd you know hopefully we'll we'll see the marketplace or making a Fifteen available all year round next year\nYeah and I like the way that you set a Jeff this is an issue that had to be knocked down because it it brought up a memory of the Berlin Wall and and uh how we face that blood while to get to Fifteen billion gallons a\nInto the the fuel supply out there but it helps us get to that level doesn't it\nIt it does and it and again it's it's one of those constraints are barriers that's been put on on ethanol a and it's really a remnant of a thirty year old regulation and and so you know this this fits the mold very well of the types of burdensome and unnecessary regulations that really offered no\nEnvironmental or economic benefit or that President Trump is committed to repealing so we knew it was a ripe for the picking a and we've been working with the administration really for a really sets a President Trump won the election\nOr to get this done and and again it's it's it's a very positive signal a to them\nSince President Trump won the election\nOr to get this done and and again it's it's it's a very positive signal or to the marketplace and I think it will shake lose some investment that's been sitting on the sidelines and and it will peak some some more interest in retail sector\nUm it's not going to bring another billion or two billion gallons of demand on line overnight and it's not going to help us grind another three or four or five hundred million bushels of corn overnight but it does help pave the the path forward to to to get into those are the types of demand numbers\nRight and you know Jeff I think it's important for everybody that's listening to understand that all this does is create more choice another choice for consumers it's not like each ten is going to disappear it's not like regular unleaded gasoline is going to disappear\nEach ten will be another choice year round now\nAbsolutely this is not in has never been about mandating you Fifteen right this has been about allowing a consumers and and allowing retailers\nThe choice to offer that fuel and and you know in a you know we always hear about oh ... you know if we only had a free market and and why do you guys need your if us and and if your product is so great it would compete in in the free market this this this this move by President Trump helps move us\nMore ... a free market I mean we have a product and ask and all that is eighty cents cheaper than gasoline today right it's cleaner it's made in America\nI'm it's supporting jobs in in in rural parts of the country or in a truly free market our product would get chosen every time so yeah um this this move just allows a more flexibility\nFor the retail sector allows more choices for consumers 'em and you know if if they don't want to purchase the Fifteen they don't have to there will certainly be eaten\nAvailable and in in in many cases there will be easy road or a will remain available yeah or if you want to pay an extra sixty cents a gallon for you know or gasoline without ethanol that she that's your prerogative\nYeah and and the price of the ... is one of the most important things in at least in my\nJudgment of of eat Fifteen because it is a it\nIs a premium product but it comes at a lower cost than it it just like you said if it wasn't for all the the the anti ethanol group messaging that's going on out there\nIt would be the the the\nChoice for most consumers out there don't you I I Believe with\nWithout question without question I mean it's a Fifteen has been five to ten cents cheaper than than regular gasoline eaten\nA where it's being offered and and um again with with a little bit of education consumers yeah Fifteen a immediately become repeat customers and and they they come back and buy more and and spend make that switch so\nUm I I Do think we will continue to see that and and now that we can you know hopefully alleviate this this burden of you know uh putting the brakes on every June first and and you know ... or or taking that product out of the out of the pop\n'em now that we're you know hopefully getting past that I I think he Fifteen or will will really take off in the years\nOkay yeah I I think it will too but what's next what do we do to get it in front of more consumers\n[noise] well I mean there's there's a couple of things that have to happen and and certainly as I mentioned this announcement on Tuesday was just the beginning of the rule making process so so first and foremost we've got to get that done and and that means EPA needs to immediately I'm getting a proposed rule out to\nThe public and allow the public to comment on that proposal and weigh in with the agency a and then ... required to take all those comments into consideration there will probably be a hearing or to\nUh and then they've got to get a final rule done 'em and so none of this matters really until that final rule is complete and and again we've we've had commitments that that will be done in time you know before next June\nUm during that process we of course you're going to be continuing to work with with retailers are with gasoline marketers to make them aware of of this change\nUm make them aware of the value proposition and then we'll continue our our consumer education\nA campaign's as well but that that works you know those campaigns really work hand in hand with\nWith the retailers because that's where you know that's the point of sale that's that's where consumers are in are facing with our products so\nIt's a um that's what we have in in store all over the next six to twelve months\nGotcha okay now let's set the record straight on some of the messaging out there because uh one of the one of the messages that just drives me crazy jazz is ... and it's from the American Petroleum Institute is from the petrochemical manufacturers\nTalking about that we're going to have dirtier air burning higher ethanol blends during the summer set the record straight\nWell that that drives me nuts as well and and a lot of the news coverage around yeah his announcement has said well the reason we haven't been able to sell the Fifteen summers because it's it's contributes to smog\nThat's that's ridiculous and it's on true any Fifteen is less ... than eaten\nUm it it contributes fewer evaporative admissions Yom it reduces carbon monoxide it reduces carbon dioxide emissions I'm ... and so you know eat Fifteen is absolutely a cleaner fuel then ... even\nA and it's certainly cleaner than he's ear oh I'm so that that is not the reason that he Fifteen has been held out of the marketplace the reason is you know we've we've had this thirty year old antiquated outdated regulation yeah that was designed at a time when higher level blends we're we're not even really you know being contemplated\nUm yeah ... that's ... ... to yeah it it drives me crazy we've only got a couple of minutes left and I got a lot that I Want to cover here Jeff ... um the other thing I I I'm thinking of opening up a shot because three quarters of the cars are about to break down\nYou know according to the AP I well you\nKnow why don't they look why don't consumers take a look at what's going on down to Brazil I mean their their average blood rate is north of each one isn't it\nSure yeah there are there are about twenty seven twenty eight percent in Brazil yeah yeah you know ... that's another myth shift that's been around since CPA approved the Fifteen in two thousand eleven ah up\nAnd again it's just nonsense we we have driven more than five billion miles on e Fifteen we haven't heard of single reported case of of engine damage or engine failure or or or inferior performance or any you know breakdowns on the side of the road any of that nonsense\nOr if it had happened we certainly would have heard about ... billion miles is a lot of miles this is the most tested fuel and the history of of of the U. S. yep I'm so they're just you know it's just more nonsense the other thing I Would point out is\nNearly every automaker today are explicitly approves the use of e Fifteen in their in their automobiles you go to the the any car lot\nToday are explicitly approves the use of e Fifteen in their in their automobiles you go to the ... any car lot a and look at the owner's manual whether it's a Honda Toyota for General Motors um you\nKnow price or whatever whatever it is they're all going to lift ... has proved feel\nExactly Jeff we got to go but now that we've got a Fifteen well don't take your eye off that ball until we get the final rural but let's move on to the hardship waivers and get that danced outlet to okay let's get your back on real soon and talk about that\nThat sounds great ship would love to write that Jeff Cooper president and they eat all of the renewable fuels association we've got Larry well from the north Carolina Farm Bureau I'm Down to\nThe money the summer or\nSection I'm more and more will make it look real green ...\n... that they're talking you know pretty strong about this hurricane Michael coming up through the Gulf Coast coming in putting another five or six inches of water in our peanut guys and sweet potato guys are trying to salvage that they just they can't they they just don't need that\nFor sure right right okay I'm Talking to you from Iowa I'm obviously a lot of the listeners up in this part of the world are interested in what happened to the hockey industry down in North Carolina you said that\nSome of the poultry houses that three foot of water into how ... how did the pork industry come out of it ...\nThe pork industry uh did great I couldn't be more proud of our farmers they uh they pumped down those lagoon job they do it every year in anticipation knowing the hurricane season comes the puck down their lagoons\nA they pre positioned feed across a flood prone areas in many cases they had generous almost all of our uh August ... operations have generators air to run those a a feeding operations as well as water\nUh we had we had some uh that uh you know had some problems but let me just say this out of a ship out of out of thirty one hundred lagoons we only had three they what they called breached the dams broke and they do which is ...\nYou know it was no problem and then we had to others that the that the you know the\nThey were inundated by the rivers or whatever I had one farmer called me and say Larry how 'bout the calling the governor and our department of environmental quality and tell them to come down here and get their river outta my lagoon\n[laughter] see here's lagoon was in good shape but the stakes regarding his lagoons or you know\nWho's but uh but I have I couldn't be more proud and lose only fifty five hundred dogs out of a out of about twelve million we have here in the state on the ground and the one time was nothing short of a miracle and ah I I I just can't say enough good about it and for\nAnybody that's out there trying to make political hay or raise money\nUh in in many cases on on any any problems with the goons I think is just an incredulous and ah I I Can't uh can't say enough bad about that what our farmers need they did a tremendous job or are farmers needed their help and support\nOr not not criticism and being a bunch of Monday morning quarterback\nExactly good on your Larry so what is the recovery or like you call that to salvage operation what does it look like right now what do you need right now\nWhat we need right now just some dry weather less sort this out see where we are let's get arrested these are the costs of tobacco is finished these guys with these big combines a corn was blown over but you know they're the ... to get that in that law was left out there the soybeans are I think we should could be a pretty good shape a\nExcept those it went underwater they just have to cut around those your whole feels went underwater then\nThat's a you know that's a a crop insurance\nClaim all our peanuts or they're digging those we'll see what any problems all the sweet potatoes with all the war they had\nTheir going at this store ability of those sweet potatoes or certainly in question right now uh you know people say well doesn't that farmers have crop insurance yes they had cough insurance and all the insurance will cross but there's no crop insurance there is no multi barrel crop insurance for sweet potatoes\nOr ... and I can tell you as you note chip a crop insurance is not a hundred percent and it's not\nA ... and I can tell you is you know chip a crop insurance is not a hundred percent and it's not designed for back to back to back year after year a disaster because you're a P.

many details\nAnd we're going to go over as many of those details as we possibly can today because I knew there were some surprises in here and weren't there\nBut I I Would call the entire thing is surprised I'm not against huge surprise and perhaps the the biggest surprises that it wasn't a huge bullish report basically you know um that maybe the most surprising thing ever\nYeah exactly [laughter] you know the uh the fact that we did see corn prices higher today coming out of\nThe report after we got the numbers that we got a shouldn't be any surprise the corn prices were higher but like you say well why did we move even higher we're going to talk about that\nWe're going to get into some of those details and why this corn market may not have pushed a as high as some people thought it would\nSalary was ... dollar would sharply lower today crude was sharply lower and that's our shop sharply lower for a second day in a row down four hundred and fifty points right now not yesterday at the end of the show we were talking about stocks being off about six hundred points\nYeah they ended up more than eight hundred where lower [laughter] and I ... the right yeah so like the mercury in central Iowa trip [laughter]\nYeah it's a it is a little chilly out there today I said oh here we laid it here I said about four hundred and fifty points lower in in the Dow right now four hundred and sixty points lower it's going through a some of those those gyrations in here again who but ah boy\nIf if we were ever going to see some of that rotation of the funds above has been talking about that we talked about yesterday with the wind or let's say that we talked about with Richard Brock earlier this week that we've been talking about uh-huh happening for\nGosh Davis couple of months people have been anticipating this yeah\nIf if we were ever going to see it in a big way today was one of those days where it would have made some sense to see that\nWell six cent bumped in corn really doesn't seem like they've been dumping money into the commodities maybe it'll take a day or two for them to sort of catch up with the news ...\nYeah ... well yesterday felt like a transition date to me and I was hoping that today was going to be the day that we would start to see some of that that ... rotation of funds take place but like you said with corn oh six cents today on bullish USDA a crop production report\nMhm yeah\nI wouldn't say that there was a whole lot of rotation of funds going on in here but tempted reaction you may recall it right right and so Davis and I are going to have all the report details for you\nWe want you guys to be part of the conversation today give us a call ... five five for talk that say five five for eight to five five to four you can also tweet at us and when you do make sure that you include hash tag ... a gp in the message that way I Will be sure to see it ... a\nSo when we look at the details of the report in the USDA raping ... where did cornfields go doubt\nOkay and it it's a it's kind of all over the place because you got South Dakota down a bushel one Seventy two and this is compared to last month\nSo down a bushel of one Seventy two in South Dakota, Nebraska down three at one Ninety five um I went down to it too old for an Illinois down to ... to twelve\nNow even though we're down from last month in those states we're still looking at a record deal in South Dakota, Nebraska Iowa Illinois you can also throw record yield expectations in for um a Michigan Wisconsin Indiana Ohio\nOr Indiana was up to bushels from the September ... minute one Ninety four Ohio up to bushels\nAt one Ninety ... you've got South Dakota a poor bushels from last month after it you know and and\nPeople up there in North Dakota right now are probably thinking how the heck did they go up on the corn yield in North Dakota a bike for bushels per acre up to one forty six this is as of October one\nOkay uh the survey work the the objective you'll plot observations\nLeading up to October one now there was a little bit of survey work that still comes into play that that was ... you know in the first couple of days of October first few days about Dover but these estimates are as of October one\nDay this so yeah I think well what the ... think about what the craftsmen through since October one\nWell this is what I'm thinking there's gotta be farmers out there in Iowa South Dakota Nebraska are that are absolutely throwing chairs right now we've had a crazy rain up in South Dakota once they get six inches of snow up there we're I'm Duane yesterday\nHe just sent me attacks by the way he's a stubborn old cuss [laughter]\nThe ad because he hasn't shoveled the sidewalk out from in front of it you know if we don't shovel it didn't happen is that the idea I think that's what he's thinking yeah well I just wonder if maybe and maybe I'm over estimating\nThe damage that there was a potential damage that may or may not have been done I mean it has been soggy as all get out around here yeah and ... you don't go to a little bit of stock rod I don't know\nYep and then when I think that the weather we've had okay we knew that the stock quality was going to be an issue once it started raining in October because of the crop was basically ready to go right we're getting started in September when you've got that\nThat a corn stock that's already starting to drive down you ... with with water and rain\nYou're gonna have some stock quality issues and then through the wind on it but these are things you guys these are things that we're gonna have to wait for the November crop production report at the earliest right before we start to identify any of these\nThese harvest season whether issues on this corn crop that's November at the earliest we might have to wait for the January annual production summary you know to see\nWhat these just exactly how much damage has been done but it wasn't that\nThat kind of one of the inherent messages coming out of this year as a Midwest crop tour from you guys is the ... to the finish\nYeah yeah absolutely we were looking at a very mature corn crop already back in the third week of August and when you got that are\nThat much maturity on a crop that early in the seeds and you hope for a quick\nSeason okay and you go back to some past years when we did have a very mature corn crop and you don't have to go that far back just looking to sixteen crop heck not so much the Seventeen\nCrap because it just kept going and going and going and going the growing season I just never ended it seemed like a guy finally just had to go out and get it but that sixteen crop was pretty mature crop as well\nBut we had a good good open harvest season and we got up there and we got the crop in this year it's not happening that way so\nYou you already identified a couple of the states where I think we might be vulnerable to some yield reductions as we go from October into the November Iowa and South Dakota or they went up from September October in North Dakota I think they probably are going to take a little bit off of that crop and I'm not saying it's\nIt it's going to be a catastrophe or anything like that but I think they take a little bit up in North Dakota crop\nUh Lance Koenig who is in charge of the uh the crop estimates that at Nass does a stat chat\nAh on on Twitter following the the NASA reports\nOr somebody asked him about Minnesota\nAnd basically because they left the Minnesota or yield alone a hundred and Ninety One bushels per acre\nMake don't change from September same thing in in Wisconsin they made no change from last month isn't that a hundred and Seventy nine bushels per acre so they asked the question was was the ... not ... not belong\nTo harvest the objective deal plots and Lance basically said no the data was available the data just didn't support any changes I thought that was interesting yeah yeah so so I'm going to put Minnesota on my watch list to\nA four states that may see a bit of a yield reduction from that one Ninety One I and I throw in Nebraska in their throat cancers in there I'm not so sure about Missouri and then the eastern belt I think for the most part that's my next question yeah I'm I'm not too worried about changing those numbers too much\nWhat are the chances they out perform expectations in the eastern\nBelt um I mean this goes back to the age old question is a good not good enough to outweigh the bad type\nBut him and that and ah you\nKnow I mean we're hanging on record you'll hear right ran corn yield it's got to come from somewhere\nYeah and and you know even more we could see some meals reductions we might still be looking at record deal David right right that's how great this crop was I be before we get to being here real quick\nUm I just want to point out that we're looking at the highest\nAh it now the ear population is down from September ... down from October but the air population is still the highest on record in the uh\nAny objective deals the region and we're looking at record ear weights as well above what where's all your way stick in Seventy so there's the airwaves what happened on beans\nOn or other religions move on yet the crop production report on beans USDA put the national average menial that fifty three point one bushels per acre that's up three tenths from last month\nHowever USDA cut estimated harvested acres by more than five hundred thousand acres resulting in a slight reduction to the being crop from last month\nAt an estimated a four point six nine billion bushels USDA's been crop peg is down three million bushels from September and his forty three million bushels below the average river portrayed estimates\nRight I Am yep again leaning in the wrong direction or is is how we caught the market here\nI got a point now I mean now and before I point this out I Will point I'll make sure that everybody knows is back on August twenty fourth\nPro farmer estimated the national average corn meal at a hundred and Seventy seven point three and a crop at fourteen point five billion bushels here we stand at fourteen point seven seven three whatever it is or something like that on corn\nOr so were you know the pro farmer number is still below USDA's current estimate there but who knows by the time we get there I think we're going to be\nWe're going to move the number closer to that one Seventy seven point three but back on August twenty fourth pro former put to being corrupt the being Neal that fifty three bushels per acre how do we\nTook a half a million acres off of the uh harvest did acreage estimate a and that was based on uh the essay the certified acreage report so back in the third week of August we already took a half a million acres of that but here we still with a crop duster\nCrop estimate now from USDA four point six nine on August twenty fourth we put the crop at four point six eight three\nSo we're seven million\nBushels bolo\nCurrent estimate mhm mhm\nYou could chew and here again that's a very good shooting a here again though we're talking about some problems with the beans\nYeah and Davis\nWe talked about potential\nProblem areas on corn\nThose same areas [noise]\nI feel like we're just watching it being ...\nSo we are a serious problem we've got serious problems out there was a being crop will talk about that and I read your leaving\nInforming getting things done early has a way of setting you up for success like using corpus for an early season when over weeds tourists keeps even the toughest weeds from gaining a political\nMultiple sides of action deliver superior control would be merged weeks later corpus reactive each with just a half inch of rain and take out any new we may have sprouted and\nLos ... and I think the risk is even greater or buy a multiple\nThe risk is greater of beans ... either I really do believe that\nThere are a few bean fields in particular that I've noticed just over the last week or so on my route back and forth to work with city studios or the the beans are they looked like they are under a heavy load yeah just kind of leaning a little little bit looking a little patchy and weird\nYeah yeah and and stock strength is an issue and soybeans says well if that crop lays down how do you get after it down his bowl guards was on the farm reform dentist is down a pal Iowa or was on the farm reform on agar talk on yesterday\nAnd he was even talking about he considered going out and getting their Draper heads that he could get down and get some of those things that are laying down yeah so it's ah it it it\nIt's an issue out there I don't think there's any question about it uh\nYeah uh it it\nI I think we're ... I\nI think by the time we're all said and done with this ...\n... anything the Wisconsin\nMhm Minnesota North Dakota South Dakota Nebraska Iowa\nI don't know about Missouri\nBut I think all of those states\nAre yield is going to be lower than what was was indicated today ... because of harvest loss right yeah yeah I think it's a big problem but the big problem dude no big problem\nInteresting interesting that that Missouri keeps coming up with a big question mark on it too\nYeah yeah and you know part of the reason there is because they had such a weird growing season they had it in or out when nobody around them dead really right ... ... you know I mean yeah there were dry areas in Iowa and dry areas in Kansas and gray areas in Nebraska I get that\nBut but bottom line was ... I go back to two thousand five we had a drought in two thousand five and it basically started at the Mississippi River that runs east to the Illinois border right it was in Illinois drought only well this year we had a really ... was a a\nA a Missouri drought and in two thousand five\nThat Illinois corn crop the Illinois yield estimate\nThe lowest number that we got all year was in August and it just kept working hired just like we're doing in Missouri this year\nMhm mhm yeah interesting you ready for a Sunday yeah yeah let's it\nAll right well the smaller than expected corn crop resulted in a smaller than expected new crop corn carry over in the supply and demand report estimated carry over at one point eight one three billion bushels is up\nThirty nine million bushels for last month but that is still a hundred and six million bushels below the average river portrayed estimate bit of a miss their\nYeah yeah and you know a lot of it is because of the like you said it's because of that smaller than expected a corn crop there\nOn the demand side of thing for two thousand Eighteen Nineteen marketing near total demand Fifteen point one five five billion bushels that's up Fifteen million bushels from last month so even though we've got that smaller than expected total supply coming here to to the market\nOr the USDA went ahead and pushed up the the the total use but it wasn't just across the board they cut estimated feeding residual use like twenty five million bushels\nThat raised some eyebrows we've got a record number hogs on the we got a record number of cattle and the feedlot right and here we sit and bring down are feeding residual used estimate by twenty five million bushels I mean that and I I don't ... to me that didn't make any sense a\nSeed and industrial used was an changed was an changed that seven point one three billion bushels which includes five point six five billion bushels of corn for ethanol uses the change came on the export I'm surprised\nYou know we're sitting here with the export bookings what sixty three six ... yeah I think sixty three sixty sixty five percent a head up the pace of we were on a year ago yes but in fact her yeah ... it's so early in the marketing year why would you start making\nBig changes to the export forecast you wonder if this demand that we are getting in the export market is loaded Davis they're going to have to appeal to some of this office if it is you know they push the the push the export estimate up Seventy five million bushels\nUp to two point four seven five billion bushels\nBig number dude big number or\nI should we talk we talk about that to me it's just a little bit yeah where did that demand jumped come from\nWell it can we expect it to continue or is it was sort of aspirational here at the front end of the marketing here\nWell I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that that are suffering the corn crop out Brazil just wasn't quite everything that they thought it was going to be\nWhich is is it that it wasn't it wasn't a swab but it wasn't quite as much as what everybody was in ... to be and USDA didn't make any changes uh that for the Seventeen\nEighteen crops they left the resilience corn crop in eighty two million times and for the Eighteen Nineteen crop uh Ninety four point five million votes so that it was it Ninety four and a

and won\nHandily forty three Nineteen they had four hundred and forty seven years of total offense while holding Washington to only two hundred and eighty three yards the wind moved the same stuff for one of the season which is best in the NFC South\nRoger Ferguson hey prayed boroughs Ferguson is proud to be a part of what you do with over one thousand one stop shop counter locations expert associates and an on match selection of OPM repair parts learned more at\nFerguson dot com a five five to want to for CBS is the phone number\nWho's the one quarter back you would take who's the one to be you would turn to\nAnd you can't call in and say your own quarterback right so you can be like oh you're on fans have had to go to somebody else Aaron Rodgers a five five to one to\nFour CBS is the phone number I Love the homes I think he's awesome it wouldn't be the answer for me it wouldn't be the one guy I Would turn to the guy that I Would turn to without even a hesitation if he's healthy\nIs Aaron Rodgers like that's the guy that the guy I'm going\nTo go that let's first get sewer Kovacs CBS on Twitter your\nTop three ... and then the separate thing who turned over the year\nMy top three this year would be my home's breeze and Jared golf was rented out I don't hear their car on there\nOh he's ripe he's right below doubt or just misses just got off ... cool and I know what I'm going to want to go to this year it would be Aaron Rodgers act that would be the guy followed by a breeze and Brady\nYeah bring it to be pretty hot and less and bread he's Brady Mr\nThrow have an allergy dot com that's ... dot com Taliban into\nWho would you give us your top three earlier who wouldn't be your turn to for the remainder of the season\nSo tough because Rogers hurt if it wasn't for that it would be definitely him given everything we now know I'll I'll gambling on\nI don't think it's crazy as it\nIt's a little crazy get crazy a little crazy but I I I'm happy to be crazy especially with a fun player like that\nYeah the homes has been such a joy to watch such a joy to root for I actually talked to a buddy of mine in Kansas City yesterday and I asked him about something unrelated sports and I ask like what the vibe is like and he said\nIt is among the most excited and exciting sports individual sort of obsessions camps that he's had that he can remember I think he's probably my thirty five or forty I mean is there a cans of these sports figure a milk bone Jackson is probably\nThe last guy to be this transcendent of a talent this ridiculous of a difference maker eight five five to one to four CBS is the phone number is we're going to Wisconsin I had to get five and guess\nWhat the answer is going to be but I'm not going to presume Dan\nIn Wisconsin thanks for less than a brother you're on CBS Sports radio\nYeah I guess I should know that or even a healthy Aaron Rodgers wouldn't do much good you wouldn't eat at two thousand eleven Aaron Rodgers\nIs going down side cats all there is to it I mean my home's ... that's the future that's the president Aaron Rodgers I think he's just passed his last Super Bowl up\nThought you were going to my friend but you absolutely that I Will respectfully\nDisagree with you\nAaron Rodgers with a single turnover so far this year and they got see while injured ridiculous comeback against not just my Chicago Bears but\nArguably one of the best teams in football I saw the other day that one of the most prestigious drinking ranking than using the world the ride of the new power ranking actually put the bears is five which you know so that was a pretty\nRight yeah that's pretty impressive as I saw it just happened to notice that that that's a\nVery impressive victory for Rogers I think we've seen this age and its limitations on quarterback excellent has been greatly restricted by the way these guys take care of their bodies and let's be honest the way the NFL takes care of aging quarterbacks because it's good business Aaron Rodgers is what how I don't know is he thirty five years old\nThirty six years old and do the total guessing thing again you've got Tom Brady at forty one you've got Drew Brees ... approaching forty you've got robbers burger that thirty seven rage and Aaron Rodgers just thirty four I turn thirty five\nOn December second home ... almost happy birthday Aaron Rodgers to play for a really long time he's in a position now in the NFL or they're going to protect you they're going to make sure that it's okay and he has been on the record he has said he wants to play until he's\nForty five years old and not only are are Brady and brief still doing it it's almost like they're getting better mean Drew Brees is thrown\nA completion percentage of Seventy two percent or Seventy three percent so far this year among the best of his career he's been ridiculous Tom Brady won the MVP last season facts were breeds this year I didn't even realize this\nAnd all the accolades come looking at the stats right now in all the accolades and all the excellence and all the things we've talked about with him and what he's accomplished over the course of his career is also true that right now Drew Brees as the only quarterback in the NFL who's played you know an actual large amounts\nThrone interception he has been perfect at eleven touchdowns and zero interceptions and he has been set a time I mean it's not like it's all kinds of wind has been\nAbsolutely perfect protecting them and corruption here\nHe is completed Seventy eight percent of his past is that is the highest completion percentage it would be all of his career last year Drew Brees completed I think it was Seventy three percent of his passes highest completion percentage of his career over the course of an entire season I pointed these guys could you play a really really well and so I\nI don't think you're wrong day on the Jared off is the future league\nThat the homes of the future the league\nI'm not going to sleep on just shown Watson I mean that guy was so good last year as the future of the league that magic for business has clearly I'm just getting I'm not sure if I'm kitten\nHe did have six hundred yards and six touchdown and also came against damp so it's kind of a you know which which doesn't really count I'm just not sure the quote unquote the future of the league is going to be unveiled as quickly as we think\nTom Brady may play for a couple more years Drew Brees may play for a couple more years Aaron Rodgers play by play for another decade there's going to be a lot of competition is run and break your way to the top two or three or four or five or five quarterbacks I haven't gotten to ... Ryan\nRyan's been amazing this he's\nHe's been an absolute stood he'd just on a team that's really really bad\nAnd really really underperforming I didn't think they were either I thought Atlanta was going to be really good I actually um as much as I give steward a hard time Adam clues to produce the show actually send them a nice because I mean\nThe falcons got one for the same time the Braves\nGet theirs Rob the playoffs that's a real tough run for Atlanta and now you begin the hawk season like ... I Hope when twenty five games in our rebuilding childish things are really good gym so stupid I sent a St Louis real quick like\nHey man I'm really sorry and I have in front of them know that just was just uh\nI hate the universe everything is terrible I don't want to talk about this it was shut down real fast\nSo his football team is one of four and his baseball team got eliminated from the play offs and you send them a night tax but my football team is one in four and my baseball team gets eliminated from the piles and this is what I get\nWell um he just kept maturing you know as a as a player um he can see the defense is better you know the pressures are coming from getting the ball out of his hand he knows when to scramble when to step up in the pocket um in our receivers are making some really good catches we have from echo receivers in Africa line is protecting better\nSo it's kind of a combination of everything but we're just Steve and he is a better understanding of um of our offhand but he had a really a ... a tremendous amount better understanding of what defense is they're trying to do to us and where to go with the ball quickly\nTalking to Colorado head football coach in two thousand sixteen coach of the year Mike McIntyre here on the show writer\nThan you with me bill Ryder coach last year the football team won five games total you've won five already this year at what point in the pre season or the course of the early part of the season did you realize that you had a a special opportunity in a special team to maybe make a big leap forward this year\nI had that question asked me earlier today is kind of interesting I it was honestly it was the thirteenth practice a fall camp and it might as well how did you know 'cause I was standing on the practice field and you kind of started to camp and so you're right in the middle of it and it's hot and you're going to kids can't remember the beginning and they can't see the the upcoming gang come and yet\nAnd so that's kind of like the dog day so to speak\nAnd usually on those type of days you're having to get at them you have to push 'em you have to restart periods you and you're trying to do everything you can motivate them and push 'em and help them get better I'd have to do anything\nI'm sitting there watching I'm going we're having the very best practice we add the entire camp and they were flying around and they were getting accurate and they were having fun and they met with each other and they were competing and uh I thought wow these guys get it and we didn't have one practice the entire camp or I had to do and you had to\nDo that type of thing where I thought hey these guys are dragging their check it out and that's when I realized that kind of under ... they they got it\nAnd then they were really close pain they really like hanging out with each other that like being around each other and uh no so that's that's kind of when I notice I didn't know who the father no but I knew we were going to be good\nAnd coach for that kind of and I know it's in some ways it's probably all Comey there's all these ingredients that go in but\nIs there a percentage as best you can try to figure it out when you find those right combinations of percentage that it's you and your staff creating a culture and if he's in our class and become seniors there's just the ... a more of an opportunity for that are compared with sometimes you get lucky and you just have the right guys like each other and you have the right leaders who happened to ...\nWell I think when we went through the year before a lot of those guys realize that we need to be closer to a team I kind of introspective look at not kind of I didn't respect looked at myself trying to figure out what I could do to help create a culture of um success in a culture of really up\nGuys caring about each other a humble\nUm servant type culture where everybody was buying and everybody is important\nAnd so I kinda I changed what we were doing during the off season and um I think it made a lot of difference\nNot oh Mike McIntyre the the coach in Colorado here on the show in in ... you are\nThe son of a ...\nDoes how does that experience shape you and prepare you and what is a very competitive profession\n[noise] um that's a that's an excellent question I'm a father George mcentire was a phenomenal personal phenomenal coach and all his players cares put so much for him and uh I just uh I Love the game um I Love the competition of it but what I saw my father is\nHow much he help young people in college you know it's such a big deal they go away from home they're Eighteen years old\nTrying to grow up you know there were ... we were all ... times and and seeing him dive into these young man and care about him and then when my dad died three years ago when they came back to you know there was hundreds of guys\nAnd then I got tons of phone calls are taxed and tell me what he meant to them and and how it's helped them in life and and everything how they change their lives and uh so when I'm that's what I saw that is what I understood and that's what I'm trying to do here along with you know when and football games and that's a\nSo it's a combination of the two in in college I definitely believe that is\nWhile my Mike McIntyre here on the show the the Colorado head football coach and one of the realities of success coach in in in every profession and certainly in coaching and you're in the spotlight on on a regular basis as the pressure\nThat comes with being expected to achieve and expected to succeed him in the face of a program and the community especially in a college town\nFor you as as the son of a very successful ... in a man who made a difference in a lot of people's lives\nHow much pressure did you feel to be successful because of whose son you were combined with how much perspective did you have maybe about the long run of a coach's career that\nPrepares you to deal with some of that pressure\n[noise] well I tell you what\nUm my father was such a phenomenal man and I and I loved her he loved me and raise me so well that um I did\nNow know the ... gene or building a brand new leaves the air and Joe seven o'clock tomorrow morning within twenty five miles north of Nebraska program we continue on translator came to nine zero aging Eduardo fine point nine FM\nYou got to win games to keep your job and all of that um but um you know I just wanted to do this and\nJust felt compelled to to work with young people and then coach football and I'd never had like I Need to attain what my dad did or anything like that I Need to make my dad proud I'm already knew how much you care for me and let me so I I I think that's important part of a father of how much\nHe loves his kids and cares for his kids if they know that they're self worked in that um then you can be yourself and so he's enabled me to to be myself and and chase my dreams and my passions and\nAnd you're right in college football or in in major sports I'm it's what have you done for me a second ago not yesterday a second ago and so but if you have your mind and go on the right goals and ... and things and ... and\nIn mind that you want to help work with an influence that if you do that if you build 'em up and I think you will be successful\nGo along to that's what he taught me that's what he taught me\nDon't you love that answer 'cause I I'm I'm forty and I have a nine year old and a and a six year old am I when my daughter was born my oldest my dad pulled me aside and said you can be scary it's going to be hard but if you love your kids right and you can do that\nMost things are going to work themselves out and it sounds like you obviously your father lived that very thing with you did it as you sort of look at your father's influencing in as a as a young man whose dad loved him which makes\nA huge difference how what is your ... you know tough love being hard on your football player oh yeah with you know trying to balance right trying\nTo make sure they know you care about him even when maybe the way you're communicating with them is is difficult for them to hear\nYeah that that's very true and and my dad had tough love with me um and and I and I ... that that's part of it I mean if there's no discipline if there's no accountability and responsibility I don't really think there's any love\nI think that's just letting people do what they want to say you don't truly love 'em 'cause you know that's going to lead them into traps\nAnd it's going to destroy their character and they're not going to be able to make right decisions and I could be able to handle adversity when it hits so when I'm coaching these young men they know that I care about him I said if I'm pushing you add on holding accountable if I'm holding you responsible\nThan actually caring love your if I'm not doing that I really don't I'm just let you do you want and that's really not love I Know 'cause I Know it's going to eventually get ya\nAnd so I talked to about that all the time just like that and uh and they understand it\nMike McIntyre the has the ball coach of Colorado here on the show with with me bill Ryder coach\nAnd I don't want to get too far ahead of ... of things for you and put the cart before the horse but you are undefeated you are in a really tough conference you've got us he coming up this weekend on Saturday and then you go to Washington so\nThe reality is I'm sure you know if you were to win out if you're a football team were to win out you would very much be in the college football playoff conversation\nHave you had that conversation with your kids with their players to any extent said hey guys we had this opportunity here if we can keep our eye on the prize week in week out we're talking about the chance to play for national championship or do you avoid that message until deeper in a season\nNo what we talked about coming in through the season it was the impact will south champs and and then and then we play in the championship game and hopes and then you got a chance to be packed a champion and then those things will take care of itself\nSo what we did is they always focus on our for first three preseason games on which we had an interesting thing that we played our two biggest rivals at schools history in the first two weeks of the season which is kind of an emotional deal so we played the issue and we played Nebraska then we had New Hampshire and then we had an open week so what we did was\nWe we did well I guess the first three we had to open week so what I did is I took um we we kind of ... we have a practice filled out a lot of our facility and then we have a practice practice fields down the hill and it's a you know about\nI guess I don't know about a half a mile wall maybe not that far down the hill\nAnd that's what we do have pre season practice so when we finished the New Hampshire game I said OK guys off we is pre season pack twelve week so we went back down the hill and got ready for the preseason pack twelve and then we talked about preparing a sales to win the pack twelve and then\nWhen we came back up the hill we decided I was there was all about UCLA and I said I'm not going to miss impact twelve or anything else again we're not going to go one week at a time", "year":
