everything going on in ... and then when I hop aboard I give you the chance to get in touch with us and get your feelings out there I'm what transpired today big plays big efforts\nBand plays questionable decisions and the like by\nOpening up our CBS Sports radio toll free line eight five five to one to port CBS without people do but the rest of the way a throughout the ah two hours plus that they give me to chat you up so high up on my phone lines are I'll take your calls starting now\nFirst step is bad from Pennsylvania that you were on CBS Sports radio\nHi Gary and that could that actually not Chad my bad I'm Sorry about that [laughter]\nNo or the benefits of years for a quarter century from the fill up your day so it's not to talk to you thank you [laughter] I'm about my eagles okay [laughter] I'm trying to birth instead of the out which is worst long at Twenty one uh Seventeen foot in the fourth quarter are missing extra point that that's another story for another time\nI'm [laughter] I'm\nCarson went went thirty or thirty seven today right the defense allows Twenty one fourth quarter point but a lot of talk is still is focusing on how this is Carson joke in the game away and my missing something\nOr or is it that they honestly\nGoodness it's it's amazing how people are saying now Carson did make a right to read and made it that throw but I'm thinking well if you eat that doesn't give up Twenty one point to put it in that spot is now with you\nThere I mean I don't do the missing from prevent defense they went into what that Seventy nothing lead\nSame on Jim Schwartz has just much more about the defense than the eagle up and now the eagles got a break as far as I was concerned because I watched it in front of a day or two fifty inch whatever screen high depth that we've got to your CBS\nI don't ever agreed picked off the pass\nSo fat and you actually ... the the fact that caused and got another chance after they took that God awful family\nHow do you like Jeffries get behind you and then have to basically tackle and before you got a ... a forty five yard parents in a very friendly which gives the eagles the chance to steal victory one of the joys of defeat well that should've been gone when Reid picked off to pass\nSome out they come up with the decision to date the ground I guess I was the corner field and they said they could not return it I never saw the ball at the ground flag\nDay that the calling the originally that was nearest actually they actually overturned it\nReally yet I don't ...\nThey originally called that pick on the field they they said it's a business so that they thought it was an incomplete I honestly thought all never touch the ground which I thought was a lucky break that they overturned that can be getting\nA correct and we should have added chance that we have to know I don't blame is on cars on Wednesday if you're going down the list of people to blame it yeah I I'm going sixteen or Seventeen deep before I ever get the cars and wind [laughter]\nOkay I just 'cause I'm hearing a lot of talk about that and there's and journalists down in Philly that I respect they're saying well I put this on Carson let them and I'm suspecting ahead going\nNo ... no no I mean it can get a\nSecond it passes no pets even though the wind set up an attack I mean you're talking about that now that's given up you double digit lead and the second half and fourth quarter games and overtime that kind of game where they gave up three or four down\nAll the the only thing I can get I live in a chance to check in with any of the Philly outlet so the Philly riders and the like the only thing I can come up with is\nEverybody blames the quarterback everybody praises the quarter back at you when it's the quarterbacks doing you lose its the quarterbacks doing and the way people look at the national football league you watched today's game now he's just not the case I'll give you another example two games I've watched\nCloser is in the early window with the eagles and the jets Sam Darnell ... you look at his numbers have all my God what a God awful gave me I'd today to to pay less than fifty percent a completion percentage\nI kid you not when I tell you about nine bowls came off why open wide receiver hands of the jets today he sold crushed by his teammates inability all is a ... or ... interceptions came off get receivers hands\nIt wasn't they didn't lose because Sam Donaldson I guarantee you that they lost because they couldn't catch catch a ball passes they didn't make plays on the football the defense cuts sliced up by Kurt cousins\n... everyone always wants to put everything in the quarterback slap you when it's because you're quarterbacks grade\nOr good enough or whatever if you lose your quarterbacks not good enough should be cut run 'em out of town drawing them out of the league that's just the way a lot of people look at the national football league I get it it's the most important position to be a truth Superbowl contender I think you have to\nHave a level of a quarterback doesn't have to be the best quarterback in the national football league but you probably have to have a top ten quarterback um people just overestimate the quarterbacks a outcome his influence on the outcome of every single game\nArnie from Tennessee's up on CBS Sports radio hey aren't\nWell Jody Mac a\nDolphin quarterback he didn't look that bad day or what\nOh well you're a\nQuarterback he didn't look at it they would play all that on him either\nRight bright guy swallow went back to be in ... he looked better than broadcast widely last week today he was All right he wasn't the main reason they lost but he also wasn't good enough to live them to anything it was ...\nAnd have a job doing it\nYes ah coming coming back from the deep dearly departed of the national football league people thought his career was over a not only is he doing the job he's a work course\nThey gave him the ball a lot they ride them alive at his advanced age of his career and yeah as they meant for his place he's a bigger reason I'm being a first places any\nAnd my

after they one game too and the A. L. D. S. wrong they have many Aggie steady one to interrupt I\nChose your favorite the red Sox and swipe the fact that the red Sox at home field advantage and that one a hundred and eight games during the regular season they took out the ... and five I think they're going to beat the Dodgers too\nI'll say six socks insects\nWe'll see what Scott email I was going to be my guest at the top of the hour thinks about the upcoming World Series we'll talk to him at the top of the hour right now talking to you on the phone date by five to one to four to seven Ira from Staten island's up pie I\nWhat I was an automotive so it kind of\nPlay up where it would um you know fighting of course her step a class of ... in the last two weeks on I thought they held their own for a while at first but you know a talent and wrote a a cop and you know it yet this is ...\nI mean after they're hurting the touchdown and dry and in it for your ball that's not right\nDo you do agree with me or you look at the final stats and Donald's numbers are pretty damn bad but I Can't remember a game and you and I've been watching the jets for forty fifty years on and we've seen some bad jet teams\nThat being said dropped passes blatantly drop path is not a top cats didn't come down with a wide open hit him in hands tied drop passes this is bad as I can remember seeing a lot of aspect being twenty years\nYeah now once again you know a couple of the regular receivers were out but there is no you're you're gotta catch your past and and more evident I think are worth twenty seven it was still a ballgame Crowell drop the past and they had plenty out there for an on\nAnd on there no one in front of him and and\nOh I think are worth twenty they said there was still a ballgame Crowell dropped to pass and he had twenty dollars in front of them\nI didn't know on there no one in front of them\nAnd then comments and said he ended up with a field goal is to make it funny that I Would say we're still kind of hanging around protector been twenty to fourteen and and then also you know than non hole on the um Ravi Anderson are long past where they shared throwing a fourth quarter\nYou know that was another one forty ... Seventeen and then they get the ball in fact the twenties for one sport have\nNow are you doing to play when I got the penalty for throwing the ball the rap\nNo wonder if they didn't call back that would have fallen headed play this guy's never got ... but the earlier like the fourth quarter down for a separate Seventeen and they don't call it pass interference and it gets pushed really earned even though they got the one road factor\nWhere they got the tangled up I mean he clearly push and is now because we are richer their flag so\nI thought I thought it was borderline yeah I could have been called might not have been called a we see that every single weekend the national football league was a close call the one that he got upset listen to the ball with the rats\nThat was one of ... passes because he was behind him and it was just under thrown there was some contract contact but the defendant was trying to make a plan a ball and it did was it easy you know how to play because Donald ... airs it out the way it's supposed to touch down\nAnd then Anderson adds fuel to the fire by throwing the ball to read and write they inept\nAnd dumb equals blowout lost the Vikings\nI put you write about Donald they didn't lose the costs have gone all the the one thing I Will have to say I got to put a lot of this on page today and the coaching staff\nThe court granted okay this is this for you know it's for professional games on the fifty degrees he played one collegiate game on fifty degrees or two winners today we're a major factor and after the first couple of Dr\nI understand if I can take them certain things but when you're casting game\nBut they continue to be okay you want to stretch you feel a couple of times I got no problem buttons Fifteen twenty yards out passes the bulls were selling her all he was having trouble adjusting to the wind\nYou would think after a couple of drive for a couple of plays you were just in years maybe that heightened over the middle of the field or something because the kid wasn't gonna hit those tasks as he just wasn't ready to handle that type of weather and it's not a knock on wood and part of growing up and learn to combine the north east but\nDue to ah to be fair cousins made those passes today and I know you've got more experience and he's been down the road but Donald supposed to have a strong arm as anybody in the national football league and he just didn't compare to cousins to\nKnow which you wouldn't expect but but the point I Know you understand me but the point of trying to drill home is this is the first time this kid's experienced ... wins in Jersey\nSo if you see he's struggling with it like trust they never were just being there for just extensively they never guess offensively once again I didn't going it's game expecting to weigh in\nOn my own even going to gain in Chicago effect as well we spoke yesterday that made it to a actually gave a telephone bills get the five five but now we're pretty banged up so I'm not sure which way diseases headed right now\nIra ah my condolences a ... cell shared condolences and today was a bad laws for the jets I saw it coming but ah still ah I thought they'd be a little bit more competitive than they were Jason from Kelly's up on CBS Sports radio AJ\n... a year just to get to play another team next week and the bears where the receivers that's out today really let down their quarterback got ... was victimized by a couple of drops one by the tight end sams and the first of all he's been good or subject signed was drops\nAnd the expensive ... Robinson had a drop in the first half the strangest sequence though was late in the third quarter tied at twenty four\nTaylor Gabriel the speed store is open deep for a possible touchdown or inside the ten loses the pass it in the sun would change skiffs and happened\nUh two plays later comes the block putting all of a sudden they're down by seven yeah besides the bad receiving corps and what can you tell me about the jets for next week\nKen let me let me ask you about Gabriel cause a and again I don't watch every play that the bears every single week I Try and jump around and watch a bunch of games\nI I'd seen him make several mistakes they feared losing one in his son coughing up by a a a catch ... already made an important billings balls going off his hands yet they continue to put them out there\nI'm not sure what what has he done that gives the bears so much confidence in him to enter ... confidence in him because he keeps going to um\n[noise] oh well that's a good point Jody because a lot of the success came against Tampa on a day that you lie and nine other guys from the white could have beaten Tampa that day they were awful [noise]\nUm I guess the theory is that you know between ... and ... with his speed that's just so much speed to spread out the ... the whole often says look so sloppy so far after six games this year that\nI mean Gabriel yeah he's made a lot of mistakes but in the general the equation probably so as everybody else on that you know on the fence on the plate they've been sloppy and that's been a disappointment to me so far\nNo and then we got sloppy again sloppy we'll see who's ... who's left sloppy next week and that's probably the theme is going to walk away with when Jay time she had to call a jets bears next week in Chicago Pete from Charlotte it's up on CBS portray like Pete\n... who is now I ...

Taylor capture out left field on what would've been a game by double I doubt that change the complexity of the game right there\nIt did now I annoyed some Dodger fans earlier today I was on CBS as serious as it might be network radio this morning\nAs great a play as family play was he took command route on the ball he what he did yeah\nHe kind of made it into into them from play than it needed to be now we mated and it was it did change the entire momentum of the game and we'll go down as one of the ban and defensive plays in postseason five years ten years Fifteen Years twenty year period I he's going to be in that mix but to be told\nHe didn't exactly take the best route to the baseball\nYou know you're exactly right now what I Would say in his defense and I guess maybe you would call a grading on the curb a little\nBit okay um\nYou have to remember this was a guy that started the game and second base you know the modern baseball today where these guys manager\nWho players around like chess pieces anymore uh Taylor's play the first few innings of the game at second base and then during a double switch he got pulled out in left field and I believe\nThat was his first inning in left field so you're right it was it the greatest route to the ball but for a guy that had just switched from second base just shoved out of left field is as the wheels were turning I thought it was pretty good\nScott Miller from bleach report our guest here on CBS Sports radio\nOr not a key playing a game for me and maybe it's just because I've been in disagreement the way some people have handled this individual players over the last week to ten days many Machado laying down Eighteen\nFirst born with too strange three and two page getting on bail both for\nThe big box or they gave the Dodgers the lead by bone you I\nI I I Know manning with China was not a perfect player\nAnd he plays aggressively if that makes them dirty so be it ... what was all over the base the other night and yeah I think he stepped on it on purpose but he's trying to make a winning play some out because he did what he did on the base pads\nAnd because she gave an interview in St Louis and I'm just not Johnny also that's not the kind of player I Am\nHe became does villain and is bad guy and his band teammate and ... cancer why didn't I ever hear any of this when he was in Baltimore\n[laughter] that is an excellent excellent question man I'm I'm\nI was talking to a person in Baltimore connected with the Orioles earlier this week\nAnd I asked him that question and he had a pretty good answer he said oh\nYou mean your weren't watching the Orioles this season when they finish like sixty five games out of the first place I said yeah you're probably right maybe I just wasn't thinking of that stuff but ah yeah very deeply I think we saw a little bit of it in Baltimore but I think it was\nWell managed to get a few up to credit buck Showalter for that whatever a member a few years ago the Orioles got into an ugly for all with the old club when Machado hit cats are there or is with his back swing twice in one sororities\nSaid I'd our faith in the world at it because I knew that tipping is pitchers and with the problem so a shirt up give her okay man I guess the Astros get five at a there ... there were stopped watching site but it got dark\nSo I'm I'm gonna say are based on

they moved to teams to Los Angeles or they just believe because of the market size and because they previously it at a pro football franchise in town or not only won two are necessary for the Los Angeles\nAnd the rams they're unlucky have been good coming back in may when end up with a Super Bowl championship and I'm kind of gotten enough for the attention of the town and there are viable nobody cares about the charges in LA\nAnd they're in LA now and they're gonna be staying in LA for a while 'cause they're building that man some stadium and they did so for two teams so they're going to have two teams in LA and one of them is not going to do real well and that's going to be the chargers so if you've got a town like Seattle\nThat specifically sounds out of town said ... steam and he's a profitable team\nThey're not going to want to take the chance would relocation somewhere else and not be guaranteed to do as well as they were in Seattle so I think they will go to great

CBS Sports radio ah you know I'm already on record taken a Red Sox insects in the world series\nMade to pay before the dodge into brewers wherever done and I said whoever wins the American league championship series is going to be good at picking a World Series which turned out to be the red Sox and they want\nKind of handily over the Astros so I'm taking the Sox in six I'm I was thinking about five but at the Dodgers good then are they going to write a little momentum over the last several years teams to the bad\nTime off having fared as well as teams played later you would think stress in using up pictures in the like it would favor the team that adds some downtime but actually the team that is continually played has has done better going forward um so I don't think the red Sox get an advantage because they've got a couple of extra days off\nI just think they're better team I think they're going to win so I'll take Red Sox insects as my one pick\nI Need the chiefs here the wind by at least they touched down there a six point favorite over the bangles tonight a two minute warning chiefs driving in the red zone they got a third insects from the Seventeen yard lined the route fourteen seven\nAfter cheats can win by a a touchdown tonight yours truly going to be sick for sex with my picks up there's a Patrick my home's touch down\nSo making Twenty one to seven\nA with a under two minutes yeah they all get the ball back here a bangles may have a chance to go down and score but a cheaper up by fourteen brief for three and a called yesterday had the\nSometimes the close games go your way and sometimes they go against you I had the are under Ines Sainz and the ravens\nA talker makes the extra point late that makes the total forty eight\nThe under all who was forty nine and a half so if anybody gets a field goal over time it's over so that kind of dodged a bullet there and\nThen Redskins cowboys that the Redskins plus one\nCowboys miss a field goal at the gun off the upright that would've tied it and send that game and overtime so I dodged the bullet semi pro games uh we got to keep going tonight I think they win by at least a touchdown over Cincinnati we shall see I couple of calls to round is bad boy out\nGeorge in LA up on CBS portray like George\nDownwind you already know how you doing good but you good good man this is a magical time in in Los Angeles was rammed and Dodgers fan but adds a one game yet has he no but I don't really care about and be on a street joining Mac all I care more about the\nRams Dodgers to be honest with you ... and going way back uh this ramp team Jodie is very complete refers to print specialty yeah\nThey're they're unique team right now they're just I'm not trying out big but there are three packs and and and they can get better when they get a key to lead back in Peters hills up and and they got their line back\nThe kicker today and he made all ... and they're just a complete team buddy\nSarah there was a team of choice for me I pick them go to ... years started I thought they were pretty much on shoulders better than everybody else in the NFC the eagles were ... champion last year they wanted they wanted fair and square they got hot at the right time the Iron Dome\nField advantage to play as which would you do for them I think the rams if you're only going to have that this year which is going to be big for them going into postseason the question's going to pop up about the rams and it's going to be fair is lack of playoff experience a bunch of guys running the last year\nBut they got bounced and the first round at home by Atlanta as a matter of fact in the wild card game um they may be matched up against a team with all the more playoff experience come playoff time\nOr by like their chances rams do look like a beast right now Eric from Wisconsin's on CBS Sports radio hey\nJordan America you're doing good you\nFantastic thanks for having me on a kind of want to talk about the inner city north\nMore Vikings fan or Wisconsin which are not an easy ... or the you know I Love 'em and I think there's a hundred performed a little bit this year your parents coming out of nowhere\nWith the ... that changed everything um\nThe Packers always a threat and record here I honestly thought a Detroit would be better than Chicago but they don't record march oh you really see this right now\nI have not changed my opinion I Will say this the bears are better than I thought they were going to be that I'll give them credit for that I still think there are five hundred team I think they're a native best\nBut ah I because of the ... trade which we didn't know about when we made our production whether you're started uh they certainly upgraded\nAnd now he looks like he's a pretty good coaches hit the ground running so could they be nine and seven maybe I'll still think of them as an eight Nate Detroit's three and three I think to them as eight and eight seven to nine I thought ... started to Minnesota and then in Green Bay to the wire and I still believe that's the case\nThey've got the tide between them which is kind of funky but a ... when they got a shot\nAgainst each other a again later in the season that one in Minnesota\nPackers are probably going to have to win that cause there'll be even an door down a game if they win it then they got the tie breakers 'cause there'll be one on one against the Vikings I don't have it in front of me right now but whatever we that's scheduled Vikings Packers\nGame number two will be the biggest game that division is by far\nRight after he regret it one other return of a strange question I'm sort of a\nPacker owned by\nGreen very short order throughout Wisconsin throughout the country really\nWhy go to the news or why don't cities or states\nBuys a team of building a stadium the cost is about the same\nMm no the cost has gone up it's even more so than the stadiums are no no bargain and it depends on where

now tonight find him on Twitter ... right or wrong if a A N Darryl good evening\nGood evening Ken thanks for having me what do you know\nWell what I can tell you is that uh the owner of the team to me has warm than general manager John Dorsey uh Iraq really thrilled right now that the Cleveland Browns are not only washed or is this afternoon in Tampa Bay in overtime squandering yet another opportunity to win\nBut the fact that the the team sifted two four and one uh at this juncture of the season ah John Dorsey believes that he put together into was ready to win an inland mediate Lee and because the browns have not done that\nAnd then obviously huge Jackson's post game comments uh concerning uh his expertise when it comes to off at the ready to get in a to Todd Haley's territory I'm sure that\nAlso didn't resonate well within the organization that was very strong was that a tipping point\nWell ... you know I I I've seen this before a multiple times in this kind of feel like the beginning of the end um why the the immediate as in tonight or tomorrow is like it's got to come at some point it's almost inevitable the only thing I think it can save ...\nThey're all you're breaking up\nWe're losing do writer\nThe only thing that could say few Jackson's job at this point is whether it's the brown start rolling awesome winds here and they had a one\nBack to back games in years uh their next opponent is the Pittsburgh Steelers they ever wanted Heinz Field since two thousand and three so I'm I think that uh we are getting close to the end of the huge accident era in Cleveland at point in ...\nWell how soon could we because if they're meeting tonight or they meeting tonight or the meeting in the morning\n[noise] well uh I don't know that there are ... what I was told is that this all happened in Tampa edited the displeasure was expressed in Tampa before they even got on the plane so I'm ... you know I just I've seen this movie enough to do that this is you

organization\nAre speaking at all about the future of huge ... and my question is what's the point\nWhere you've already been through this before you have been through in off season and coming off or when sixteen it would have made sense to bring in John Doe or seen them let him bringing his own head coach so if you're going to wait any longer and now this is being brought up then what would indeed be the point of letting that play out any longer Darryl\nWhile it's to give this thing a fair opportunity to get back on track you know they've already changed out the quarterback this year they traded their starting running back on friday to Jacksonville and Nick Chubb really showed this afternoon that that was uh\nNot necessarily the worst of personnel decisions he ran very well against the buccaneers um\nYou know I and ... you know I I ... the problem that the Cleveland Browns have is that they have this reputation of having the itchy trigger finger when it comes to coaches in GM and I know that that's something that the house from family wants to\nWants to get away from it you know their their air dying to find\nSome stability yet part of the reason why they kept huge

P. palm CBS Jerry ... thanks for joining us today my friend\nHas it gone is that ... is that Purdue drum really the biggest draw them in the world\nRequires a we know it is yeah\nOr there's no other bigger drum\nThere is no bigger girl All right I'm going to have to find out because I don't know if they're telling the truth either way or that bra you just have to come down to interact with three or something\n[laughter] [laughter] it's so long I don't know if I Want to do so and it's very opposing him Purdue was imposing last night against Ohio State in the Ohio State has been known\nTo have a hiccup liked is basically every single year now over the last couple of years or did you expect it was going to get this out of hand and Dwayne Haskins throwing Seventy three times Jerry\nBut he threw Seventy three time because they couldn't Iran\nUh when they got behind\nA you know it's funny he was um\nYou know one player early and they gave me but something like biking for twenty five\nBut you know the passes weren't you know really down feel much they can get anything they wanted in a while you know they go out to the flat you get the guy from space won one and under five or six yards than about just about every time but\nOne of those Dixie completion he mistreated wide open touchdowns just missed the root of all I'm\nOver three with guys a three through nearly two interceptions among those completion the he was not sharp\nUm in general but they had to throw so much because\nThey'll produce scoring especially in the second half\nFelt like every time they touch the ball and you know let's get down like that you got to try and come back and you're running games not working and you're going to for help\nDuring ... joining us on the show follow him on Twitter Ajay the palm CBS ... there were so many things sitting out there can be a vacuum I understand there were so many things said about urban Meyer urban Meyer being over rated so on and so forth I don't know man when you when you're comparing the guy to\nTo Nick Saban how could you not be ... how could you not be says you're over rated or disappointment Nick Saban has everything has the world and his hands and everybody else you just really can't even make the same conversation with him\nYeah yeah well it okay to make that comparison man\nYeah he is you know everybody is but you know he's got a couple of national championships it's not like\nYou know he's never been successful he\nEven these teams you know their lose them once a year you know maybe twice it's\nUm you know they've got great talent they've got great town every year they got the best talent in the big tent\nYou know just in terms of full depth of their roster every year ... when the leak more often than not and they do\nNot believe in Alabama doesn't win nearly every year and they've got the best talent so you know that's I I don't think urban Meyer it's overrated but you know he got to ... I think this year\nThat isn't quite what some of his passed to ban\nA hand it does you know a good quarterback but still young quarterback even though the talent\nEither very talented guy\nAnd you could see that but it's still somewhat Ron ...\nAnd uh and that rocket showed up last night I think there since ... blindness is fantastic\nBut the the guy behind that why it that's where you could make plays against Ohio State network or do you play all night against Ohio State one day could get enough protection for David Blau or they could get the running gait going at once you got past that beds of line you know than the free running ... success\nHow great and opportunities is for Jim horrible known Michigan where you at Penn State coming up which is not easy I get that did he got rocketed Indiana to cook too cupcakes and then he got Ohio State if they can get past all of them this is a playoff team from what it looks like\nYeah oh it's a I think twelve to one Michigan\nThat that comes about is a playoff team\nAnd through what are we now eight weeks into this even\nIf you have to say that a Michigan perhaps even if they turn right now ... Ohio State still very good and if they get they got their places so\nYou know that's obviously not going to be in our body hasn't beating them yet\nUm but uh Penn State you know it's\nYou know they played Ohio State tough finally lose\nHaven't really been is that they're not really\nA dominant you might expect\nStill pretty good Penn State but uh\nYou know and and uh I think all of that I think they go to Michigan\nSo that's obviously an advantage for Michigan but ah yeah they're they're set up well right now to make a run for a playoff the level that they have spent\nThe whole time Hamas men now\nLSU currently ranked fourth both them and Alabama hibernate for a week and then they'll face each other on November third Alabama would have the natural upper hand but could Edward drawn get them in death valley\nWell yeah I think the word I Want to see\n'em you don't have to we used to prepare course they've been does to\nA buddy gives you a chance to work on\nThings that they haven't seen you know I don't I don't necessarily need to replace but maybe one or two of those too but you know stuff that Alabama won't have film on\nOr that you can use to your advantage for trying\nTo beat the team that you know the\nThe standard bearer in your lead so yeah I think\nYou know the whale is you were playing I think there are definitely the second best keep it that easy to get 'em at home and yeah they got a shot\nJerry palm joining a CBS Sports a\nHoosier Heisman Trophy winner is it to attack viola right now or is it anybody else who can give an argument because they don't play for Alabama\nI just I don't know that there anybody is\nFat outstanding and you know to kind of a default\n... Alabama's quarterback you'd have a three year you know physically very ... year but for me you know they haven't really played anybody the challenges of yet but he hardly plays in the fourth quarter\nOf games there are so far in here so\nTo me if he's going to win the Heisman Trophy\nYou have to weigh that against us\nOf game because they're so far in here so to me is the title in a hyper trophy\nYou have to weigh that against LSU\nOperate on the road Georgia baby and that's you can't be tricky donor game\nWhere you can do the thing\nThat bird hype from trophy\nBent or do you have it happen\nYou know I look at the pack twelve and they're taking a bunch of hits right now because Oregon got beaten over against Washington state and the whole thing that can come through my mind is I'm thinking\nI I don't see this is an Oregon problem I see this is maybe the rest of the pack tens problem because\nIf you're going to hinge everything on a guy who's just taken over that program after the guy left to adjust taken over that program before I don't really think you have a strong leg to stand on when you're going through so many changes and they are playing well but they did have a hiccup out of Washington state\nYeah it's a ... you're walking on the team so they were under talking that yeah well you can't really call them that upset it's ah I I you know there just isn't\nYour announced the team here than we are very ...

Goodman hoops Jeff thanks for joining us tonight\nWhen I was ... coach K does think that uh the FBI a probe and all the trials and everything is a a blip is what he called it and I'll tell you what it is not a blip or it may be a blip in a sense that there's not a kind of media covering it it's not a TV show it's not getting as much attention\nIs maybe we thought and there's three anonymous guys\nAre that are right now I'm On trial you know not big time coaches but it but it's not a boy\nI'm willing to let the process play out I have to it's supposed to be a quarter law the whole deal like that but uh it's hard for me to believe\nThat die and Williams and decided to go to do for free\nWe we don't know so it is really hard because again\nHere's the thing that could happen right you certainly sound and William soon could've gotten something from a financial guy a shoe company got a without my shift you're going is actually what went on or he might have chosen to do\nJust because of the fact that he felt like you were the best place to get to the next level uh and and have as Dr draft stock be as high as humanly possible war yeah there's something that could've could've went on there all I Would say about the whole situation is we came up\nIn the course of of the testimony or with the course of the trial I think if you're the ... you have to investigate you have to invest it all of these allegations that came up you know from\nOregon to create ... ... designed Williamson um all these ... and there was more I mean listen Joe pastor that former assistant and Arizona is now the head coach at UC Santa Barbara I've won on him up there were a lot and we don't know if they're true or not we don't know if there's proof or not\nBut I think it's better to get off it you know what ... and start to investigate and do what he should and try to figure some of these things up instead of just relying on the FBI and and and the prosecutor\nWell because\nWe're we're in a different era here Jeff where you know when I was young we been talking about one and done and things like that where you had guys that would play for three four years you get to know what I mean you get the love 'em you get to hate him\nAnd it was really good for the rivalries and it was really good for college basketball\n... ... if we have this happen here and I know that Adam Silver is talking about the G leading the changes there and I want to ask you about that coming up in a bit but how much damage if we find out that this is all true that'd be Adidas thing is true that William sinister the whole thing\nHow much damage could this do to college basketball is really the damage been done because we're in an era where these are kind of professionalized immature athletes where they just know they're worth and they want to do what it takes to get them from point a high school to point B the NBA\nI I think the damage will be done if you see some big boy programs\nOr with their fingerprints on some of these allegations\nUm if if not if it's\nYou know some of the smaller you know no disrespect to like the ... most of the world uh but if it's some of those programs um I I don't think it'll it'll hit is a big if you get you know it's time Williams involved I can just simple um then I think people start to really pay attention\nA but you know if not right now again you've got three guys a new unknown there in your house right now Jim ghetto\nFormally ... wrote code former did his consultant um Christian dock into your work or a aging MBA agent Andy Miller\nOn trial and and and that's why again you can say it's a blip\nBecause these guys are fairly anonymous uh within the the general public but within the basketball world listen it's not a ... because my phone's blowing up every single day over the last three weeks and I know Dan Wetzel who's been at that\nBut within the basketball world listen it's not a ... because my phone's blowing up every single day over the last three weeks and I know Dan Wetzel who's been at that trial every single day his phone's blowing up and Jeff ... of ESPN and ... on their phones are blowing up so uh it's not a lick within the industry\nJeff Goodman joining us on the show at Goodman hoops on Twitter so\nAccording to the attorney for the Adidas representatives wrongly bill self knew about the payments to as soon as I can you clarify anything of what's going on because these are closing statements that hasn't been necessarily put down yet in full by the lawyers or by the court correct that correct\nIn in the jury has hurt him so you know let's see if we don't know again this is this comes from a one of the\nThe the attorneys of of the defendants I'm\nJim ghetto is saying that hey listen bill self new not TJ gas Noah\nWho is the one who actually allegedly paid Billy pressed and uh and he had dealings with Sylvia ... as a mentor guardian denies that bill self new\nSo again unless you have proof I think

Indiana\nAt Ohio State and I know a lot of people and Hickey knows I haven't seen it for a year if you're going to get them this year to get him and a lot of people have that feeling feeling all of a sudden after that last uh Purdue that big beat down that Purdue laid on Ohio State which will eventually bring us to who's down\nWho's down\nTell you what urban Meyer\nHe got ... ... ... you got nipped both ... who's decided to take off which\nIs there anything that's more fake do with me on this is there anything more fake then the\nFake outrage by sports talk radio show hosts that those who are fake outrage about Nick both are\nGetting out of Ohio State and going to the NFL is going to be on this\nYou have nobody well like one guy from rivals but really nobody who is going after Nick both for leaving Ohio State early but your tune in sports radio you tune on TV you see I Can't believe people are going after Nick both suffer making a decision that was right by him and his family who\nWho was I Want to know\nWell there's people out there said it's selfish no everybody saying it's selfish in itself you should do that you should make that decision\nYour top ten pick maybe even a top five ... yes you should go\nThere is no nothing holding you back and who wants to sit in their locker room so if Nick both is supposed to be back and couldn't be backed by the Michigan game for Ohio State you're telling me the standard that locker room it'd be the missing link if his team does out there and get the advantage to him\nNo oh no [laughter] no and you can make an argument that well you should be with his football team these are professional amateurs\nThese are guys who were added an extra level so if you wanted to talk about this a coastal Carolina or if you wanted to talk about this that have stayed or northwestern and some of the other places out there you go right on ahead but at the school like Ohio State\nAlabama climb so I Would throw into that mix your professional amateur\nMeaning you're getting yourself to that school to go on to the next level\nSo no I don't take anything away from Nick both so I take away from those were making a false argument and certainly in equivalency that people were upset and they both know was upset and they both people will have said aren't even upset and they both say this is what you're supposed to do that\nWho is up the chargers everybody's just loving Kansas City and wind up there up forty five ten over the bangles who are not a bad football team Kansas city's doing fantastic the office is just rip roaring Petra while homes looks like the real deal he throws this left me throws with this right he throws on the ...\nHe is the sensation of the NFL so far throughout this year\nBut there's another team in the west and that's the chargers attendance ripped off how many in a row now for in a row and they're not allowed to five and two and one on the road and then one up\nOn the pond over in the United kingdom by the time they come back home to Los Angeles ... got I'm ready\nThe grand old man and Philip Rivers hasn't gone they're the best story that no one's talking about in twenty eight T next\nWho's down the chargers because I'll talk about charges but no one seems to care about him including people in their own hometown including the NFL who is wondering whether or not they are viable in a city like Los Angeles\nWithin the next ten years CSPAN those needs to do what's right neither move this team back or find a way to self esteem and move it back to San Diego or somewhere else because it doesn't seem that chargers fans or LA is one of the chargers\nI Know that's a city that's supposed to be of winters you have two teams that are winning people like the rams they're not down with the chargers next\nWho's up my God\nThe words that are being said about him and Lincoln Riley right now and I'm telling you as of today and as of last week market Sean McVeigh is the most dangerous man in the NFL because all these owners\nThe owner in Cleveland I Would say the owner and a host of other places are looking at ...\nHe's so young he's so brilliant it's this changing of the guard to the NFL I Want to be the next big thing in the NFL I Want to be the next fun off in the NFL let me go get my own version is Sean McVeigh and that's scary because if you get a guy like that and it doesn't pan out\nYour holy hell on your hands because there's only so many guys who are sub thirty five years old\nWho can still hold the beef fever of his football team and Sean me they will be one of the first ones to tell you he's a hell of a lot of help from the grand old man and wait Philips\nBut for Lincoln Riley Campbell were outlet the lump them altogether ... was talking about them be right at the top ... lists where people go and see how they work their deals how they work what they're doing with their camps they love the way they're bringing these guys around and all of a sudden it's conversation can they be the next one's the next young guns\nThe ten commandments show\nBack on CBS Sports radio can comment until two am eastern eight five five two and two for CBS eight

remember looking down at a than anything you know what this might be you know the most historic winning the programs history this when you look at\nYou know the number two teams with a lot of momentum that hadn't been to that point came in to receive a lot of confidence and ultimately ended up getting the pace taken away from them earlier\nWhen you see the way things started out for them and just an old for to start the year and a lot of people like Rome you brought a lot of people like what he had been doing last year and then it starts off on such a down note and now they've really started chugging along is this just a taste of what he can do at a school like Purdue\nAbsolutely I think that when you look at how the season started with obviously divisional opponent that that you know means a lot to start the game was on national television how big game day was there in the house and the kind of really lose the game and the dramatic fashion that they left a bitter taste in their mouth and they went on to lose two more one of which they really should the last I think to eastern Michigan\nBut yet it's still the same hung in there they still believe in what Jeff was was preaching to them and also when they were able to put it together on the grandest age having game they come back\nTo Purdue and actually um you know put together stole the performance or you know and part of the nation\nBrett Hopkins joining us on the show I'm certainly pulling for him for the rest of the year ... going to tell you and it's not just ... on the deep but that's an added bonus I'll tell you that right now is joining us on the show\nSo loud week seven as it tends to be every single week spin nuts and we're hearing a couple of rumors right now ah about huge accident with the Cleveland Browns I I just want to run past you here\nOr there alright are out of Ninety to flee the fan and Cleveland reported that they're they're meeting tonight\nAnd a meeting of the mines and we we could see some red alert type stuff that was his quote a when you change out to coach in the middle of the season what does that do to a football team\nAbsolutely nothing\nI mean I Do I opinion absolutely nothing I mean I don't know if if there's a situation where it's been so greed just the relationship between the head coach and his team then it'll be a welcome you know situation\nBut unless you're hearing guys are just grumbling about the relationship that they basically don't feel that he is someone that is in control there and it's ultimately not getting the job done then it'll be easier for them made the transition but I haven't heard that from the guy you know what I'm saying I of course I'm not in that locker yeah I don't know\nSpecifically was being fit in with a relationship is life but what we can see from the outside it's not toxic\nSo basically when you switch up the situation like that that's for the ban I mean I'm watching television right now and and I both band just tired of you know the mediocrity they throw out of this team but I think that this year that need to look at this differently because we can\nGrow from the Cleveland Browns you know why because they should be upset that the ... lost in the buccaneers land but this is the first draft like the last two or three years so why should we have the patience because of the team is better\nAdmittedly better they've already double that they've already double double the window bill so far and I'm halfway through the season\nYou you know huge actually was one in thirty one coming into this year if they were going to make a change should the bronze and made a change then this last season\nBrowne should have been a change when they were wanting\nTwenty I mean don't you think that that trigger should have been pulled a long time ago ... eat with actual problem can arguments I don't know yeah I think there's\nSome issues can't it already been answer but you know this is like a fine wine and unfortunately people are so used to the instance stuff\nThat when it does take a little bit of time for it to you know to kind of age him to come\nAt least that tasteful products that we know what's going to sell you know it's up to the consumer we're not willing to wait for that moment when you got Becker may build who obviously had another dimension that often they drafted miles Garrett they drafted a the work it out of Michigan these guys are ultimately pray makers but\nThat will get turnovers and put it back in the hands of ... job and DJ in uh uh do Johnson the guy that lead them in Russia last year the team is starting to be balanced on both sides of the football but it's going to get a little bit of time for us to really legitimately be about the browns being contender\nBread Hopkins former NFL the current host some serious XM NFL joining us on the show will for Baker and you just mentioned a rookie quarterback this type of change happens early ... you said it didn't have an effect on the team but could this have an effect on him and his maturation\n[noise] I Know the bigger maybe go to the ... with the guy came here to post up up by who's the head that it's that sharing the Heisman Trophy winner but this is the guy that also had the transfer to a ... a couple of different schools to find that comfort level you know to be able to be considered one of the best quarter back to the game so is used to kind of being that\nBut this is the guy that also had the transfer to a ... a couple of different schools to find that comfort level\nYou know to be able to be considered one of the best quarter back to the game so used to kind of being the bad and it's been an underdog you know what I'm saying that no one is really you know really got behind but when they're with some people are making the analogy between he and the great Drew Brees there's something to that\nThe kids to play maker and innately can he's a leader players gravitate towards now even ability but his personality his style is competitive nature and that ultimately is going to spark something else and not only you know himself with other teammates\nYou we've seen the ups and downs Brad Brad Hopkins joining us on the show from these rookie quarterback speaker took it on the chin last week better this week even in the law is\nSam Darnah was fantastic last week this week not so much what can what can you really glean 'cause you guys like me we love to say we told you so seven weeks into this thing but hey I didn't play the game Brett I never been in the locker and tell me what's what with a rookie\nWell the thing is though you you when you take a gamble and commit yourself to one of these you know these are high draft picks yeah there's going to be some aches and pains to come along with the excitement that you know potentially there or they wouldn't have been taken that high right\nA kind of liken it to like a a big block or something a little big oh sloppy being\nYou know ultimately you know when that rascal gets tuned up and where they have all the right pieces a carburetor\nYou know the the right hand the thing that's going to make it really be that high powered car they can get down at quarter mile tracking about you know nine seconds or something\nIt takes a minute or two for that that that motor to really be put together and spark like it's supposed to but the potential is there so I'm not gonna throw the baby out with the bath water I'm going to wait and see what this team looks like maybe with a couple of years of mature ration maturation on a bigger megaphone on some of the other assets that are being dumped draft pieces\nBut unfortunately with all this conversation about Jackson is actually I'm not sure he's going to be around to reap the benefits of what do you help put together\nRead Hopkins joining us on the show former NFL or current host serious sex them NFL Philadelphia they are they having a bit of a Super Bowl hangover\nAnd that's a good question I think that really kind of like ... Craig's list or us with Doug was talking about today though and believing in them that comfortable position they like to be\nIt may be fabricated at this point but then again I think they had to expected the bulls eye pervert really to be on their backs\nYou know at the beginning of the year because you won the super bowl last year\nI'll be you did it with this underdog role for summer your image were really no one really focused on you but it's different when you when the bitch when you when the big show you know so I think that it's ultimately Harper team to kind of be in that position understand and be comfortable in that position to be able to repeat\nBut nowadays it is a lofty goal to think about winning back back Super Bowls but it does put a lot of pressure on the team that just want it\nIs what's going on with dad Prescott\nThey'll all thinking about it I mean if you're not trying to do too much\nYou know especially in a couple of instances I mean those who wants to who thinks the deck prepped for the phone call on the one yard line that scoop it up school you know what I mean but then again I think what he did after that put us up his team right back in the position to win right went down to seven more on the board after giving them to seven right\nAnd then ended up driving them down at least positioned wise enough to make a field goal palatable was forty seven yards which would have been good\nHad you know they had not had the issues with the long snapper you know mess with the ball so ultimately yeah you can say that there's a lot of issues that I was maybe surrounding this team but it's not talent and it's certainly not the quarterback position\nBread Hopkins joining us on the show we'll do it could be Jerry Jones on down because I I Know a lot of people go after Jason Garrett I'm thinking well Jason Garrett's always standing there in the media he'll he'll put blame on himself but how much is he willing to do or how much does the able to do Jerry Jones is always going to be learning over his shoulder\nYou know I guess there's always someone to be something to be worried about and we've been dealing with that situation ever since we were kids right near the helicopter dads you know what I'm saying ... Jerry Jones is the ultimate helicopter dance when it comes to his head coaches\nBut at the end of the day just we're just does what he wants his players to just do their job\nIs nothing more nothing less and maybe some time to Jerry in his prognostications about the greatness of his team puts more pressure on the guys to to be at that level and it does where the dysfunction sometimes at the end of the day you're good coach he's a great coach he knows exactly what it takes to win\nAnd when you get the right players in mind that can do those things similarly especially when you come to like you know bad press got his ego LA the players that we know that they've drafted lately that can make waves it'll come together\nYou agree with my great will go into the winner earlier today\nHank yeah absolutely first of all of these the titans coach now it's getting to be that that show about it [laughter] but I mean\nYou know one of the wants to tie we've seen a lot of ties to Joyce let overtime situation this year you know what I mean\nBecause ultimately everyone's scared to lose but who's willing to do what it takes to win this is a difference there I think it might be able to come in from his old school a philosophy and coming from the train the tree of Bill Belichick he doesn't want to not lose he wants to go out there and when and that's ultimately why he made the decision I was trying to not go off her meds words in\nAnd for oh three one one eight hundred three seven four oh three one one\nAre you looking to senior care for your mom or dad that don't know where to start Hi I'm John Lennon with a place for mom nobody knows your parent or a loved one better than you and nobody knows senior living better than the experts at a place for a mom it's a free service and we've helped thousands of families find the right place to their mom or dad\nThere's a place for answers late for mom called today called a\nPlace where mom at one eight hundred three seven nine eleven Seventy four that's one eight hundred three seven nine eleven Seventy four\nSports play [noise]\nI'm Peter Schwartz we begin with certain that I football in Kansas City is the chiefs when pain go hunting\nAgain find a lot of people don't\nKnow\n\nMade this aren't chiefs radios the chiefs beat up on the bangles forty father ten four touchdown passes for Patrick my homes\nIn Fox borrow the patriots beat the bears thirty eight thirty one Tom Brady free touchdown passes\nThey made some plays Mason obviously came down to about one yard and uh but I think for us to to get it went on the road or something we've been talking about so we need to do and a little bit better than I think there's still a lot of things you can do better and I have a good team so it was a great team with\nA bears quarterback rich ... through a fifty four yard Hail Mary on the final played it was caught by Kevin White\nTackle it the one yard why not of South Florida with alliance took on the dolphins [noise]\nDan Miller on lions already on the line speak the dolphins thirty two Twenty one Michael Roberts with a couple a touchdown catch is on the day\nElsewhere on the scoreboard the rams are seven and all that matters thirty nine it's and the Redskins beat the cowboys twenty to seven ... was the same speaking the ravens twenty four twenty three Drew Brees with career touchdown number five hundred it was the Texans over the jaguars twenty seven overtime box twenty six rounds twenty three\nBut I can speak the jets thirty seven seven St Panthers down seven see nothing after three quarters beat the eagles Twenty one Seventeen gold silver bells thirty seven five and then the wind and the chargers beat the titans twenty Nineteen\nBaseball the world series where we get on Tuesday in Boston Red Sox take you on the Dodgers other baseball news the angels damning bread hospice their new manager NBA the hawks over the Cavaliers one thirty three one alive in\nHis one thirty one thunder one twenty the dog it's over the warriors one hundred Ninety eight the clippers beat the rockets one Fifteen one twelve NBA suspends Lakers for branding room for games Lakers guard ...

another\nFrustrating performing Jackson said it's time for him to take control a level of\nContinue to watch something that I Know how to do a ... that just the truth I mean that's nothing against\nAnybody in our building I just think that's what I Do and I think I Need to be a little bit more and more stress of what I say I'm not trying to create any issue here but I think if the officers not playing well then we have an over the period of time then the head coach and they often some guy who's done this\nI think I have every right as that goes to jump in here and see if I can help\nAnd the fish and get this thing to where I think it needs to be because we need to be better off it and if that's my specialty did I Need to be involved and I will be on the respectful I mean that's why you bring guys any making according you know I'm again there's some things we gotta we gotta fix that get this thing back door and he's\nSeven games in huh\nAnd this was coming up now I Want to know see I should ask this question where there are a rider on in Cleveland earlier\nHickey do you think this was\nWas this after Jimmy Haslam and John Dorsey had a conversation or was this before\nWhen you Jackson made these comments [noise]\nI'm going to say the ... from watching the hard knocks and we'll see in the way you Jack Nicholson and say\nOkay so this was after so boy this is this is my ... year Jackson's the safest ever\nBecause you're going to go back to to getting involved in play calling here\nNow you've been involved in play calling don't tell me that because there was a third and two and yes I watch every bronze game\nOr there was a third and two that got switched to a fourth and to and they threw it and said Iran where if you know you're going forward on fourth down you'll probably try to run and get the first down if you're on a third and two\nSo you've already been involved in play calling before you probably did that earlier today with the Bronx would Fordham fourth down instead of taking a field goal which ended up costing three points which\nThey lost by three points so that might have gotten involved as well so you can't say it wasn't already involved in play calling 'cause he's definitely been involved in the play calling now he is the head coach he's allowed to make those calls because he's the head coach of the football team but you're also going to take the brunt of the criticism there\nAnd when you take the brunt of the criticism and then you come out and you say that type of strong stuff\nThen that's going to throw people intuitively and obviously by the calls we've gotten a night that throwing a lot of the people intuitively tonight\nSo you're the one who wants to answer to that\nBut it always seems to be hunky dory again if if they're actually having these conversations that what's the point of dragging them out\nBecause if you're already talking about it that means it's already done and you can get yourself a head start\nOn the next coaching search if you were to make that decision now but you might not trust what taught Haley would do or Gregg Williams would do as ... as an interim head coach and that would probably be understandable that level next\nOne of the most bizarre sites on Sunday was during the coin toss in Philadelphia as Eric reading Malcolm Jenkins had to be separated from each other

be a year that they were going to vie for the playoffs I thought they were building I was wrong it was an early exit and it just seems that everything Sean McVeigh does though Georgia's right\nHe doesn't play as guys during the pre season they get off to a seven and a start now watch everybody coffee that\nThe the rams they sign ... who's ... who's a very young head coach now other teams are going to want to do it now all those other teams with those decisions might end up falling completely apart because I think there's only one Sean McVeigh and I don't know who the next one is but they're all about the find out either way\nIf someone's going to get their way or something and ain't going to go perfect but my God I I don't know who's going to do it and I just don't know because the auspices good defenses in the defense is dirty or the ... that needs to be the heck I'm somewhere I just don't know when it's going to happen\nYeah he just see some type of a sudden ... brother because he he as everybody\nThere's no ... everybody plays for the team result argue there's no huge jacks and there's no whatever you know I'm Sorry about the browns or situation but\nAh tell issue they've created it on their own\nBut thanks can have a good thing\nOr you could shoot [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] I didn't mean to do that and it made it right you off there it's yours yeah the browser hellish\nThat's the way she goes John in San Francisco then I'll get the Johnny next up on CBS force ready to go ahead\nAnd then I can all wonderful go ahead\nHey listen I've got to take on the the gravel decision and um\nYou know at least ... yeah so that's how I first of all I Want to\nSay that I think it's a great a discussion topic because as valid points on all sides and I understand you know being planned Monday morning quarterback or in in our situation Sunday evening quarterback\nIt's a it's an emotional bam bam split decision I think in a moment having said that no I think my take is based on the big picture and if you're if you're a if you're a dollar check in your plan and the AFC East\nOr your McVeigh and you're playing in the NFC West I think you can afford to make that decision and go for it but if you're if you're playing in the AFC\nCell and you've got a log jam of three teams that three and three and the winner owning is going to make the playoffs and it's probably going to come down to one game that separate\nThe winning division painting versus the other two I don't think it's a gamble like hey what are your thoughts\nWell right now you're in the thick of it with the Jacksonville and yourself there's three and four Houston I Know Houston's one for in a row I think that that house of cards can fall for it any time John now I don't know if that was going through my rebels head when he was making that decision I think that if we all live right there in the moment\nA cause of member he's playing at nine thirty our time he knows he's playing early before everything so I don't think anything is going on I think in in that moment he's thinking ... if he makes is if they get this thing converted\nThey were going to be eating out of his hands for the rest of the year unless they go out there and they suck up the room for the rest of the year but if\nIf he ... he is he converts and their foreign three and they win at the end against against the chargers think about what I'm saying about the charges right now I think they're the best he no one's talking about their\nFive and two and everybody loves Kansas City they won for in a row so I I think that that's a negligible difference and I think a lot of people want to head coach who has the sack to do with he ended up doing today I I it's it's hard for me to go after him it really hit is I get your point I hearing\nThis exactly why it's a great discussion topic point taken thank you have yourself a nice evening\nThank you very much I Know I hear what you're saying rather I absolutely hear what you're saying\nIt in the mass of it three and four guys you can't go to over time it it just assuming you make the field but I Do crazy things have been happening so far this year it's supposed to be higher odds to make the field goal\nOr to make the extra point I should say it's still supposed to be higher odds and it's tough and so many people are going after my ramble for the call itself\nI still would rather put the ball in the air you put the ball on the ground or you you run the football\n... it's difficult when you you have nothing to back you up you have no other place you have no other time it's very difficult to do that\nAnd so I agree with the ball and the year I Would not I wouldn't want to throw said they didn't say that'd be the one I didn't want to do you mentioned Henry mentioned Louis so many other things that there's I think you just need to boil down to the point of oh you're going for the two point or not if you go for the two point er and you make it\nAnd you don't feel like going algebra class anymore\nSo say you get him or you get one of the other top quarterbacks and the draft\nVenue at another pick then you're able to add another pick\nAll of a sudden you're not waste your time was safe while I'm Barkley anymore because he's getting carries that matter there actually starting to try to compete you're using some of those takes maybe on guys who can God Forbid protect a quarterback\nMeanwhile Eli Manning gets one more chance in the sun with a pretty good defense even though they've kind of sucked up the room here and there this year with a pretty good defense a decent offensive line was supposed to be a pretty good rushing attack and he takes one final year left in stretches that industry\nAnd from thirty seven to maybe forty years old and I know that's a stretch but from thirty seven and maybe forty years old there's a window open for the Jacksonville Jaguars where before\nAs of right now\nWith Bartels\nWith Tony Kessler your windows clothes\nYou're not taken seriously with either one of those quarterbacks can next fall one situation can ship a cellar to situations in fifty three years of the super bowl or I'm supposed to give your window open please\nIt's a full hardy idea not foolhardy you're going for a quarter back in the guy that the Tom Coughlin those can go on what a big football game\nAnd he said that about ...\nIt seems hair brain until you really think about it and then it makes\nTotal sense even at the cost of a first round pick\nOh we can't get rid of our first round picks why\nYou address the quarterback Hi you're going to trade up trade more picks and drop the quarterback got great then you lose some of those older guys on the defensive and and then you can't even read punish him well done\nMake no mistake Jacksonville the window is closed as October twenty second and you're at a major crossroads right now this is up for you to make this change and the one that makes the most sense towards it is a thirty seven year old two time Super Bowl champion who knows your team president inside and out and vice versa\nOr we can go on wasting our time with

the giants which are probably not a team that can win the NFC I guess logistically they still can but likely won't you got these other three teams that are vying for first place\nAnd supremacy at this point in the season in the division and I wondered which of these teams would use week six as a catalyst and a springboard and would then put together\nA couple of good games because then you start to

against the defense that had been playing really well but to special teams touchdown for the New England patriots\nAfter they had given up fourteen point to the bears on their earlier turnover so this was a a bit of a back and forth affair with Chicago\nOn fast forward to the end of the game and because it's a major tug of war of course Mitch Trybulski has a shot at the end zone\nAnd so you're

Sunday yes\nKevin White comes down with the ball and and maybe because there was pressure on ... the trajectory of the ball is more up than it is out so so maybe that causes white to come in a little better the actually the whole grumble has to move in so that they're shy of the goal line this ball didn't reach the end zone\nSo white catches the ball and instantly the patriots stand about\nOf course the the momentum would be to fall back wording to the end zone he had bears who were trying to push him into the end zone but the patriots were so quick to add to stand up and we always hear about a Hail Mary get up and knocked the ball down right except there's one guy\nWho was assigned to stand on that goal line\nTo be on that wall so to speak\nTo not jump up\nDrawing harming his job was to keep the planted so that if the ball was caught\nIn a receiver came down with it in this case Kevin White he was already in position\nTo keep him out of the end zone\nI'm so impressed with that because again momentum\nWould have should have in many cases ... would have carried white and the pile into the end zone but instead of drawing harm in doing his job the patriots so quick to react and make sure that there wasn't even six inches for Kevin White and and white thought that it was a touchdown\n...

Lewis who could Walt Disney what did we learn from Walt Disney struck down with cancer early probably would have been even bigger and greater but man his legacy lives on in his name has never been stronger what did he do\nWell it was extraordinary is a very talented animator in his early years she created this studio they created Mickey Mouse and really technological breakthroughs\nBut then from Nineteen thirty ... thirty seven he drove his team to produce Snow White the first full linked animated feature and it was extraordinarily successful even though we had to mortgage that company and mortgage the eye Peter Mickey Mouse to fund the picture\nWhen it was hugely successful\nFor years later we as a bitter strike for many of those same animators because the company had grown and got more corporate structure and the bureaucracy had changed and suddenly the kind of leader he'd been at a smaller more family like company\nHe couldn't do here and he couldn't grow we couldn't adapt to that new reality show what really happened is ... brother Roy ran the corporate side of the Disney studios from then on\nWalt Disney focused on things like Disneyland so he was great in imagining things and focusing on ... projects his brother became great at running a big empire\nSo if Stanley McChrystal was looking at Walt Disney in his forties thirties and forties do you try to get more do you try to broaden out Walt Disney or you just try to get somebody with a skill set to match the problem\nBut it's a great that's a great question I think the first thing you do is try to get Walt Disney to adapt but there's some people who can't or just are not interested in adapting and then what you've got to realize is he's not the right leader for the new reality of the Disney studios and\nThen you bring somebody anyway a little bit like apple and regionally was Steve Jobs he does basically an insurgency on a company that he created when he came back he even said he was better suited for that job\nWhen I get to ... so he grew the leader is all in context the followers in the situation determine the leaders effectiveness Margaret Thatcher\nShe was strong convictions believe very strongly and certainly conservative ideas because she was so unwavering and that she became very very appealing to the British who went through the very difficult Nineteen seventies she became a very popular prime minister and then after about eleven years\nThe arc of her leadership she became more autocratic to vary from confidence style she had before began to wear fin on people and she was essentially politically assassinated now it wasn't that she had lost it it was that the times had changed\nThe context it changed her followers had gotten where are you first style and they

Jim how are you at the start of the week\nPretty good all things considered at Washington yeah\nYou bet let's bring in pro farmer policy analyst Jim ... Jim how are you at the start of the week\nPretty good all things considered at Washington\nYeah it is Washington but a lot of Congress is on recess doesn't mean that there's any lack of things to talk about it I Want to start with something just a little bit\nAt the you know that maybe people wouldn't expect us to talk about but what what's the latest with Saudi Arabia here in the investigation into the dead of American journalist or what is it ...\nYes uh it it is if there's the focus in town other than that the immigration caravan or you know down south\nUh from both political parties and the Trump and the U.S administration is under significant pressure to react chip and and uh it's a wildcard in markets because if you go too far than Saudi Arabia will react in the uh perhaps\nIn the energy environment and I don't have to tell you how important energy as the U.S agriculture\nYeah absolutely right now we've got crude oil prices just under a little bit of pressure here today the Dow is under pressure but\nYou've got to the NASDAQ is trading hired as and the five hundred is nearly an changed right now and those are a couple of the markets that I Would look look for or look at\nFor some kind of an indication that I'm a Saudi is Saudi Arabia is getting ready to do something in retaliation but they the the status right now is we've got to wait for the the the Turkish officials to wrap up their investigation let us know what they know right\nYeah the country's president has gone to unveil his comments and their investigation tomorrow chip so we'll have\nNews there a secretary ... is talking what are the Saudis are over there today so that at least talks are going on that it's somewhat a highest level solve this thing are definitely far away from my playing out\nOkay the other one that you already mentioned Jim is that immigrant caravan making its way from Guatemala Honduras a up through Mexico\nThey they have\nFull intentions of getting to the U.S Mexico border\nAnd crossing into the U.S this is a this is a big time challenge for the Trump Administration isn't it\nYes and both not only from an electrician a perspective began Trump's up late last week immigration and one of his tweets is far more important to me he said as president then trade now that was an eye opener to me that's why let off with it on for a farmer dot com today now a ...\nHe ... they can cite what their polls are going into these November ... elections how many of the base in the Republican Party or more than a set of what's going on south\nOf the border now ... there's geopolitics involved as well because Trump today already said that he's going to ... some of the aid to these countries sending you know the people over here so it it has multiple layers job\nYeah yeah and and how ... boy how this develops a it's it is going to be a major issue in the elections as we get there and\nYou mentioned polls did I see right that Trump's approval rating is is going up\nIt's going up or just shy bride and the forty seven forty nine percent area and that's actually above the level both Obama and Reagan had at this particular time in their presidency's\nYeah that'll that that's of note here and this is why I think you're seeing the odds increase that the Republicans will maintain control of the Senate\nIf not add a seat or two and it's getting closer in the house with all the political experts however are still signaling that the Democrats should regain control of the house\nYet you know Jim it it is not unusual\nThe the house the Senate and the White House under one political party when you get to the mid term election\nIt is not unusual for the American people that say listen that's too much control and one party's hands let's let's at least move one chamber of Congress to to uh uh the the opposite party of of the White House at least right ...\nAbsolutely it's called checks and balances yeah the key is independence will always decide close elections and we're going to see this both in the Senate\nAnd the house now the key uh the the Republicans are as a potential\nSave Europe a major surprise in the house would be if enough independents do don't care what they want to hear of how the Democrats uh you know some of their key issues once they control the house chamber and I think that's what I Would listen far\nIn the weeks ahead going into November the sex to watch the independent vote watches the Democratic message rather than just say no what are they going to focus on\nOkay couple of things that are just starting to be talked about this morning I think what is the talk of the middle tech a middle class tax cut\n... for the elections [laughter]\nIt's pure Trump one on one he said he's going to major tax cuts for middle income people is coming in ten days well Congress is out until after November the sex so this'll be and ... but that means that they there there are polls showed that even though\nThe vast majority of middle income people got tax cuts\nUh they want to de emphasize the tax cuts in the next one if there is one\nUh on the business side that won't get any additional cuts and they want to propose additional tax cuts for the low to middle income people got categories but Congress has to go along and and I I just don't see that's happening ...\nBut uh but this is pure politics and Trump knows how to play that card\nHe's played at well right now the no no doubt about it okay and then Russia and the nuclear agreement ...\n... ...\nThis is something that I thought was was taboo to even talk about\nWell and that's again that's very Trump he takes on issues that that that you wouldn't take a ... he's a he said he's going to pull America out of that nuclear\nDeal that we signed with Russia in Nineteen\nEighty seven now to be fair to drop\nA for years Russia didn't didn't hold up to some of those terminology solve right this is what Trump I Know will say behind the scenes saying look we're we're fed up with this other presidents in both political parties let you go we're not so that's why you have a\nJohn Bolton is our national security adviser is in Moscow as we speak\nConferring with the you know conferring with the president to put on this and other topics\nCleaning up another mess that was left by previous administrations that's going to be as rhetoric isn't it\nYes yes yeah\nOther topics cleaning up another mess that was left by previous administrations that's going to be as rhetoric isn't it\nYes yes yeah yeah no doubt about it real quick what else are you watching this week\nWell China I Want to point out that China watchers I talk with and listen to are saying they believe that that China that China believes that Donald Trump the slumping\nStuff they're going to wait until after the November elections but if they don't see any things come into force then you're going to make up the odds that she is going to have to change his tone comes after November twenty nine summit withdrawing\nVery cool thing Jim ... to buy\nThat for a farmer mildly him we are we got Lindsey Graham and coming\nNo matter what you do you're always raising the bar and trying to do better than ever knew Laurel fungicides for corn and soybeans can help you get the edge you're looking for\nYeah yeah I'm Lindsay I've had\nSeveral guys asked me about ... what I think about putting up a hug building is it a good idea and you know you got to go through all the questions are you going to own the pigs are ... are you going to feed him on contract lots of lots of things that need to be considered as you're doing it but\nThe expansion in this hog industry I don't know Lindy are we looking at more upgrades of facilities or are we expanding or ability to finish hawks in the state of Iowa\nWell we're we're expanding I don't think there's any question about that I don't think we're expanding as as a rapid rate as we were maybe five years ago but there are there are some of the\nKey players in the uh as far as owning hogs are adding Sal farms and so they need finishing spaces to take care of those songs so so we're seeing some expansion\nYeah it's a heck of an investment right up front but boy uh\n... if if you're feeding those dogs on contract and and I've heard people say\nI've heard people say well you know if you're feeding among contracted it's not a lot different than working his job in town you show up you get a paycheck and and but there's more to it than that because you've got the live you've you've got the wellbeing of those animals that you're responsible for\nWell most every yeah we we contract seed hogs and so I Know a lot of people that do and I would say that everybody that does it takes ... they consider him their Hobbs right take care of 'em like they own them\nA because it sits shall we make our living it's our livelihood were in charge of giving him did care taking care of them and doing things the right way and I I don't know anybody that ah that doesn't look at it like that doesn't take ownership in it\nYeah yeah that's exactly right you know Lindsey so far we've talked about one product from that so I mean that's so it'd be male and the ... and and going into hug feet but\nOur soybean oil demand [laughter] pretty good here or in the second half of the year and a lot of that's got to do with ... D so I think doesn't it\nWell it does a you know we're we're constantly going to a Washington DC and even in the capital in Des Moines\nAnd talking to our legislators about the importance of bio diesel how important it is to not only\nSoybean farmers but it's important to livestock farmers are I Can't uh I used to have the numbers on top of my head but it adds a like a ... you know two or three dollars to the value of the uh uh called carcass said its benefits or\nA cattle producers it it uh\nIt's just a really uh I call it kind of an amazing product because it's environmentally friendly it's a it's a renewable I just don't see a lotta minuses are behind it now you know oil companies aid they don't care much for the\nUh [laughter] it's been a real a real boost to the uh\nTo the ag economy I Know in in the here in the mid west\nYeah you know and and soybean oil is such a versatile product there are so many there there are so many ... outside of it showing up in a in a jug of cooking oil in the grocery store\nThere are so many uses that people just wouldn't think about uh for how that soybean oil is being used\n... Lindsay what's the what's at the top of the priority list there at the Iowa soybean association\nWell you know the uh the trade trade war is a is always the topic of conversation\nThe Iowa soybean association\nWell you know the uh the trade trade war or is always the topic of conversation but I'd say what we are spending a lot of our effort on right now\nIs working on other markets or other than China will you know we're a good we're working on a a European markets are Middle Eastern markets or Southeast Asia\nOr that was a smaller customers to that you know we haven't we have spent so much time and effort working on China and and and uh it's a challenge right now you know they're not buying much it's they are they're they're buying it in a roundabout way to work with so we're spending a lot of\nBut a lot of effort into working on some of these other smaller markets to gain gain back some of these exports\nLindsay and there there are some success stories when we talk about those quote unquote other markets swimming Taiwan Vietnam\nSouth Korea they're all good buyers of our product\nYeah well the you know the Taiwanese were just in a in a couple of weeks ago and signed a big agreement there now new or expand their imports of beans from us by a thirty seven percent or\nNo that's all encouraging news we've we've got a deal to Canada Mexico deal uh Mexico is a great\nA customer for a United States soybeans are are there are there are markets in the middle East that uh people are kinda unaware of how much they're using that ah\nThere you know it's not all gloom and doom but ah but there's a lot of work to be done\nYeah well Lindsey hey good luck to you what the rest of the harvest how much we got left to get out of the field [noise]\nWe're down to uh probably about two hundred acres of beans so we need a\nWinning today and tomorrow and Wednesday properly and we all we can wrap it up 'cause we got to move to a couple of different farms that are often by Wednesday night we're almost done with certainly be\nWell if Michael Clarke from ...

things\nAnd when you dig into it a little bit more there is some pretty positive information now that was in that Catalonia feed report but when you're just looking at the basic numbers you hate to get too excited about it it looked pretty good on friday and it was pretty good for this cattle market\nWell down at a time and time again you want the market to prove it you know yeah that's that's

finance how do you like that that will be a really good yes we're we're going to be talking what's going on in the pork industry and what is going on in the broiler industry\nUm we don't talk a lot about what's happening with chicken me\nWe really don't um I Know\nActually chicken with my eggs yesterday morning for breakfast we're a little leftover chicken I thought you know which one of them do you put on the first I cooked a chicken first house\n[laughter] [noise]\nAnd actually if I you know technically I started the grits first okay because you know to about ten twelve minutes\nYeah [laughter] so I guess the old old answer is which came first the chicken or the egg the grits came for\nThe grits [laughter]\nThough oh my gosh dollar was higher today could retire stocks were mixed\nCorn firms soybeans firms soybean meal was meant to be an oil just slightly very slightly higher and weight was lower in today's straight yeah I'm looking forward to all the conversation that we got going today so we better get to it\nWhich at the U.S dollar index posted an outside session on the daily charged with a low rates open at a high range close the recovery from early losses in the green back likely made it tough for the grain markets to hold onto their early gains that makes sense\nYeah and um let me check or the ruble backed up near the fall high still below the summer highs but threatening to make new highs for this fall a Brazilian react well trained to work higher too yeah eh I mean it posted the\nLooks however conversation with Christine McCracken Christine is the executive director for animal protein researcher Robin ... she's been on the show before ... ... how are you\nI'm great thank\nYou but hey you know Christie and I got a feeling that if we started off talking about\nPoor we might spend the whole [laughter] ... will just talking about what's going on there so let's let's focus for a little bit on the broiler me J. when you look at some meat case and you try to figure out exactly where the competition is coming from\nThere's still plenty of competition from from chicken ... pork and beef even with pork very reasonably priced and to me they're still competition coming from poultry isn't there\nThere sure is um you know we're looking at record supplies of of chicken here\nThis year and and we're adding about six new additional plant next year so you you can look for a lot more chicken coming and twenty Nineteen and twenty Twenty one of those plants as the Cosco plant you know they're set to open\nA here in twenty night ten they're gonna start supplying their own you know quote birds ... for their their operation so it's it's a big issue if you look from a competitive standpoint\nYeah Christine or we consuming you know if this poetry to justify the expansion playing\nGreat question I'm at the right price sure I don't know I think that that's the issue right\nWe have a lot of meat out their beef pork and poultry\nUm and at the right price shore but we're we're also seeing record low prices for arrest me um you know they're down about thirty percent and and people just have so many choices now and in a ... pretty cheap imports pretty cheap so you can kind of look at the case and and probably you're you're not always going to pick up that\nThat whole you know package of chicken you're probably going to mix it up a little so yeah I I think there's a lot of questions about how how much consumers are going to eat and that's part of why prices have been under pressure all year\nTo you said Tuscaloosa for whole chicken processing now does their further processing on those chickens are we going to use me if this is a stupid question Christie but are we talking about for the rotisserie chicken\nYeah so you're like real that whole bird\nYeah so they're going to get in that business which is it's it's a new thing we don't know how that's going to affect the market but I think the bigger picture that's just a lot more chicken write\n'em for twenty Nineteen and [noise] you know all parts of the bird been under pressure not just press meat you've had\nYou know wings got really expensive a couple of years ago and then came off the menu at at food service and so you know being prices are down thirty percent and have\nPerked up a little here lately but still are really really low priced so you know the chicken guys just are struggling um you know and have been all year and and that's probably not going to get better with a you know six new plants online\nYeah yeah ... what what surprised pressure on the chicken brush from\nYou know it's just a supply an oversupply it's the same issues that we're dealing with and and the rest of the protein complex it's it's we have too much protein\nOf for the amount of consumption or that we're seeing here in in retail and food service so I you know that's going to continue to be a problem you know low feed costs generally and and have have played into that as has\nYou know it just we've had you know I'm going kind of nice a nice margins for these processors and I think that you know as a result you ended up with new complex is you know it didn't pork\nThat we saw this year and then and poetry now and to twenty you know Nineteen and twenty so I'm well you know that it all plays into that big protein pictures as we look forward\nTo you know when it comes to consumption and treat changing things up in the in the poultry\nSector are we there there were some inventive ways I mean we forever the wings were there and we didn't know what to do with them now like you said they were the price leader for period of time because we couldn't get enough wage and then it was the grilled chicken breast and no maybe things are backing off\nIs there any development of new products using the chicken parts that are on the horizon\nI mean there's always new products you know the the poultry companies have done a really good job developing a lot of you know further process product though I I'd say that the stronger parts the bird tend to be that dark\nMeat so we've seen to be building sized taking over and and some of that may reflect you know some of the changes culturally you know people going back toward it you know what\nKind of a fatty or add add more tasty\nA protein yeah oh and I I think you know we see that and other other proteins as well we are ... you know that's probably going to continue to be the case\nYeah gosh that is interesting this also disappointing to me because I've always been an but I've always been a side and a leg guy you know going to be so much competition ... exactly and then you have kids and all of a sudden you've got to start by an extra packs of drums action\nIs all too [laughter] so if you've\nMentioned it a couple of times the price the prices in this uh in the broader market have been under pressure how bad is a Christian\nWell jeez I mean we're at record low prices on breast me and then these guys are losing quite a bit of money at this level theory you know the question that I\nKeep coming back to is you know why I continue to push forward with all this new capacity when things are already under so much pressure and\nAnd you know these are decisions that were made months' ago right you had it the\nThe lead time on all these new plants his ears right with licensing and permitting so it's not as though they just came to this decision overnight um and that's why you know these are decisions made for the long the long run and and generally these things tend to be a little cyclical as you know and and the red meat and the\nBroiler space and so as things balance out you know and and we moved back into maybe a cyclical trough in some of the other proteins\nYou might end up with a better balance and and that's really what they have to plan for when they they build these new plants so that that's really what's behind that and as we look forward um you know I'd say that in the short run things are going to be bad but the longer term and things of balance out they always\nSay to her I have a\nHas a brother made gotten caught up in the the trade issues the terrorists and so on\nYou know they they've avoided must\nHas a roller make gotten caught up in the the trade issues the terrorists and so on\nYou know they they've avoided nice to that and they were already on blacked out of China\nAnd as of a few years ago so that that wasn't a big lie down and and the ... going open to them though I'd say you know what are the kind of negotiation around day now what it's called the MTA\n... than the old math day and there were no guys that were a little less willing to take risks Anthonette products I'd pay that ... what else are they still gag and having been a trip back to the bank and given where prices are\nYeah yeah and you know all of this is one of the one of the measures that I look at it in the in the um world there are the poultry industry is the amount of product that we've got in frozen storage and there's a fair amount of meat and frozen storage isn't there\nYou know you have to be a little careful with that it only measures that at a small percentage they over our stories out there\nAnd and the other thing to keep in mind sometimes when they're ... big promotion at the Syrian track sample it kind of ... in front of that and so if you see a big increase in the past that just means taking big commercial coming said they they do that all\nYou know it's a little art and interpreting that data that that we have quite a bit in ... right now for sure\nYeah yeah but I mean as soon as I asked the question I thought to myself I Wonder if I'm going to get the same kind of an answer is what I got from Don close when we were talking about the stock and that was pretty darn right there are a stain\nIt was and you know it it is so true as soon as you started\nTo say I was like oh yeah it is a relatively small amount of it is a ... they they use it for obvious labor managing image story for managing promotions and everything so uh it's all very interesting stuff and and poultry obviously\nA big town or a a big\nA big source of

S. model right\nUm but but what's changed is that I in essence I'm that they've been moving them away from a you know the the big cities right um they've been moving them out of a areas where they've been worried about water contamination and that\nThat shouldn't be a big surprise but it does create kind of the big problem\nFor them with packing it kind of not located where the hogs are and and that's\nThat's created all kinds of logistical problems but it's also leading to the spread we think of some of the disease as they move the hogs yeah across thousands of miles\nI remember the first talks that were found were in that very north of the country and and you know a couple of outbreaks later and and they're packing house and that at that thousand twelve hundred miles away\nA where those dogs were were sent so it's crazy to me to think how far they're sending these hogs but that that's the reality as it stands today\nOkay we've only got about a minute left or like I said we could have talked about ... for an hour today Christian [laughter] um but give me your bottom line what are you thinking here for this all industry going forward\n... well I think it all for the U.S hog industry you know I think there's just going to be a lot of meat out there we talked about how much a chicken as coming here in the short run and then to Nineteen and twenty\nA lot of protein on the market that has got a you know find a home and I think that's going to put a lot of pressure here on the markets at least in the short run until we can start moving some this product intact sports\nUh you know we've talked about the potential opportunity in China and I do think that plays out but it could be it you know into the spring before we see some of that pick up\nUm you know Chinese New year is is the big demand period for China\nAnd that February and and say you're probably looking at between now and then uh you know markets sorting the salad and figuring out how much ... they're going to need and and if there is a shortage it's going to really show up there after after that Chinese New year holiday\nShould be kind of February judge you\nChristine I always enjoy these conversations with you thanks so much for joining us again [noise] sure things get to tell\nYou bet that is the dean McCracken from raw egg refined okay when we come back and maybe take a look at church very are jak the march ... burger erode eroded\nFox News Sunday Sunday mornings at a news talk W JAG\nWhen you make\nWhen he was gone\n\nYou know we're in a legendary all roads you more than ... years\nWere born in the church to wash your doors\nFortune the trouble was\nMarch manual transmission\nHeavy duty boxed you'll bring\nYou more than thirty four hundred pounds of towing where\nStronger doors to bury\nThe messenger rocks or as a listener ... offered made available at multiplex Norfolk lead in palisade instructions always wear a helmet and when you\nDo go off road don't get grass in your teeth noodles accent\nNebraska public schools is built on individual stories that happen every day [noise] teachers and education professionals working together to give every student the attention they need to build confidence\nEight thousand members of the Nebraska said education and are working to make\nGo to any of the doubt or just the story laundromat and the rest of the nation\nNo you start watching whether our weather isn't clear skies and quiet night with a load thirty four wins out of the north five to ten miles now\nBright sunshine tomorrow high temperatures reach up to fifty five blows around thirty\nSeven tomorrow night ...\nYear old just for news talk W J e G am Devon eighties and one of those five point nine MSN currently\nSixty four degrees news talk W.

landmark yesterday\nIndia.Arie gets his to hundreds victory as an NFL head coach\n\nHe has only one of eight humans in the history of civilization to have two hundred National Football league victories as a head coach and most of the other ... you can go glum or in the pro Football Hall of fame that's how good your head coaches and [noise]\nWhat I like about it is thirty percent of those have come here fifty nine wins of those two hundred have been in the regular season as the head coach of the Kansas City chiefs that is also when you get a defense yesterday that gets after the red rifle a Andy Dalton\nGets five three announcing that game Ron Parker gets picked six comes up with two gigantic defense switched jobs Anthony Hitchens will be our guest than I Will be here very shortly linebacker for the cheese came over from the cowboys the chiefs were able to put a hammer that big time on the bangles\nDo some good things for us so I'm Lucas back there I mean he he's a I'm not saying he's young these young with us and um\nAnd so um you know anyway as though there are a number of these these kids and it has stepped in and\nAnd on good for us and they're flying around making plays and and um that that helps us when the other guys start coming back now you've got good depth there and it's a tribute to Brett and the job that he's done a bringing kids in here that they can play and you can contribute\nOne of these days I'm gonna take my grandkids to Ken Ohio I think they're going to have your laminated sheet there'll be this glow in this glass case but it was on fire with a Ninety five yard drive to start that game what about in the flow and getting everybody involved in all parts of the field\nYeah well I'm listening to it as a tribute to\nCurb the enemy and I mean he's done a heck of a job putting as this thing together and and the guys executed and he's a hammer on that thing we're out of practice anybody takes wrong staff he's got a bulldog 'em to death\nSo it's a it's a real tribute to him and then the guy the guy's a Purdue style I mean they're they're flying around\nThe runners are on the same page with the line and tied ends and in the past game everybody's on the same page with Patrick and Patrick's given everybody an opportunity to contribute so um it's a that's again that's a fun thing to watch when it when it's clicking and and going like it was\nA yesterday that's a that's a thing of beauty\nHow powerful is that however when your runners can be receivers and make explosive plays like last night\nYeah no that's that's big and then you know they always tell you there is the runners long ago yeah I can go out there and play wide receiver you know a while you start running thirty hours every play and and you have to do it fast as you know all of a sudden you want to get back in the back of it they they sure did a nice job yesterday focusing in\nThe catch and a couple of those were in traffic and so\nUm and then turn it off field it seems like an easy thing but when you catch the ball you gotta look at in then you've got to turn up field and you do one without the other and you got a problem so\nNormally the balls on the ground or gets tipped up in the air and ends up being a turnover so the guy's a they focused in on the ball they caught it they turned up feeling got positive yards after the catch\nAnd what about Patrick last night when you got a chance to simmer on it or how do you evaluate his evening\nYeah listen I've I thought he did and I like to have that interception back he just kept putting up a little bit quicker it a little bit further\nUm but he had the right idea he's got a great vision so he he saw what was going on the safety levels and they shot it out there for ... he was just a\nLittle bit short um and he learned from that you know you got to come back with that hit you you got to drive into that set them again even with the big arm that he has a diary can run pretty fast and\nI Can't put it out there far to form\nAnd last year all fence of line Debbie I mean they had to get pressed into action at New England but how different is if they have a week to prepare others have Lew look at your week they look at your guys and how they responded\nI Know you've got to tape and so they stay that tape and they're going to find your weakness and try to exploit is nice to see why they get in there and and produce and uh\nYou got to take and so they study that tape and they're going to find your weakness and try to exploit is nice to see why they get in there and produce and a camera and and so\nUm they they they did a nice job in there for the most part right inside and in a passive things off that they were present those good defense of front and the seven Ninety six I've been doing a long time but they still do it very well so the guy's held up and and I thought that well\nAnd you defended the fake ... they're trying to get you on that one that was a big playing the game what about your special teams just being aware there\nYeah and actually they had a phenomenal calls he brought the quarter of ... or so um it was um it was pretty good and it was perfect opportune time\nTo catch him and then I don't know I I mean I've heard both both sides but I'm I'm not sure that they are good communication on their side with it I'm not sure it was a fake or not say look like I said but it was a it was a heck of a job by our guys of wrapping up\nKeeping contain do hit them and get a guy on the ground which I ended up being important\nAnd I work on to a one to one would be the Denver Broncos coming in for a rematch how to approach this week and the dynamic of divisional football game to play him twice a year\nYou know listen they're coming off the huge game I mean they\nThey put up forty a guess Arizona and and um and they've had it and they've been ten days rest so uh but you know by the time they get in here we've we've got to have a great weekend practice uh always go back to the process and\nThe short changed the process of comes back in ... so I make sure that you stay focused and\nUh no that is a Denver Broncos I mean they're going
