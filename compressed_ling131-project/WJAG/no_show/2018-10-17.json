supplies they keep your facility running get what you need one you needed Granger dot com eight five five to one to for CBS to be talking about this Packers team routers and you just heard it right it is so talented\nAnd yeah it's like he's carrying a load that he can barely stand and Wylie\nHe's able to lift that burden to a place with some success\nEven remotely the kind that he should have\nDavid Arkansas think religion you're on CBS Sports radio\n[noise] yeah hey my name's a grave from a ... and I'm a law calm a Packer fan used to be a become far than I Rogers is definitely the best quarterback in the league um I think this year is a bellwether year for the Congress\nUsed to be a become far than I Rogers is definitely the best quarterback in the league [noise] um I think this year is a bellwether year for the Congress it's more of a win win situation that\nI Do believe that the Packers can make it to the playoffs at the very least a wildcard however I think that there is some always been some turmoil between Mike mccarthy and Rogers and the Rogers I'm they smooth it over but somehow\nI don't think true Packers fans respect McCarthy and I just wanted your feedback on that\nDay by agree and I think you solve and give us a call I think you saw with the departure of GM Ted Thompson the the warning signs that are flashing for Mike mccarthy and you have seen\nAlso this year\nThe stress on the Packers head coach having to address whether he and his quarterback get along I don't think McCarthy has long for this world and making the both seasons not going to get into\nIt Mike mccarthy wants to be the head coach of the Green Bay Packers this time next year they need to get into the playoffs and they need to make a run because Aaron Rodgers is clearly not satisfied with the direction of the team and they are under achievers given the massive talent they have at the quarterback position\nI mean it's it's really\nHow the Packers\nHave both perhaps the best quarterback of all time is the most talented write is probably the right terminology\nAnd also just a single Super Bowl to show for it\nAnd they ... they want and you when you when it but they got in on the last week\nI almost missed the playoffs that you\nThat is not a team that is click on all cylinders and maximize the opportunities of their remarkable quarterback and certainly the head coach\nIs the guy that has to bear the brunt of that I've done this before\nI'm gonna keep saying it and there are other quarterbacks that applies to Andrew Luck comes to mind other players\nAnd not just in the end zone LeBron James is on this too but Rogers is is so talented and he pulls off such feats of individual excellence and puts his team on his back then it\nIn a lot of ways twists and obscures how we see his organization\nMediocrity becomes excellent incompetence looks like mediocrity\nThere's this enhanced been effect\nWhere we look at to Thompson and we look at Mike mccarthy era we look at Mike Brown or we look at insert whichever people are lucky to be around these these old time transcending grace\nAnd they're not any\nThey're not even approaching\nExcellence but it seems like they do because of how lucky they were to have the players that have Aaron Rodgers leading that drive in the end of the game is about Aaron Rodgers out Mike mccarthy is not the play calling they should not the Green Bay Packers should not be in a position\nThat they have to rely on Aaron Rodgers to lead them down the field at the end of a football game against the San Francisco forty niners backup running backs and backup quarterback and hope that they're kicker who's historically been very very reliable but had a little bit of the\nThe ... a few weeks ago in boot it through the upright\nThat shouldn't happen happens all the time\nThe only thing maybe more amazing and how many times Aaron Rodgers has led his team to last minute success is the fact that always necessary because of the lack of support around it and look Rogers Rogers got it Rogers talk after the game\nAbout how important that when was\nDefinitely um was an important one especially with the uh prognosticators that'll go on about the type of opponent we have coming up\nThe next few weeks and obviously them being road games ah this was a important game for a number like use the term must win but ah it was important one\nYeah and they do have to schedule\nAt rams is a great game on the twenty eighth they've got a by coming up\nOld time off coming up\nThis coming weekend they're going to need Mike mccarthy you better start watching some some tape on the rams then they go they go to their ... they go to LA against the rams then they've got New England patriots those are tough games they host the dolphins who I think a pretty good\nThey go to Seattle always a tough place to play\nAnd then they go to Minnesota it's a tough stretch\nAnd routers needs more help\n... he talked about like if you want to weigh in\nLove to hear from you on CBS forge radios toll free line eight five five to one to four to seven budget by guy go great news is quickly you can save money switch to a guy go go to guy go dot com and the Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more a car insurance\nRogers knows it and he talked about how there's still so much they need to improve\nWell we're gonna enjoy this one's a for sure um but corrected at some point or not tomorrow ah thankfully we're going to get on our ... pretty quickly but uh [noise]\nI'm sure next Monday we'll we'll started it hard look at this and and think about the war we did well the first six weeks um\nYou know we're a couple of players away from being a you know four and two or five and wanting to find a couple of ways away from being the other way so we're thankful to be free to only one right now and realize what's in front of us in al [noise] uh this type of play um\nMight not get in on a ... next a next phone as we go to we have played better\nI gotta tell ya and maybe I'm doing a little bit of transference ma'am just\nTaking my perspective and hearing it\nAaron Rodgers now it's like having that\nI have seen him at the podium before sounded a lot more exuberant even after loss I've watched the state from cars or some kind of aware of what he has his Jollies that looks like and\nI once went to a Super Bowl party last year and he was there was we're coming around the corner is Aaron Rodgers has a chilling having a cocktail pretty jelly guys pretty funny guy I don't think he's happy and I do think it's important because of his head coach and it doesn't matter of Mike mccarthy every week says yet again what a special\nMarriage said great ones throughout the years and I I just you know the timing of just really the menu the operation baggage through his claim that ... some somebody she plays a role like that to the end you know they took it all the time off for the clock you know chicken ...\nPlease don't fire me I Love you were here and that I hear a Mike mccarthy also talked about the importance of winning that football game\nFor in a win the game of so so different from so let's let's be honest I mean you have to when your own rooms where everybody\nUnderstands there's a common formulated that works you when you're home games and you know you split on the road you're ... you're probably where you need to be\nIn the ... offers so that's just a general thought process but have to when you're home games are so that is the game and you know obviously there are just sort of what happened ... eight days earlier in Detroit it's amazing\nThat is the game and you know obviously there are just shoot what happened ... eight days earlier in Detroit\nIt's amazing how great Aaron Rodgers is\nBut I also think\nThis is more of the same of this Packers team\nI think the when the NFC North because routers that great\nBut the Vikings are really good I'm not Robert made my buddy from the ringer convince me not to sell on the bears despite that brutal losses weekend\nAlliance won't some impressive gains ended up tough tough division\nAnd they better get it together and start offering some outcome on Mike mccarthy that seat is hot we're going to talk about ... mark how false\nBy like just looks terrible I feel awful for the guy\nHe still appears in able to shoot\nIt is painful to watch\nNobody's guarding folks with a three point line nobody's guarding Simmons a three point line and this week you could really hard to enter the ball and the joy and beat down low\nCardio and you're on the show 'cause I Want to give you the the the theory that take I had at the very start of the show and you you very well may think I'm wrong on this I'm just curious your perspective you you and I love the game right we love I Love the NBA I'm a fan of the NBA and I told her story on the air I made the decision\nThat I covered the NFL for a while when I was young and I covered the NBA Fox Sports dot com and then when fs one launched they gave me a choice that I Want to be an NFL guy for TV or an MBA guy and without hesitation I Want to be an MBA guy I Love the sport and I just don't have a really bright future\nI think that future in terms of market share and capturing the attention of fans is\nIn a little bit of jeopardy just given the author dominance in what it feels like a coronation of the warriors and so I'm rooting for every story line on earth and not about the warriors to\nTo blow I Want the Celtics would be made you know why did come back I Want the Andrea and Kevin book or to be ... Kobe Bryant I Need all of it because I'm a little worried about where we're at now with yet again this feeling that the warriors are certain to win again where do you come down on the state of the NBA given the lack\nOf ... or just the sense that there's one team in one team only that's going to win an MBA championship yet again this year\nYeah well first off I don't I've people used the word parity there's never really been parity in the NBA and that's just the nature of the sport to be honest with you I think the difference is normally we've had instead of\nYou know in the in this case we've got the warriors and you know it's only orders as a you know and and maybe but I think Boston actually she's really bother them if they're much they get right I mean Gordon Hayward doesn't have his first step back yet she out tonight and they've got to work some kinks out it wasn't quite plug and play with these with these stars\nThat said I think that they can bother and my you know I think Houston I don't think he's got dramatically worse I think it got worse in the matchup against the war years like I don't think the record or against everybody else is going to be that bad but I there is some concern about that I also think though bill and you've talked about this and and we've talked about this\nIt's such a fluke he set of circumstances that came together to make the ... and I really\nThink it's not going to you know we're going to get back pretty quickly that they're being\nFree for teams that can win it and it could be very well next year I mean you've probably heard some of these ... people out there and read this I've heard around the lake there isn't everybody thinks\nKevin directs the first one out the door and it very well could be next year and if Iran does Golden State still a contender but they're you know they're human again they're they're potentially vulnerable\nHer heel and you're on the show encourage your point about how a really an anomaly created this this is not perfect and the influx of TV money and and what it did to sort of stretch the cap allowed ... to to do what he did a aside\n... hopefully will stay in Milwaukee will will see like Russell Westbrook stayed in Oklahoma City Devin book and decided I mean there is it's not guaranteed but it does feel like some of the cat just signed a big deal with Minnesota some of these stars are staying where that where they are\nDo you think there's a chance we get more parity than we've seen a long time but say ten years from now\nA little I I still think NBA players have figured out how to use their power to to team up and as long as guys are willing you know seven to Iran has taken less money to be part of this team a multiple times\nAs long as guys are doing that I don't know what you do to start you out there he take less money to win that is not what we stand for is a Basque no it's exactly what we stand for stamps were always a nice don't sacrifice to win except they are sacrificing to win\nSo I but I think you will see the way the CPA set up guys you know towns took his first contract money to stay where he's at\nA place to win except they are sacrificing to win\nSo I but I think you will see the way the CPA set up guys you know towns took his first contract money to stay where he's at I think um you're going to get the same with you on a she's not going to go anywhere short term it's those you know it's we're Anthony Davis is with us I don't know about this franchise\nAmong the third contract I'm entering my prime maybe it's time I think about moving on and\nLet's put it this way obviously Anthony Davis was thinking about moving on whether he does or not we'll we'll see but you don't ... rich pose your age and if you plant assigned whatever's put in front of you\nHeard him here on the show Curt flood's or in the spirit of it being opening night and the idea that\nHope springs eternal let's go full optimism here this question on the most optimistic side of the spectrum how many teams can be competitive for representing the eastern conference in the finals this year\nMost optimistic yes totally like sunshine optimism life is good singing to yourself and in the rain all that good stuff\nYeah I'll say for because I Want to say what Boston obviously\nPhiladelphia that means ... comes along maybe they get a second star like as a ... a lot of things kind of have to go right I kinda think they're going to fly into this year but if you're gonna be crazy optimistic Philadelphia made the ... you know they're like they're really good team\nThe raptors are really interesting I mean if if ... is back to being vintage collide Leonard if he is and BP level wind letter you just took out to murder Rosen and all of you know look all NBA player all start very good player and completely upgraded every part of the game with him on a team that just one fifty nine games last year\nUm you know they've got a new coach you assume that works out well there are there and don't sleep on the box and then I really liked the honest but more than that I really like my whole or as the coach finally put these guys had better position\nWhile I ... I was wondering 'cause I'm with you on Boston\nIs the front runner for me then it's the Sixers I Want to see quite healthy but if you sell right these ... I I I Love that Milwaukee taken boots are so interesting because I think we even I a lot of us forget how great a coach he was before we also began to player personnel guy do you like Milwaukee in terms of the upside\nI I think I I have them as before seed in in my picks I said well\nJust watching them in the pre season and you know obviously pre season so take it was you know friends of salt or like a whole box at that ... kosher salt but\nThey were playing way faster they were walking into threes and taking on a little more comfortable taking his jump shot at taking which is scare the crap out of everybody in the league find consistent jumper uh it's yeah I don't know how you guardian but beyond that\nThey were put it defensively they weren't taking the silly risks they just weren't in better position and\nPlaying and a smarter way and taking trees and getting to the ... not taking the rangers and I think they took a fewer percentage of your shot in the mid range than any other team in the NBA during the season and against the precision but that portends well for what they're going to be so I'm really high on what they potentially can't be\nHeard he on here on the show on Twitter at basketball talk are incurred same level of optimism let's just say for the sake of argument that Steph Curry and Kevin Turan shocked the world and announce it they're retiring from basketball to run Tesla in place of Ilan mosque right just taken out of the equation\nHow many teams so we're not really as he was how many teams can vie for the right to get swept by the warriors in the western conference finals [noise]\nUm ... ... they can they get that new Tesla was at the scene on track the maybe\nI have to do any of that culture turned around and get exactly on\n\nWhere you think about that for a second I honestly Houston's there I'm not I I look a lot of people are really\nHigh on Utah I Love you too and that's our central I you know they're not ... I'm not completely convinced that the challenge\nThose guys yet um I\n... I just I Need a second shot creator and maybe you can be that maybe I was and what their defense I think they're going to be really good um Oklahoma City I like in the regular season once they get healthy but I loved them in the postseason\nDenver is going to be sneaky good by the way they're not going to be really good but I don't I don't think they can challenge for anything yet I think I think we're second in that conference still\nYou're wrong about that ... I mean I've heard around with everything current a little far afield here but but\nHow worried if you're Portland trail blazers fan were on the air in Portland\nPaul Allen obviously ... passed away yesterday how worried should you be either about Vulcan Inc which controls that organization tournament screws on yellow Shay and making a lot more about money and a lot less about basketball decisions for the sake of basketball decisions and or a sale that in some way impacts you negatively\n[noise] I'd be more concerned about the second I well I suppose I should be concerned about the first two I I ... the rumors I've heard and I you know look I I have not dug into this all just because\nThere's just too soon married it was like um but that is that\nThe sister in the family don't really want a piece of they don't want to run the Seahawks or the or the trailblazers and down you know relatively quickly they're going to be looking to sell 'em that could impact them negatively is it who I don't know who's going to buy that team and I doubt they have to keep a pocket so\nUm it could have some impact there by the way for people out there would you know a moving them is not on the table a\nAh they've they're locked into their lease through twenty twenty five with some like really strict language about not moving the team till twenty twenty three but beyond that the league only really kind of ... teams that are going to move if there's\nEither it's a bad they're struggling in the market or\nUm there there's some you know real bad a issue with the arena or something that they they've there's always been a reason [laughter] healthy team and a healthy arena with a crazy than they I Can't imagine ... with with back in move\nYeah I think there's no chance an all add to that curtail and you you nailed that I also think you know what happened to Seattle happened to Seattle at the thunder moving there but I I Can't imagine they would then under any circumstances orderly abandoned the random I Can't do it\nWith wave units there are new buckets of water or filters and they cost only pennies a day to run wave can transform your home into a drier healthier environment satisfaction guaranteed ask about our indoor air package that includes the wave ventilation unit\nPlus a sixth stage portable air purifier dealer opportunities available for more information visit drawing house now dot com that's dry house now dot com or coal eight eight eight nine seven nine wave that eight eight eight nine seven nine W.

positive is at least I drafted him in three of my for fantasy football leagues\nNumber two\nI Would have been moved by me not very good though not great\nIn recent weeks rumors have popped up about the possibility of Anthony Davis playing on the other than the pelicans either later this year or next year the teams head coach Alvin judge he responded to these rumors on Monday saying quote\nWhen you have someone who who you can trade for anyone I think that makes him the best or at least the most valuable\nNow we aren't considering that\nWe wouldn't trade them for anyone even beyond say I think that makes them untouchable and quote gave it to me to say oh NBA team an average over twenty points eleven rebound two and a half blocks and to assist last year\n... line they were trying to say you know heartbeat I'm trying to get what gender you suggest like\nIf she were as you you would trade him you traded for beyond say\nThe fact is already coming up and it's being addressed because\nThat pelicans organization knows what we all know in Korea and just touched on this the in the last hour you don't go out and get rich Paul who's the bronze age and at the ... own Enron when he retires\nIf you don't have some really big plans are really big ambitions I I think the question becomes does he have they Davis wait until he is a free agent to go and be a Laker or does he demand a trade at some point this year it wouldn't be really shocking to me\nIf Anthony Davis demands a trade of the Lakers this season if he does you know a brand dumbing Brandon Ingram\nAlonzo bowl first round draft pick I mean it's not enough but it's at least it's pieces where if you're in New Orleans you feel like you're getting something back\nNo Bush really\nDodgers shortstop many Machado

athletic Machado said quote obviously I'm not going to change I'm not to have a player that's going to be Johnny hustle and run down the line and fly to first base and you know whatever can happen that's just not my personality that's not my cup of tea that's not who I Am\nI have absolutely every single thing\nAbout this I think it's so obnoxious and so ridiculous\nAnd yet I don't think you can get around the fact that he's playing really well he had a couple of home runs in the end of the U.S against Atlanta\nHe's baton for fifty five and three games in the end they'll see as he's got another home run he played well down the stretch I mean they need him his hope yes right down the series is one point three one a\nNoxious ... and he's being honest I suppose but I'm not going to ... I'm not going to be a defensive stalwart okay I'm never going to be a speech their God I'm never going to be the guy that lays down a bond alright alright I'll let that long ago I'm never going to be a guy that hospitals\nNot interested in effort I'm not really into the old fry thing when I'm feeling sorry for myself that I grounded are you kidding me and this is the reason many Machado is probably\nAttention not going to be a Dodger next year maybe you will be but that's the guy you trade for trying to get that World Series I'm not sure it's a guy you commit massive amounts of money too because if he's not willing to hustle now what's going to happen when he has the buses rerun order to maintain the level of excellence that guy on the big contract will be many many years the ages it\nIt just it bothers the holy hell out of the number four\nEarlier today giants owner John ... made his opinions known about how unhappy is with the team during a break at the NFL Owners meetings merit disgusted teams for play you lie manning struggles and the teams his decision to ... say quantum Barclay with the second taking this year's draft\nHowever what was more interesting was that ... had to say about why receiver old out back and junior or where she would [noise]\nCreate the headlines are going to play on your way through a little more quiet on school embarrassed to want to stand up here and it didn't do something about that [noise]\nFor more to focuses on Canada's Shane claws and and build how to read and ward for Fred we've all health insurance don't get or the second part will feature of the world for natural resources district candidates public is invited to join us in the city council chambers and listeners\nNorfolk daily news editor Ken's Warner Cable moderate as the candidates are question by a panel of journalists from these ...

between the cowboys in Washington wake up with the NFL today at nine am eastern six Pacific and start your full day of football on CBS\nEight five five to one to four CBS is the phone number if you want to give us a call want to hang out like Craig in Lansing, Michigan Craig what's going on buddy thanks for listening here on CBS Sports radio\nWell thanks for having me dude or you know big show big time show love you love you dude a for having me on thank you or\nI Want to talk about the rules in in what set up with what we're looking at the quarterback position or it may be a you know just wide receiver the thing is three hundred and eighty are just not that big a deal anymore okay it's like oh I got three hundred yards that means broadcast Wyler three eighty\nYou know but this so I'm thinking that\nYou know the way the rules are set up is that we're going to have these increased numbers are offensive we but another thing is when you look at guys like Tom Brady a\nIn everybody's marveling at his ability to have played in his league now he's forty one years old\nWell okay so you're in shape you know what keeps him in the game as it is a drop that quarterback and he does not\nKeep the ball in his hands very long he's not a runner so he doesn't leave himself open to injuries as much as other guys and the reason I say it is because let's give it ten years and see how many other people can play into their forties because of these rules the way they're set up I mean you know you\nKnow what I'm saying like the wrong yeah up she\nShe'll make it so that you can't really fail offensively it's like the defense is it has to be fed eighty five percent and the often says they are a hundred percent and if you put a hundred percent against eighty five percent who's gonna win I mean it's really not that hard to figure out\nThe Fifteen Percent going to get it\nHow much of the ... to ... million yards and six dollars down\nYeah the rules do favor quarterbacks there's absolutely no doubt about that I Wish it would favor thanks for having ... by the way as a dagger in my heart as the bears never got that wrong I Want to weigh in on during the coverage of credit you can do it on CBS Sports radio toll\nFree why does aid by five to one to four to two sevens budget by guy go hey everybody it's bill what's going on\nHere's a quick way you could say money's which the guy go do need homeowners runners motorcycle insurance to get it all guy go dot com Milwaukee trying to dig a three one series lead against the daughter to Dodger Stadium is zero zero\nIn the bottom of the first one out run around second Dodgers trying to get that run Iran we will keep you updated\nAs that plays out we've also got Boston\nHost in Philly and last year on the opening night Boston also was the opening night game against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers\nAnd Gordon Hayward head a brutal brutal moment where so early in the game he went down for the gruesome injury\nIs really cool to see him back out there it is really neat to have his return and\nJust a reminder that last year one of them works because he ... and I know of your lives in Utah is a bummer but he left Utah last year to go play for his college coach Brad Stevens now the coach of the Boston Celtics there was all those optimism about what he was going to do and the kind of stars that he\nCould be and that injury obviously\nChanged everything that team so it was really really good to have them out there he's already played eleven minutes these super sex is just a very cool story and just a reminder as much as a bomber was last year and I still were you working at night 'cause Kluger was the producer was it James at night\nIt was me that night I remember it pretty vividly actually too so awful to watch and if we didn't know what it was we thought it was a\nBack injury sold a replay it also like such a bummer and such a we're all just sort of stupid fire I just just just\nTaken it ends I just want to take a moment to listen to Gordon Hayward talk about his return finally and again that counts to the floor\nOf a nervous I think that's that's natural though and [noise] uh once you get out there and you get your blood flowing and get up and down the court a couple of times I don't go away but I'm just looking forward to being out there as a big step for me like I said about in the pre season two men out there on the far after what happened is a big so\nThese are the guys on the floor right now man these dudes are so talent starting five hour for who I think is grossly under wraps\nThe big stuff these are the guys\nOn the floor I now managers are so talent starting five hour for who I think is grossly under rated as a as a difference making a basketball team Jay Lynn brown who was so good last year Gordon Hayward who you just heard from Jason Tatum might be this because I like crazy talk\nI think he might be the best player on that thing and I know carrier is out there he was so impressive last year he's such a competitor he's got Fifteen six and two so far\nHe's looked really good ... and the second year ... and ... by the Kyrie Irving out their Kyrie Irving is one for tat jail and brown is to for ten\nAnd they still look like the by a long distance won't get first in the NBA season they look like the best team by far on the floor\nThere so do you ... and I think it was a six man of the year ... markers smart fits in in a really big way I mean you've got one of the two Moore's twins you've got things I mean these guys\nWhich we mark Morris who's I think he's a fake tough guy either but he is a he'll go out there and he'll get physical it's just such a deep Celtics team and the addition of Irving and Gordon Hayward they basically took\nThe best team in the regular season in eastern conference and they added a top Fifteen guy in Kyrie Irving and a top twenty five guys being conservative in Gordon Hayward starred\nIn those both those guys those sort of assessments before a full season in ... case any professional season under Brad Stevens who I think is the best coach and the game was going to make all of these guys so much better to be such a well oiled machine\nAnd this is a game and then I Will see what happens with\nSenator warriors but the warriors are going to just crush Oklahoma City because of the wars in his open opening night not going to look past his game they're going to be fired up they're going to get their rank and get their ceremony they're also not going to have to go up against Russell Westbrook which make that ... easier challenge for any team\nGoing up against the Oklahoma City Georgia is a great player\nBut he's not going to be able to do it all himself certainly not against that team so again it's great to have the NBA back thunder wars later tonight right now Celtics up\nAbout fourteen points on the Sixers Marco fold still looks a little rickety would that shop but at least he's made a couple at a lay up and I think you might either jumper earlier he did it a free throw I Know that's not how they want to celebrate the gay a professional NBA player I made a free throw but\nI'm rooting for the dude I Am ... to get the gifts that as a professional athlete as a rookie\nWhen you were a shooter that's what you did you the number one over a pig it's so brutal\nSo embarrassing or we're going to recap the show we'll play some of the I think really interesting perspective as we got earlier from cream Jackson and Vern one question and curfew and current an hour ago but also we're going to have a little bit of a cameo\nTimes to get a flu\nHuge huge judge\nWake up to this email writer you sound like three in the morning I guess is on west coast

five\nBest friends one of them have cancer\nIt got jobs on the building and kill themselves to sort of the show the other ones like his girlfriend she now it looks like the most depressing show\nWhat I Want to do I want to spend my time with my wife\nWatching a show about ... everyone's miserable\nSo I write I write to clue\nTo a million things looks like the saddest thing ever\nHis response I never said during the voice\nNever set of super lifting\nLike dark\nDark\nYear and a half to me and him the message\nThe God is currently suspended until further notice Adam globe lives in San Diego\nWhy don't you recommend man in the high cast that shows incredible you guys are the shows about\nBill gay dig novel they basically took an expanded\nIt's about an alternate universe obviously I think those are super cool in which the Japanese and the Nazis one world war two\nNazi Germany basically rules most of the earth including the eastern part of the United states\nThe Japanese Empire rules the west coast and in the mountains\nIs like the free land in space so they looked for men to the American nothing and there's a man in the high castle who's trying to fight both regimes and bring freedom but it's been Thirty Years' Hitler is still alive like Seventy is dark but it is amazing in space about if we lost the war how we try to fight back\nThat's a good show\nA million little say I'm watching the trailer and the main guy just jumped off a building it's like a seven minute trailer something happened to ... what is this about\nCome on Adam I Know you're a ... a PD now come

least a little bit unfortunately trace what's your I go to TV moment right now what do you learn watching\nUm it's a lot of sports but I mean nothing nothing new unfortunate ... sports the other\nWell now we just watch the office together so it's not new the office\nYeah that is very uplifting and funny it\nIs it like ten years old well yeah but the reruns are so funny\nOkay we're going to move I cringe action was on the show earlier in the program Texans cornerback\nOut of Alabama and Houston won three in a row there are three and three there are three teams in that division that are now three and three so the emcee south pretty closer together and I asked green the message afternoon three story that he and the guys got from head coach bill of rights\nNo for coach who just you know encouraging us to stay positive faith or you know come in every day and just try to get better\nNo I'm In all the phase is you know like I say you know uh all the games with will close games you know for us you just go on with games like that being close that's the way to leave it to be so first we try to find a way to eliminate al ... planned situation being continue to get better and continue to\nTry to improve in ... and grow and learn from mistakes that we make them those those first three games you know it's all about goes aggression and if we are with the weak\nAnything's going to be there for you know you're going to be different chapters so close we just have to do that as a team and and and continue to work and it continued you know throughout you know any circumstances and you know I think we've been able to show that the last you know I'm\nI'm the type of team orange ... state the care they continue to work and you know we've been able to get you know the ones that are all\nI'm telling you is it Blake board will continue to play like ... and the jaguars underperform it smells up yeah it smells a lot like one of those nine and seven below Brian playoff specials were you in a bad division keeps his job\nI've been such a defender villa Bryan probably should stay on the bandwagon just in case they go on some crazy hair and go anybody want to bet on Thirteen and three thirty ... neither do I neither do I ah because he played Alabama obviously cream played for\nNick Saban and I'm a saving fan I find savings so interesting I told the story several times my sort of edgy funny interactions with him as a reporter so I asked the Texans cornerback for his favorite collegiate story about former head coach nickname\nSo this one one day we we're in practice and I mean you got the\nHigh is on the sideline during the game but you know in practice you know he kind of get by that would be ... this one particular period when\nSomebody must be screwed up the car I'm discounting cars and\nAnd he started to look around\nAnd the coaches coaches you start to I'm Out in an article she just proceed they're just kind of put the if it got to Baghdad is I I I wasn't on us up so he'll be out my mom always joking and do so I I\nI see a show that was a no fault when she was the ... each yo yo fill it with some of the players are starting to laugh and you know for me I'm laughing because ... ... ... you off instantly so\nThat was probably one is uh what was the funniest stories that I was\nYou know we also had on the show the the legend\nLongtime CBS broadcaster Vern ... was a new book out play by play\nAnd burns a lot of things but he has been very vocal\nAbout his perspective that Nick Saban in a crowded field of excellent players is let's say even as the greatest college football coach of all time and so I asked for and when I had him on the show earlier\nWhy he was so convinced that saving deserve such high price\nThis is the guy who won that one of the national title\nA at LSU went to Miami it didn't work out either for them or for him and wanted back in college football and uh ... went to Alabama\nOr and I think the game as much more complex or the pressures on a coach and they all feel pressure a soda ...\nSo that everybody does every football player but to sit to see that with all that's going on in all of their lives but in this era of ah\nInstant access was social media to recruit the way he does and to get people to buy into his program\nOr the way he does I'm a I'm not\nSure where you go you go there Brian I I Would suppose chill

you know basically got himself the voice of the Broncos everybody knows that a legend and we let them on a bench he's always been on a bench through the years in areas again getting ready for the Broncos and Arizona in Glendale on Thursday night or\nMr alone and how are you a buddy [noise] got to hear you I'm well so tell me on your show or what\nIt is obviously normal for you to have a lot of conversations with John Elway were you surprised city at all that he came on your show and started talking about frankly um how bad is football team is [noise]\nYou know not not really um you know you you know him too\nUm how bad is football team is\nYou know not not really um\nYou know you you know him too he's\nHe's a really competitive guy um I think he's care that over from his playing days I think he cares deeply about the franchise I think he very much does not like what's happened recently and I think he\nYou know he owns some of it he he he takes ownership of of some of what has happened the last couple of years last year was was a really rugged year they're five and eleven\nUm and I think I think he's contemplated making a change at that point\nWith head coach decided not to and and I think by most measurements of the people in the organization of people around the team thought this year was going to be you know not a Super Bowl year but a highly competitive playoff challenging team and to say that they've been\nA disappointed with the start of the last four straight games or two and four they play Thursday at Arizona against two one five team it's a must win for them but ah it's it's been a really tough start for the Broncos and there are a lot of people that are concerned about\nAny sad that they're run de sciences soft tail\n[noise] yeah I you know what I I I think that's accurate um I Know a lot of people looked at it and said man can you believe that John Call them soft but listen when you get a five hundred Ninety three yards rushing\nInto games and the NFL I mean five hundred and Ninety three yards I I don't really know what else do you call them but that's sort of like going back to the mid\nSeventies and and have an Oklahoma play two teams that you didn't know where they're from and they put six hundred yards\nRushing that well because they run the which\nWhich voted in the NFL so that's that's a lot of yards in each game of two hundred yard individual Russia which has never happened in NFL history\nSo uh you know I like when he said that you know they they hung in there they battled and still not good enough that they engage Iran some problems but in the end not enough problems they they couldn't get it done\nA an interesting uh the things that he said the gang and how do you feel about like case keen on and the job so far that he's done at getting bad\nBut I Do not I do not think he's been that bad I think he's been inconsistent um in\nIn the issue one of the issues that they felt like there were solving when they brought a case here was their ability to generate points to ... points last year\nAnd they get off to a decent start they went to games that come from behind in both of those games are he has he has a ... a an excellent game game want even though he threw three picks\nA game to eat you know late late heroics but they still have the same issues in the red zone they're not a good red zone team they don't scorn of points in their defense you know it was not good enough this year where you can say hey if we can get to twenty\nYou know do you think we have a chance to win it it just doesn't translate into success not with the way this team is made up so there's a lot of head scratching there was a great deal of frustration\nAh there's anger and you know what I think from John standpoint and anybody else that Joelle is you know the president of the c._e._o. the controls the team they've got to get this thing turned around in a reasonably short period of time or I think people are gonna lose their jobs\nAnd other words a Vance Joseph a de ... our people calling already in the mile high city for his head\nOh absolutely um and I think and I've said this before during a broadcast the game broadcast and show broadcast I think fans in Denver a are spoiled I mean the Broncos of not had back to back losing seasons since the early seventies\nWow so you know this fan base is used to a whole bunch of women and good football\nAnd great quarterback play with Elway and Peyton Manning and\nYou know it's so that they think that that sort of happens all the time it doesn't in the NFL this is a team right now that is I think sort of quietly trying to rebuild without using the term rebuilding\nSo uh yeah but they're you know anytime you lose games though you know you go to the jets and play the way they didn't give up three hundred and twenty three yards rushing\nA you know and and you're the same head coach that was here last year when they lost eight straight games and finished five eleven I mean you're going to have a lot of people that are pissed off about it so he's you know advance advance it knows that he's got to find a way to win soon in order to get this thing turned around\nA David alone and avoided a Broncos I\nAsk you so he went out and he was that the Eugene at that great a overtime game between the docks and ah the huskies last week and and I

or San Antonio Mexico's really or something like\nThat I don't you know I think that's a little a dangerous\nTo say right now that they would sell the franchises and they'd all move I think that's a drastic I don't I don't think that's going to happen here but I think a lab and I think that I'd just or will not own the teams\nI think they're going to get new owners and I think the new owners I think part of the deal will be he's not stupid this guy the genius right you understand show he was a\nA a guy that uh\nThe new owners I think part of the deal will be he's not stupid this guy the genius right you understand so he was a a a guy that uh you know perfect scores SAT perfect a genius mentality with the Microsoft business\nOr the guys made billions of dollars we talked about last night as well and one of the richest people in the world\nAnd I think that the the exciting thing about him is this is that I I think he's smart enough to put in there that they should keep the teams in Seattle and uh in Portland right they're not going to move\nOut right you know what I mean and there's another thing ah I think that he's really ahead of his time in that\nThe guy's going to donate all of his money literally to charities or do you understand like forty three billion dollars or something to give to\nA different you know philanthropic endeavors so I think that guy is you know anyone that they like Bill gates gives away a lot of his money which is you know I got to tell you guys do that are just so much better than me because\nIf I had that kind of money I I frankly don't think I'd give any of it to anybody you know what I mean like can you imagine them ooh does that would come out of the woodwork if you had that kind of money that would be begging you for money and leach and onto you for the gravy train that you would become for them it's almost like being a Dana White\nA relationship with Conor McGregor he's just latch right onto him like leach\nOn his leg like getting out of the lake water and he got like a leach on your leg that's what he's like\nHe makes so much money off of that guy would you know all of this fantastic losses but I got to tell you I I think the guy that gives away all his fortunes to charities his he'll go down as one of the greatest human beings that ever lived I mean who does that just gives away all their money\nYou don't hear of that ever do you really who does that\nI think that's leaving your mark on society I think you know I'll say this I'm not a fan of the whole\nUh the cabernet story as it continues to just great on my goal for years at a time about this guy's a activism but I Will say this that he put his money where his mouth as right so everything that he made it gets so much of it to charities\nMillions right above all this money is like I think he's given away all his money I mean he staunchly as money but I think he's getting most of it away to charities to help people and I think that you get it back in a bigger way my guess is because I Would never know I've never been that guy that\nYou know frankly gives away anything for you know any but like I mostly by now are the same way right they just they don't they take care of themselves right they pay their bills they somehow survive they live check to check they pay their martyrs their bills and they try to feed their families right\nAre you behind

year stuff okay I get it you know the warriors won it last year to year before and I go on for three I get it I I understand all of that sentiment but I'm In the now like right now what are they doing for the last two months and birds have been doing better than everybody\nAnd ... and the red Sox right I mean the bottom line is they had the most land and they absolutely can't be asked her I was asked\nTonight and they even won the game that day the bad luck price started on Sunday when that guy was only ten and playoff games they actually didn't wind farm but they won the game that he

able to prove\nThat they've been sending some conspicuous guy down to the immediate area a line that dog out and he's in there filming a signals and the and the like how can you steal signs from the side of the dog out you know what I'm saying how to use steel science you have to steal science from uh the outfield don't you write\nUp up what are they saying he's doing the ... of them that's come out tonight if him being in the on the side of the dog out where the Indians were uh last week uh what is he doing apparently he's not supposed to be their right to that it definitely not supposed to be that can they prove these actually doing something what would it be doing\nThey think that maybe he was using a hand clap to kind of um\nI get it over the signs are a whistle or attacks something maybe out his phone out\nBy hand clap how good a guy standing on the side of the dugout he was a hand clap your right this is going to get a ridiculous going to get as silly as the cell allowed at a

do a CBS worth ... about this uh it's a microcosm of the way that major league baseball is gone and it's disconcerting\nBut there are double the number\nOf strike out in this game as they are our heads\nAnd I get it the Dodgers get to go home happy of course they do weary and happy\nBut for them\n\nIs really a it's a problem but in the last two games has been highlighted\nBecause they've set records this year in both the national league as well as their own franchise for the number of home runs hit but the ... is done such a good job\nThat they're not getting the home runs and whether or not getting the whole runs because they're swinging for the fences not getting these home runs\nIt feels a lot to sided with all these extra strike out\nSo I'm telling the truth if I didn't have to watch the game it's great right I'd I talk about sports for a living so fine it's not like someone painting me down and forcing me to eat beat for McCain or grade nuts either one of those two things

comes highly recommend it it's after\nHours with Amy Lawrence on CBS force radio were pleased\nTo welcome longtime sports writer Baltimore Ravens columnist and author John ige and burned to the show from Baltimore John thanks so much for a couple of minutes\nMy pleasure thanks for having me on\nA even as I'm I've read part of the book and I plan to read the rest it's fascinating the first question that jumps to my mind is why did you decide you're right that's what drew you to the inception of the NFL\n[noise] well uh yeah this is my tenth book I've written I've written football and baseball written horse racing and I'm always looking for just a fascinating character fascinating time will just stop and pause and go wow and ...\nOr a no brainer honestly for somebody that life stories because\nUh the the character that I'm writing about it here George how Rangel things died now they're all in the hall of fame but a ... in this story you're young you're twenties and thirties they don't have a lot of money they're trying to make a goal of the times you know a wartime depression\nAnd how in the world are they just would go and\nUh when it was really sort of failing enterprise to me\nIt just jumped off the page and it was like you know how could I not take this on at some point so I you know it was very very rich story telling a terrain for me so are there was no way I was going to Mr\nCan you talk about going back to the thirties where actually the national football league was failing\nMost people didn't even know that the league which out there it was an anywhere close to the popularity and stay baseball which was America's game are you mentioned horse racing too so what was the turning point what else to keep the NFL afloat and turn it into\nA ... at least the building blocks in the business that it is today\nWell I think we started tinkering with the first call they started tampering with the rules I mean you're pro football was was pretty boring I mean college football's well there wasn't a ton of passing\nYou know it was a lot of distort handing off her it was considered like a like a like a character building exercise for a young man you know so good guys stayed on the field and I got an exhausted and this is what much going on so\nSo they opened up the game was that they really open up again with ... they they they will rule that can\nThat worked against having a passing and they eliminated though\nSo it just became a more interesting sport uh and that helped him and the other thing I think with the draft no question about it or that level the playing field\n... ... came up with that and because the bears giants were better than everybody and it was a lopsided and and and and people were having a hard time connecting with it and that made it a more competitive and George you didn't know what was going to happen once they put a draft or twice\nSo changing the rules is something that still lingers and still survive in the NFL [laughter]\nIt it's no different than the the things that I came across and I'm very active covering today's NFL and in in many respects straight line it's the same stuff going on\nGun Eisenberg with us from Baltimore the book is called the league health five rivals created the NFL and launched a sports empire you mentioned the five guys and you've you've given a couple of the names here and there are all hall of famers\n'em but they're not all with us so how did you how did you get first person account or get to know these men when you didn't have the ability to interview them\nWell first of all I interviewed a summer of their of their family members are they still on the themes I mean the relations or\nA droid houses family in Chicago so you know I went to those places are interviewed a beer George houses are on the bears ... she's in her nineties I interviewed her when I when I told that other people in the labor ready to retire in George Washington\nDaughter into\nIt it's just an everyday thing that all those she she was a great source and so I went to the whole thing and Canton of have this amazing volume there does not lead they have a great research libraries it doesn't ... it is with the official minutes of every week meeting going back\nTo the first one white yeah so the the voices leap off the page there so that that was a very helpful ...\nOh my goodness why do you think ultimately succeeded John why do you think ultimately it didn't fold it stayed afloat and as I say it was the foundation for what we have in two thousand Eighteen\nThat's an excellent question and a ... I Do believe to be a a you know how to order Marshall Bert all these guys\nThey didn't believe in it and that sort of with their peers were all that it could have folded during World War two of them were it was really problems than it could have pulled up during the depression they believe in it so they have to go and uh ... just\nWith your source and in any way that they could certainly wasn't profitable\nAnd then as I said I had been tinkering with the rules that it just became a much more dynamic on the ... which is something that college football did not do\nA until much later into the sixties actually unlimited substitutions that created through platoon football and created modern football uh suddenly it was a became a week of quarterback your hand you know Johnny and I just you know he didn't have to play them back\nAnd so a suddenly became very exciting dynamic in and it happened just as television was coming in so the timing was good and so it's a lot of forces a lot of factors but certainly those whether he was a TV coming in suddenly everybody could be and it just it\nThere's but certainly those were the key ones and television coming in suddenly everybody could be and it just it just took off\nAt what point did it become mainstream popularity\nOr in a definitely a nice thing is\nI mean a lot of people go out in my book is the greatest game ever played the colds and the giants game where are you know forty million people watched that game so at that point in the mainstream or no question about it\nAll over the years before that it was getting to be very popular in New York New York Giants or a you know really really took off\nIn the thirties and it becomes very that was in New York is very popular and so uh you know New York with baseball kind of all those years I'm leaving was ... it became more and more strict so\nIt was it was encroaching on baseball Kirk and what's in passing\nJohn Eisenberg is the author of the league about the inception of

[noise]\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running out of ... not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nWell that is Senator Jeff flake decision theirs and and that's his conclusion is part of the reason why is that Reagan's numbers were terrible\nAnd he thinks is because I Believe that he liked to reach across the aisle and maybe take on the president the author of at the cell phone into is here where did you get this number is named his book and he's an outstanding poster with CBS what do you think about Jeff Flake just said\nYou know it's interesting and I and I talk about this some of the book myself is this this animosity between to right in the left wing Democrats and Republicans um look in the ... is there among\n... among a group of people who are really ideological and really passionate about politics they see the other side as\nYou know we've we've done pole and they see them is a threat they see them as different from they are the sides politics um everybody you know that's not everybody there there is a middle in that regard there are people who are just tired of the back and forth wants sensible solutions you to Prague\nAmerican citizens or politicians do you think these politicians should have more courage had they had in the past be willing to lose their seat in order to do what they think is right\nWell you know like I I don't know what the politicians are thinking but I Do know this\nCampaign seemed to make a choice between whether they think an election is a base election which means you've got to go out and get those most fervent partisans get 'em out there\nFor you what persuasion election and they look at the numbers and they see that people are getting harder and harder to persuade\nSo you understand why these campaigns go after and now the other side's Tibet you know the bad folks and we've just got to mobilize our own\nAnd that may contribute to it I I Will tell you this real quick Bryant you know we just did in the last part of this poll asked a question or the party's arguing about the kinds of policies they like or dislike or the kind of people that they like or dislike and most of the partisan saw the other side is arguing about\nPeople that they like and dislike as opposed to policy\nBoy that that's hard to educate yeah that's that's that's hard to negotiate when you when you become very very personal and I think there are a lot of Americans who have a reaction against that\nTop three issues that matter most of your polling for these midterms\nUm health care keeps popping up yeah health care no matter how many times we ask get healthcare keeps popping up\nThe direction of the country generally\nAnd I will tell you this you know the president a either a pro or con is shaping up to be the biggest factor for a president\nThat we have seen in mid term typically it's a majority a little more than a majority who say they go to the midterm vote with the president on their mind to 'em but we're looking at record numbers for the number of people who said that this year both for and against but friday before and against\nThe most intriguing race or some of looked at New Jersey that sentiment end as who we had a hung jury that kept him out of jail a and it was censored by the Senate\nWe we wish we did pull that race and we had Menendez up but you know here's a case again where you've got partisanship New Jersey is a blue state so people break along partisan lines and a lot of that seems to have been put aside there were people who who weren't thrilled with with what a senator Menendez it done on but we are voting for him anyway in that regard but\nThat it helps the Democrats in places like that it hurts in places like say Missouri\nLast week Florida's Senate race Nelson ... Scott yeah was that hurricane done for Scott do you think you couldn't have pulled it yet because you in the middle of trying to help yet\nHaving a Democrat center and Gary Peters who we're going to make the senior senator and having me a as a as an independent thinking conservative in the Republican Party on according to the Senate that means that\nWe're going to make the senior senator and having me\nAs a as an independent thinking conservative in the Republican Party on the court and the Senate that means that Michigan has a voice Michigan has a seat at the table regardless of who's in the majority or who's in the White House that's a much stronger position from Michigan to be in\nAnd it makes logical good sense and are having the experience that I have a in the ... of environments\nIn Iraq and ask also growing of business in Detroit\nThat definitely benefits people state of Michigan or look I I have to represent people regardless of differences of opinions and I've done that as an officer and his business man I'm looking for an indecent\nWe would you have voted for cabinet\nAbsolutely I Believe Kavanaugh's objective jurors and uh everybody who's um who's tearing them down or don't don't know the man I I'm looking forward to a place in Moore I'm a\nA textural Supreme Court justices on the bench and not just a but not just in Supreme Court but around the land because I Believe that journalists in jurors have an obligation to be objective impartial and protect the constitution and also to make sure that we the people are informed the trans parents to buy\nTwo we're speaking with John James who wants to be the next senator from uh Michigan replacing Debbie Stabenow and we'll see where that goes because they'll Mitchell poll that just came out a ... on the seven uh how'd you cut a deficit from Eighteen to nine\nAnd we know that you or your energy we know that Don junior is coming out there correct\nYes a darn junior will be out here uh tonight we're having a rally and kid rock ... oil ah and ah we're going to have a great time did you like to learn more go to my website John James for Senate dot com will also be streaming live on Facebook and Twitter at John James I'm a\n... year with congressmen and maybe future speaker Nancy Pelosi said about the president's push to build a border wall especially in light of the caravan of over a thousand people were heading to our border cuts Seventeen\nYou're home all day long\nHair all\nI\nCan I ask you how do\nYou think it's a man who'd issue um I I think that ah that's ridiculous I the the president's job\nIs to enforce our laws in his Nancy Pelosi's job to make the laws if she doesn't like the laws of the book is her job to fix them and train and and and and and to legislate\nAnd she is basically campaigning on issues that she's created um we need to secure our borders I Believe that legal legal immigration is a moral and economic imperative for this country by illegal immigration must be stopped Nancy Pelosi is part and parcel to the problem and she's refusing to solve it\nBecause ah for her own political gain we need to send people to Washington who are more intent on keeping us all safe who are intent on upholding our values as Americans and not continuing to to divide us ah like Nancy Pelosi and and the establishment politicians are doing\nHave you dealt a John with a race issues in your life\nUm I I have I have my mom and dad are taught me\nOr that I Would need to be twice as good to be considered half as worthy and so I I've always uh endeavor to ah to do my best or put God first uh into served my country and that's what I'm doing now I'm like I said before I just have a future good friends are folks who uh who just don't know me yet\nA and I'm going to show through my actions that is not about black or white spell red white and blue and I'm looking forward representing us all very well\nDo you think we're getting better at this as a society as a country uh judging people equally not on the color of their skin\nOr I think that um if if we are backsliding it's the um the political prejudice and beginning to see\n'em you have this political prejudice where people are beginning to assume they know exactly who you are because we are or the the by your name\nWhen I went to Iraq I didn't fight for Democrats or Republicans I fought for Americans and so people are are assuming that uh that uh uh that they know who I Am and what I'm all about just because of the part of your money and I'm an independent thinker too many people have died for me to have the right to vote to think for myself\nAnd we outsourced our our thought process in in in our ability to to vote in lead for ourselves to a political establishment a cares more about getting re elected than representing the people a part of the American dream is not only being able to elect our leadership but also the dream of being leadership\nWe have in the system right now in this country was the only way you can be a U.S senator is it your super wealthy or if you're a super connected if you're a political politician group politician that's wrong and I think that people are are are are getting Americans against each other\nOr and and then blame the other side when things get done our country is in the throes of generational change and the Dems and liberal media wants to keep talking about um\nAbout things that continue to inflame a and I'm looking forward to bringing us together because I've seen what what a partisan sectarian divisions can do when I went over to Iraq Sunni fighting Shia cousins fighting cousins\nA we have a history in this country of family fighting than when we cannot go back that way\nAnd so yes we still have a racial tensions racial divides we still have gender issues and gender divides but despite our issues we're still the best country in the face the planet and can't forget all Americans\nAre not perfect but trying to be and fighting along the way and lastly I think the ... the United states if you out of race issues Kanye West came over Jim Brown came over to the White House did some stuff in front of the camera\nAnd then people are saying they've tiny West is is being used by the president as his sample that he shows he's a racially tolerant but he's not what is your reaction to it what what on last week as\nIt came to came to gang issues and race relations in America with this with this White House\nLaw I think that anyone who who speaks out it just goes to show that are Democrats aren't interested in diversity of thought they're interested in getting people in line are telling the party line because uh\nUh ... it's ridiculous um we in this country I remember being raised to believe that uh everyone was entitled to their own opinions but not their own fast but now the Democratic party saying that everyone is entitled to their own fast but not their own opinion [noise]\nUh I'm looking at breaking down a bit the shackles that that that chain of dependency and victimhood and I believe that um by reaching out to the communities people selectively forget that ah that the president\nUm has a has forgiven millions of dollars of debt to I strictly black colleges and universities they tend to forget that the president has met with the other presidents of those universities um\nAt least down to them where I'm not even sure that the uh the previous president did uh we need to make sure that we take a look at the the underlying issues of income inequality\nAnd get to the root cause which is opportunity inequality and having those honest conversations because in in these areas are these are the places\nOh it's which is opportunity inequality\nAnd having those honest conversations because in in these areas are these are the places that are good that a progressive liberal policies failed Americans overwhelmingly where minority African American we need to have these conversations we need to change now I can guarantee one thing I'm for the state of Michigan\nOr if Debbie Stabenow stays in office nothing will change we need to make sure that we in her rain hyper partisanship we in her reign of ineffectiveness and we in her reign of broken promises I'm looking forward to represent Michigan\nUh and uh I I Believe that\nAmong African Americans specifically we need a seat at the table when Ninety eight percent of those voting one party and neither party feels like they have to work or do we have to silence we had been ignored and now we need to have a seat at both tables because righteous indignation is not going to change things right just influence will we have marching through so much to Detroit\nWe been writing from watch to Baltimore and nothing's changed in forty fifty years we need to make sure that both parties work for a vote we have a seat that both table so that we can continue to push changed now\nI remember I hosted a show with a Jim Brown out an ex CIA all sports radio\nAnd I was we were talking to get all of these calls about black coaches by general managers he said forget that we need black owners and then then you'll have somebody in power and then there's the black hole is going to pick the people are going to get the most wins and that's what you should be looking for it not for any you know go out and you know go out and get it\n[noise] you know and that's the thing and I love that Jim bounced it will be more black owners the thing is African Americans have been have been rolled into the sense that not only should we accept mediocrity but we should expect it\nOr you take a look at not just an NFL with the coaches and the and the and whatever but we need to look at owners and you see that right now with what they're saying Fifteen dollars an hour why are you telling us that we only should\nExpect Fifteen dollars an hour winds are teaching my babies how to make Fifteen hundred dollars an hour why aren't you are doing the things that it would take to pool entire communities out of poverty by by\nActually uh um\nIncentivizing people to get married and keep families together rather than saying that hey if you're a single mother and you get married somebody making the same amount you could lose your benefits incentivizing people to do the wrong things I Would need to have these conversations because we need to bring everybody not just black or white but everybody 'cause these are issues that\nAll of us face but disproportionately speaking\nOr African Americans who have been forgotten I'm looking forward to working for everyone but particularly those uh who've been categorically forgotten\nJohn James you're exciting candidate and I have a sense a Ivan says he's going to

that's a pretty interesting you know markets have been interesting we had a really good day on young day Tuesday awesome day yeah not quite as strong a little bit or the other direction but\nA little rain out there today I don't know what you read on this is it all harvest we trade what's going on\nNo I think a lot of its own Monday had to do with the fact that we had a couple of boats that were loaded out of the pie and W well actually three boats loaded out of the Pacific northwest that we're headed for Asia one went to China yep two went to Vietnam and there was also a boat out of the Gulf that was loaded and headed for\nFor China is well was soybeans and I think that had something to do with it but then yesterday\nThey kind of reevaluated it and said you know what these were purchases that were made a while ago so this isn't any new demand coming to the market so then we step back a little bit yesterday\nDo that we're about an hour and a half straight north of of Kansas City in northwest Missouri\nOkay is that of feeding operation cow calf what do you get going\nSo we're at a stocker background operation so we have no cows are we usually by cabs around four or five hundred pounds\nA one nice thing about where we live in Missouri you've got all up the cow calf operation so there's usually a pretty good life of cattle and so bring them in here have Mullen pasture and then you know take 'em up to about eight nine hundred pounds before cell so have about five months probably on pasture\nGotcha gotcha puts them bone and some\nSome there's some growth in to them and then turn them loose into the feedlot where they can put the weight on in a hurry I'm right Andrew yet tell tell us about a a this harvest season down there I mean I Know it's been\nTough for all of our guests today are but but Missouri what a growing season you guys have gone through\n[laughter] yeah I'm a you know I mean\nDrought was the big thing now we stay or a little better than some um you know I talk\nTo [laughter] when when it snowed here uh two days ago got to visit with some other guys that were in the field and\nYou know one of the guys at arm's probably forty five miles east of St Joe that was probably some of the worst drought here or there was a forty five bushels an acre and he was pleased that it was that now we haven't had anything not extreme although when you're going through a cornfield you'll see the monitor go from\nZero up to two hundred and fifty and I've heard that story a lot I I Would say we're\nTwenty five fifty bushels off average for us maybe more is kind of where we are coming in and I think that would be pretty typical for a lot of guys around here I Know beans have been started at all you\nKnow being started at all good grief okay hey let's bring in Iranian Wagner from South Dakota and rock catch ...\nStarted at all here no being started it all good grief okay hey let's bring in Iranian Wagner from South Dakota and rock catch Nick from Illinois rock how are you today [noise]\nWonderful funny how you get along\nDoing just dandy just dandy hey how's things looking over there in western Illinois\n[noise] well check in our particular area here we've been pretty fortunate over the last rain event we weren't too about two point eight total\nAnd a guy was in ... Monday evening and they were to a six inch total so we're kind of pick where pick and choose when we go we're staying on the higher Sandy spots and we were in some low ground yesterday and we're cutting tracks pretty bad with the car and we only loaded scar ... to get them out so\nWe didn't want to ruin the field so we moved the sand today and a hearing about half hour we're going to switch to soybeans and for every morning coming in I understand are kind of where\n[noise] um but anyway we're going to put them in a van and below Iran and paying my coming in okay Jeff\nYeah you sound great rock you sound great okay I'm On a ... so he was\nHere and just want to be certain sounded good yup yup we're we're good you're rolling\nAll right All right let's bring in Brian Wagner from South Dakota north and South Dakota you told me in an email that we are that he can smell North Dakota from worries [laughter]\nSo Ryan I mean we obviously if Andrew said some snow down in in uh Missouri you've had snow and and do you still have snow on the ground up there [noise]\n[noise] no uh our our snow came middle of last week and it's all melt and now we actually just got going on soybeans yesterday I'm\nI'm On my on my first round here I just got going on for this morning we had an overnight law about twenty four degrees they'll have to wait for a\n... a little bit a little bit marginal conditions Bode Miller gone so yeah we got rid of our snow that's a little while back on Sunday at all disappeared and and we kind of been taken away and corn and a little bit earlier this week and and started in on this day and we have today\nOkay so when you say you started in on the soybeans you mean that you open up your first field the beans right\nYeah that's right yeah we had we had a ... and every single Ankara soybeans still out there when that smell it had a we had done low we do a little bit of customers who had done some work to September twenty eighth and and just that was basically are only are only window is that one day\nAnd now we're we're on to our own now finally by yeah it's a\nLimit the has been a frustrating thing happened to wane after there was this lady and take it out before the\nBefore the laws you know in some areas but ours just you know they were still green up until the rain and and the snow started so really no opportunity but yeah I'm getting out there now some shining and we're all in our now\nGood good good okay you guys know how this works if you've got a comment that you want to make jumped right in there if you've got a question from one of the other guys on the\nOn the forum jump right in there and ask it but right I got to say that I'm going right back to you and those soybeans you got started yesterday they you you guys had such a good dean crop up there in South Dakota this year didn't shit I mean it it it sounded like he was going to be a good being crap is it's still all their\n[noise]\nYeah yeah ours we had about four or five inches here and and north than a little bit west of Boston in the north Dakota they got and plus you know ... or does own everything about fourteen inches which\nWhich I don't know how they buried and end up ... pretty good you know four or five inch and you're able to take that we didn't have anything really leaning over too bad that I've seen yeah the only way I'm\nVery out other than our main problem is just shutting the moisture now you know we've gone by and probably being\nSixteen percent right here sixteen to Eighteen Marie started yesterday in front and then there have been so dry enough or they come to town yeah without getting beat up pretty bad with balance so um but yeah as far as coming through that no it it came to that early nice and even the guys that\nLike the idea that I Know with with heavier snow instead they're leaning but but they have they're picking them up pretty good I don't think we lost a whole lot um in our area anyway\nGood good that's good to hear Andrew how's that crap standard for you guys down there in northwest Missouri\n[noise] you know the beans are saying you can find the snow or just one of the two answers although that was the earliest snow on record ever I'd know at least in Kansas City so it was [laughter] we met early snow but that was the earliest snow um you know some of the corn years some reports that some of it's not standing just as well but\nUh we're just going to see on the beans I mean there's been just very few beans around that have been taken out yet so I'm right now they look like they're standing well but ah who knows but the time we actually get dried out to get in\nYeah yeah and rock what about you know that this has been a big concern all across the Midwest just how this being crowd is going to hold on to it's a it's yielding in over in Illinois rock ... some of the some of the numbers that I'm hearing\nOn soybeans ills are just phenomenal like are you looking for ... like that\nJeff far we've gone by two hundred acres of soybeans are for the rain and we will never ever ever again I don't think she feels\nThat we have this year and a white uncommon knock you know if you're in this game I don't care how old you are you live and learn every year I'm kinda curious and we're going to find out this afternoon if we how much you know we'll lost when we go back and\nWe'd go right beside where we left off and what I'm Wondering if it's just a visual assessment by showing those beans and part of my hand in science so that means and how they changed the mainstream order and then what we're looking at now\nAnd I would come to mind was a single blackberry hanging on a plan you know ... when when when they got good quality and when you don't have good quality you know after it deteriorates\nYeah yeah absolutely we'll see what happens after they got pumped up with moisture get insurance back down\nOr let's bring Ryan back into this conversation talk a little bit of markets here real quick Ryan ... the thing that the market is dealing with is a big supply of beans and it's going to be tough for this market to shake it but it's been performing pretty good hasn't it [noise]\nYeah it's actually been providing really well lately I mean we're sitting here what fifty sixty Seventy that about ...\nWith his big crop coming out that was unexpected and I think that the harvest relate to and it's from a local perspective gas market perspective allow\nLater get emptied out from that really harvest um\nThey had some that came off at the end of September and and with based in so tired I think that that middle too weak law they're allowed him to the ship somehow get them somewhere else anyway or are made arrangements to get something somewhere else\nThat you know that no two week long they're allowed them to ship them out and get them somewhere else anyway or or make arrangements to get something somewhere else to make room for a second wave coming so you know I guess kind of a silver\nLining there is is I think that the gas market may have had a little relief with is a harvest like\nYeah yeah and Ryan and another thing that we talked about yesterday on aids teach me was the fact that we're moving some beans [noise] not a lot of beans not not as many as we normally do but we are moving some beans to the pie and W and that is helping us all out it's a farmer form\nMuggy summer\nMonths just\nSent my mom was it will make it look real green ... view\nAnd it said you know for the first time basically since the mid west to settle we're going to have more deaths than burst as a whole in in rural America and and I know a lot of ... that are counties declined is still\nThat's a threshold we've never cross before and it just really wakes you up to the fact that they were literally in some cases dying ah so how do you correct those people that want to want to be out here and and have businesses alongside those marks\nYeah yeah very interesting rock one of the rural development issues that uh we've been talking about for the last Fifteen Years or so is the development of the ethanol industry we got some good news on it would be Fifteen in Trump President Trump\nPutting his support behind year round availability it'd be Fifteen seems like there's a pretty good when for the ethanol industry\nJeff and it's it's amazing how soon as you drive to countryside no matter what state you're in how ethanol has changed in this country side you know you see a improvements in grain managed a farm buildings she quit buying it is ... totally changed the landscape\nAnd uh [noise] you know it's a it's a quaint and product is\nYou know it's something that we were very fortunate in our area here we have one plant miles away and not want about\nTwenty five miles away and and and it's just change the delivery system in a market for the corn and all our rural areas and yes the Fifteen is going to be fired huge advantage to find a home for more of our former bushels of corn\nYeah and Ryan it's changed the flow of green up in South Dakota to as a new\n[noise] saw absolutely I changed our bases here you know sometimes we complain about our bases that you're wondering why they wouldn't be without ethanol and and it's scary to think about ethanol as you didn't go into\nUm North Dakota Minnesota up up in our neck and when yeah ... ... is our main foreign market without a doubt\nSo yeah um yeah yeah ethanol is is getting out there and and the on the beans I of course we're getting another are getting crushed by the second one in a state here in Aberdeen El Al ... as well we're kind of hoping that'll be the ethanol\nOr something like kind of like they have no answer was reporting for soybeans\nYeah increasing to the local demand for soybeans up there Ryan that's been on the agenda for quite some time in the crush plant when is it supposed to come on line do you know\nWell a fall I'm twenty nine teams were about a year now and um I Do a it's a D the plant you know a a base it on my own I Do kind of check their beds over in ... Minnesota and I just noticed\nThe other day and that uh\nThey don't have been posted gravity and yet but they do have it listed as one of their plans now so um they must be getting pretty close to where you know everybody around here is hoping they were all by being next summer to enter relieve the pressure for a lack of export market but uh\nI don't know it's probably gonna be a little too late to help with that but yeah fall two thousand Nineteen when they are planning on starting up\nVery cool that is so encouraging in and run you are up in an area where the the Chinese tariffs on us soybeans is having a major impact but are you still feeling okay with how these trade issues are developing or do you think we we need to take a different tact\nUm I guess my personal opinion and it's kind of a the wrong path and taking the first place\nUm you know here we are now our hearing so let me do about it and and now that we're in this position I just think that you know a trade resolution in ... sooner sooner rather than later would be my whole that we get something done um\nUh now that we're in this this and I just think that you know a trade resolution and ... sooner sooner rather than later would be my all that we get something done um yeah and all the China market back up again for us but I'm I'm just afraid you know that we've encouraged that\nEncourage China to look to other stars look the other source of protein and other than being in the country that we could be just doing our long term damage here that it's going to be tough to undo so I'm just hoping for a resolution any rather than later I guess bottom line\nRight right Andrew that sooner rather than later that's kind of a common theme across the countryside isn't it\nOh it is yeah and it you know it's a lot of uncertainty so how do you how do you market it becomes big you know what are we going to talk if we ever open that up and what it does a beans will jump about how much and how quickly will they do that so\nOut of your marketing beans that you've already gotten the ban are going to have in the band and the twenty Nineteen crop it's a really I don't know for me it just gives a lot of uncertainty an eye on what to do and how\nYeah rock Andrew brings up a good point I mean what if we would see some progress with China there's going to I Believe that there's going to be a relief rally I'd be do you keep your powder dry and not selling anything or what do you do\nA little uh when they reached an agreement we're going to see a large move shutting up side and a\nStorage as everyone says yes George Church certainly utilize that things are going better we of course we have to stay optimistic in this game and I think we're going to be OK chip\nYeah yeah I have to stay optimistic in this game I really liked that rock there's no question about that we have to stay optimistic and\nAnd continue to hope that like Ryan Saturday Andrew that we get to a resolution with China's sooner rather than later so that we can keep the product moving for talking with Andrew McCray from Missouri ... from Illinois Ryan Wagner from South Dakota\nFarmers do during arrange a leg

time how are you well I didn't win the lottery\nEither so obviously I could be doing better\nSo you're still a celebrity egg broadcasters\nGet out of the big word that comes with a lot of expectation and I just feel like that's really a lot that army jail\nWe have high expectations for for the news segment today so let's lower those [laughter]\nMarkets were mixed today a very exciting and inspired to trade and the egg commodities corn has a little lower beams little I read a little lower cattle were mixed so uh this is just kind of a a slow day to day my phones are ringing I think some farmers at least in some places are starting to get back into the field or are we thinking about it\nYeah we'll get into that in a minute but I'll Try to find some inspiration in the news a gel and you know corn futures scene slight pressure today across the board it was pressure later in the day that are raised some of the gains made earlier Wednesday morning looking just at December futures\nPrices holding above the one hundred day moving average I mean right now looking at prices today how essential is that one hundred a moving average Joe\nI don't think it's that important necessarily I think the most important thing to me is that funds have essentially covered all there in that short position and the corn\nSo or ... short covering event is is over and now we're going to get farmers back in the field here and they're gonna be a lot more farmers selling the pressures this thing that's my question I'm about the ... the dynamics about that market\nBut what's the next test the state technically I mean do you think closing of a Monday tie up three Seventy eight and a half in December could trigger like let's say a ... a dime rally in this market\nSure that would be a big positive short term there's a big technical level up at three eighty six three eighty eight I'm One of those is our high back from late July and then the other one is the fifty percent retrenchment of the whole they'll offer made through September so that that upper three eighty to the the key level well looking\nAt harvest the Jill mentioned in the drier whether warmer weather it's entering the corn belt that should help dry things up and allow for harvest the kick back up and most places this week and next December corn futures closing at three Seventy four and a quarter down a penny march three quarters of the lower three eighty six and a quarter make corn prices Indian at three Ninety three and a quarter\nNow starting to ... with a narrow training range for ... today prices went from seen small gains ... back to small gain January future said about the one hundred day moving average traders continue to hear reports of greater you'll damage just the way these in portions of the mid west from the recent heavy rains as well as the snow\nBut do I mean how big of your life is do we need to see the cause of considerable reduction and his overall monstrous yelled at you Neal the USDA's still pay\nAnd weak exports in particular we had a U.S gave acknowledge the fact that you know they'd been under fire because of their export Jackson but he believed that these exports are going to improve\nIn the second half of the marketing your or is that going to have [noise]\nWell I think there are obviously going to improve uh I I called the USDA's decision to leave wheat and soybean exports on changes in the October report as a gutsy move\nUh but yeah I I think we will certainly improve as a year goes on a I I think it's a it's a valid reason to doubt whether the whether whether we get to their forecasts but they will improve yes\nNow so in terms of improvement I mean are we going to hit us forget can do we improve by that much do we gain that much ground\n[noise] well I think will come up within fifty million bushels give or take of of where they are now so uh you know I'm comfortable comfortable with that so\nSo because nobody so you have no issue there\nNo not not a big issue I I again I was just surprised that you know you look at where we are in sales relative to the fold your forecast and it was like a twenty year low so I thought on the basis of that and I think the number was like worth thirty seven percent of the full gear or commitments relative to sales and\nI just saw it on the basis of that uh they they just kind of\nYou know wind down a little bit but uh they didn't so you know we'll go another month and see what happens\nI think the way to weed marketed priced here it's kind of interesting um both Kansas City and Chicago we futures by month contract work good dollar Bush will above where we weren't the same point last year a you cannot say the same for the row crops um what do you think the differences year over year to carry out projections aren't that different\n[noise] well I think we've got the trend uh going in the right direction in terms of global we'd supplies so I think the trend is in our favor\nA again the expectation that uh the the Russian between ... between the concern about Russian exports exceeding let's say to pick a number thirty five million tons of wheat\nUh and and the you know a lesser quality that\nThat uh Russia has to offer this year for example I saw one of the analysts from Russia Today mentioned that and the second most important a wheat growing region for export of the milling quality wheat is down about ten percent a relative to last year\nAnd that that wasn't it wasn't a surprise to me but it is a reminder that in terms of uh there's two reasons to believe that a U.S exports will pick up the pace of bit uh just on a quality and quantity standpoint\nWe seen a big correction in the stock market here will last week we did and we were attempting to recover here this week I've heard him mentioned in in Baba mentioned it earlier you know if you see a big decline in the equity maybe that pushes some money in the commodities I don't know if I necessarily buy that um what's what's your thought on the stock market and does it have an impact on ...\nI've never believed in that theory a I think you know those people tend to operate with two different a man days if you will in terms of managing money on futures a relative to equities and emerges commodities so I'm not a big buyer that I I think he made a valid point earlier that\nIt is important to recognize that a manage money fund and corn have a small net long position for the first time since June\nA I think they are at their ah most short level in September they got to like a hundred and fifty five thousand contracts that short so yeah I think in terms of the upward pressure that short covering his head on the market uh\nThat's behind us now I'm not personally convinced that that translates into oh my gosh the funds and want to get long now if you look at the track record of funds are they not had a good year Joe and so it it could be very well a possibility that manage money funds in corn particularly or just saying hey\nI just want to go to the sidelines for the final three months of this year and then call it a year or so uh yeah I yes I think the shortcoming aspects important where we go from here to be named I don't know\nNow let's talk about another ... let's talk about another group of traders a\nFarmer selling has been kind of light because of these delayed that we've seen and I'm In a covered the delays in their impact on the cob in the next thing in the urban but are we going to see more farmers selling emerge here as harvest\nDuring the next several days next week in\nIn that something you see\nMy rule of thumb from my\nMany years and the cash market is\nWhen you're going to get selling off the combine that tends to occur at about sixty five to Seventy percent\nAre harvested standpoint so I I I expect that's going to happen uh from you know if you believe the consensus the consensus is uh to the extent the farmers are tied on a storage space are going to move corn and soybeans\nI mean you look at the Carey and charges and corn relative to beans that makes sense to me also uh I I think carrying charges and beans are about as wide as are going to go now\nUh so you know I'd be sock on the beans away if your heads for sure uh in in in fact the I've I've bull spread or the no ... uh Eighteen versus or Nineteen versus Eighteen on Monday at sixty one sense and uh you know I think there is why is it going to be\nUm a thug basis real quick run out of storage crunch this year I mean maybe more is that we've had that a lot recently but it'd be a lot of grain that's that's not going to have a place to go necessarily um we we've dealt with them historically very poor maintenance levels\nFor corn soybeans this year is that a trend that you are the continuing\n[noise] um of course barge freight has a lot to do with what the basis does a we're also going to have some regional a space shortages for example the Dakotas and Minnesota you know those BMW oriented markets especially on the inside or just basically have been nonexistent so\nI think those are going to be kind of separate line item issues to deal with uh but yeah I don't see a particular need for\nA strong basis certainly into the you know into early two thousand Nineteen uh so I think that's going to be with us for a while a I suppose to some degree it's hard to put a number on it but the high water for example is going to keep barge freight relatively high\nUm so you know I I I wouldn't be too optimistic of a big basis wing over the next sixty days for sure\nI wanted to go back to something he said about the carrier Clinton's just popped into my head you you said you don't think that the beans breads are going to get much wider um how does the out of the farmer play that what are the implications and if you're a farmer you're on the field right now you're you're hired and you don't think the Caribbean any wire\n[noise] ah I have a view about as I mentioned earlier I'm ...\nYour your heart and and you don't think this carry get any wire\n[noise] uh I have a view about as I mentioned earlier I'm ... no ... or avian versus Nineteen uh but I also have a have a strong feeling that I've been covering this a lot and my newsletter over the past week people are probably tired of reading it by now\nBut but I really think that people need to seriously start considering getting supplies protection for two thousand uh of two thousand Nineteen crop\nSo you know your head if your heads to being right now it makes sense for a couple of reasons first of all I don't think the carrier's gonna white mini premier I think it's going to narrow\nIt but by ... by rolling your just forward to November of two thousand Ninety and I mean you can pencil it if you have a space especially on farm you can pencil but carrier in two thousand Eighteen cropping to do that I was Nineteen so I just think it makes a lot of sense to\nTo put some sales on in November two thousand lighting beans whether you are a role in the desert just selling them out writer boat\nNow if you're not ruin Hedges and you're looking at a November born nine forty four today that's not a crisis and you get anybody real excited they might not even be a price and make anybody any money um how do you how do you convince somebody to do that\nCan they stay in business I think that is that is the whole question that you have to answer a I I don't know if you saw my Twitter poll earlier in the week but I put out a Twitter pole and it is with something like this\nThe question was crop producers it's too early to half price protection on at least twenty percent of two thousand Nineteen production of\nAnd I gave them the choice of the corn soybeans winter wheat and cotton\nA soybeans was the winner in other words producers at forty five percent of the people who responded to the poll forty five percent of the producers ... or I guess they were producer said it's too early to even have ... percent price protection on two dollars a night team soybean production\nUm that shocked me a shock to me because I think there was a very real chance that we'll end this crop year with a billion bushels ... in storage I think there's a\nPossibility that will in two thousand parties with over a billion themes in storage so that's where I'm coming from and I\nThink we're going to cut to a break and we're going to pick this up uh in the next segment Ken more than ... the market's going back on this ship we back in a minute [noise]\nCurrent price you times one thousand acres care either one of these days it's hard to make the math word\nFor your soybean fields to be a chef liberty link system would liberty herbicide\nLeading this is something that's going to take a lot more than just than just a handshake with a between Trump and president G and it's all going to go away and it more prolong the\nOn those issues that seemed to be the sticking points and and quite frankly the rhetoric from the U.S side has only been ratcheted up over the last two weeks not that on\nA on those issues that are talked about from the U.S side as the issues IP and subsidies of state owned enterprises those are not trade issues mhm you know Brazil is having no trouble getting soybeans into China\nSo there is no trade issue related to soybeans in getting beans into China\nLateral damage I just get on the other is the world differently than others\nYeah so you so we've heard a lot of people saying about a set of doing it on a show he said you know China has major economic problems that will eventually forced them to the negotiating table then not the way you see it\nI don't think the stock market in Shanghai means a twit to the Chinese leadership in the issue is basically a U.S challenge of China's long term economic policy mhm\nAnd then and then has been a long term economic sophisticated\nTechnology a engine for the world so you know that is that that is the rub right now with the U.S they see them as a\nAs a threat economically\nLet's go back to another topic here I wanted to talk us whether and what we've seen over the last couple of weeks you know us being reduced its corn yield a couple of weeks ago um\nSo vacuous go another topic here I wanted to talk us whether and what we've seen over the last couple of weeks you know us the reduced the corn yield a couple of weeks ago um there are some who believe that because we've seen so much rain and an adverse conditions you recently you know maybe we could shave some more off of the deal or what are you seeing in terms of us production here\nWell I don't think we've seen enough to know yet Joe of what I did take a look at is I said to myself okay if we're wrong about us export demand on soybeans being two hundred and fifty million bushels too high\nA then that would be the equivalent of a three bushels per acre yield different on the current yield estimate so so so that would be a wash in other words if if the U.S soybean deals were fifty bushel instead of fifty three then that would offset even if\nIn the worst case that uh we found out that our demand numbers were too high but two hundred and fifty million bushels so so that's kind of the way I looked at it but\nI we just don't know from a quality standpoint from a legal standpoint uh from those areas that have had so much rain we don't know yet what the impact is\n... ... um so I think the market may be assuming that deals will be lower but I I I wouldn't make that judgment at this point in time\nThree three bushel dot the national being able to be asking quite a bit even exactly that's my point yes I got ya okay\nUm so we we talked about acreage a little bit we talked about um uh the crop anything else you see coming out from USDA here on the demand side potentially that could be a a wild card\n[noise] [noise] this is not on the demand side but I think it's an important issue Joe a rather than talk about the trade and tariffs wars I think what for agriculture the most highly potential change that could occur\nWith is is going to be related to a current dispute that the U.S filed back in two thousand sixteen what the WTO that would change the terror of rake quota\nThat China has on grain a whereby if a change were to occur according to the U.S suggestion or it would increase the amount of of low terror of quota import quota that would be given to the private sector\nI see that as a much more important issue to trade as ... than anything else so I see not going on with China related to trade\nCan you explain that in in layman's terms\nYeah a China annually under WTO for example is mandated to allocate up to seven million tons of one percent terror of for corn import\nThe industry are only thirty percent or let's put real numbers on it only three million tons of that is allocated to the private sector\nSo let's call that a hundred and twenty million bushels annually of the U.S going to end that uh and and we'd allocation to the private is the only ten percent and so that's even more agree just but as for example if they were required by WTO to amend the tariffs break quota\nAllocated to the private sector of let's say to use a number of fifty to Seventy percent instead of a thirty percent then obviously that would give the incentive for trying to import more corn if it's if it's a competitive\nVery good I Gotcha can we are about running out of time here I Want to thank you for being on a show that more and more so now the markets I'm Joe back the extent of grain filling in for ship the day or we will be back here on a TV\nWrong about some of the things that he said but\nYou gotta worry that he may be writing smart guy I Will be back on a TV

I don't think it's ... dollars he makes twenty million here he's like dude it's two thousand dollars to talk for seven minutes money's money I think we lose track of that sometimes\nThere is no state income tax in the fine states of both Texas and Florida I think that would be the appeal and because of the new tax law that was passed if you live in a state like California or New York you can no longer right off your student come taxes\nWhich doesn't matter to most of you but it does to Kevin Iran\nYou're talking in the neighborhood of five or six million dollars in cash all year on a ... not ... not like taxable money five or six million a year in ... cash if he plays in a state that does not have ... ... is on his state income tax and so I Do think\nThat can be the poll if the twenty million dollar athlete I'm referring to was thinking about a five minute Scott calling for two thousand dollars why wouldn't a guy like Kevin Durant at least consider that for that kind of money but the question becomes what does he want I I think\nWe know we once had a Golden State we don't know where he wants to go and respectfully I Love the cone appreciate you and I know people love Orlando shack lives their check swears by it I think the state of that organization that's going to be a hard sell\nEven though they had the advantage of the tax situation a five to one to four CBS is go to where my parents used to live in Green Bay Wisconsin Scott thanks so listen and brother you're on CBS Sports radio\nThank you for taking my call bill always a pleasure to be on\nUm I I just wanted to say I I Believe a kind of like you were saying before that the next uh or a better option um although James Dolan is a terrible owner I mean you already have a superstar when healthy and Chris stops\nAnd just the length alone in that starting lineup between two guys that are six eleven with seven and a half foot eight foot wingspan whatever they got I mean that's going to cause a lot of problems and um you know ... you can also stretch the horror but\nUm one thing I was and I don't know what they're kept structure is and the Knicks right now but I'm sure if they were looking to add a Kevin Durant there you know they may be able to push around and get a third max contract down there and I was always thought that ah you know now that he's playing with buggy cousins for a year that maybe\nYou know they could eventually end up both going over there but uh the whole Orlando thing I I agree I I Believe that if he was going to go anywhere and Florida it's gonna be the Miami Heat because pat Riley can just lay down a pilot rings yeah and these are the what he did deliver on and I know\nThreat as more rings and things like that and rounded when he got there but um I think those are the two options\nScott I I agree with you man and you make a good point about the nicks and I I Want to add this because I don't my New York friends probably think this and you know ... and I say how sensitive New Yorkers are as he walks in the door\nBut one of the things New York doesn't get the credit for in part because New York has so many amazing things that it doesn't get talked about in part because James Jones has turned this jammed into a showcase for incompetence I\nThis video of shaggy is making this horrible like armed guards bill writer germs can blame them don't want to go on the go writer germ beach later than you would bill later on\nGoing on CBS is Super Bowl season continues Sunday was a triple header first live from London the Tennessee Titans take on the Los Angeles chargers and Tom Brady and the patriots\nComing off a thrilling went over the chief collide with two we'll Mac and the bears\nFollowed by a big in the show dumped in the cowboys and Washington wake up with the NFL today at nine am eastern six am Pacific early west coast and start your full day of football on CBS eight five five to one to four CBS where would you point Kevin Durant\nOther than in a place of a little more self confidence I'm jogging basketball teams where would you point and let's go to Jake in Oregon Jay appreciate your buddy you're on CBS Sports radio\nThanks for having me I I gotta opinion here\nBut I definitely agree that I think you're going to grant fighting with the New York for example\nI think you really want to take his own moving feel what he can do that as some people are a American there's no place to play like Matt ... Square Garden ... or you can perform like you've done and his career and take the next level if anything I Believe on the platform of great players where he's trying to get started I really agree that he'll be ended up with the New York Knicks myself\nI think it's right Jake I like and the more I think about it sells visually salvage it actually should us on the guys I should probably root for him to stay with the warriors because the CBS Portage to show every year now sends me to the home of the final but they just they don't want me going back and forth to the TV shows like pick a city like a lot\nBecause I really like listen I appreciate you don't tell the truth really nice and three and a half weeks just chilling in San Francisco went there never\nWas amazing and no offense whatsoever to some of the fine cities are out there\nI Love using until now but it wasn't as fun and it was someone who San Antonio in ... in June but I Do think Duran to the Knicks makes a lot of sense for a lot of reasons it's such a magical and such a cool place now there's a lot of perspectives other\nJason Stevens tweets at sports writer sports Ari I T R spurs will be the ultimate fit for gay deep under

situation where it would not be Duran steam it would be pops team with the ramping the focal point of it\nAnd I think Michael leads to that earlier drain has studied the Bronx so much and if he's following LeBron model a big part of that model is it's my way or the highway you don't do those great pop of eight five five to one to for CBS to go to Vegas\nI Would love Vegas to get an NBA team and make the finals I Would definitely spent some time I might go for two months trying to convince my wife that's along the finals or yeah it's the best of thirty one series now baby Frank in Vegas appreciate she lives in about a year on CBS Sports radio\n[laughter] yeah you do it by the way they lost they got to get an MBA we've already got the WNBA that just came here with the aces we've got the raiders and we will get MLD eh we're going to get the NBA because yes all out and we've got the night\nBut hey I I was heading out to go I Try to catch the last couple days is Dodger games hurt what you're talking about you know as a Laker fan I'm definitely biased but I if I were him yes you're right the taxes are high and Cal Oregon through\nBut man ... palisade red dawn do teach southern Cal and you're rich and you get to put on the number one Jersey all on the Lakers I I think you should go to the Lakers and I like Jeanie Buss and magic regular bought off bill\nA great you know that's a great point Frank about Jeanie and and magic magic\nConnect to these guys because they want to be magic magic at least for me second best player will probably third now behind the ... and I think Jeannie can be the best donor in the NBA I really I really do I'm a huge city bus fan I think there's a few things that that are at play there one\nThat I don't think the thunder were real rival in any way to the warriors even though they were up three one in that final series with random it it's not going to be true for the Lakers and the worst the worst in the Bronx don't like one another and that's a that's a real thing to rent the exception\nTo Iran to go to the Lakers and I think it's in the realm of what could happen\nBefore it to happen first and foremost there has to be some bad blood between him and Golden State or this like I got to prove I didn't need you guys would you be kinda weird because he'd need LeBron to prove it\nSo I I have trouble getting my mind around it but as a guy that lived near Redondo I Lived in Manhattan beach and I was not rich although everybody around me was not told us around there and I and some of my friends listen to show not talking about Utah what everybody else\nThe rich people there and the neighbors around me thought we were poor because we drove up we Laurie in each of the previous they want to give our kids they give us like designer clothes for our kids my daughter to most Barbie Barbie cars you drive around\nI don't think kids should have cars and we just had one day and we never used it might not like why can't I use it or you know what you're too young\nSome of the Barbie car you drive around I don't think kids should have cars\nAnd we just we had one day and we never used in my other why can't I use it or you know what you're too young 'cause you were told neighbors yeah because it doesn't work I took the battery I lied to my kid and told her to the better it didn't\nWork a it's a pretty magical place and I wasn't rich and I'm not rich and it's pretty magical place the only thing is Kevin ... knows this\nHe can spend the off season they're an MBA players are not going to be playing\nNow nobody ... leads the air until seven o'clock tomorrow morning if you're within twenty five miles north of Nebraska programming continues on translator K. two nine zero eighty at one of five point nine ...\nPull the actual the place that he plays is probably going to be what brings him wherever it brings a five five to one to four CBS poll in New Hampshire thanks it wasn't a buddy you're on CBS Sports radio\n[noise] hey how are we doing bought up dude\nHey ah I think the issue of the Celtics 'cause hey that's the best franchise and NBA history be the taxes aren't that bad in Massachusetts and see if we played for the Celtics\nYeah I mean I think he would be extraordinary there I'm a huge Brad Stevens fan\nI just my thinking is by the time that happens Jason ... I'm going to be a superstar he's already a superstar I just don't think it's been recognized the way that it's going to be two months from now let alone the end of the year and I think he wants to core of his own path and I the\n... and this is good right this is a this is not a criticism brands got an ego he believes he's the best player in the game he believes the best player in the league if he believes he's better than liberal and I think he believes that he believes he can be the best player of all time which we never talk about Kevin Durant\nAnd he's never going to get that ... he goes to the New York Knicks and he won three championships people will talk\nAbout it he'll be in the conversation I think his ego and his ambition is Dr is going to pushing the place where he is the guy\nIt'll be really interesting to see whether he can do it by himself or you can build around them\nBecause if he can that's a giant indictment on Russell Westbrook\nBecause he's already playing with a pretty great player a by five two on two for CBS or Twitter sports writer sport's already I T R Anthony horny tweets at sports writer Katie should go to the ... they could build around gym with ... and Smith junior I Do like Luca Dodgers a lot in the tax advantage there\nAnd to ramp played at Texas ready play in Austin and Austin isn't and we're not on the air in Austin Susan me just pandering to Austin Austin is one of the coolest cities in the country and a lot of people do not because they don't go there ... does but again I guess we'll see I\nI think I think the allure of New York city and it's this untapped basketball GM I think that the thing that likely is the main draw on his affections\nWe're now going to do a segment that as Tom depended on absolute favorite because his last name as the bend a dead though which doesn't it all sounds like the word depends but we tried to you know ... it all together and come up with a thing called it to them\n[noise]\nList find out what's on producers Tom's mind all the time or\n\nBlood is up we really are you set up a whole suite with her yeah as I ever ... yes as you ever ours I just I but\nI have to for you to start off with stars in baseball you uh play for years at Columbia baseball in seven years in the majors according to my miscalculation or were you were a ballplayer\nYes kind of can you defend this is not working out very well from Milwaukee can you defend the Milwaukee Brewers sons do art of war like maneuvers and bringing a pitcher who they left the for a single batter to trick\nThe Dodgers into thinking that they should alternate their line up in a way that adjusts for less than the sort of\nI mean sure if this one is easy it all depends on how much of a purists you are I think if you're a strict baseball purists I mean this would be there a million things to tick you off by the way they are being played out of this would be at the bottom of lists that I'm sure it would be\nYou know something that work you a little bit but I don't really have a problem with it it's just interesting given everything else that we've gotten out of the brewer so far in a series of that council pull this move but you know it's within the rules not even gamesmanship because it's directly within the rules and I I can\nSo that one barely defense we barely barely renting to them ... it's just very interesting\nWe uh we might have some CBS Sports radio colleague on colleague crime here I'm setting you up for it but we also have meant built around [noise] Tom to self esteem do not have been that it was you know these cells female the cell and that's not confusing who um [noise]", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Norfolk", "day": "17"}
