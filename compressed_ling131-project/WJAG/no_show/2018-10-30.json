Internet game the rams interestingly we're one in nine when traveling by ten or more than a game with Geron golfers are quarterback obviously that turned around there were downtown in the second quarter golf finish the game Nineteen thirty five for almost three hundred passing yards and three touchdowns\nHis second career winning comeback went down ten or more what does that and just what you've seen this year say what have you seen in Jared golfs growth as a player this season\n... sometimes you're a dozen have Cory games\nAnd he can have an awesome game like we've seen against Minnesota and\nYou know throughout the season so what it says is that we're just keeps the weight of it just keeps brought it hurts happy was not um at his best than a lot of that had to deal with a lot of pressure from the Packers they're secondary than up banning job but\nHere it just keeps picking actually keep picking acts and then finally we got to start to convert some of those girls and that's what he did in the second half you really got the ... go on and it was ... you know the first half hours or no eight\nPoint then the second half they go out and it really started to light up the door for a couple of touchdowns and to me either look more and more and true and that's your ... keeping her head down and not really\nA you know I always joke with you about it but just keep your head down and Brian and don't look up all the where you're at just keep going and eventually good things happen and that guy was in the second half are geared yesterday and he continues to or ... or the opposite could wind picked it up it was a different team we saw in the second half\nThe second half are Jared yesterday and he continues to impress the operative line picked it up it was just a different team we saw in the second half\nLongtime NFL player former linebacker Kirk Morrison here on the show Kirk and you're playing days now you're broadcasting days as a football talent where does ... Gurley rank\n... football talent [noise] man [noise] it it it's tough because he's climbing the charts I mean he is moving up the charts very fast I mean you look at what he's been able to do I think when you look at some\nOf the people who I went up against from you know the ... to the hall of famer um guys like\nA God man Tony Gonzalez you those types of players are going to be hall of famer and I think that I can say this girl was right there on the same path as those players I mean what he's been able to do in this off switch ... um is really almost reinvent himself Qatar girlie\nHis first two years in the NFL was just a running back meaning wind up in the backfield handed off and go on\nAnd he's totally not that I mean what we've seen from him was yesterday and outstanding catch and I say I'll say the word for probably one of the catches of the year we see in terms of difficulty he brings it in on the sideline ah and then just the awareness at the end of the game a hand off\nHe can go and scored a touchdown but he was like no no I don't need the score touched now I just need to get the first now he gets the first down and\nThen then stops before the end though\nGets tackle and the rams take a couple of knees and then the game's over I I think his awareness past catching his blocking yeah so that's why I put him on that path\nOf right now he's the game's best running back and it was lazy I'm Bill still hold now he he is taking that torture of the NFL's best running back for sure\nAnd by the way Kirk and he knew and he joked about it that are non touchdowns you know very handy football play that cost a lot of people in Vegas some money and a lot of fantasy players not many should care when you did you guys know I mean he likes when fantasy step after it was like oh man yeah like I just crushed some do tart and Dubuque, Iowa\n[laughter] you know what I I think as players were worse so why not into it we really are so like it just doesn't\nIt doesn't affect us we're not listening we're not looking at it and I think that now because of the incident you know social media oh what are you doing or did you know the the you know would beg us probably have going on and it's always funny is player like\nWe could care less that has\nNothing to do with us I mean we just try to with a football game who care that people pay for them to win by a certain amount or\nYou know your fantasy team leader you know another school or you know for a girly man he made the right football player and I think he's more happy with the uh with the greater outcome which is the number age which is when the rams is zero losses\nSo I'm going to ... and actually cost me a when a fancy but whenever I don't care it's got it's got to do current wars and you're on the show curtain ramps changes big game are coming up next weekend or the ... the biggest or are the only true threat from your perspective\nTo the rams in the NFC when the postseason rolls around or do you like some other teams to be potentially good enough to take LA down\nNo I think this is probably the biggest threat right now\nOr that we see or just because of record I think also you can look at the following week Seattle um 'cause it's their division rivals and they're it's never going to be an easy game are you in\nThe last game will came down to the final drive as well so um you can look it also look at uh the Philadelphia Eagles who are coming up on the schedule as well yeah another team\nThat can be a team that can uh you know be a when the rams have to see so what this ... this group of games in which the rams had I mean the rams were second to know\nGoing into yesterday and they had before game gauntlet of\nYou know basically going against Aaron Rodgers Drew Brees Russell Wilson and then the big one of his parents will homes in Kansas City so they've already checked off the box of beating Aaron Rodgers they've got the next three before they hit the by\nLike I said of going against the troop leaders of huge game against the faint at New Orleans when they come back home to play a game against the Seattle Seahawks and then they go to Mexico City the pay Patrick my home and you will know a lot about this team over these next three weeks\nYou know I I Know that there are playoff team that's given I Know that there are divisions champion I that's a given\nBut I think you really know who who are you all for the next couple of weeks the terms of it is a ... type of by team that it can be just one that went away in the playoffs from going to accomplish championship\nCook more than you are on the show Kirkpatrick moms you referencing I Can't wait for that game in what three or four weeks against Iran's he's\nGot the most touchdown passes to open up a season initially the NFL tied and I got I think it was actually Peyton Manning Tom Brady and he's on pace to be just one touchdown short a Peyton Manning all time record whenever it is fifty six\nI'm being ... I'm being facetious but only a little bit at what point are we allowed to get his spot and can read it I Know what we are a lot of say okay this guy is the is the future best quarterback in the NFL at some point even if it's three or four years down the road\n[laughter] I mean what he's doing his outstanding man I mean I Can't even\nIt it's hard to fathom what he's been able to do a especially after sending out his entire first year you know what I mean like he didn't play a game\nAnd all of a sudden he comes in and they just light and this thing on fire [noise] um I think it's what you want to slow the horses down a little bit because you want to see some consistency\nYear after year after year I think that's why we you know we kind of relishing and looking at what breeze and and and and and Rogers and Brady and all these guys have been able to do but will you continue to play like that at a high clip is just\nA it's one of things that puts you I I think in a class of its own both for right now I'm at what he's doing is [laughter] it's kind of remarkable just to see because no one expected that was a big question mark and and all of a sudden now he's just like the legal our\nGet all your opening information that could save you thousands of dollars a year or a month depending on how much you owe direct the more you over the more you can save all you need to oh ten thousand dollars or more in credit card debt medical bills or department store debt to qualify so cool for\nFree debt forgiveness information now at eight hundred ... seven eighty five fifty eight that's eight hundred to oh seven eighty five fifty eight\nDiscovered the secret to having your credit card debt forgiven call eight hundred to old seven eighty five fifty eight eight hundred ooh oh seven eighty five fifty eight\nCBS Sports radio was on his northeast Nebraska on AM seven eighty one oh five point nine FM news talk W JAG north of\n\nThe civil war there I'm Lisa Sarah Fox news fifty two hundred troops now headed to the U.S southern border as thousands of migrants mostly from central and South America make their way north\nAnd border protection commissioner Kevin ... and said not one that you can dance if people are now coming from Central America and he says they need help from the military\nWe've already seen the first one make unlawful entry across to international borders and the second has deployed violent and dangerous tactics against Guatemalan and Mexican border security teams\nNorthern command general parents Donald ... says by the end of the week more than five thousand troops will stand out across the border\nOur first level of effort was CBP will be hard and the points of entry and address key gaps in areas around the points of entry\nHe says they're bringing ... medical and logistical resources and one of the teams and expertise and building barriers and sensing ox\nIs Jessica Rosenthal the suspect in Saturday's shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in court today Robert Ballard is facing hate crime charge\nAnd we will have the opportunity to present evidence demonstrating that Robert Bauer was murdered eleven people or exercising their religious beliefs and then he shot or injured ... others including four of them were police officers responding to the shootings us\nAttorney Scott friday prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty funerals for two of the victims will be held tomorrow at the White House says President Trump and first lady Melania Trump traveled to Pittsburgh tomorrow to pay their respects to the victims\nAnd FBI spokesman says evidence collected in connection with a suspicious package addressed the CNN Today as intend to the agency lemon Quantico, Virginia for examination\nA federal judge ruling a Tennessee death row inmate cannot be executed unless prison officials gave it attorney access to a phone during the execution sixty three ...

not of the job will that brown job being\nI think it'll be a very coveted um you know when you look at the the young talent and the uh the draft picks that they the browns have acquired move forward you know it'd be a very exciting a job in enticing job for\nSomebody you look at it and say hey we gotta we have a young quarterback whacking mode and kind of turn it to what I Want them to be the difference of a defensive team you you have to play makers on his football to a lot of players they still do that more depth but they have access and they have money to be able to do that so\nAnd I think um job Dorsey will also be able to attract um the top head coach or hit coaching candidate because when you look at him he's very well respected around the national football league and they won't look at it\nA look at this ... this bra situation than I Am not is not a lot of a job that I've covered\nLondon bless your here on the show former linebacker Super Bowl champion with that ramp seem I actually I was in St Louis that summer I'm London when you guys were doing your thing as a as a as a young young intern\nThe St Louis Post Dispatch all these years later as a ram do you do the Los Angeles times is a continuation of your team did you view them as your franchise or or is it different because of the fact that now in Los Angeles [noise]\nYou know I still I mean I have a connected to the rams obviously you have a what a a Super Bowl with that team um it was so long ago man that's that's the thing\nI Will say this I still stay in contact with a lot of guys on that team will always have that bond I feel bad for the city of St Louis\nBecause it was a great sports town and and they really supported goes\nThis is the second franchise that they've lost that that has left him in the national football league um so I feel bad for that I missed the clock it was a\nMinority owner or with the ... connection there but uh you know I have yet to get out to a game of LA is if if it's if I still have a connection to the ... obviously there was a they were still in St Louis there would be more of a connection\nLonger when you watch is Los Angeles rams team undefeated now ... where what do you make of them and and their hope that this record indicates that they can make a deep run\nTo the super bowl on CBS in Atlanta this upcoming postseason\nWhere they they they're one of the the favorite definitely in a in a NFC them in a New Orleans um you know they'll they'll we'll find out uh who who who's the favorite in his in his first match it which you could be maybe a preview to a\nTo a a NFC championship game are coming up uh they play what this weekend coming up yeah um so it'll it'll be it'll be a big game\nOf they definitely have off as they have the Gurley he's ah for me I think girly girl is really the every piece of the league so far I Know a whole has gotten a lot of uh attention but I think a girly has been to every pie in the national football league so far\nThey um you see what I'm On air Donald's doing as a defense\nDefensive player being able to do what he's doing as a defensive tackle of so they have the makings to\nDefinitely have a law playoff run in and represent the NFC and the super bowl and and and when it said that they have that type of a tape on the bus or you rent valid I Know shop McVeigh\nWell he was a he was in Washington as a a pet is coach um during my time there and he is he is and how did they really have play tall and office of the office of mine\nHe's so young ... what is it about this guy that makes him so successful so quickly in his career\nOffensive uh off as a mind\nHe's still young ... what is it about this guy that makes him so successful so quickly in his career\nWell I think he has a um he just he's been around the gay for so long and\nWhen I um when I was there was shot I used to sit and and or stand next to the tide as because of ... backers are position next to each other on the practice field so when\nTheir office was out on the one the first team office was out and you know I'm over over on the side like kind of watching and listening to him coach up his guys and I'm like man this guy really knows what he's talking about um you know you'd watch his guys guys come on come back to uh to the ... give them you know a point there to tell them what they\nDid good or needed to improve it and he did the right to guy just really had a great way to connect and explaining teach even at a young age they like that is that this is rare for someone who was so young\nTo be able to teach at um the way he was a he's able to do it and you know he's ascended uh what's it became off as a coordinator and he he really loves the game of full body he had to stay out of these studies it and he's he's a he's a he has to go to\nLondon Fletcher here on the show London who is the biggest threat to the rams enunciate and see who are you buying as among the best teams and promote you see the chiefs was that we do you think of\nYeah yeah you definitely the chief um said the face of the um you know you got you got to throw a patron of mix\nYou know I like I like uh I like my ... I mean my risk as deep as right now so [laughter] to get more officers but if they can get into a they have the type of defense\nTo where they can they can make it a you know down and physical and dirty and ride it out with the ah with the rams you know that can be ... you know somebody who can who can get make things a little bit interesting for the raft but\nYou know that those are some of the things that could cause some problems\nLondon Pulitzer here on the show former linebacker Super Bowl champion London the game has changed a lot since you play the national football league what is your perspective on the rules that now protect quarterbacks and make roughly in the past or something then back in your day when it's just been you know a light light hello\nMan is so hard to be a defensive player and the national football league right now\nAs as it pertains to the quarter back you know they have rules where you can't hit them low\nThey have rules where you can hit them high and now they've ever let a rose where you can't hit them hard so it's really a\nMan it is really extremely difficult to be able to get\nHit on a quarterback sat the quarterback and you know that's how you really especially the way the game is now with the events such a pass happy league\nYou have to be able to get pressure on the quarterback you have to be able to hit the quarter back and do it in a manner where you don't you don't feel like you have to you know be care for up how you are here to guide you know there's been some ties with guys are kind of laid off section you know it's cost them I uh as far as making plays\nMe the water here on the U.S for the first time\nI've ever pull the books that are ... out of my backpack I traveled to Brooklyn with both of you\nTreated in sports writers portfolio TR Mr [noise]\nI Need that quote you just mentioned about Junior's a passion or at least the title of the book where we do both ways [noise]\nWashington alive by Ron sure now\nAnd it wasn't for sports are well no I meant about the uh the quotas quotes the tumultuous passions which company greatness and frequently\nTarnish it's lost or the ...

back\nUp in Buffalo between the patch and the bill it's three to one bill goals patch over the bills\nWhich makes the official score nine to three as we are now a couple of minutes into the third quarter are not exactly a a barn burning up on our porch in the first day and we'll see if we get any of that in the second half\nAn intriguing little note for those of you weren't watching a game forgot that was the Monday Night football I doubt the forget that money for a while maybe we're all excited about what your team did over the weekend\nOr and or all disappointed about what your team did over the weekend or then if you just tuned out the Monday Night football so be it I'm\nJosh Gordon of the patriots\nApparently showed up late [noise] either yesterday or today but he was party or a patriot gathering\nAnd the patriots are admitted such and that that uh as punishment they were going to bang Josh Gordon for the first quarter tonight\nAnd I had the game on and I was a look it up when they kicked off I saw the pre game stop blah blah blah but I was doing a couple of different than watching basketball prepping for Tonight Show and I looked up\nAnd on the third play a big game patriots that during the long in the first series but I got the ball or a judge Gordon not only in the gay but they do the ball dorm on dirt playing a game\nI didn't know that they had shrunk and the first quarter of a football game down do plays\nThat that they're supposedly Jeff Gordon was going to fit for the first quarter that I teach him a lesson is\nA bad behavior was not going to be tolerated in New England or that didn't last long I roll I Know he could have been out there on the way the game I I don't know if we start it or not\nBut I Know for a fact that we live out in the third like so you might have bad for the ... ... you may not have started the game which we didn't play the first play but it's been pretty darned quickly\nOr he has made all that may play don't bark tonight nobody as ...\nPlayed okay patriots are up by nine to three and I get the ball back here uh what about three or four minutes into the second half will certainly recap all of what was weak

field stuff is never as much wind at least not for me but some people get just as motivated by crazed by it\nIt ah I think there are a lot of people out there that believe they could manage a baseball team coach or a football team be a general manager and the NBA or the NHL or they know vote well they're not going to go out and score forty goals or put up a fourteen threes\nAnd or hit four hundred but I Will be a man you're going to be generous so people there are some people actually perverted talk about and language over the on court stuff\nWe will do a mixture of both tonight or because the baseball season is done\nIt's finished the world series champions at once again the Boston Red Sox for it in this millennium which is pretty damn impressive\nIt all and the teams have been different the red Sox won the world series in two thousand for two thousand seven a bunch of players who are on both teams but there was a difference between those two teams as well two thousand Thirteen six years between World Series championships there\nAre and then and now another one here in two thousand Eighteen five years between this one so there were four\nSeparate teams they weren't back to back teams they weren't teams that were winning a ... that had a ton of players that were on ONE Championship team and came back and won at again that tells you a little about the organizational strength that they have\nOne guy who I Do know was there for four World Series was just the past and the other which is McDonald's senior\nOr my father joined the red Sox as a scout in two thousand and for\nThe first World Series that they want and Ninety plus years uh and has been working for them ever since so he's got his two thousand seven World Series ring and his two thousand Thirteen were out there during and they'll be getting his fourth the red Sox\nSixth overall World Series championship Rick congratulations for the old man a joke senior um but they are just\nAnd here's the thing that a ... in addition to above and beyond a in a different light the reason why I was rooting for the red Sox the main reason was yeah from my old man see him get another championship ring I got some Red Sox buddies and I was rooting for them to\nUm but I think the red Sox maybe more than any other team in baseball\nExemplify the merging of old school new school and when I say old school new school I'm Talking about scout derived as compared to analytics\nA baseball is incorporating analytics absolutely everywhere they crunched numbers they use that to decide how good a player is what direction to go with certain players and handle player differently and a like\nA and there are some that I think cab missed out on the fact that nothing nothing served as well as being able to see a play or play\nYou can check spreadsheets you can see spray charts you can do all that ... watching a player play with a trained I still is for me the best way to our value ate a player\nInformation is good those who turn their nose up at analytics are missing the point you couldn't figure things out and then that gives you an advantage as to what to look for when you're watching the player but they should go hand in hand\nIt should be melting and it's one of these topics that button topics\nA lightning rod topics that you either have to be new school or old school you have to choose never the too shall meet that you have to look at it one way or the other I Do I think there is a compromise and the Boston Red Sox show you this year that that's the best way to do it\nNot Paul Holden to data sheets and analytics\nBut not be trained them either and saying we're just going to do this says that who is Nineteen fifty\nNo they matched the to better than maybe any other organization in baseball and that's why I think they won the championship as much as anything else great players couple of good side JD Martinez would you form Alex core Oh yes\nI chastised for the way that he handled game number three in the Eighteen innings and pull them poor cello as quickly as he didn't leave in a while the ...

Mac\nOr there are a whole bunch of teams if you look at the standings they can make the argument for being in it there's only a handful that are stone cold buried and or even a team like the rams were nine you know supposedly are looking to continue to upgrade do you think we're gonna have a busy day them all\nThat it's hard to say I uh you know obviously there's been some guys reporter that failure for example um is with the\nUh the area is a mess with the Broncos uh the Broncos and so you might have somebody that you know goes after him as a last minute I I think you you get at the end and you might get heavy seas and out of them but you know the ... a rare is declining at this point in time so it's always hard to say how much action you're going to get\nA fair enough what is the toughest thing about getting a guy quote unquote up to speed if he's joining a team at the middle of the season\nA kind of depends on the position if you look for the past Russia or you can get them on the field right away a on a ...\nA ... and you should be able to you don't there's something wrong with it but you're talking about a receiver depends on the system I'm you know the lime it depends on the system so um\nYou just have to scale it back to what he can handle on the rest you put them in there for a ... and I I that's I Know that's kind of a big question but that's really the answer so it's going to depend on the player with a scheme or as to how much you can play but you have to keep that in mind when you bring them in a immediate impact sometimes do happen\nWhat's the top of his position to try and had someone in season to get them up to speed in time to be able to help you make a plan to push\nMonetary quarterback now there's been people who have played in a week uh I Know that's happening uh but you they'll usually very smart players um keep it simple or maybe with a good team or they'll make them look good because they can make plays with the ball um despite being so close to the office but your quarterback would have to be the toughest one\nIs it easier to plug in just a comparing these two and I know again by position would change like you just said about a pass rush or just in your ears back and go but comparing off in the defense\nWhich do you think it's and when you were as an executive making trade trying to contemplate how quickly you can get them in there which do you think it's just easier to get an authentic guy up to speed or a deep and some guy\nI I Would think it would be a defensive guy\nUm because the office of guy the other line that can be very complicated depending upon what you're doing the receivers that can be complicated we talk about a quarter back\nA running back depends on blitz protections um whereas in defense of you know you're reacting to things are in a sense but you're also being aggressive too\nUm whereas in the defense of you know you're reacting to things are in a sense but you're also being aggressive to 'em for example if you're playing a corner and its manned bad um you know the basically man a man is gonna be man a man of over simplify it um\nBut it's a little bit maybe a simpler than if you're running a receiver and you try to put the whole out free and he's got to be coverages reacted just Roche\nI Would tend to agree little easier on the defensive side I get your reaction to the biggest trade last week and it played the cowboys favored that they were sitting on nearby wheat gives them almost to four weeks to get a Mari Cooper up to speed\nA high draft pick from just a couple of years ago when is it working with the raiders they change out their coach they decided to go in another direction I still think he's a very talented players got a ton of 'em upside a first round pick has a pretty good price to pay though uh who got the better of that trade the cowboys are the raiders in your mind\nWell first of all I like him I Would have done the deal OK I'm kind of a mystery to me why the production is falling off are they part of it was the officer year ago\nI think part of it could be the office this year or could be that there are car has struggled earlier years replays best game of the year probably yesterday she me coming off the by and maybe they changed things to help them with that I'm so right now I like with Dallas has affected gives Dallas is\nPotentially a shot in the army to get him a going towards the playoffs uh Oakland has to do something with the pet\n'em and you know time will tell us that can do that are now I Know people will say well there's not a simple answer ... um anybody could give that answer but I like ooh that's number one number two I Would have done the deal now the three ... got to prove they can pay players he has been proven it yet\nAnd let me ask you about that and uh you mentioned car I had one of his better getting maybe as best game deer yesterday still not good enough for the raiders to find a way to when they're struggling struggling mightily\nAt little time to come back after a decade away or is he as the game pass John ... and buy why are the raiders fan is they are\nWell although more next year when Joe Gibbs came back after being out illusion record as first ship 'em they made a lot of\nChanges in the off season um after that first year I went to the playoffs in his second day or so we'll see how grew to adjust at your one as far as American personnel decisions schemes et cetera um\nRodents history has been to be a guy that show a can be his sister loves a guy that does the love

get into something I touched on yesterday on CBS portrayed on my Sunday get together\nOr the Los Angeles rams are eight no\nAll apology to Kansas City chiefs fans out there patriots fans are are puffing their chest out after Darrow win over buffalo right now are the same to plant dynamite football they got major revenge against the Vikings yesterday going into\nA Minnesota and beating them after losing the way they did in the NFL NFC division of playoffs last year um\nBut the rams have been the best team in football if you want to debate with me get on my phone a five to one to four to seven they are the only undefeated team and they beat a a Packer team came into their House yesterday\nTook the lead in the fourth quarter got to feel that they needed to get the lead then forced to turn over on the kickoff there after\nThey get the ball out of Aaron Rodgers hands because you had the feeling that Rogers could go down a field and beat them given the chance with a a minute and change to play a so there were made the rams have been the best treatment football barred not ...\nBut in watching the first half of the game before I had to come in here and do the show a would act on CBS Sports radio I'm listening to the broadcast\nSounded like a pack a home and get\nIt really did so I check a couple of people on Twitter that I Know we had a stringer at the game when I was they would act do an eye on football and the broadcast it confirmed there about fifty to sixty percent of the fans in the stadium Packer fans\nNow it's not a drive from Green Bay okay you got to get on a plane from Green Bay to go out to LA\nAh now LA's not a bad place to go if you're going to take a road trip to go watch the play might as well go to Hollywood getting some good weather out there in sunny Southern California so I don't blame the Packer fans\nWarm blaming all the LA football fan\nYou go to decades without any football the NFL gives you not one team but two teams you know what I mean after you're not forced to pick what you got a choice of two and in LA right now they don't support either the rams or the chargers now they both have funky\nStadiums that building a brand new stadium is going to be open and a couple of years but he said are you are they'll share it with the chargers um the charges are playing in a soccer stadium that only holds thirty thousand it doesn't really have a football field to at\nThe coliseum as where the rams are playing and the coliseum was better days are in their rearview mirror but the U.S the fans don't seem to have a problem packing at house in screaming and yelling and getting craze for the Trojans\nBut the rams fans do I need to get to the bottom of why the football fan in Los Angeles has not adopted either they're two teams and the one that I think is worse is the rams 'cause oh by the way the rams seemingly\nCharge pretty damn good it right on Kansas City seals out there in the eye of the west I thought they were little overrated coming into the season they build up their end of the bargain we'll see how the second half goes but season and today there were a playoff team and the rams shortly a playoff team yet\nOne of them is get the backing of the LA fan I Want to get to the bottom of it uh so I asked a my producers mafia and ... and a Carver kid to see if they had a good LA guy\nGot covers the national football league ... Los Angeles talk about both to talk about the fans and like and makes a joke curly who covers the rams any NFL the Ventura County star is real good for us out among before I don't know that I've ever talked to a job before we're going to punch him up and talk football in LA\nThe Ventura County star is real good for us out of mind before I don't know that I've ever talked to a job before we're going to\nPunch him up and talk football in LA\nWhat's the deal out their folks why on the rams getting traction I don't know what more are you going to ask him to do their undefeated all they do is when I got some of the most exciting plays in the national book boy on both ends and the vents and yet as teams walk in and take over their building\nAnd have more than half the house and you can't tell you the home team is we'll get to the bottom of it next our video currently have you on TALK LA football now we can hit me up telephone lines open the rest of this hour eight five five to one to four to seven Mike from Orlando on stock football but on the collegiate level oh Mike\nHey how you doing do you\nI'm doing just fine hey I wanted to really talk about uh the Florida State Seminoles on an earlier program there was a discussion is which team is underperforming more whether it was Nebraska or or Florida State and uh so besides being aggravated about the giants the jets the next\nUh now I can get aggravated about the Seminoles as well so I'm really bad really bad season so far you know new head coach\nTrying to rebuild but they have exactly the same problems as the giants do terrible offensive line short of no no heart a lot of penalties I mean they got\nA crane my Clemson here on on Saturday matching the worse loss and actually worse on laws and Florida State history but\nMatching a point loss as as being the worst than there are ... in their history I don't know if you have any opinions on on the Seminoles of what they can do to try to turn it around or I Would certainly like to hear\nWell yeah you ... the first things first yes I think they're even more under achieving the Nebraska\nBecause granted or you get in for us to come in it at the success that he had a central Florida a great story line and homeboy going home you're rooting for 'em and you've thought maybe ah they could a ... a strike Bali iron was hide\nDon't take time that's been proven\nAnd wild Nebraska is probably going to have a lesser record at the end of the season I didn't expect him to go in there and compete for a conference title in your number one\nOh I expect we'll tag or to go in there and a half Florida State in the mix for the ACC title I didn't think they're going to beat Clemson uh but I truly believe that they could be competitive and they're not\nSo ... it all comes down to what your pre season expectations were and then you decide which is the bigger disappointment I'm with you if you say Florida State\nAnd tag or it has not been there I even know Nebraska's struggled mightily I'm they're going to give Ross a ton of time there and I guess they have to give tag or at a time to time because they gave him a mega contract\nThey'd have to eat a big chunk of change to blow am out\nBut if there's ever been to see them that I can remember Florida State or I say wow this coach has got to be on a hot seat it's this season and Willie ... if not for the size and length of his contract I think we'd be seriously talking about him not making it through the season\n[noise] no I I totally agree and and quite frankly I think part of the problem with college football is if\nYou don't perform you can't recruit\nRight didn't name and former accomplishments only go so far and Florida State certainly got a great historical resume but that doesn't always south to a Seventeen year old kid\nYou're trying to get a a high school superstar athlete to come in here all he's going to do is go on CBS Sports dot com\nWhile they're buried in the AC how bad where they last year they don't go play for this team win if he's got other recruiting choices top flight programs that are making place for them they're going to have better ... seasons the Florida State\nTiger is going to have to make his bones\nHere in your number one or in between your one year or two and really go out and recruit the heck out of it and you're right he's recruiting upstream because of our ah tougher season the Seminoles the bat I don't have any problem if you're going to say that the most under achieving team in college football is you\nJim from Oregon's up on CBS Sports radio Jim\nHey how's it going good but you said\nHey I had a question about this the big match up this weekend between faith and the rams is is finally the year where they have a little bit

I'd probably say it was about forty thousand which is you know what fifty five percent of the\nUm the stadium and and you know I think part of that is you know a lot of people are talking about how well they Packer fans travel certainly their national team a lot of people talking about how LA is kind of a um a tourist destination you can take your trip to get out of the cold but\nReally I mean this is this is you know I'm you know the chickens coming home to roost with the NFL leaving this market for for Twenty years the ramp specifically\nI mean you have a whole generation of fans who continue even though the NFL left them they did not leave the NFL be continued to the NFL fans I Know a lot of people around this neighborhood who have grown up ... you know Packer fans those those were you know Wisconsin born and bred people those weren't\nKnow people you know traveling in um you know flying in those were Angelenos and that's kind of what the rams you know this is going to be a a long term thing um you know kind of winning the hearts and minds of a\nA football fans in Los Angeles Bert you know when when you look at the national teams there's tons of Steeler fan tons of the eagles fans patriots fans I mean that's what Los Angeles is you got you know twenty three million people in Southern California and um you know so many of them have a team and and you know the the rams have to go out and and when those people over the generations\nOther than going to know which they don't know what more can the rams do\nTo get those people turned right away your rights going to take time and yes there might be some with a chip on their shoulder in the NFL allowed them to move to another ruining it drains without a deem in that town for so long what what more can rammed and or the charges do\n[noise] why didn't the rams have done exactly what they can do which is to put a not just a winning product on the field but an entertaining\nProduct on the field I mean every time you go to the coliseum there's a a celebrity out the first game back against the ... a couple of years ago they had LeBron James there or you know on a sign of things to come um you know they had you know there's a lot of uh you know entertainment people that\nYou know are part of the situation there that are coming back time and again becoming rams fans and um and really you know that they've they've they have this um you know star studded roster that they've gone out and paid and they spent the money and they're winning games and really I I don't think there's much more you can ask them\nOther than you know it's going to take some time uh you know for this younger generation to latch onto the rams and\nAnd you know I Believe me you see you're out at the grocery stores and you see the big kids pointing to their um [noise] you know their their parents you know by me this tug early Jersey by this jerk off Jersey and it it it starting\nAlready it's just going to take time to have an effect on the stadium\nI Hope that's the case I before I moved to charge one last ramp watching NFL trade deadline tomorrow for I Am eastern one o'clock out there for you guys on the west coast rams going to do anything\n[noise] uh well uh ... um today and this is a post game press or as his weekly presser um you know it was asked about the trade them on them you mentioned that there in the market for a a pass Russia\nUm a lot of it that you know it will depend on you know how much they believe in a lot of these young kids they went out uh both neither drafted them or brought him and his UPS face some of them have been pretty productive and you know but they really do need ... at the position it's it's been really the position on defense that\nYou know from the from the the summer that you know since they got rid of a rubber Quinn and counter bar when you know that that was the position where they they have needed a depths and um he was honesty said that may be a position that we're certainly position we're looking at um you know I think it's going to come down to the deal um and uh\nYou know that that would be um you know the number one position maybe that and a little bit of deaths from that beat up secondary would be a you know the main targets for a for tomorrow for\nBusiness Joe currently from the Ventura County start talking NFL with us here on from one to venture out we're on CBS Sports radio\nI or if the rams or at least trying to make any inroads generic swimming in a pill a battle here\nIt's even worse for the chargers I guess the joined just thought well we'll get some people would come up the highway and continue to be charger fan I take it they're not taking the northern commute for charger games\n[noise] yeah I think you know everything's gone about as well as it can you know could have gone for the rams you know maybe the flip side is\nIs the chargers who you know I've said repeatedly you know since they came up here you know they moved just far enough away to kind of make everyone mad you know to to to upset their fan base and you know it's not like they moved to a new market that didn't have a football team there it's not like they\nYou know I'm you know move somewhere that was you know thirsty for the chargers they they move just enough away\nTo a new market that didn't have a football team there about like they you know I'm you know move somewhere that was you know thirsty for the chargers they they move just enough away you know kind of straddling the LA market straddling you know and and the San Diego market trying to get people to still\nI'm kind of hang on and and that has been kind of rough obviously but the the thing about the chargers that's similar to the ramp says it's a competitive female\nAnd no one of the more talented teams are in the NFL so certainly there's a lot for them to sell their it's just that I think their situation is just so much tougher you know I think it's under rated that the the rams did have this\nUm [noise] you know hardcore fan base that really time for them um you know the Twenty years that they were gone held a rally use and and in got together and\nYou know had you know put together Facebook pages and websites and and really pushed it took to woo the rams back to Los Angeles and you know I don't think there really was um you know you never really saw like bringing back the charter says I Know that the LA charters with a thing for like a year\n... coverage at five twenty friday evening ... going to be seven five Cheney excelling in K.

I got my Twitter open I keep an eye on it or whenever I'm On the air if I get good grades I Will surely read them\nAnd respond to them or we've done some uh football tonight for chores some baseball given the red Sox there perhaps a little NBA\nOnly fourteen threes by quite Thompson tonight for the warriors they win again go to seven and won the box state undefeated beat the raptors right to eastern conference undefeated teams left\nOr want to lose tonight that would be Toronto Milwaukee gets big win over the raptors tonight if you want to do a little hockey when do a little wacky I'm not a you're not going to get the same hockey insight that you get from for al\n... I I like hockey I follow hockey but I'm not as big a ... is a mystery for al is\nI could point out checking the NHL standings the top team in eastern conference as of right now is sixteen points is the Toronto maple leafs\nYours truly picked to win the eastern conference or this year before the season started and while I'm at it I could also point out that the Nashville Predators\nAre the top team in the western\nConference back forgot to teams which sixteen points to peace Colorado in Nashville but a natural has a game and hand they've only played eleven games eight and three out of the gate for naturalized pretty damn good or the maple leaves are eight and four\nUm so my two teams are sitting atop their respect the conferences so I might not know it was much hockey as for al does oh I Know I don't know that I don't know as much hockey Israel does [noise] um\nAnd so far at least my pets are looking pretty good long way to go and the national hockey league season and your Toronto pick I we talk you were here actually they're not you made those\nYes when I landed I live here because that's what I talk and I try and keep up around vans act happy I Know there are hockey\nMan here's the thing to watch though with Toronto as a sixteen points I get it they've scored forty two goals and given up thirty seven one of the highest in the eastern conference so they're playing some run and gun hockey Jodie and as you know\nDoesn't always advancing far in the Stanley Cup play oh okay well we're ... the games they are changing and baseball and football and the NBA and debating it earlier in the newsroom with a speech summers guy which holds joke on Afghan nah I'm old stays older than I Am and he's not a fan of the new NBA\nAnd here's my thing about the NBA I said this on CBS before and I get on the phone just promise you want to get on hit me up now a five five to one to four to seven\n... this is one of the things that are all annoys me about sports fans in general\nThe NBA has\nChanged I I'm old enough to remember the sixty nine Seventy next that won a championship and still today people talk about them as maybe the most cohesive unit to ever play together or will the street and Clyde Frasier and Bill Bradley in a day to Bush or in a like\nUm I Love that baskets the basketball I grew up on\nA great team basketball\nThe NBA in two thousand Eighteen is completely different it's all athletic at shooting it's making three that flying up and down the boards high speed high temple and the light it\nSignificantly different the basketball changed a lot in the last huge change in the last ten years certainly the last twenty thirty forty eight has changed\nI Love them both\nI Love the basketball but they play when I was growing up as a kid John ... check coming off the bench for the Celtics and a real big man like Kareem Abdul Jabbar and wilt Chamberlain in like\nI loved it but I Love the NBA today just\nBecause it's different doesn't make it better or doesn't make it worse and there are some people on the opinion either you or you love the old time at me and my God what a bastard as they should have a basketball the NBA is come become known what happened it's just different ... minutes last\nIt's just different and then airplanes have today how could you watch that I'm just so slow and there was no athleticism well it was competitive\nAnd the guy for skilled yeah they didn't play above the room like they do today doesn't mean it wasn't great enjoyable basketball why does why do you have to choose sides there are some things you got a two sides and in life and there are some things that you can appreciate as different\nAnd that's the way I feel about the NBA but the NBA changed drastically maybe this is the year\nThat a hockey we returned to the glory days of the Edmonton Oilers where it's going five or six calls the night is\nGoing to win a championship Edmonton oh by the way we're great furor between the pipes wasn't a bad defensive team either walk off and back there on the back line and he was more of an offensive player than a defensive defend front but ah Edmonton won a lotta cup scoring a lot of Gulf so I don't count out my late maple leafs jets yet\nCarver kid or so occupied and you want to check in tonight's Monday Night game we get in the national football league I Want to give prompts the red Sox for what they accomplished that year hundred and eight regular season wins which is a large though not to make teams in the history of a baseball since I went to a hundred and sixty two games have won a

full rather than an empty half full would be certainly\nBoston where the red Sox just one another world series make that for in this millennium\nTwo thousand and four two thousand and seven back in two thousand Thirteen and another one here in two thousand Eighteen for your manager Alex Cora the hell of a job I second guessed the way that he handled game three that they lost in the Eighteen innings\nBut he bounced back out managed a Roberts two games running a four and five when it out in LA hell of a season for the red Sox I think\nThat one of the best teams in the history of baseball\nAnd there are several different ways you can look at that over a period of time I'm just talking about one season\n'cause the last couple of years the red Sox have gotten bounced out of the playoffs early and their players that have been there for a while I was only a couple\nPut joy yeah was on the one that one in five years ago they under bull guards was a rookie shortstop on that team back in two thousand and Thirteen\nAnd were coming out of the Penn who was in part of the I don't think he was on the AOL cs roster\nAnd he was in the series against the Yankees I remember pitching against the Yankees\nHe might have been on AOL CS he was replaced and not on the world series roster but he was a guy who's pitching form all year long they had three guys left to run the team that won the world series five years ago so it depends on how you define best teams of all time is it over a period of time or is it just one season\nIf you Michel ... down to just one season these complex

sometimes a grasp\nBarely isn't as good as others and I just off the top of my head tried to remember what the score has been like in that game good job ... already looked him up for me ah last three times down in Mexico way back in two thousand five cardinals niners the two thousand five cardinals and nineties cardinals work but ... year\nNiners not so much thirty one fourteen cardinals so forty five total I'm not great\nIn two thousand sixteen just a couple of years ago the raiders and Texans played down there that was before a missed the watching took over\n... quarterback might have been tastes Keno I'm trying to remember twenty seven twenty raiders car probably a pretty good game forty sevens\nA good number not a a off the charts number and last year the Patriot the raiders play down there at a raiders were bad a and the patriots beat him up to where they're supposed to ah thirty three eight but still only a forty one total\nI was projecting it to be sixty or more I said the NFL never gets to sixty or it's raw\nMob you also pointed out to meet this week Rahm same in New Orleans fast track under the dome down there on the by you over on the number opened at sixty so we do already have eight sixty point number we'll see if it stays there for the entire a week\nUm yeah that cheap and ram game if things continue 'cause we're still several weeks away from it but that could be the biggest number we've seen is and under over in the NFL in a while [noise]\nEight five five to one to four to seven many cause I can before we exit stage left\nTaylor from Dallas up on CBS portray I gather\nYou wouldn't mind ... to talk Dallas Mavericks are your but we start start talking about perhaps a home I had to pick the national phase and said this is why we dropped maker may feel it was because Patrick ... homes were coming in and we knew she was better than Baker and it makes me sick that I had to watch your\nEverybody talk bad about Texas back on the way our renew patch homes and the truth anyway if you have any thoughts about the mavericks by all means but there are a patch from home\nOkay you're you're going back to the college football time they both move onto the NFL I'd rather stick with what they've done in the NFL and yeah more homes is look great um the ... year apprenticeship has worked very well for him\nSome guy stepped pride in and are good right off the bat some guys go to their top rookie season and to learn from it and get better from it I was having an argument with a buddy of mine patriots fan of not just patriots fan as a matter of fact get non Sam Donald case because they didn't play all that well against Chicago yesterday\nThe jets are so bereft of a weapons we're talking about the bills and they need to upgrade their weapons yes so did the gets\nA noble out Powell this week they had to cut ... prior because he was hurt and be they had no wide receivers so I'd add a roster room just to bring in some other guys to try and play they miss him a and ... their best deep threat also didn't play yesterday\nSo I'm not going to kill Sam Donald too oh by the way didn't draw any ... than twenty touch us we also didn't Tony ...\nHe'll be better for it it'll be better for having played this year going forward a Peyton Manning his rookie year led the national football league and interceptions\nSomehow he's able to overcome that and when five MVPs\nSo we've seen guys both sit their first year and play early\nAh it's work both ways it failed both ways there's no definitive way you can do it\nIt's working right now for Patrick bombs and I think yeah Baker Mayfield even though he's getting beat up a little bit and Cleveland now\nI think he will be good for it too I think they're both going to be good NFL quarterbacks\nAh your mom's Don teaches okay eat a lot of pressure to step in his first year or the ... of building things they're not going to be a playoff team in the west I Know they've gotten off to an okay start but I I just don't see them\nAs a playoff team but he's a pretty good starting piece to take over or when they put an official rest\nEnd of the season to the ... the ... year in Dallas\nHunter from Texas on CBS portray honor\nHey how's it going good you know\nI just wanted to get your thoughts on this from mark Cooper trade I have to Dallas I Know that first round pick which seems like a lot can be but\nI think can get back to his rookie see I have a really good I think it'll really open up his Dallas Cowboys are that has been struggling for a lot of reasons but uh\nI think we've got a decent team I just want to see what we can do with\nIt's a trade for today it's going to be judged on board it becomes for tomorrow 'cause ah Cooper is going to do what he's going to do the last seven games they games with these nine whatever the ... they just had their by so uh they've got nine left to play um\nI like them I loved him in Alabama I loved them coming out in the draft you're writing a good first rookie year looked like he was going to become a superstar has leveled off\nI think it's a lack of quality teammates around him and I don't know if he was a good fit any gluten off in the season so it makes sense for the raiders to trade him I thought it was a fair trade I thought that it was going to be a first round pick I didn't think they were going to have to settle for a tour to plus I\nThought they were going to get one in Dallas was the only team that was going to give it up other teams offered twos low X Y Z in Dallas now so uh the cowboys did what they had to to get them um it's going to depend on\nThe teams offered to lose well that's why he's in Dallas now so uh the cowboys did what they had to to get them um it's going to depend on where the cowboys finish\nIf they go nine and seven and they were in the mix for the wild card then that pick is going to be in the mid to late teens maybe down as low as twenty and if you're given up to twenty picking the draft for a guy looking out for me real quick or I'm going to say Omari was the\nFourth picking the draft fifth I don't think he was the highest third he certainly on top ten um port ...\nThat's what I thought

[noise]\n... with the million\nCame to the right place\nAt the time like me with Laurie [noise]\nYears\nStraight from\nMouth was in Cleveland and why did he was accent and taught Haley both\nFired following week an eighth of the NFL season\nThree games that are robot has been largely competitive in fact even in the Pittsburgh loss on Sunday the browns\nLeading they were controlling the\nAnd the pace of the game they were going up and down the field they just weren't able to capitalize on the point and then on their second this field goal Pittsburgh woke up and then took control of the game but they've got the top\nNumber of take away for a defense and all of football there's a lot alike\nSo why now it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio let's hear from the general manager John ... who did keep his job there\nWere certain things that happened I mean from an all sorts of production standpoint there was no minimum ... puts a production you know there were some players that could have been made that were not mood in the middle to play or failure but I think right now in the best situation news\nFor tempted to do here now is create the best environment moving forward there are a lot of good people in this organization\nThat really want to win I mean there really are and there's good guys in the locker room so you know I Know you can feel it you can feel when you walk in there and it's a good thing\nAnd so John ... says part of it is a player thing they all kinds of not capitalizing on the opportunities but part of it is also the fact that there is a lot of good people hear a lot of guys who want to win their talent and we're just not moving forward\nHe says the organization remains strong what about Jimmy has on the owner and there was there were multiple reports that the owner as\nAs the general manager of the brain trust for the browns went over and over the various options Darryl writer from Ninety two three to than in Cleveland just told us that\nThey had multiple options ways they could proceed fire one fire the other keep them both I Try to work something out in the end they chose to fire both you\nAnd taught Haley what ultimately lead to that decision for the owner\nWell with a big step today is very troubling ah it's hard to win in the NFL's everybody knows that it's us and I think the message today is we're not going to put up with internal discord um\nSo we want people who are collaborative and worked together\nIt's kinda depressing though right I mean I Know that huge act and didn't have a great record in fact it was it was awful three thirty six and one but they weren't too to add one just a couple of weeks ago\nIt looks as though there had been positive stride and now according to Haslam they're rebooting whatever that means I think it means they're hitting the reset button and starting all over again so that kind of depressing except the owner maintain some optimism as\nIf we did what we thought was best for the organization um I think that we put the organization a better place today that it was yesterday moving forward and recoverable to decision\nWe put the organization a better place today than it was yesterday internal issues will not be tolerated internal discord it's it's something we're not going to put up with we want collaborative people who work together\nI think you can easily read between the lines of what the owner to me has let me say it also what the general manager John Dorothy had said about why the moves were made right now but where does that leave the most important piece\nBaker may feel and here's this rookie quarterback\nWho definitely has struggled the last two games have been major growing pains for him and for the entire often\nSo now where the no off into coordinator with no head coach with defensive guys taking over Gregg Williams becoming an interim head coach is also going to be the defensive coordinator where does that leave the number one overall draft pick\nAs he tries to develop into a viable NFL QB he's\nA young man I'm seeing a lot of complex difference who's um he wants to win and the worst one is the conflicts are still very that's got to wonder how much does he brings to the table but you really so much monitoring him\nSo John ... says he's a young man who's got great confidence he doesn't really explain what happens next with Baker\nBought one major reason why this movie was made according to reports and according to Daryl who joined us before all the top of last hour is that they didn't want Baker may feel to get caught in a power struggle between huge accent and taught Haley who was promised autonomy but once and then left alone so to speak\nGoal eight hundred and five nine oh Seventy five sixteen big Lu

they were both extremely successful so now she has just released her third sports biography book about Babe Ruth\nShe spent eight years working on this book and I'm excited to hear what she has to say I've heard that she's a great talker\nShe had a book event in Chicago and has agreed to join us but it's called the big fella\nThat's the name of the book the big fella Babe Ruth and the world he created and he's billed as the first sports a superstar the first sports icon that we were obsessed with\nAs Americans but also as sports fans even more broadly so how'd you get to that point and without social media how does that even happen\nSo it's a brand new book for Jane to labor of love for her and she's going to join us she tells me that there are many myths about Babe Ruth that as she was doing her research and writing this\nBook she found out were nothing more than stories have been passed down that actually aren't true\nSo Jay will join us from Chicago coming up just after the update at the top of the hour eight five five to one to four to seven\nAnd she went out of her way to get to know him as a person and was always there whenever I had a question the senior living

Fox is Laura Ingraham\nI would've done it even sooner but I didn't want to disrupt any more than they already had disruption\nThe president also you get back in his critics blaming hubris joking instability seeing the media he's responsible for fanning the flames of hostility\nFox's Sean lunge will more than thirty thousand people signed an open letter to President Trump from a group of growth of Jewish leaders the letter says the president's not welcome in Pittsburgh until he fully denounces white nationalism\nThe man accused of attacking the people in the synagogue and what's believed to be the worst attack on Jews and us history appeared in court yesterday Robert Bowers who expressed his hatred for Jews as being held without bond he faces twenty nine federal counts including hate crimes\nAnd the accused package bomber Caesar say oc appeared in court yesterday we say that he has a list of more than one hundred people to whom he intended to send packages you tend to leak fourteen to Democrats and others who are critical of President Trump\nThe president told Fox News he's not going to let the caravan of migrants enter the U.S\nThey're wasting their time US military sending more than five thousand troops to the border with Mexico is the largest rapid deployment of us troops since the twenty ten earthquake in Haiti\nAnd the deployment comes just days

in Twenty years\nWe're going to shift our focus a little bit and I'm really excited about our next guest she the bonus guest for you authored Jane Levy joins me to talk about a book that she's just released its called Babe Ruth and the world he created\nHis picture and the title of the big fella it's a really neat\nIt's a really needs a cover of the book and I really can't wait to read it actually Jane joining us from Chicago Babe Ruth is one of those icons and forged that we don't know a whole lot about Jane since we weren't alive most of us what made you decide to write a book about him and his celebrity\nI think I'm completely not I don't know it ... it was the craziest decision I made in a long time\nAnd the consequence is ... years doing it I like I like the buddy that I ... I I own a new major league record for most ticket if night spent alone with Babe Ruth [laughter]\nWe live but he couldn't leave me alone [laughter] so I've gotten to know pretty well um I actually spent the whole year before agreeing to sign a contract\nReading everything that had been written about him in a lot of very very good but none of it had anything about his childhood and as a reporter with just one of those things that you know my eyebrows shot\nRight up and I said there's something missing here there's some untold story and I'm going to go get it and luckily what I thought was going to be a disaster meaning that nobody alive to talk to\nAre are there are all for it and we did it turn into turned into something completely different which is that I was able to get material that my predecessor\nWe did it turn into turned into something completely different which is that I was able to get material that my predecessors couldn't get because everything's now digitized so all the old newspapers that you know are now out of business you can find on line\nAnd all the family records that were buried for you know decades are now on line and as a consequence I was able to ferret out the story of Babe Ruth childhood and the years that were so formative\nOr that made him into the big fell\nSo what would be like well it's not so much what he was like Amy it's that there are two competing myth that survived to what was that he was an orphan and that can simply from the fact that people thought\nThat St Mary's industrial school in Baltimore where he spent his childhood was an orphanage it wasn't an orphanage it was a reform school\nSo the other half of the world thought oh he needed some reforming he must\nHave been one of those you Cora ... kids\nSince there by the courts and so there were ... and both of these things were untrue what he managed to keep quiet for more than for his entire lifetime and another Seventy years past\nWas the complete disintegration of his family and his parents' marriage and George Foreman Ruth senior and Kate Ruth were divorced and not only were they divorced it was announced in the Baltimore Sun\nBut there is no way any reporter

not it's a game\nWith after hours here on CBS Sports radio\nYeah he got the ball from going back to Aaron Rodgers\nBut to be rated with insults and death threats\n\nTo another issue another major problem with social media is that people will do and say anything when they can be anonymous with no accountability\nFunny because none of those people who are sending him death threats\nHas lived a perfect life but I guess your mistakes don't matter right only time a gum raise do\nBecause it's your ...\nInterested me\nIs that\nHe brought the ball out of the end zone\nBecause\nHe was upset at the Packers for not using him on the most recent offensive drive\n\nSo Ty obviously is being asked over and over about why did you bring the ball out what happened what was the situation there were you upset about something\nAre you going to have to answer these questions for a while but he swears that it's really easy to explain\nEverything for him even though I was more [noise]\nOr [noise]\nOr [noise] or was it was a little more about this was her [noise] so [noise]\nWe get the return of all we're [noise] that that's one of the world was so decisions I don't know if I'm not going to go along with your [noise]\n\nFortunately\nPhoto service house or just for the phone for both of us were\nSo there is time uncovering\nAnd he says hey we wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't fumble nobody be worried about the fact that I didn't\nTake the knee in the end zone although if he defied a direct order then of course internally they would be upset about the fact that he did run the ball out when he was supposed to take me now he says he wasn't sure where that ball was going to land\nThat instead of seeing Greg's or line kick that ball out of the ends up like he always does their line has just returned from the growing injury\nBut this one looks shorter to him and so I wasn't gonna take me on the goal line he didn't think the ball was deep enough as it turned out it was what roughly two yards into the end zone and so he thought\nActually this might not even reached the end zone or it's going to be on the goal line\nAnd I'm going to have some room to run\nSo that's his perspective time a bummer explaining his decision the problem is\nSeveral Packers players and assistant coaches have confirmed two different members of the media members of the the media that cover the Green Bay Packers that time was\nExplicitly told not to run the ball out of the end zone before they kick off he was sent on the field and he was told you taken a you do not run the ball at the end zone\nAnd you know Mike mccarthy he hadn't been hard a little bit\nRemember after the game he said well he probably thought he can make a play you know we we black came to take the navy but he probably thought he could make a play he even tried to cover for him maybe did understand the situation\nBut if you consider\nThat tie was reportedly disgruntled\nBefore he went out there to catch the ball but he was upset about paying pulled off the field\nDuring the Packers previous drive\nMaybe he's emotional maybe now he wants to prove themselves maybe he's defying orders because he feels like the coach and the coaches are not giving him enough of it not fraternity I mean those are all\nFairly normal standard reactions to being emotional and feeling like you're not getting your

been doing let's ask him congressman what is it about your campaign that Sal resonating\nWell come on and Brian and hey what's ah what's happening is fine when people get to know me I mean the states a big state multiple\nMedia markets and I've been able to get out there and let people know that you have a business guy somebody who's been created Fifteen hundred jobs unemployed three thousand people over Twenty years who ran for Congress has a Chevy dealership has taken away a prominent\nVersus somebody like Sherrod Brown who\nReally when he graduated from college and ran for office has been in office for forty four years is only worried about one job and that is a and it's interesting because that message resonates the problem is a ... you you might not notice I jumped in this race\nJust seven months ago when the individual who was running against Sharon the last couple of years have to step down for family reasons so I had a seven month uh\nWhen the individual who was running against shared the last couple of years have to step down for family reasons so I've had a seven month a opportunity is trying to get people to know me and it's happening people are finally getting to know who I Am\nRight congressman and a couple of things if he was just amazed that these senators from states that are ... battleground states never vote a with the president I mean short brown ... never vote for the president but yet the people of Ohio already voted for the president at the very least it's purple right\nWell absolutely and he and Chevron has voted with the president is along president he was ... bomb almost a hundred percent of the time he has been voting against this president across some against this president approximate eighty five percent of the time and that's the other thing I've tried to let\nPeople from Ohio no he's a fourth most liberal center and the country ... outlook Ohio's a purple state trending read it's not a liberal state or he goes to Ninety four percent of the time of war and he probably would be better representing\nMassachusetts or California than Ohio\nRight and I think that's a lot Claire McCaskill trying to market yourself to

to earn your votes in the Senate they're all these people who are sending so fair and balanced have not shown to be fair and balanced will kind of centered or would you be\nWell look I've shown that uh Brian when I went to the house the first thing I was disgusted look was all the backbiting between Republicans and Democrats and I literally\nOn the first month started a bipartisan breakfast at seven years later is still going forward so\nSarah Brown joked about every day in order to pay anybody comes to practice but you know we have almost thirty members hurting Republicans Fifteen Democrats that talk about things we can work on together uh and I've said this time and time again all problems are not Republican problems are problems are not Democrat problems are American problems the problem that I've\nLearned the violence in being being in business and then going to the house of representatives says it's politics gets in a way of everything and that's why we're so divided when we should be at least looking at ways we can get things done\nRight or that would be key maybe they're maybe it's going to come and vote to try to get things done after a while a congressman what do you plan to do to close I Know governor case it gets finally backing you\n[noise] yeah the the real issue here is just getting people to know me I mean we've spent seven months of getting around the state\nAre trying to get as much a media attention I chuckle because ah\nI'm as the president calls it the fake news and much of the mainstream media\nHas been very vocal ... toward much in the local Ohio media has been very vocal toward shared because his wife was part of the media for so many years that we've been breaking through that little by little but we're just going to continue to get that message out a business guy somebody who has created Fifteen hundred jobs versus somebody who's\nBeen in politics for his entire life and we're going to continue to work a travel this state and and get them get the message out that's the key when people get to know me they've come my way\nAnd it's just been such a big state that I realized even in our last poll we only have about fifty five percent name id where Sherrod Brown has a Ninety two percent name id that's the difference we got to make a difference and make sure people know who I Am\nAs a six point devastate right now so let's look at it is a couple of issues out there and the plate on your on we Congress going to have to take a look at the president's got an executive order working he's going to announce it officially Sunday\nThat he wants to get rid of birthright a ... birthright citizenship you have to illegal immigrants parents you born here you're a citizen Trump takes we're misinterpreting the constitution where do you stand\nOr walk I I Am a big believer that Congress needs to be immigration program people in Ohio and people across this country\nAre mad because of too many illegal immigrants share brown actually supports not only no no border uh he he wants to eliminate ice like the rest of the Democrats and when it comes to sanctuary cities he supports them too that's what people don't like so they start there and then they started looking at an immigration system and saying spoken\nAnd then they look to those that are born in Ohio or in this country and say you know wait a minute we're we're letting them come across the border or doing everything just to let go immigrants and\nThat's why I say it's just not one issue if the entire issue we need a strong border wall we need to make sure the Congress gets immigration some kind of immigration law passed and um that's what I'm hearing you know in Ohio across people are mad that\nAnybody can walk in the state I'm but I'm not sure we can override the fourteenth amendment you see I I Do believe in the constitution and and then so I think we need to support those as well but president bit of help\nDid you

very very successful a businessman a very articulate very pro business uh and I think that Mike Brown is going to win that race in Indiana\nIt does seem like it is a trending closer or as the days go by the latest polls\nAre showing Braun leading in some of those polls some have done the neck and neck a John Harris you're in Indiana here what's your ... and all that rain right in the middle of that race you want to talk about you can't turn on the TV or throw a stone without hitting a political ad what's your take on and read on this race so far\nIf you just took the states uh in its natural state you would think it would be a shoo in for Ron but Donnelly one is is fairly popular especially in the northern part of the state where he's from he's from right here in South bend area um and he's run a very credible campaign and that I think uh he came out of the gate with some\nOr to the state where he's from he's from right here in South bend area\nUm and he's run a very credible campaign and then I think uh he came out of the gate with some advertisements that showed human proximity to President Trump has some audio of President Trump praising him for some legislation that he worked on sure I'm so played well to the audience here in the state of Indiana\nUm whether it's not going to be whether it's going to be enough to ah overcome that natural proclivity of the state of Indiana to support or Republican I just don't know I make\nI make two other points there too is that the president was was in Indiana over the weekend I'm and I'm going to go back to more times between now and next Tuesday and I think the vote that Donnelly made on Kavanaugh was ... was the deciding factor\nYou know it does seem like that a is a big part of this discussion you know we have John Lam he's a former here in Indiana he's he's called in and uh is talking with us a little bit about the race here in Indiana are as well he's going to join this year and a few minutes hopefully but um you know I I Do think ah that\nThat vote on Kavanaugh seemed to have played in multiple places not just Indiana you want to look at him Heidi Heitkamp North Dakota gym do you do you feel like that is out of reach for high camp at this point\nWell it looks like the polls are certainly they are you out there you know they're suggesting that oh you have by a Kramer and that's one way or just a few months ago I you know I have to change because I thought a\nHeidi Heitkamp could uh you know could have one but she also voted against Kavanaugh but it clearly shows that the race I think is is out of her hands now I I think that's another another picked up by you know for the Republicans\nYou know and she even ran ads explaining her vote in her decision on Kevin ... which is an interesting tactic I think um you know for in a lot of these different races you know it does seem what like what's happened over the last couple of months is really gonna change the whole dynamic of this election Randy\nYea which I think what's happened here is ah the Kavanaugh\nConfirmation process not just the candidate the nominee\nBut the process and how it was handled what it did I Believe is take the enthusiasm gap which was significant and in favor of the Democrats going into a next Tuesday and ... basically evaporated that enthusiasm gap in fact in last week's Wall Street journal\nNBC poll showed that the gap is gone and the Republicans now are are and their base are is enthusiastic about voting as Democrats are and I think that's why you're seeing some of these races turn or the gaps get wider\nOn the real question comes down to and we haven't talked about yet and I know you're going to get to his what does that mean for the house sure were clearly Democrats need to pick up twenty four seats to take control clearly people were talking you know three or four months ago about a blue wave people were talking about fifty sixty Seventy seats [noise]\nAh I I think you know I I'm not suggesting that the possibility the Democrats taking the house over a is not still there but I think this idea of a blue waves evaporated\nYeah we uh looks like chipped floria and able to take a chip what's going on what's your take on this enthusiasm shift well\nI I couldn't agree with Randy more with what he is saying about um uh the ... the idea of the blue wave has has lost its momentum I don't think there's any question about that\nJim and Randy I've got I've got some perspective on on the Donnelly race in the high camp race we ... on agar talk we go out and we we tried to get lawmakers from across the country either party\nOn average talk to come on and share their views Donnelly and hike camp or one of the few Republicans or excuse me do Democrats along with Peterson a out of the house out of Minnesota\nThat have agreed to come on agar talk suggests to me that they're more moderate okay and and and willing to talk of use do you think they're moderation hurt them in this race\n[noise] Jim what do you think\nWell but Kavanaugh as Randy set and Indiana a capping off thing did hurt\nNow I Will add all that took the cap and all of a circus if you will also galvanized the Democrats but there are those the hassle couldn't go any much higher than it how they solve that perspective there\nIn Missouri I think are consistent this was the second Supreme Court justice by Trump\nThat McCaskill has voted against and I think that's her undoing uh in North Dakota it's just that that Trump plant up there and Kramer did not make a mistake in that election as some people thought he might so I think that's the differential there\nYeah Jim you know oh go ahead Randy real quick\nLives just gonna say chip moderation is is an interesting thing to look at it because in the end when people look at these things you know there's three or four issues that they really look at it I mean how's the economy going\nAnd clearly the economy is rebounded and is doing quite well and in Indiana particularly a given the unemployment rate given uh many other factors and I think when you look at Donnelly voted against the tax bill\nA an end on another significant issue again as the Supreme Court and you know people there's two or three key issues that people can look at fifty issues but in the end they're going to vote on three or four\nThe economy is strong and he voted against the Supreme Court nomination I think for a lot of people in Indiana State that Trump won convincingly that the vice president was governor of are they going to be a very very big factor in a probably might brown winning\nYeah that's an interesting uh interesting take on that a rainy we've got done lamb who ah farms here in Indiana and dumb uh what's what's your take on the deciding factor on this Senate race here in India\nPlays for crap me on I Apologize I I kind of came to light to the ... yeah no problem it was on top on top of the ... and so I didn't [laughter] dollar an hour and a kind of\nWatch what I was doing our movement harder so purposes a wrap wrapped up here for us but\nI think from what I what I just heard I Would agree with that that are here in Indiana you know we're we're a conservative state I'm old Donnelly is really practical so if you look at it from agriculture perspective\nIt it may be kind of a win win district agricultural issues\nThat from a lot of the other issues where he goes with Democrats so much the Kevin Kevin all issue is was really just a great example of what happened to you Dr rates the road he has a tendency to go with the\nWith the Democratic leadership and in general that's not a good thing here in Indiana and in general the bag population that even though he's good for agriculture we also don't see\nIn general the population that even though he's good for agriculture we also see Ron be bad for agriculture so that's a that's a tie that I I Would say mostly\nFor strong yeah yeah well it will ah we're going to continue it stinks dawn for that perspective we're going to continue this conversation coming up here and just a second\nBut more advertising of course we're going to talk about the house races or we're going to hear from some folks out in Montana about a big raise happening out there and of course we'll take your calls here on TALK of a five five ... jump in here\nBe back in just a second\nMuggy summer or\n... looking for a green while living below\nAnd uh so I think it's I think is paying off\nWhat is ... ... have you seen any change and enthusiasm\nFrom some of the the folks in rural areas in farm country over the last a couple of months giving some of these things and issues happening in Washington has that changed at all or and what are the what are the big issues that farmers and ranchers there in Texas are going to be voting on\nWell that's the that's the first part of the question is is yes I I think there's a definite change and I guess the way I kind of noticed it\nIs is there's people talking about this Senate race or that\nYou know for lack of a better term unfortunately before they were kind of a ambivalent apathetic talk politics and and that's not the case uh you know there's there's folks that I I've\nI talk to maybe a year or two ago and you know really couldn't get them interested in now they're interested in their their you know they're saying that goodness you know this you know there there is a lot of difference between between some of these folks that are running so yeah I think there is a renewed interest um\nIssues in our state uh just you know I think it's pretty much the same everywhere in farm country a regulatory issues\nA ... you know or something that that we deal with all the time as as does everyone else um uh the farm bill a moving forward a very important to our farmers and ranchers a you know and and and just you know trade issues of\nThe things the same things I think that are in the important throughout farm country but but uh generally those issues are front and center\nJohn Harris joining us again John as we look at some of these big issues are are they big enough to motivate people to the polls for in rural areas\nI don't know that those are but I think we've already get on the ones that are we talking about immigration when he talked about uh the Supreme Court issues I think those are probably the two biggest that are going to drive people to the polls\nYeah what do you think a general does get people to the polls farm bill train I think\nThey will point yeah but now the Democrats are galvanizing galvanizing around some health care or you know topics such as pre existing conditions etcetera that shows up definitely\nIn the polls in the Senate race the last one I saw the survey said that there there's only about three percent undecided so that that's hard for or Rourke to come back around five points that he's down there and their their quest to know\nA bottle only two percent can could possibly change their fault so that they're going to know where it's not impossible for him to still when it's going to be ceding really difficult I think that you think that the race but I wouldn't want to get other opinions on this tester out in Montana or I can see that go on either way\nYeah so what do you think Randy what are you what's your take on that Montana race [noise]\nAh you know over time what has happened is that race has significantly narrowed I think in the latest a real clear politics of polling data he somewhere up two to three or the president has been out for Rosendale he will go back out I Believe again\nI think the president made no bones about it a a a doesn't particularly like Senator tester he uh feels like he torpedoed his a VA nominee\nAh which was his former doctor and uh I think he held them a kind of accountable for that and I think I think that's\nUh which was this former Dr ... and uh I think he held them kind of accountable for that and I think I think that's one of these races we could wake up next Wednesday morning and find out we have a new senator from Montana\nYeah it it will be interesting I talk with Michelle Jones she's a the president Montana grand grows association or ... and this is what she had to say Michelle Jones lives in one of those hotly contested states out Montana Michele uh I don't suppose you've seen a few uh advertisements here lately idea\nThe only downside of a contested election contested elections are graded graduates that an object but\nMatney can't watch TV without having them fast forward on your DVR or another it's all up letter glad\nYeah they're saying it's been sixty million dollars poured into that state setting a state record as far as money being spent on this uh this election\nYeah it's definitely it's definitely got a lot of outside interests that there isn't a lot of people outside obviously President Trump's been here a number of times it again and other officials with a campaign and other senators and stuff like that a lot of campaigning going on as well as outside money that has been pretty substantial\nWe have Jon Tester there is a democratic income and run against Matt Rosendale is Republican challenger as far as what folks in Montana especially in rural farming and ranching community what are the big issues what's playing well to those folks\nWell I think there is always our main issues that show up and a lot of states that are typically red states Montana has a little bit more purple then people tend to believe that they are but public land is always a big issue agriculture policy is always a big issue as well as the other social issues\nThat plan to help people identify in politics but certainly trades big issue this year as well as a governor the economic ... has a lot of talk about the economy and especially the farmer gone I mean\nSo many things to discuss a out of that clip we are going to talk about whether or not Montana's a purple

reality some can that may be trying to think moving\nAt the major buyer of us soybeans you know a lot of folks that it's an edible they need to come to the U.S but it hasn't happened yet so we'll talk to any about that\nAnd lack of Bob ... typically in the bay or he prided himself on being the bear but the last couple of times and he's I he must be ill because a couple of times he's been actually bullet and so I guess when you get to these prices maybe there's nowhere to to be but bullish and some of these cases so\nWe'll talk about at our back about that and of course we need to really decipher what happened on the floor of the the immediate days or a friend Joe ... going to check in and just a bit\nTo decipher that for us but before we kind of\nCome through the chaos of the the Emmy\nClint Griffin is going to come through the chaos of all of a market for with a market news either not a great day it he'll watch market prices\nTo know it wasn't a great day and it always seems like you know in equities do well commodities tend to ... bought her a little bit I think you know we've seen that the last couple of days we've seen a little bit of a pullback of bounce back as far as ... or equities go the stock market\nAh but commodities boy they're struggling struggling to find any kind of a momentum let's jump right into some of the market movers today the U.S a winter wheat crop right at fifty three percent good excellent as of Sunday that's up\nFifty two percent from a year ago us funding progress has moved to Seventy eight percent complete behind eighty three percent last year and eighty five on the average of the past five years of Dr pattern\nContinuing to build across Europe and the black sea region the market focus sluggish on us export demand and not the potential for a second year of a small world crops\nThat I mentioned a week contract down today December we ended the day for Ninety nine and three quarters down seven and a half Clinton never Kansas City we down fixing three quarters today for Ninety four and three quarters in December Minneapolis we contract and in a day six and a quarter lower at five Seventy one and a quarter\nNow in the corn side of the ledger harvest progress shows corn farmers are catching up you're serious as hard as advanced as sixty three percent complete as October twenty eight equal to the five your average harvest weather looks wetter than a yesterday for the next ten days which\nAt you know a lot on the line yesterday and chip no longer a blue ribbon agra marketing on and he said he looked at it as you know maybe this is the kind of the last shoe to drop if we've care of all of the the goods that we can maybe this is the worst that the market can digest\nMe do you view it that way or kind of ... where's your head out right now any\nUm you know like the last couple of weeks has been a lot different than the really previous three four months and\nThen with the stock market I get really um rough choppy down a dangerous mailed those those things that the companies\nThat are working with these tariffs are not like in it and the trade is not liking it\nUm and it's getting bigger not smaller like right now and it's like every day I can read a lot of different stuff about it and you can just tell I can tell certain days and markets as nervous and not going to be very good and uh we trade down five hundred points for her points off of\nJust fear and the stocks and that's that's got our markets kinda closed up here for right now and these companies are going to start missing earnings and stuff going forward here and you slept all the tariffs on New Year's bigger numbers of twenty five percent [noise]\nMan that's scary to me um [noise] maybe ... minutes how it's going to go I'm hoping for the best I mean our guys have have gotten hit first here um with the twenty five percent tariff on beans and we've been twenty five percent below\nBrazil the whole time I'm doing these other companies that that's the bigger picture stuff and gets the most people and has the largest impact and so that's the thing you've got to watch here um but man [laughter] ah I really want to see him do 'em all sort of seems like they're going to do 'em all that's what I Would say\nBob does that nervousness translate into pressure on the Trump Administration if you see him in agriculture yes we've seen the pressure and we've seen the president speak about that but not really changed his mind set on getting this fixed with China do you think that's enough to kind of break this administration when it comes to negotiating with China\nAbsolutely not I think he's in for all and and it's a game of chicken and one thing while our stock market has been hurt it's nothing compared what they've done to the Chinese economy and Chinese stock market is down over thirty percent\nSo they're starting to feel pain over there to the problem that scares me probably more than anything is we elect our officials over here over there it's basic who's a strong man survived\nAnd so who cannot ... who can wait long wait longest and I'm fortunately think China thinks they cannot wait is Trump's and I think of those mid term is going to have a very big impact on trumped up in the house goes to who the Democrats\nThat I think to the Chinese will become a boat and that they can negotiate now Trump wins by house and Senate both I think that has a big and gives Trump edge on on China\nSo this midterms are really really loud and on their impact but is he going to it's going to know is getting the workers back he's happening in the mid term he was helping the consumer and when you look at the political vote who has more people farmers or the urban\nIt's just a function of numbers there's more political power with the urban then there is what's real and this has always been a problem that culture\nAny do you agree with Bob do you think that in China thinks that they can outlast the U.S in the U.S is is kind of the the one in the party that has to break first\nWe just had a um one of our guys spent a two weeks over there we just came back here last friday and um it's kinda weird I gotta say uh it's really uptight\nAnd the young people really don't like what's going on here and that's obvious but from the government side there's a lot of propaganda stuff just kind of coming out um he talks about fake news um this the the real deal stuff is over there man I'm telling ya\n\nWell you know there's like um we don't need any beans and so the crushing plants will basically outright lie and say we've got coverage and to a January but that's not true and there's no possible way that you could just it's impossible and they were saying that well you know we think we can\nChange the formulation on our feed and work through this and take no beans for all next year I'm like so it was the word is going to have a skinny a guinea pig is that's how this roles that's the formulation that uses less feed so just like it is all say the same thing good\nMoney and the Americans basically yeah out of out of beans are pretty much though in November and right\nIf they want to feed their oaths are going to have to buy or being but if they get the giants fab\nAnd South America doesn't have weather's problem being market can get pretty nasty so there's a couple of months here where you think that at the by I think what they're going to do they're going to buy for Mexico we're going to ... ship Mexico buys a Canadian buys it and then they ship it to Canada to get around the terror\nAnd when you go to the numbers it almost makes more sense to go that way so they get a or B but not directly you get an indirectly\nFor the funny thing is so these guys were saying that this is why I'm not going to say the names of the company's ... three or four in the big ones and buy all our car goes\nThrough like probably by Jan and won you need to have a full export program roll into China which would mean we would need a good month and a half to get stuff into the system to roll that direction so like that's coming here [noise] they better have some stuff moving in November So we'll see what they do here\nBut it doesn't happen I go what if they don't start moving those beans and they don't get him in the pipeline I mean is that tell tale sign that we're not going to see the shipments had to China\nI think it is because from what I can tell their government is really hard line on this thing and there are they wanted to support from the people and sometimes from Newark in companies you know the least amount about it um you know you work for a commercial company it's kind of that but this deal [noise]\nAnd my son I don't want to have a lot of them that they start having a lot of disease outbreaks in China and kill hogs and\nYes and I got to this point it is not going to get a ... you know yeah no the cat\nBut how about you know I had I had quite a few animals on the show that had argued you know no matter what we understand the nervousness of the market but China has to come to the U.S they have to buy more me being you know like an added up all that happened but with with each day that passes it seems like it may be less likely to that comes to fruition\nI think that's what the markets reflecting right now everybody believes that the November supply demand reports going to reflect to lower yield everybody wants to be\nThat's what the markets reflecting right now everybody believes that the November supply demand reports going to reflect to lower yield everybody wants to be Bush but I think the market could fearful get a lot of the rally in before the report report returns and if the demand does not\nCome back with the bench enhanced to all of a sudden we're going to be ... ... ... a very difficult situation we're going to be up there\nAnd once we get past January February the south American crop right now it looks like it's going pretty good the weather looks good everything looks good for our just named Brazil with the weather up for it if they don't have symptoms materialized but I'd say by the middle part December\nJust market's going to happen and now have a problem then the question becomes do you see a big shift to coordinate her from being occurs to corn back in December corn futures could you see a six to eight percent shift in Corning ... it'd be knickers to corn\nAnd so this makes spreads go nuts and affection bases and just does all the all the rest of next year could be in the bases and the spread not as much in the ... price and the farmers historically don't feel comfortable with that type of market\nAndy real quick you agree with that\nYeah I think um my theory is where they're going to have no carry out and beans or a billion and it's going to be a mess and it's going to screw up the whole market and I don't know how that goes and I'm hoping it's about ... billion but at the stage where it's headed but otherwise there'll be under bought\nAnd come forward and reload stocks and we'll be down to what we've done the last ten years towards that carry out probably pretty quickly if the stuffed changes but\nOne of the other if if that happened how much longer do you think we can go on with the impression\nThat we need to go any lower at all I mean we're twenty six to\nBrazil here cash basis is sixty under in Cedar Rapids futures or heat forties or in the seven so we don't need a girl pending a lower price is going to be a lot of the same sometimes\nMarcus just flatten out and just kind of stay the same um beer at all and like you say go ahead in\nThe back in falls to the front and so the bull spreads were not because the markets bullish them both Brits workers the brunt of goes nowhere in the back and goes to the front of the only absolute in the market\nWill be trying to kick all\nWell we're just getting started with a lot more to talk about anti ship Bob ... when you share more their knowledge with us coming up on this show on Tuesday edition of Akron talk after the ballot and we'll talk\nAfter this break so stay with [noise]\nNo matter what you do\nYou're always raising the bar trying to do better than ever knew Laurel fungicides for corn and soybeans and help you get the edge you're looking for\nWere kind of ... at the number out there are going into insurance for February and all that but it's similar to years ago and so it's like we're at a pivot point where we're either thirty cents lower that are thirty cents higher\nUm and I don't think we're ready to be thirty cents higher than that right now at this trade stuff coming on and and that's how that would develop as if we change the sopping China's starts buying stuff here that's pretty obvious that's how that would go but actually sold corn\nFor four bucks or above for next year because we can't hardly get a four dollar price on the front end no matter what we do here and so like I even sold some stuff in the three Ninety area on some of the old crop and I figure\nI always say that um you know if it if I sell it when it's\nA pie can work with that but if it goes down I Can't make it go up and and that is is really tough and so I look out there and I'm like All right awesome for on the board with these car and I work with that and figure it out but uh [noise] I guess I don't feel bad about the corn market so actually seen a pretty decent number out there and you can sell calls and kind of put the\nPackaged together and you've got a decent price and I can't do any of that was soybeans I'll make sure I Do it and corn\nYeah they're going to where I'm at but do you think a lot of\nProducers ... right now\nYeah that's exactly the problem for corn corn you know I got clients can make money on these Nineteen corn at four bucks not a lot of money but they can pay for all the bells beans or a buck twenty five underwater eat wants good deals so that's why acres are going to ship and\nYou know if you listen to the advertisements before you get\nIf I'm underwater eat what good deals so that's why acres are going to ship and\nYou know if you listen to the advertisements before you guys came on there is all about production how to increase my production hardly get more bushels soon so the the incentive for producers I got to produce more as I got to have the same grows cos I gotta get more bushels per goose was I don't see any incentive for supplied and tracked over the near term\nIf anything you would expect those guys need more bushels\nBecause he got much gross dollars they got to generate and that's what so that's going to be the battle with a banker allow that shift from being the corn corn corn costs more put out or being in school we guys they were being boat all know they're going to have some rotation but we're talking\nI've heard numbers as high as nine to ten million anchors I personally think that's a little too\nToo and that's a pretty extreme\nExtreme but we've historically had those biggest shifts\nBut I'm thinking maybe four to six million acres\nWith seven probably being the upside it depends on whether but so all of a sudden you could if you don't have the crop if we get the acreage increase and we have a lot of member tore him ... men you could see\nUnfortunately I hate to be the bearer of it I could see three twenty three twenty futures with a wide basis next fall\nWhich is below cost reduction and then you see the that through them makes everything just rarely get nasty at the bank or level\nBut that any yesterday we had some analysts on who we're talking about with the ... and the payment from USDA with these high yield some producers are seen that some producers are looking at making actually a little bit more money when it comes to soybeans so do you think that the case for some and that kind of\n... the big increase that Bob is talking about and corn acres next year or do you think now pretty much we're going to see a large jump\nOn that we see a large chunk of the guys that get the big deal to the same people the plant the crop on April ... year the Seventy five the eighties and those kind of numbers those guys don't change that rotation they don't really care um but you go up in Minnesota\nAnd we can't poll fifty Bush will yield on a farm average off some of these farms and and uh the Iowa\nYou'll read on the border there and you're going to range from a hundred and forty to two hundred bushels to just tougher it it's easier to make that argument for those guys and so that's where the banks are going to be tighter and that's why you don't see a sixteen million acres which you see something like Bob's talking about because it's that kind of area\nWhere you'd see a switch to to more corn by believe that\nBy the thing is you can't guarantee that you're going to have that farm payment next year the eighty six\nWell and they said it's not the only one year thing right yeah they are going to be a one year thing and you can't bank on that plan accordingly but looking at this year and cash reserves some you know\nPossibly looking at at at still planting a decent amount of soybeans next year\nSo the game playing with his for the carriers you've got to sell the corn Terry you got to sell the July ... Ninety to Ninety five you got to get rid of the ... older carry over the bases improvement and if you want to be a speck of a double play a flat price play on paper for a limited amount of cost\nAnd get really focusing on Nineteen and my several you're in the market and I hate\nTo sound like a man you can't sell next year when you've got the grain bins full this year on prices are just farmers can't move that we've got corn on the band and they have they can't sell next year just their vapor locked and that's the problem I see develop a new farmers are going to be locked by their own restriction widespread problem in ...\nI got to think we're about as on prices weve been right wouldn't you say I mean once the trailing came on there was no other opportunity really on the whole crop and everything like that\nWho do you say you got you got basis and Ohio fifty under up in Minnesota even except when you guys haven't voted them\nAll right well it's trying to think only fix for prices at this point last candy and Bob\nAfter we have this break a lot more to this guy closed down the ... after the ...

the it was there I don't get me wrong was there but you could find some nice come as I used to enjoy actually going into the comments that I Would reply for times my boss has made me stop\nThings have gotten much ugly place now and unfortunately they've there's ugliness I think is more of a little bit and it's it is move is migrated from the stages beneath columns two people seeking out\nWhoever they're directing their vitriol that ad and it's it it's unfortunate I noticed on everybody\nAnd I'm aware of my time as a writer that the ugliest voices the ones that I hold reflect us as a as a people in the country the least are often the loudest\nBut I'm also aware very limited compared to time on camera and that however small whatever the fraction the tiny sliver of people who are really ugly when they directed towards your children or towards your wife\nRight if it crosses the line and it really it really is it is an ugly innocent and shame on\nWhoever those people are paid five five to one to four CBS is the phone number\nIs ... ...\nA five to one to four to seven is brought to buy guy go everybody here's a quick way you could save money switch to a guy go\nDo you need homeowners runners are motorcycle insurance to get it all\nHad Geico dot com you know the um\nThe the bevy of of of trade information of of trade none of information of action had me really excited about the possibility\nOf some blockbuster deals of some huge opportunities and the thing that I was really hoping it was going to happen was that Patrick Peterson was going to be traded from Arizona too and again this is my I've been a fan I I just I think that she's a really exciting\nAnd give them somebody in that secondary to somewhat staunch the bleeding that we've seen and they become so dangerous so interested in these are just use them back in the next and Patrick Peterson reports were could perhaps command as many as\nAs to first time picks your Arizona you have a first year head coach was what defensive coordinator in Carolina last year I think is what will did\nThere's already uncertainty about his future and what he's about where he is going to be you don't and I can't sell on Josh Rosen already but there's it feels like such a rebuild such a tear down such a oh man how far away are we how do you not trade that guy if two version on pitch to the price and find some kind of a ...\nMinute Kansas and she's the only team who would seek that due to town and he's\nNot he's not you know he's not old I think he's twenty eight years old\nBut that's not it's not like you're trading away at twenty five year old who's got years and years and years left you can get kind of a wall so\nIt is an forge I Wish that it happened I was I was I got a little tease right it was kind of cool and kind of excited like oh you know I'm Ari Cooper alright cool cool cool down a foul are All right I guess I couldn't do until that time I go Murray we're still in need of the blockbuster trade\nEight five five to one to four CBS is the phone number let's go out to Wisconsin Travis thanks or listen to buddy appreciate your man you're on CBS Sports radio\nHey I have a walk with God right around grief man I feel bad about that made a four way but there's no reason for it to get back alive appearance last night in Green Bay right next to ramble feel and yeah the guy white home because of the threats that\nI mean that's unbelievable I demand me to you know ... and he paid for by getting traded or you know they were gonna cut him\nWith rocket fire what your what your back which is what people were calling for over ... ... in a you know we're in the first year and threatening family you know I was ... home and not go to an appearance\nI mean that you're it's gone too far I let you than I Would point to what I mean I was I got caught him get rid of it on your ... your frightening and\nI went to ... and you know I live in Green Bay and my parents did for a while I visited for ... it was awesome six weeks when when Christmas Vacation but I'm from that part of the country I'm from northeast Iowa I have family scattered throughout Wisconsin Iowa\nNebraska and so I can speak from some experience that doesn't reflect most people but whoever you are ... whatever scum bag or re out their represents those people who did that please turn off the red out we don't want to hear like if you're one of those people\n... I Can't really control it but I can tell you're not welcome in this space whatsoever [laughter] that'll go away\nAnd shame on you you worthless pieces of you know whoever's and I hope it's very few people listening who were like oh it's\nOkay go turn off the radio I'm sure there's some hateful thing you can find online that'll that'll that what you're about\nTo end by the way in the caller made made this this point you can get fired you can get cuts you really you should be the contents of this and we don't do nuance well but the context of this\nIs time Montgomery acted like a diva he acts like a baby he threw a fit\nOver not being a part of the series he said to hell to you basically with his coaches he brought the ball to the ... so I shouldn't have such a terrible way to lose some of the last ... and they had no chance Gillette Aaron Rodgers do the magic you almost certainly would have done but that\nHappens in sports and again like as the gentleman from Wisconsin from Green Bay just said you can trade him you can tell them that he's out for a game you can\nScream of in film session and make him watch in front of the team thirty nine times and then put them back on the field you can cut him what you don't do is you don't threaten him he's in his family I mean come on let's have a ... percent that perspective eight five five to one to four CBS dug in Green Bay pre shake Joe you're on CBS Sports radio\nAnd how they're going to put up\nA as well from my take on the whole ... thing um I don't feel that\nThey should have been threatened that they caught a like I stayed at basic Crosby adjustment for feral goes for us to have four weeks ago we plan to lions and technically if you think about it we lost that game by nine ... was ... so we were the one that I Do\nAnd you didn't hear anything about crowds they get caught or getting traded or that threats to family and that's why you don't talk to them as family I think everybody knows that I just don't feel that I'm a ... ... let them read deserve\nIt actually scares living crap out of me is one of those just crazy moment but first\nLet's dogs some sports eight five five to one to four CBS let's uh maybe put a bowl on this topic we're talking about time I gum or a his trade the frustration toward him the blaming does or doesn't shoulder for that Packers lost against the rams Dave in Green Bay thank you for listening about a year on CBS Sports radio\nYeah hey I just wanted to get your thought on this um you know what I'm thinking about the the last that we had a ranch and philosophy at back were Crosby mystified kicks you know we we can handle losses on these guys as much as we want to [noise]\nBut the fact is throughout the throughout those games we never got hardly past the red zone and as many touchdown because we needed\nSo we can shoulder the blame on these guys but when it comes down to it there was a few points difference and yeah Rogers Mitt may have made it down the field and we could have kicked she'll go to school to touch them to win but if we would have been able to score and more throughout the game it would've been a whole lot easier at the end\nThey totally agree I think the problem for time Montgomery is\nEnsue board a nation and the national football league can happen can't happen ever normally you would know about it normally a guy like time Montgomery would be in subordinate would bring the ball out when he's not supposed to hold on to the ball everyone say and then he would just get destroyed behind the scenes by coaches\nIf you're going to be in sport in it and carry the football where it's supposed to be carried a\nWhole lot of the football so it's not just like the coaches losing their mind is the board ... just like your show incompetent you're going to begin to subordinate and focus on the end of the game that I think the issue\nThat people are losing their minds here's a fun fact by the way and\nI bring it up in part because Mike mccarthy is on this list here are the odds for who is going to replace Hugh Jackson\nIn the long term in Cleveland the offshore betting on us in these habits listed on cars right scary plus two hundred so very likely to\nRamp quarterbacks coach Zak Taylor he's the favorite and I understand why but I'll say this everybody wants a little piece of that shine from the rams in ... and ...\nThat's a young guy and we don't know how much is McVeigh just doing it themselves like how much of it as McVeigh and how much of it as a similar thing to an eerie here things get really interested in it some of those late on the show but plus two fifty\nLincoln Riley obviously coach Baker Mayfield\nIn college I'm smothering there's a bunch of names um I I Believe McCarthy was plus twelve hundred by remember correctly which is twelve to one that's on the notion that he will get fire and then you'd have to get the job he'd be released from Green Bay and a lot who liked that idea here is the one that that is crazy or two that are crazy to me\nPlus twelve hundred which is twelve to one so it's not it's not likely but it's not fifty to one it's not sixteen and wants to have to Seventy five to one of the eagles were when they open last year and one of the super bowl twelve to one Sean ... they make they born in Dayton, Ohio\nWent to college in Miami University that is not a bad about the\nOnly other one that just blows my mind this is the one where I think if I was looking for a little\nBit odd not urban Meyer he's plus fourteen hundred I I wouldn't hire and fourteen to want fourteen to one Bill Belichick\nCoach the bronze back in the day and what you're really doing there if you're betting on ballot jak you're betting on the fact that the ugliness and the divorce and the the schism between

for one of your division rivals\nUh yeah I I hate them move for us but it's a good move for them or just gave them another weapon that we have to find\nAsked him how he would assess the team's lackluster start\nTo the NFL season is not the ideal start that we would have liked but ah you know the good\nThing about having a ... week right in the middle of our season is that we still have eight games to\nGo out there and proved a who we want to be as a team this year and still put ourselves in good position or you know being in the playoffs and then go from there\nYou've got some time to think it over but as you look back at the first half of the year and you look to the second half of the season what do you think your team needs to do differently to try and play better football\nUm you know that's something that we just have to evaluate internally um you know we have to do a lot of self scouting\nAt the end of the day we just have to go after him play we have to have the will in the heart or in the mindset that we won't lose when I was down when\nYou know a time when I was a huge John Ramsey fan Tom are you I'm\n... and there's a lot to answer you enjoy or is it okay doing the board while you're trying to take in the ... nature of June ... candid answers I'm a little distracted I got to say I know your ... your big big fingers of love\nWhere this is entering into to blame portals dumb things are going to join including competition began asking John Ramsey about his level of of confidence\nI Am confident and um you know you can say whatever they want to say but uh he's going to say leading the team you know we we got to help everybody from office and the fish that's what we plan on doing\nYeah it's ... it's just such an interesting turnabout and you know for for you it every players got their sort of on path to success and what they view as their path to success you train with your father rather than training with the team as a part of your process why is that for you the right way to go about getting ready for an NFL season\nOr just 'cause I mean those who is always going to be ready our life\nFor every new chapters of it in my life he's the one who's got me ready for so a lot of stress remains on him to continue to do that for me um and I can be back home with my family at the same time so it's kind of way with me\nAre your job is in large part to shut down opposing wide receivers can you give us a name or two of guys when you know that you're going to be lining up against them it's a particular challenge you know that's

make a big splash horse first game that got the injury on and then we have the two times a year\nAh we have been on the ground issues onshore on a mission of who I just had our son Jeffrey I'm sure I'm missing a few people but um\nYou always have a test after\nUsually going against a some really good receivers in them while she was a lady\nJust repeated so you can decide for yourself whether you think John Ramsey is full of it or not his answer to me I Believe morals was quote I Am confident him\nPeople can say whatever they are going to say but he's going to continue to lead the team and we've got to help them in close yeah people continue to say what they're going to say like they're confident him or he trash or he socks or he's garbage you know whatever the particular\nPerspective instead of that is true John Ramsey in our conversation earlier today also have to ask him and he actually was like a man really but I get them Missouri fans understand what it's like to get beat down\nAt the zoo was coming off its worst defeat in the history of a program in large part because it hired a person really tag or who deserve all the football karma that can come is way the bad kind
