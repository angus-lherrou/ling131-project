I think like tuned to every single week it feels like maybe some three months here and there\nI wasn't in our league do our league I I have a ... of the most points by the way of anyone in late July\nThe second most wow again at\nTrace 'em ... Ryan ...\nSure I'm not I'm not good at math um is one of three good or bad is how stupid like really good it was a really bad\nI Would say it's really bad is it like ... like a lot of expectation and disappointment that sounds pretty accurate guy the guy I just want to put in the context\nAnd be able to say that ... stews a weekend speaking of Clinton ... not a great beginning\nFor the Dodgers were\nFor their race they have gotten out of the first but not before Boston put not one but two runs on the board and\nIs a long series\nYou know I've been proven wrong many times before but this feels like\nHuge advantage of the red Sox entering the game and that for the Dodgers a turn the narrative and not just that\nTo overcome Vegas in everyone else's believe that Boston is a pretty big favorite you've gotta win game one because you're a ... he's taken the mound in its early it's one game is one inning\nMaybe crucial go six or seven or eight more ... and give them a zone we've seen that in those nerves and World Series but for a guy that has been\nVery much substandard relatives is remarkable regulars using career in the playoffs it has continued at least through one of the first game of the world series and the first time quitting girls ever pitch to Fenway Red Sox two daughters you\nKnow LA and we discussed this earlier really interesting and Boston both teams at the center of of sports excellence in this country right now\nDodgers Red Sox and the baseball side Celtics are by far the best team in eastern conference in the Lakers future's very bright it'll take a while for that to really be put together in the right in the right way but they have the most important building block and in the game in LeBron James and on the NFL's side we we know this patriots or the patriots and the rams are undefeated\nAnd so in that spirit in that vein\nI had the opportunity over on the TV show CBS Portage cue it's about six months old now CBS his\nBrand new streaming sports network twenty four hours kind of like Netflix can't find it on cable but it is an actual twenty four hour sports network I show over there it's called writer's block it's a short I host by myself five eastern to Pacific money to Thursday that we just opened a brand new\nYesterday a brand new operation in Stamford, Connecticut we've been based in Fort Lauderdale itself an operation there but we now the beautiful brand new studio in Stanford I I'm based out of ...\nYesterday a brand new operation in Stamford, Connecticut we'd been based in Fort Lauderdale we have an operation there but we now they're beautiful brand new studio in Stanford I I'm based out of so here I Do so in southern Manhattan south west part of Manhattan I'm where we did a radio show but\nThings are going to really see me as much as you should check it out it's very cool and I'm very lucky get some pretty big names on the show in comic ensue actually it was on the show today will plays interview tomorrow the on her junior on the show\nTomorrow we get some budding ... coming up hopefully in the next few weeks in markets cousins and I don't know his biggest star but do they own the game was really interesting had the chance to talk to him as well this week over on the program and just wanted to play some of the interview I thought it was insightful about the state of the NBA the Lakers and in\nThe position of al ... center in the late ... or service and talking to Jill\nJill muggy the Lakers big man told me how refreshing it is to be now in Los Angeles Laker\nWell maybe it's been very refreshing uh luxuries are great organization a historic organization and ah just being able to be a major contributor and hopefully a championship runners a mazer\nYou want to championships with the warriors are obviously a dominant basketball team what went on your decision to move on from Golden State and sign come to Los Angeles I'm\nA one two titles with the with the Golden State would go to the state and uh it was amazing in a great experience um and I just felt like it was time for me to explore gross democracy here [noise] um [noise] especially with it revamping itself I guess you just say\nSo in a look the fact of the brown was going to LA to I'm definitely didn't hurt so it was definitely opportunity for me to\nExpand my game I guess or Marlboro [noise] I'm In the NBA saw uh definitely [noise] um when I talked to Rob and I talk to them as you got felt like it was the right thing do\nYou know do you feel and I also talked about just this notion that brought it on the right you're you're not going to walk into a locker room\nWith a new group of guys especially of liberal\nAnd as the brawn James but have instant oatmeal which incidentally love love is anyway neither here nor there lots of it so\nHow long she thinks it's going to take this particular team to build the chemistry they need\nThem I don't think it's really a timeframe is just it's more of a commitment so\nThe sooner everybody buys in\nEverybody's committed to each other and the team and uh what's necessary\nUm then I feel like we'll jail perfectly and I'm not saying people aren't you made it right now I'm just saying we've only been together for a month so you can expect to be the Golden State warriors who've been running the same place at the same players for the past four or five years so\nIt's definitely going to be some hiccups um but we're working extremely hard you know ... from the our film we're just trying to get everything right and I feel like we're on the right track\nEarly in your career career in vale you were on some losing teams and the last couple of years you were part of one of the most dominant teams in the history of the NBA we asked this question athletes when they come on the show so I'll ask you\nHow important is it for a team and I just have talent like talented guy that actually like each other how important are the relationships on top of what teams look like on paper um\nI probably didn't realize this until I got to go to the state but the the chemistry off the court is\nJust as important as it can retreat on the court so it was going to stay there really made an emphasis of including everybody in doing group things and going to eat together and just things of that nature so that really counts when it comes on the court or just having each other's back\nAnd uh I feel like we were we're on the right steps for doing the same thing\nYou're listening to rider than you or me bill Ryder here on CBS Sports radio in my conversation with a veil muggy earlier\nOn the television program CBS Portage cues writer's block and yeah that's another one of my name is apologize up one of the things that that I think is interesting about about Vail McGee\nIs and this isn't actually my perspective but most people do LeBron James and Kevin Durant by far is the first and second best players in the NBA and they're both superstars obviously and so I wanted to know from the Lakers center\nThe similarities and the differences from his perspective between LeBron and Katie\nI mean I really can't go person ... just because I was with Katie for two years so I got to see\nEverything uh I've only play one game with ... and the rest of appreciating so I Can't really compare him as of now of similarities but definitely uh I just feel like\nKatie is more of a I'm going to show you through leadership and want to show you on the court in through my worst ... ethics or the bronze ... very very vocal\nAnd uh likes to communicate with everybody and get everybody on the right page and make sure everybody understands what's going on that's the only difference I've seen so far but I've only played one regular season game and the\nArts I Know it's early but what is it going to take to make the Lakers and warriors legit rivals in the western conference\nOwn commitment it would say that your memory for us to pick up our face measure our faces right ah do all the little things fifty fifty balls on\nRebounding on hidden shots or as one thing it specially defensively if we wanted to compare with the wars we have to defend the three and we also have to be able to shoot the three so\nEither way we have to make sure that we focus and um we have to make sure that we focus and make sure that everything goes the right way\nI mean do you feel McGee talking about the three point and it's important offensively into guard against defensively and that speaks to the fact that that has become the important part of the NBA gamesmanship and execution and\nThe center of position in the southern muggy talked about\nThree weeks ago has been phased out and so I asked a veil muggy what solution he sees for big men like

this is this is what\nEveryone knows happens in college basketball and I think that's why the noxious cause basketball about ... big money costs for this is about college football as well even though college football's not on trial here um so that's why I think\nAmericans sports fans is generally taken this with a big shrug just like whoa Oklahoma State offered a hundred and fifty thousand dollars

bring up a the amateur symbols and the judge is honest from them for that but that's not what this trial is about well\nMaybe not this specific trial but I think that is what big picture college basketball nice to have is like a public airing it whether it's in a court of law or\nYou know some sort of defeat system or something it's just more honest than just perpetuating the system that we have just you know as well as I Do amateurish them in a billion dollar industry it just doesn't make sense and that's what creates the black market to begin with\nRevolt great if you're on the show

I knew a bill cells in like Bill self you know bill self and like Bill self up\nWhat happens to bill self\nI like a lot of these coaches are like Rick Pitino I Know that's an unpopular opinions to say these days ... ... it was always very decent man to meet and that's all I can really judge 'em on um [noise] I think bill self if if the NC double a does what it\nProbably should do if it is standing by these amateur ... rules these antiquated and ... is there going to go after him like it's it is the\nThe fact that the FBI can give them\nThe FBI has subpoena power which the end subway does not and that's the biggest issue the NC double a or struggling with enforcement they can't just going to say we need to get all this information they have to rely on schools the compliant\nSchools are often complying especially if it makes it look bad if they're basically handed this information by the FBI saying you know this guy cheated and here's\nFoolproof fools it airtight information showing it\nI don't see how the NC double a can do anything other than go after him but it's so deep there's so many coaches involves so many schools involved so many players agents involved that it could if the ants he definitely does really stick by their immature ism rules then this is going to be a huge thing for the sport you see\nTen Fifteen twenty coaches either fired or having like major major

know what your what your thoughts on\nThe idea of a kid's going straight out\nYes correct yeah yeah I mean I\nSo I've always like I Love college basketball I covered it for a time and I\nOf all the sports that I've covered interestingly the people that are\nSources who I consider friends people I build actual relationships with\nOur college basketball coaches I count some of the people out there in the world is that for a living that I've gotten to know among the the really interesting and and and good people I've I've I've\n... my point is I Love college basketball but I Do think in America people should have a right to govern their living I tell the story a lot when I was in college I didn't have a lot of money\nAnd worked Israel but myself through school and my parents helped a lot and there was a time when I got called and offered a job I applied for an internship at a newspaper and they misunderstood an offer me a job and they offered me like twenty two thousand dollars a year twenty five thousand dollars a year in a small town in Florida\nAnd I want to take it my parents you know thank you mom and dad talk me out of it trust me buddy that's not as much money do you think it is\nAnd I made the right call but the point is I Can't imagine if someone is that you're not allowed to go you're not allowed to go I mean I Want to be a newspaper reporter right\nSo the New York times the Washington Post or whatever the Chicago Tribune for me it was just didn't want register because I grew up in Iowa had called me and said here's two million dollars a year to do your dream and the answer is no\nI have probably get my mind around that just in terms of what's right and fair in America so I hate the notion of these limitations even though I understand is good for code basketball\nAnd it's usually good for the athlete in question but part of this country part of what makes this country great isn't just the opportunity to succeed but the freedom to sail and to accept the consequences the decisions that lead to\nWhatever issues so I think young men who play at a high level should be able to go to the NBA I Love this Julie concept ... hundred and twenty five grand and you saw that recently\nCredible recruit Syracuse best recruited has has mellow\nWho\nSigned with close sports which is the bronze agency\nWas going to do the ... league and then got this new balance quote unquote internship for a million dollars a year a million dollars for one year and basically negotiated a deal in waiting for a fourteen million dollar new balance deal\nIf he hits minimum requirements and what that does\nAdams over so smart is it opens the doors\nTo undermining undercoat in college basketball enforcing the amateurs him off the table because people set in front of my age ... he said people they got it wrong what kids are gonna leave on her twenty five grand that isn't the point\nI don't think there's an observer point\nI think it's the opportunity to sign with an agent and see what's out there\nAnd the worst case scenarios you go to the G lead\nYou make a hundred and twenty five ... but the real risk for the NC double a isn't the G League now why a\nSeventeen year old superstar basketball player consigned was an agent\nAnd the worst case scenarios I'm gonna go make a hundred and twenty five grand ride the bus basically my only basketball bullet caught sports has shown no there's a whole new model and prepare yourself for because Nike or Adidas new balance all these apparel companies Under Armour\nAnd maybe even beyond are going to see what new balance is doing healing the next LeBron James or might say here's a five million dollar internships not legal\nHere's a ten million dollar internship Katie Katie poor too\nAnd that's what an agent does I was\nI get coffee up the street here\nIn New York and there's a really nice guy the the breach of their\nWe talk we shoot the breeze about sports and he's a stand up comic he's an actor right he's trying to break he tried to make like everybody is\n... you know he's a really good move to that I I'm a weird creatures of habit I go to the same place every single day you know the same thing and to want to just go somewhere else because the coverage of the street by Oliver eight months I'm like that guy that I Do that always ... anyway the guy got an agent today first time really exciting like very cool\nAnd I told him 'cause I have friends that have happened to that changes your it can change your life if you have a career that's a requirement\nIt opens doors you can imagine are there\nThat's going to happen to Seventeen year olds never had the opportunity and already happened to this young man just signed was an Asian the bronze age in this case and go out and find out

I Love it especially the fact that we're seeing so many of these teams\nOr ... you know mess things up in their conferences I mean what's the last time you ever think Kentucky\nWould be good and you have to see if they're out there are so they're not going to stay up there but just not being in the top of that was when I was a great story you know if you're tired of just Alabama and Auburn, Alabama or Georgia\nNow the FCC it's always on top of you to see teams like you know George was bad for a while there ... now they're coming back and they were powers to go to see you know Florida good again so quickly to see a good team\nBut everybody gave up on them the minute they lost I mean Georgia last right and they got smoke and then they just fell off the face of the earth day not\nGood but now you're having some votes you've come back down there it seems like ours they lose this was getting them back in the mix when they lost that one is like our well that's going to be all about and no one else but now some of these other talked to another conferences or ... I got an Earth like Oklahoma or they get them back in the mix to make some more exciting I mean even teams like\nYou know or like Washington state I was it's no longer just organist Stanford of the north it's not washing the Washington state or in the mix is good to see some of these other teams get in there and make\nThe only thing that do consider Washington in Washington state for the playoff\nNeither auto shop or they're probably gonna lose somewhat by this point to see them up there and\nI should say this week\nAnd a third that's got to talk for the fact well has absolutely no shot up ... the thing that will ... the thing that I Want to do that is that uh you know you're talking about\nGeorge illusion again I'm telling you they lost and no one talked about him ever again they're like thank you for coming and now they're doing instead of Ohio State losing and thanks for coming in stats are saying\nUrban Meyer is going to get fired so it didn't it didn't just lose

and the dolphins on Thursday night and age town John thanks for coming on a bench how you doing\nI'm doing well I'm watching a Red Sox beat the Dodgers in the world series after I'll watch the red Sox win for in a row over the Astros including ... met in ... park so I'm pulling for the Dodgers\nI Believe that after that are so let me ask you about um this about paying their pretty hot\nI pay me back to the point where it all started that lack close game at Indianapolis that day that they stole and then they didn't win and close friends ... cents or a three point gamut of cowboys I touched down when over the bills and then a day handled their business in Jacksonville I thought they look really impressive against the jags\nThey they began his season was seven point loss new like three point loss in Tennessee in a five point loss to the giants the only game the giants of one and he lived like\nGreat in that game I thought okay he lives back and he had done that sense and then they eat doubt it over time Indianapolis game which Frank rye made a controversial calls for help to them then they want\nOvertime game of with the cowboys that was a really big deal and used the news you can imagine and then they play Buffalo's I knocked out Josh Alan and still squeak by their deep bench playing great and then they go to Jacksonville where they were blown out forty five to seven in December\nWhen bottles through for three hundred twenty nine yards three touchdowns and no interceptions and of course he did not resemble\nThat at all in this game and they're deep and it's just been playing great led by walk cloudy tire net do they've got a lot of traveling on that side of the ball last two games they had\nTo win with defense special teams in the running game because shot Watson is playing hard and he said he's gone from drawing for at least three Seventy five three games in a row to not getting one eighty\nIn the last two because he only three twenty five twenty four passes because he's playing with us so many injuries\nSo they have a their divisional opponent or one more time each and its remaining schedule but all of those games are in Houston so I really liked their chances\nThey are usually they get those three teams at home and they played them overrode December\nThis year they've already got him out of the way on the road tendencies a nationally televised game in primetime\nJacksonville is the last game of the season the air which going into this season I thought\nMight be for the day of the south and then I picked Jacksonville too wet and uh so there is a favorable schedule is the toughest game and even though Philadelphia is losing they have to go there a\nBank on December twenty third that's right and uh\nThe eagles could with the NFC ease the way it is the eagles could be competing for the title with Dallas Washington and so that looks to me like Texas game they got one coming up\nNext week against Denver and uh but they the get tough is the way the first game which was a trip to George stadium where they've never want\nYeah I think Don McLean one is from the chronicle in Houston I thank God Denver's miserable I actually think they attach ends up top game at FedEx or the Redskins they seem to show up for every game that there and\nAnd then they got the brown calls at ... go to the jets go to Philly you write that will be a top game but I've seen belly and plug it Rob Seventeen nothing on Caroline and blew that game last week so tell me how is the shot and watch and getting it done like playing with a collapsed\nLungs and well it's a it's a partially a deflated lung and the ... the bad one has broken ... ... bruises rare bagging any\nHard to do anything including brave\nAnd show partially collapsed long kept his book will fly you separate the injury against cowboys win three three hundred Seventy five yards and he ran ten times got obliterated trying to run in ... in the red Sox\nAnd he didn't know what he had so you have to go two weeks before you can fly that's why I took a luxury\nCoach ride down interstate\nAnd he didn't do what he had so you have to go two weeks before you can fly that's why I took a luxury\nCoach ride down interstate tend to Jacksonville and he'll be able to fly to Denver next week and but that ... I just don't know why does it he hasn't thrown as much he's run a few times not as much as he did\nAnd I wrote a column tomorrow about all the players talking about how much he inspires them the way he is playing through pain\nI mean they really are a ... it would appear to me turning into a a really solid football team\nOr not just that they are in a row but I loved their pizzas like\nHopkins is so unbelievable how crunches this guy's doing it all for them and and frankly you know I like uh all of their receivers everybody Kiki I like ... and uh everyone on that team they're throwing it to even Lamar Miller\nThere this guy's just spreading it out I Love all these guys and the numbers are putting up\nHad they just had a better off into line they might have won a couple of those gates wives and may not have been in his much he's face more pressure\nThan a quarter back in the NFL solemn NFL match ups today on ESPN\nAnd he's got they want him to get rid of the ball quicker he'll hold the ball trying to wait for seniors like Hopkins will fuller Kiki cutie a talented slot receiver who's a rookie he's out with a hamstring injury but he's got talent trying to make lives down the hill and boom\nYou know he'll gets much ... and so they're working with him\nTo get rid of the ball quicker throw it away lifted another play don't run as much as he's gone to slide or go out of bounds and his explanation when he does that to them as\nYou know coach I'm trying to make played it helps us win and it's hard to argue with that though and the other hand he's a he's still in a rookie as far as games started and he's having to learn the hard way about getting rid of the ball and protecting yourself\nJohn Glen and a great writer from the Houston Chronicle on a bench ... tell me what do you think of how J. J. salmon sacks coming off the injury again ah he's doing it all as usual and cloudy as well as ... I Love the pressure they're putting on quarterbacks and in my pocket\nI mean you've got to get rid of the ball against the football team or you're going to get rung up\nWhy is back playing the way played when he won his great defensive player you're wards clown is playing for a new contract he missed the game earlier and then he has been a little inconsistent and lately he's been\nHe's been very dynamic they move them around those same up down inside outside sometimes he's standing up over the centered passing situations so everybody has to be ready for him to rush she's also always played the run great\nHe told us two years ago I've always been better against the runs in the fast\nAnd but he's showing now he's also get NAFTA quarterback he's got his hands on a couple of quarterbacks multiple times he could have seven or eight sex right now at the made them that they got him and walk with the Marshall is coming off his best game they got some play makers on defense and the guy that's evidence best season\nIn his nine years ... Jackson in the last year his contract they moved in from cornered ... making so many big place because of injuries they lost four corners and the first six weeks they had to move in back to corner\nAnd uh he has been tremendous better than any time in his career\nAnd Matthew had started he's got a couple of pigs he's starting to come into his own with this team you know like you did in Arizona I think he's a starting to become a rock star for the tax and\nThey love him he's been a tremendous leader he makes a lot of speeches to them they listen to him he's a they don't move him around\nThey keep him back let him keep his eyes on the ball and the player\nHe had a second an interception in Jacksonville he's still fitting come feeling comfortable Romeo Cornell system and he stayed healthy that is the main thing about tower and Matthew and all Caesar was the first time he didn't have to rehab\nA from a surgery and quite a while and he said it's made a heck of a difference and their top draft choice they didn't have pigs in the first two rounds\nBecause Watson and Ali Wilder trades and so\nUh Justin rate from Stanford was the topic and he's a he's a starter safety is really good\nSo what do you think of a how ironic that ... coming back to face some hair on this Thursday night game or after eight 'cause he was just dreadful in Houston and but he's really good I thought that surprisingly I Am stunned at the last\nChildren has been the mission of save the children for nearly a hundred years so when tragedies like Hurricane Florence strike they're prepared and they're on the ground for children and their families around the world and writes you were at home\nWhen your partner would save the children you can send love and care and essential for children and families including baby wipes cribs toys and books learn more at W.

banks judge thanks your honor that I'm sure that'll protector\nAnyway can you imagine after all of that after all of the months that we talked about that that that guy are you kidding me at the end of the day he painted two hundred and eighty nine dollar ... they are assigned and he got a disorderly conduct you know that as it might take on a league in public\nThat's already got for after all of that\nSet it two months ago still saying NOW News going to go away just like it\nNobody talks about it anymore if blip than today because that happened\nBut in terms of that ad urban Meyer all that stuff\nWhen he cares about him and his wife they only care that ah there's a story now that Ohio states are coaches in trouble right\nNow but all that stuff that was driving everybody crazy and in August and for good reason at all it's gone to\nA guy just a wrote me a letter or whatever email just now are messenger whatever he said that um I mean I I don't have it in front of me so I don't know and and not so many words that it wasn't about the um it wasn't a he's not getting in trouble or getting fired or having these problems\nBecause of the uh Purdue last it was how badly they lost that ... right now the guy that learn as\nJust like last year at Iowa right the same same thing it's not that they lost in a bad day last that he should be fired for spoiled Ohio\nAre there that as the I mean they really are they take that came down day in college but ...\nI think that they're up there now they might be at the top\n... they really do take that gag think everybody's out to get 'em and who's following it on Saturday and ran a West Lafayette is that my\n... ... ... whose father ... they they got to have somebody\nWho you know blame this week that I don't even think they play it as we do they\nI I actually think they're off after that beating they deserve to be off\nAm I wrong I can be wrong\nYeah they are off this week they play at Nebraska next week\nOh the beating they're going to actually cruise into into the Michigan winning game\nOr their home for Nebraska Bob God it will be even worse\nThan you know that's just automatic what that's going to be that just going to be a that's a bumbling waiting to happen do you think don't win at Michigan State\nYes they're going to cruise to Michigan\nYeah 'cause if Michigan can beat him what do you think ah Ohio State will do it on\nI think you're going to get to a big showdown that everybody wants yeah\nDoes Michigan Michigan set up like Penn State right they still have one tough game they play them or any\nMichigan as Penn State or next week not this we have to get\nThrough that I don't know if they definitely will\nI mean let's put it this way there's no denying that Penn State can play with anybody\nThey can score with anybody they're going to be in the game no matter what like they were in big trouble last week in Bloomington they still won the game right because they put up thirty three they can score against anybody so I think in the Penn State or Michigan game everybody will get to Michigan automatic cause it to the big house but I Am expecting in that game a lot of points\nAnd uh you know the Michigan events are so good right that that you would think that they'd be able to stop\nPenn State I have a hard time believing that right there you know\nThey've stopped everybody but that's the one team that can score on anybody is Mick sorely in Penn State I think they'll that game's going to be somewhere in a range of and I'm not a a points guy were you I Do totals in anything I think that's going to be a game and the you know twenties in the between the twenties and thirties they're both going to score they're gonna\nHave Michigan's going to have the score to beat Penn State and Penn State's gonna have to score and more obviously to win the game on the road in a Ann Arbor then they would anywhere else but that defense is so good when they put up forty and fifty against everybody thirty dragons Indiana was up was basically a let down game for them\nThey usually score fifty or more so let's say a ... there's no way they're doing that against that defines but they I still think they can put it on twenty eight or thirty\nAgainst them because they're that good they score a lot right there fast\nThey have talent they speed\nAll this I think they can put the ... but but ah Michigan has proved otherwise they do not let anyone score on him right I mean you look at the numbers it really is I think that the the turning point in their season for me Carver\nI was really a\nWin Michigan was down Seventeen at the half right or whatever at Northwestern and then they never let 'em score again since the northwestern game are they gained Twenty one to Maryland Thirteen to Wisconsin and seven to Michigan you notice how it's getting better every week look at it in Nebraska fifty six ten they the northwestern never score and after\nHalf Maryland they blew out Wisconsin they blew out\nAnd it never ask if any six ten they the northwestern never scorn after the half\nMaryland they blew out Wisconsin they blew out and help them to third date at Michigan State held on to seven so they're getting into that November type of defense where they're going to not let you score against them although I Do think Penn State and Ohio State will score on Michigan\nThey've had to bad have of defensive football the whole season first half against Notre Dame first half against North West because the second half of that Notre Dame game a Michigan right all the second half of that

L. games\nYou gave this guy that ball late in a game trailing and a chance to win\nAnd there's like a minute\nThen I have two minutes left I mean it's to me it's the most dangerous way to make a living if you ban against that guy you're going to get burned a that was incredible last week if you ask me down Seventeen nothing to the super bowl champs and he wins the game Toni one Seventy and it really was incredible and the fourth quarter what they did\nAnd he's now passed apparently Aaron Rodgers um\nRivera set idea is overload because of his style of play it's not a\nProlific Sally runs the ball extremely well he's not a pure a pocket passer although there are elements of this game where he plays very well from the pocket as far as uh exactly where successful for a quarter comebacks comes from ... says it's his desire to when he wants the ball\nA fourth intend bass that he made the door I spent ... he was in the air being tackled to create a little more time to join it made the cut and for him to stand there and take that it finished the delivery is just outstanding and it really is [noise] uh I just can't believe\nWhat he's been able to do I listen I got to tell you I'm a huge fan of this guy\n... the way place okay so I don't really like his whole a pact with the you know a Superman and the and the you know\nThe closing the fashion statements and the outfits and all that after games before games he's trying to be this red carpet celebrity and all this other stuff that doesn't do it for me it\nReally doesn't um but you know I'm sure he he gave a rat's ass or what anyone banks he's clearly a beach to his own drum I'm not a fan of that stuff but I Am a huge fan of his uh his ability or I just think he is so much fun to watch\nI think he's a really one of the most exciting players in a league I think he's a brutal to you know go against\nAnd to beat 'em you know he's already been to a Super Bowl last but listen this guy can flat out play uh I never stopped talking about him on the show because I just think he's so exciting I mean it just I constantly am watching this guy do amazing things and it\nReally bothers me to be honest with you that it goes unnoticed I think it does I don't think anyone gives them the attention he deserves\nFor uh the performance was that he puts on he's a game or a man that dude is flat out a gamer and you know all they do and this week is talking about really Tom Brady Aaron Rodgers right and Drew Brees that's all they talk about who started talking about\nI mean Philip Rivers does this every year these amazing numbers and yards and touched down to the games he plays he is that guy\nIs worth watching every Sunday blaming you if you're if you live in San Diego or you live in LA and you can appreciate what Philip Rivers brings to the table I got to tell you that to me you're you're you're missing something because the guys flat out good\nBut they never talked about it than ever talk about it but now they're talking about the homes now he's the new flavor of the month everyone talks he's the greatest quarterback everybody's going to the hall of fame they're already making his Boston can\nAnd he has been incredible\nAnd go off they don't talk about am either that or you know they say he's yeah he doesn't even matter like it's all a girly and that deep bonds and uh you know but the who's the guy providing all these guys\nCooks and top and all of them even though cuts injured God sullen throwing the ball he's the one saying he has no love either it's Brady is Aaron\nYeah I'll say this I Love Milan luge age I think he's tough I think they need him on that theme to protect frankly uh their investment and David they gotta have somebody around they're nasty enough to break someone's nose and luge age or will step up first in that department so look\nAh [noise] they have been exciting really had said at him once right they made the playoffs and they were exciting once and they still lost so he's got a lot to accomplish yet and a lot to prove to me before a I'm giving them all these accolades guys at the end of the day really done anything\nHe's just the fastest player and a leg and he scores a goal is because of the speed but his team hasn't done jak so until they start winning playoff series I mean I'm Talking about not even a Stanley Cup I'm Talking about just went in a

career\nUh before I made the jump to network my last stop was Providence and so in two thousand four I did a lot of trips to Fenway Park from Providence and covered the red Sox the year that they

IVs and everything else he was extremely weak for a couple of days and it was charted that you could see on social media you could hear about on the broadcast that\nThrough the four innings he pitched his velocity dropped\nHe allowed\nThree runs on five and he did have seven strike out he started strong and I had a strong for dating a couple of walked in there as well I didn't last long enough to get the win but there's some concern about Chris and about how he's pitching right now\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert you have to be and it's a waning won ... million winner reported so far for the one

Wednesday officially in Boston Raphael turns to twenty two but in the morning noon yeah she was the guy who was on the bench in available for Cora\nWhen they needed that right handed bat against Alex would in a seven day and you hear a joke is typically own with a couple of the big hits from gave one of the world series on the red Sox radio network Boston doubles up the Dodgers eight to four and takes the one oh seriously it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio\nYou can find me on Twitter Ala radio if you were at the game I'd love to hear from you or do you want to send your

after hours with Amy Lawrence\nLed to welcome bend writer who was at Fenway Park and it's working on his story for Sports Illustrated to be published in the morning Ben thanks so much for a couple of minutes what was the last\nYou can remember and it's postseason mettle move Alex core a maid didn't work out for the red Sox\n[laughter] it's been a while I I mean I Wish I knew what Alex ... numbers were for tonight mega mega millions drawing really pushing\nAll the right button of course\nPushed another one tonight pinch hitting a ward of New Year's to hit a three run bother to put the game out of reach here in the bottom of the seventh inning Alex would really everything this guy does seems to work out but I think there might be an underlying reason for it I think that is roster is just so deep\nAnd so talented as do many players who can come in and do great things as an order new news that night\nIt's interesting to the trust that has developed with a guy who is a first year manager because new and yet typically would have been in the starting line up against a lefty and Clinton cursed shop but instead\nHe kept on the bench and Cora tells them I'm going to need you more than likely I'm going to keep you here because we need you to come in and potentially pinch hit and yet these guys don't seem to balk at it they accept their role and they and they trust their manager\nCertainly and that's the type of manager that the red Sox were looking for this off season one who could get that trust from his players or who the players corrupted the have the authority to make the call and to make the right call certainly that happened again tonight\nWhat did you see with Chris Sale\n[noise] oh I mean look this was billed as\nOne of these kind of like classic game one match up a spill again curse a didn't turn out that way both of them lasted only four innings a bill it's All right you know he's facing a tough line up\nUh they made them work really hard Matt ... great ape pitch at bat against him that ended with a home run over the monster uh one thing you can say is I think Phil ... pitch quaint and curse a kind of another playoff thinker for curse a U.S there are only four innings fire earned run\nYou know that ended up ... all that or the red Sox needed in this state for when\nBen writer covering the world series for Sports Illustrated he's also the author of astro ball the new way to win at all with us here after hours on CBS Sports radio\nI it's rare anymore that we see a quality storage by a starter I in in the postseason it's not just the world series were both these guys are gone before it out in the fifth inning but it's just become the norm and\nHave you got the point yet where hey it feels it feels like it's new school and starters now going into the seventh inning it's old school\nIt's old school but it's still with the managers would prefer you know I mean\nRobert yesterday said that he felt like you for starters who could make life a little easier for them but he didn't necessarily want to have to match a ball or as he did tonight it every reason to believe that curse a could go deeper into this game\n... the fact that they're willing to go to these relievers early I guess is a new school type of development\nThis game ... the fact that they're willing to go to these relievers early I guess is a new school type of development Bullock what are you going to do in your starter gives up five or ... runs over for or against the highest scoring often than the league I think that a day of Robert ...\nI heard the word relentless a lot to describe the red Sox are known only from ... in the A. L. C. S. against the Astros but also in tonight's broadcast I happen to listen to some on the radio they drop the word as well what are couple of ways that you would describe the red Sox all fence\nYeah I mean certainly relentless is the best one you don't get any breaks even where you think are going to get them we saw with Jackie Bradley junior did put away the after the last round tonight it was up and down the line up for the red Sox again yet and bending handy with four hit from the people and then Sandy Leone with a single\nGuy had a few minutes in a game and something like five months or even if he had to single against the Dodgers tonight look it was the best scoring often in the league of for a reason and we saw it against the night\nRyan ... inherited some runners when he came in to relieve cursed shah in advance and he only gave up one heads up and he did have a walk and there was a wild pitch in there and so it was a bit of a rocky inning for him but thinking about these two bull pans which one do you think has the advantage if starters don't go deep\n[noise] ah it seems like it's the red Sox right now um but I don't think that it's in a vacuum again I think you have to look\nAt all I Know and just the red Sox let it doesn't make it easy on anybody whatsoever so it's really a combination of the factors you do have to think though if you get into one of these late game situation in which both starters or out as we said we're going to see those again of the red Sox have the advantage\nFrom Sports Illustrated and from Boston after game one of the world series Ben writer with us here after hours on CBS Sports radio so I heard\n... told me that the standing room only seats\nAlong the first base slide at Fenway where they do try to cram as many bodies and it's possible those standing room only seats cost fifty one hundred dollars I don't I don't know if they got their money's worth or not but how would you describe the atmosphere inside Fenway Park for what is there for the world series in Fifteen Years\n[laughter] they're ready for another one oh for sure I don't know if I would've paid that much\nPersonally Sammy neither on a four and a forty degree\nNight here in Boston a withering early on a but certainly there are hungry for another one uh and it got pretty loud after at or nearing you put them ahead for good\nDid you see any Dodger saying oh I'm trying to think\nI think that's a couple of blue hats\nHere and there but there are few and far between that's for sure develop like when Tony Ken I'm Sorry Tony can't match camp in the home run that I heard some cheering but maybe it was just like oh oh\n[laughter] it could've been hard hard to hear those in the rural\nWell water will no longer smell or stand your fixtures city water will be purified of harmful chlorine led arsenic and chemicals way home solutions provides the cleanest healthiest water at every faucet satisfaction guaranteed for more information coal one\nEight eight eight nine seven three wave one eight eight eight nine seven three W.

know\nWouldn't believe\nMe [laughter]\n[noise]\nIt remains to be seen exactly\nHow this this trade hands out for both the Dallas Cowboys and the Oakland Raiders because we don't know who that number one draft pick will be for Oakland we don't know what will happen moving forward with either jak or Cooper or the office\nPaper it was worth making the trade I'm all in on the cowboys making this move\nI Believe that that Cooper can change the office and a variety of ways\nIs the opportunity to the cowboys need to evaluate that Prescott\nYou know write as much as I Do the jury is still out on jak is he going to be\nThe face of the franchise moving forward is he going to be the quarterback of the future for\nThe cowboys going to move on from him once his rookie contract does that are they going to pay him like a starting quarterback in the NFL which right now the going rate is between twenty five and thirty million dollars a year\nThey cannot evaluating jak Prescott until they give him another receiver because the last time he had started to throw to reliable experience target\nThe cowboys were Thirteen and three and he had what twenty three touchdowns versus foreigners sessions and so it's not possible to evaluate him and his decision making and\nHim as a signal color for the cowboys if you don't give him a number one wide receiver which is a kind of a hidden reason to make this move for the cowboys it's after hours with anymore it's on CBS forge radio\nI'm Ari Cooper showing up now with the ... for the cowboys but he was showing up for the first time with the facilities and getting a tour on Tuesday\nIs great you know storage furniture in order came just walked through the place you know to a great place for a moment ... ... ... was\nImagined Cooper's a little bit\nGun shy like whoa is that young guy who is still just twenty four years old the cowboys are certainly one of those franchises that elicit all\nThree first round picks next season for the Oakland Raiders before I'm already Cooper this as a new lease on life\nHe's got twenty two catches two hundred yards and a touchdown and as six games I haven't heard that he got officially cleared from concussion protocol but they're coming up there by week in Oakland uh and his helmet to helmet hits was back when they were in London so let's hope that's the case and he can get right to work with the cowboys\nTrying to come in and you just hope the cowboys you know when more games or wherever they are going to accomplish that you know hard working a guy I was going to come in every day and you know doing into you know we're really extremely hard to be the best I can be and be the best team made a documentary\nFor that's what the cowboys should expect from a large Cooper into his fourth season the Alabama product\nSitting down with the media for the first time in those soundbites come from cowboys dot com it's after hours with Amy Laura's on CBS Sports radio\nHead coach Jason Garrett was a guest on our Dallas affiliate one five three to fan I Know a lot of you listen and we've got tons of calls from cowboy fans not just in Texas but a lot of you in the Dallas Fort Worth Arlington area wanting to weigh in on this trade over the last twenty four hours and\nJason Garrett is now telling you exactly what he thinks of Cooper and this isn't just because of the train he's he's had this opinion of Cooper for quite a while we know\nPeople well Alabama really highly regarded by the people that are around them on a daily basis or both as a player and as a person at the same same report for people around them a pro football so he's twenty four years old he has a lot of physical ability to get help listeners out for the right kind of guy or bring your football team\nAnd to me that's huge that age that age factor is uh to me one of the major selling points to make this trade because more than likely the cowboys were going to draft a receiver in the first round or make a high draft\nFor our receiver in two thousand Nineteen but you've already got\nA young receiver in fact Cooper still under his rookie deal he's got the rest of this year so you're not just renting in front of the end of this year plus next year his options already kicked in and he's only twenty four which means he's going into the prime of his career he still has plenty of miles left on those legs\nBut he's already got some wisdom and experience he already fans of gives me already understands how the NFL works and what it means to be a pro football player there's a learning curve like there would be for our broker a broker it's definitely helped show where the brain about don't light up\nHe knows what it means to be a pro but he's still under that rookie contract which means the cowboys also has been time to decide how he fits in but he's he's impact was immediate when he joined the raiders\nAs a fourth overall pick in two thousand Fifteen he had to back to back pro bowl campaigns and if you look deeper into his stats which I did with my column\nNot only what the aids in the NFL and receiving yards and she doesn't sixteen members that was the years but the raiders were challenging for an AFC by and Derek car was MVP candidate until of course he broke his leg\nBut Hoover was ace in the NFL that year and yards and he was Seventeen and both receptions and targets and he was the youngest by far he was the youngest featured receiver any NFL and so he's already got so much experience wrapped in even though he's just twenty four years old\nFive PM it'll be

questions\nAfter hours where they ... on your CBS Sports radio I feel like they're always food questions that's okay we love to talk about food around here in Star Wars that you're interested in my solo review okay\nI Can't be jumping the gun I got away from producer ... ready set go\nAmy I'm asking you to review so\nThat was a statement not a question to the way is is this from you or is this from someone else's from me uh okay cool well we're just talking about yeah though I didn't catch you two words after that the uh\nThe viewing of solo which I I did while I was folding laundry and well my dog was a beauty parlor on Saturday was a couple of minutes a quiet and like I have to watch this movie before the game seven of ... and all the stars and the football they Sunday\nIt was highly entertaining I really thought it was it was fine them so it didn't feel much like a star wars movie to me that there were fewer\nFewer direct references to the star wars franchise is though you could tell that the young actor playing Han Solo had definitely studied the iconic character because he dropped in a few of the lines and he also you could tell was trying to mimic the ... the mannerisms that Hans solo I'm Harrison Ford made so iconic\nBut it didn't feel much like a star wars movie to me except for the millennium falcon I Would say my favorite part was how he ... met that was awesome the way they develop their friendship their relationship and became lifelong partners that to me was the best part about\nPlus Darth mall and that's what I texted ... whatever you don't throw your hands up in the air there Isaac you haven't seen it yet but you don't get to be protected from spoilers my favorite guy well good he's in the movie but he's not in a very long and you're left to wonder was\nAlso there was an anxious there with the storyline about the the woman from his past and and that made me really sad but then I thought what was she now going to turn into a ... is that kind of the idea we don't actually know but yeah the the Woody Harrelson role awesome and I jumped\nWhen he died I won't say how he died well I guess what every now and he died uh I I went no\nHan Solo shot him it was such a surprise\nThat I was like whoa I jumped out at my feet but yeah I don't the movie with really good again I felt very disconnected to the star wars franchise but it for two hours of entertainment why not I bet it was fantastic on the big screen I just saw it on my own TV but I bet it was amazing uh in in a surround sound on the big screen so I liked it\nDo we have like an official like one out of four stars are five and three because\nAgain it wasn't because of my love for Star Wars that I loved the movie it kind of stands on its own um though I did appreciate that you buy a part of the things I'm putting just even if you know nothing about Star Wars it would've been a fun movie it was action packed it was really fast paced some great cinematography and very dark at times too\nUm but yeah I really I enjoyed watching it and to finally understand the crimson dawn storyline that got\nUm revealed at the end yeah that was good\nFor his fall perfect Saturday Night with the family at home just need some fun to watch\nYeah ... except that in mind was pre college football pre game seven because I had to work on my sports so it's kind of weird to watch a movie in the daytime I don't normally do that but I thought it was good it was kind of a cloudy darker day because\nThere was rain so what happens so we'll start with the pure who writes dear Amy very dramatically you think the prices of tickets for sporting events have gone out of control and if you do what would you do to ...\nWell I don't think you can fix it I mean this is the United states of America this is capitalism it's supply and demand so as long as people are willing to pay the prices for the tickets are well then obviously owners and stadiums uh they're they're going to continue to get what they can get at at the gate\nAnd I don't know that you need to change what I Will say is if you if you don't want the prices to go up for that what would have to happen there would have to be empty seats at the park\nBut as long as there are people willing to buy them ... you know it's it's does suck right because then you go and if you want to take a family of four you're talking about a couple of hundred bucks depending on where plus\nThe parking always gets me then the concessions I usually take my own sacked I hardly ever buy anything it stadiums um I Try to smuggle in waters generally when you go into a press pass you can get away with smuggling some stuff in\nThe press box or in your bag\nBut yeah I Know it's hard I mean it's hard to to fork over that kind of money if you have to drive any length of time or maybe want to fly to a particular game it's expensive generally there are ways you can get cheaper tickets\nAre sometimes on the secondary market or you wait till the last second um or you know you go in on a season ticket package with a group of people sometimes that's a great way to be able to get into two or three games 'cause most teams will have\nLet's say in case of baseball a Fifteen game package or thirty game package so you buy in and and you get a better rates and the access to better seats to splurge every now and then to be sure maybe it's like a once a year thing you\nGo and he splurge and you really enjoy it so Kevin using birthday present sorry that's I think that's a good idea to have been using the hashtag ask

Saudi Arabia who do you think about his comments\nWell I think you you never know where are the wind comes down I mean it's kind of had an unholy alliance with Russia and an oil alliance with Iran and then he says he's against Russia and Iran issue down a Russian airplane this guy's allegiances change every day for whatever's going to give them a moment of power and\nLook Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two polar is right now in the Muslim world in the middle east and that bothers or the one he wants to lead the middle east and and uh\nAnd so I think he sees this as an opportunity in my estimation to take Saudi Arabia down a peg to probably get some concessions from um including some economic concessions and reassert himself is kind of the dominant power in the middle east the reality is though\nHe has no moral ground stand on sure he doesn't murder journalists in the fashion of Saudi Arabia dead and again\nWe need to be very clear and condemning this evil back but he's not he's not you know some you know St Mary himself either me a couple of hundred journalists in jail and we had a pastor in jail for goodness sakes off a sham trial\nA congressman ... you know with a lotta times Congress takes the lead you guys did neuron during the Obama years what is going what is going to be the the backlash from this apparent killing a brutal killing of cars Yogi what do you what are you guys talking about proposing\nWell this is where you get into the internal politics and I think it's important to talk about this you know some of these people that are calling for cutting off arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nYou know basically the strategic real I'm going away from Saudi Arabia or the same people that were doing it the ... before this even happened this has been their foreign policy goal like I mentioned Rand Paul he's always wanted to X communicate Saudi Arabia and frankly get us out of the world it's fine he believed that but I think it's important to know\nSo yeah you're going to have these groups in Congress that have always been this kind of anti Saudi more pro rainy and they you know they love the Iran deal\nThat are going to try to take advantage of the situation I think it's important for us to say things like travel bans on anybody associated with this certain sanctions against you know the regime but at the same time we can't completely re aligned ourselves in the middle east away from Saudi Arabia because of this\nYeah I Know I was just struck by Lindsey Graham and Bob Corker to defenders of a ... relationship feel personally taken a personal front because this happened and you just wonder as brutal citizen it's nonsensical and you don't want to think about it why the Saudi Arabia I think they can get away with it that's what I find it following\nYeah yeah and that's where that's where I'm blown away is is you know this idea and this is why he don't suppressed journalism right it's because\nUltimately if you try it's going to backfire on you know the idea that the Saudis thought they could murder you know their own citizen but a resident of the United states in\nIn Turkey is ridiculous and it's going to backfire on him and I hope\nAnd this is why I'm for pretty intense punishments on this because I Hope it prevents us kind of behavior in the future but again I think before you know everybody sits back and says gee we need to just you know cut Saudi Arabia off the map and become best friends with Russia and Iran and everything in Turkey but look at what some of these countries do them before we you know bill sanctimonious\nYour reaction to the suspicious device as it were a route to Obama or Obama camp to Clinton house and now CNN\nYeah we don't you know we don't know who sent 'em awful if no matter what the situation is ah I Wish we could just get back to having good spirited debate instead of confronting Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz in a restaurant you say and you need to confront um at gas stations and fight people and push back to their face\nBecause ultimately are going to have you're just going to have a huge mess that is not good for our institution democracy\nCongressman or how concerned are you what changes if you're in the minority\n[laughter] oh man everything I'm you know sometimes you sit back and yet you imagine how Nancy Pelosi would be a speaker I mean imagine every Trump official in front of every committee every day\nUh being attacked and asked for everything and and ... and they would but he is the Trump Administration and Maxine Waters and the chairman and Jerry ... Adler is a chairman I mean I'm really just it gives me chills up because\nYou know and I think you know what is it due to the confidence of the economy people read the economy has grown ups because people feel free to take a deep breath and invest or if you got this Nancy Pelosi regime on the horizon a I think people are going to hold back some guys get out and vote even if you hate your Republican congressman\nClaiming asylum or refugee status en route are here and you may have the possibility staying here and less you get rid of that message down south\nThe flow of immigrants is going to continue ... continue\nHow bad is it down there I mean our our people ... is is typical of sent to America economically struggling with bad leaders who don't do anything in the population once overrun by gangs is there any different in twenty teens and we've with us on two thousand nine\n[noise] no it's not and you know that but that's the thing is the message the messages if you come here and you can claim I'm a refugee or asylum status because of that um then you should come\nNow everybody I mean if you're saying eighty percent of the people are are male military age males coming up\nI mean how many of them have ill intent how many of them have a background I'm In that same violence that they're fleeing I mean that's where the the problem with the borders going to happen is we're going to have to fat out close to ten thousand people\nKnow you mentioned I was a whistle blower my biggest thing was about the whole vetting of these adults with children harrowing and are we going to a potentially have um two to three thousand DNA kids ready to go when we're down there I mean it's just it's just going to be a complete mess\nAbsolutely use our quarter she's actually in Guatemala and this is what you saw a cut Eighteen\nWe ran into people that were part of them is Thirteen it appeared that there were other people as well goal for very different group that would move Norman amount of now we were there to greet basically the way people crossing from Honduras and divide them all I was right on the border\nI can tell you what I saw were very few women and children and any normal pronounce it man\nThat's what you see so and that's what's going to be at our doorstep how hard is it going to be to get that next dead next nine hundred miles with a with a you know basically with sandals on\nIt they they can do it I mean I Believe me they can do it and I'm sure they're going to um there's trains that they're going to be running into soon ...\nUm there's other transit court orders I mean are they going to be linking up the smugglers there's ways to make it to the border it just depends on how much time do we have to prepare I mean if they're a thousand miles away we need the Ford deploy\nAssets down to the McCown area that we have Fort Sam Houston is right there which is great big military base um but we need to really start moving assets in place the border patrol will get overrun by ten thousand people\nAnd they're helpless I mean they were almost victims in this because ... politicians can't get out of the way and also I saw you know we have Tom Homan who used to run I said the for the most part twenty percent of everybody that crosses has a criminal record\nSo you got to deal with some form of the people who are trying to mix in the Washington Post talked to two people that have been through five or six times and they using the caravan as cover to try to get back again here\nWhy wouldn't they Brian I mean when I was in a border patrol um and when I was with ice you know one thing is like when I was let's say it was in a border patrol and I caught a group of ten ... ten you could say at least you had a criminal history that was verifiable now what about people that do not mean vetting as great people left talking about betting but\nIf you've never if you're a criminal and you've never been encountered by law enforcement then you're not going to have a criminal history so we don't know if you're in the area so I mean this is just it's mind boggling\nYeah here's a Mollie Hemingway I think she reflects the sentiment in this country Katrina\nThink there's a lot of room for disagreement on the immigration debate and you have people who\nYou know who covered the spectrum there but the idea that there aren't national security concerns with immigration policy or economic concerns that immigration policy I actually just something that a lot of Americans agree on and when they see something like that and I can't imagine a better visual\nFor Donald Trump's argument that we need to have secure borders and orderly immigration policies and understanding of national sovereignty that that does not allow just literally the flooding of people over the border\nAnd he used to be unanimous I mean we have ... we have rock Obama Chuck Schumer all saying we have to have border security Jason this you must have seen this what happened why it was only one party convicted on this\nI don't understand I mean ... ... I Believe both parties can agree that there are legitimate or refugees and a legitimate asylum claims within that group it's the other part of the group that we need to be concerned about and it's not a\nIt's not calling out I'm like hey you know calling fire this there's actually legitimate bad people within that group I guarantee it\nUm but I don't you know in Ninety six is when it's all really started fluctuating\nFry and think about the border of San Diego you still get inundated with hundreds and hundreds of Alan just running up the highway and Clinton passed a law back then and that's when the ... of the border patrol began that's when the the ah mash hiring started\nAnd also you guys got a wall at a huge fence\nAnd that yeah that was fourteen miles long but what happens when you get to him a gallon where the fence only goes a certain point\nAnd I've been to the I was deployed to auto Arizona were all there was was a strand of\nUm a strain of barbed wire that's not going to stop anybody so let's say they meant let's say they are going to count at this point we don't know exactly where they go and that's just the closest water but what happens if they get to that other areas and then you also have the crisis of what happens if they start crossing a river how many of them are going to die\nI mean there's so much to do with this and you got to remember one thing I brought this up the other day was\nThat a communicable diseases we have to not just only vet for criminal history we need to deploy a Center for Disease Control people down there a and FEMA tend to ensure that uh we're not bringing everybody across it has like a high fluctuation of tuberculosis or any other disease\nAnd Leslie Jason if you talk to anybody used to work with at the border is there any color you could bring to their jobs like now\n[noise] their job is tough it's always optics optics optics a back in the day there was no cell phones are nowadays are going to see when that when the ten thousand seven thousand hits the border there's gonna be cameras hundreds and hundreds of cameras not just news but\nCameras from everybody in the world and they're only going to take the good clips uh both sides are\nAll right uh Jason big low thanks so much appreciate it thanks for any one eight six six for all eight seven six six or the midterms\nAre here are so many issues\nMatter right now we're looking at the Caribbean and Kavanaugh dads propelling the Republicans to close the gap which was supposed to be a blue wave almost no one's calling for that what about the ... gap in

Marines started ... ... a bushel area\nAnd after the ring that same old song five ... bushel yield and in in ... and that's that's pretty strong ...\nAnd so you know just don't find Jim Marshall right off the top of the meals yup\nYup man that's amazing that uh the weather that we had to do that much and I'm hearing the same thing out of South Dakota guys\nWhen when you hear stories like that you got to start thinking that uh maybe those are the USDA numbers that we get on November ... are going to pull back a little bit on soybeans here Michele we've got a lot of crop\nThat needs to be moved we're going to use a lot of it domestically but we got to get our exports are backed up and running here give me give me your latest thoughts on what's going on with the trade [noise]\nYeah we definitely need to get actually back then burn running essentially soybeans obviously the lack of demand and sign up and even we we\nAre way behind our average and would have liked to have us and see a you know getting ready to be approved by\nThe government to finalize that wrap that up because next big market for our when are we and we're also\nLooking forward to President Trump and president of the meeting and I believe Argentina later in November and hopefully make some progress on China so we can get back that market not just recently beans and sorghum and talk\nLots or we park it inside that way for more of an emerging market for a week but it was definitely an important one given that demand\nYou know the demands depends on the air and not market well\nMichelle would you just said is what makes it so hard is that it was an emerging market and we need those emerging markets for wheat and that's what makes it so hard when we run up against a of a road block like we've got right now isn't it\nYeah it was definitely really disappointing and it was really disappointing to see a Chinese\nYou know stop buying entirely us but I had to enforcement cases while we still have them against China\nThat we put up with your WTO and funny take me and that didn't impact that Chinese buying up we are they still fight for the following year than they had been greeted jumping thing to see the different parallels\nThat they took a train large trades for every call it a lot more seriously and I thought I told her he is as opposed to you know previous he had on straight through official Seattle it\nDidn't stop and my son is an interesting certainly disappointed and hopefully we'll make some progress there\nYeah yeah making products\nIt sounds like a set of an interesting thing that's why they will make them\nYeah yeah making progress that the key here guys when we come back what I Want to talk about and I'm going to talk about it with thick and German here when we come back up but we\nWe got some progress going we've got some momentum going we just need to keep this going and continue to to push forward on some of these agreements in and get our trade issues are settled here and pick one of our friends paying jobs and she's over at the WTO right now trying to lead the case\nThat open up these markets around the world will talk about that next right here on average ...\nDigging deeper with the mostly a company the show were to Romney experts take your questions about crop Patricia your host could move folk and Ross spender senior uh dramas from the mosaic company Hi this is\nUh nowadays a lot less off as far as I say it's we're still making it I guess yup\nYup ... you know I don't know if I've seen as much as you\nKnow I've seen the spread this wide before between the established farmers that has their costs under control versus the the start up guy that dealing with a lot of debt but boy there's an ocean of difference between those two operations right now is it their\nAll match there is chip and and your knowledge of great concern because let's face it\nIf you look at the average age ... there's going to be tremendous come over here and the next ten years how are these young farmers acquire on Capitol I mean this structure capital in tents industry\nAnd how those people get access to the amount of capital that it's going to take\nAnd I I guess I learned or can survive on the far end of a thing where we're quite frankly which you're going to be a a a real debate Mr Moore has to happen here for going to have young farmers are just going to end up\nProtecting on her culture I mean and I was like a you know when when your family and your brain\nYou know unless you're harming you know a hundred thousand actors you compete well yeah I don't want that\nFor tourist stabbing here I don't believe but you know how do we get the capital necessary to these young people in part of a problem is they got all understand that you know that during the Clinton is wonderful but you know you can probably get a stamp leash\nUsually some stuff but there's a little faded on those are some of the work they're facing and show how can
