about the absolute fact the Chicago Cubs would win their division and send the very talented scrappy cute but not to be feared Milwaukee Brewers where they belong to the locker\nRider than hell buddy on that particular take give the brewers tons of credit\nA gutsy season a gutsy wins tonight and they do it with all the names that got them here we're runs okay with a huge huge it today and already\nChristian yell edge for me the MVP and I mean I think copy biases in that conversation would yell at each one of the better off into seasons we see in a long time\nDid not win the triple

at the end of the game Josh ... to the left or you came in and was dominating dominant\nShut the cubs down for too many they put together very quickly a really good baseball team of Milwaukee and the yellow Cain additions obviously huge with that organization\nAnd Craig council ... the brewers manager deserves all the praise all the champagne and like I'm a cubs fan it was not\nPleasant I did not love watching the brewers celebrate on the field at Wrigley Field but you know what I also Washington they earn every ounce of it\nI it's hard not to like that team made little easier when they'd be Jersey but that's a real good baseball team and I think maybe the best team in the national league and and maybe the other ... and maybe it's the Dodgers they will not games and against the Rockies\nAnd if they get hot at the right time with her shawl but both and when you can show that team down in the sixth and seventh and the ... and the nights certainly seven eight nine from Milwaukee that's dangerous after the game with Kelly Nash Craig council\nTalked about beating the cubs in that game\nThrill out I mean we um [noise]\nYou know we went in and around to get on to knock on the same like the ... um [noise] well that's a great we might plant today it's again it's a it's a thrill to do an air crash on some more celebrate threatened salmon or ought to get to the game\nI

Louis cardinals you can't win a single game at home and the brewers how to ... really good really impressive ... and I've said this for a while now I think outside of the Dodgers the three best teams in the national\nLeague we're in the central\nSt Louis faith that the end for\nThe cubs and the brewers are both really good teams is it going up tomorrow for the coverage is against the Rockies yeah the matchup as favorable yes the games that really doesn't matter in his one game\nAnd as a single game that has a single baseball game it's going to be really really difficult for the cubs have any kind of ... and after the last night after the game the cubs skipper Joel mad and talked about what comes next\nGive him credit men don't don't bang on our guys get Milwaukee some credit they did a nice group um they match up while they're pitching is tough on us especially the book and stuff on everybody [noise]\nUh but we got to go to the current ones come back tomorrow and we'll get another shot out of there is no there is no lamenting there's no crime there's no none of that um [noise] it's uh it's getting back in how they got to get back to when something bad happens you've got to get back out all prepared for the next play\nAnd they're still baseball they played it won't be against the Los Angeles Dodgers which was the nightmare scenario for cubs fan\nYou do not want to ... in tomorrow's game but the Dodgers get the win and think about this the Dodgers have won the ... last six consecutive years after beating the Rockies five to two today\nAnd yet they have not won a World Series over that stretch ... a lot of organizations say this is World Series or nothing the whole thing whole it's a lotta for that job disorganization\nOne game away last year game seven against the Astros and Walker buell or the young pitcher for Los Angeles was incredible section two thirds ending\nOnly gave up a single it now that Dodgers both ends a little reckoning Jansen his back give two runs actually looked rusty my it has been good kids in my it as ... really good out of the ... if the Dodgers team can get hot\nThey can be the best team on the side of the bracket and it's also a reminder every year the trades headline we talked so much about who was buying who we're going to go get it doesn't always translate Dodgers had\nRemind your every year the trades headline we talk so much about who is buying who's going to go get it doesn't always translate Dodgers had to win this game in order to win the division and they went out and they got ... in a much bigger move they got many Machado\nThe companies went out and they got what Neal Walker not near Walker Murphy Daniel Murphy was a throwback name\nDidn't matter sometimes and it's interesting that and there's a bit of a paradox here because the numbers the saber metrics to date in baseball it's not just a fad building winners how the ashes build that team you heard Ben writer last hour was words does want to talk about their top lieutenant under\nThe gym and use it went to Milwaukee ... build that organization Andrew Freedman president operations in LA saver Patricia in the ... tradition but there's also something about the chemistry of a team\nAnd the most since Todd girlie had two hundred and Seventy six against the titans last year\nMonday Night football update for you Terry kill just returned a

much as this is\nBeing the same drum over and over again every year the chargers starts slow until she was ... it ain't over\nThere and find shape but every year the chargers starts slow and tend to finish strong so over the chief to build a pretty comfortable lead like they did last year obviously what day are angling for will keep you updated on the game\nTo starts last Tuesday parts of the season that\nDo not live up to the expectations many not all of us had her for two longtime powerhouses last few years in the NFL and the sewers case this century\nPittsburgh one two and one\nNFL can seem one and three\nAnd four me look in those two teams they're they're both talented\nThey both have incredibly disappointing\nThey build a future hall of fame quarterbacks and a lot of weapons on often\nPittsburgh not as many with Les beyond bell\nNot having reported for duty and not having signed is franchise center which by the way accordion chapter as we told you\nYou're on CBS portray or over the last few hours reportedly lazy I Will show up week seven that supply week\nHe gets about nine hundred thousand dollars a week so the reason presumably he'll show up as you can get that money for not working for not having to go in there and play and then he'll he'll play starting we get the lab breath to see\nBut I think the Steelers problems and obviously they're going to be markedly better when when lady and comes back when every comes back and gives up the formula rusty last year\nSame situation franchise tag last season didn't sign the tender until just before game one there's no guarantee that and we gave he's going to be the lady on bell we've come to expect\nProbably better than James got\nTwenty total rushing yards twenty\nFour the Steelers\nThis past weekend and that loss at home to the ravens\nThan robs burger couldn't handle the weight of it himself\nThis is a Pittsburgh team and we've said this I've said this again\nAnd again and again\nThey're coming apart at the seams\nAntonio Brown\nPut out frustrating\nThan robbers burger as we were reminded you when we came back on the rejoined from the trace\nA lot of time last year talking about retirement\nBefore complaining aggressively\nAbout ... Rudolf being drafted behind it obviously not a guy's going to push him for his job anytime soon\nIt's selfish towards this\nMike Tomlin not having his arms around this team this organization\nI don't believe in the sewers this year\nI don't think they're going to turn it around and I know that I could be wrong that is\nI don't believe in the sewers this year\nI don't think they're going to turn around and I know that I could be wrong that is a really talented football\nTeam and\nThe test will be it'll be interesting because the team I Do believe in to get your second the falcons at one and three I think the thousands of really good football team\nPaying job defensively they're going to improve on defense lotta close games falcons come to town\nOne of those teams is going to be one in four or one three and ... and the other is going to have a chance to get back closer\nTo the right side of five hundred\nThe game after the last yesterday Mike Tomlin\nCame out and talked about his team's early season struggles\nWe don't life where we are um but but we accept it we don't understand it 'cause I'm doing um who's got to keep working or we will do that um we won't make excuses I'm disappointed in the night\nUm but there's going to come up tomorrow we'll we'll look at it the ... um make necessary adjustments\nYou can you can have a lot of things guys that are injured can get

we seven and get going at some point we gave we now whatever it is the teams that have real dysfunction that has deep seated\nAnd goes back before the current season players that don't like being around each other\nThose things don't heal overnight and losing exacerbate them again and again and again\nWe've seen talented teams football basketball baseball whatever\nOn dirt cheap because they don't connect that don't get along like being around each other\nI don't believe in each other\nThat's the sewers look like\nI think a lot more likely\nThis is a disappointing season in Pittsburgh than there is some kind of turn around and I'm not Mr Right off the team because they're wanting to uh one or one in three you judge them on the whole you look at the schedule that's still a schedule is tough falcons bangles\nBrown's ain't that suffer ravens Panthers jaguars or just the next few weeks\nThey go to Denver they play the patriots still\nThey've got a game in the world was there at the end of the season that's your schedule is really tough\nNot able to defend at least yesterday home field because I Do against the falcons\nI think a lot of this goes have been Roseburg hasn't played well hasn't led well not for the last year\nAnd he played poorly yesterday and to be fair to little bad after the game little Ben did acknowledge that\nYou know I don't think I'm going to say if there's anybody right now because I'm not quite well enough or I Need to play better today was just a bad to the office we've all had them I had one today and I promise I'll be back to play better\nStewart Kovacs I didn't catch the entire press conference or did he developed the next Fifteen minutes for retirement or did you just like\nMercifully not a not go to this time around oh he always liked to devote time to retirement you know that bill there was a good Fifteen minutes you know when I retire until I retire and oh I Want to be you're not sure this is the right move for me and you know for every team to lose it as a team that wins and give them credit ravens played really well\nJoe Flaco you everybody responds differently to being challenged and having a challenger robbers burger got petty and potential ... over Mason Rudolph and he's played badly flag wasn't exactly super thrill then he got his future\nReplacement draft that team but you know what\nHe's respond planes have really good football\nHe's looked pretty impressive he's got better receivers three hundred and sixty three passing yards Flaco yesterday\nAnd most importantly\nAnd after the game after the when\nFlaco talked about\nThat performance it's not like today it was one of the toughest Pittsburgh Steeler games I've ever played I played really really tough football games against these guys in front of the pie one fifty [noise] ah but I think a lot of fried and some of those games because things are really hard out there I think our guys the way our guys up front today and the way our guys on the outside that open\nYou know I didn't have to be one of those games and I was able to stand back bearing and throw the ball with confidence and without too many guys around me and that definitely helps\nI Love the flag will call the Steelers soft I blame the Steelers when they've been good before that that that's a lot of it sure do it that man I didn't love I responded to barge accident nationally but I like that is brought your swagger back lack of good for your buddy good for you do not by the Steelers\nFor me the falcons are a very different story and I recognize it a

CBS Sports radio jail see what's going on man\nAnd I can't complain my friend just watching this game uh\nGetting ready to put a bowl on week for how are you\nI'm doing good I'm ah I'm Down a little bit in Vegas but you know I'm I'm planning a massive comeback after the show that show much like\nGuys in Vegas for as like a fight or something going on I\nMean yeah I have ... Habib McGregor USC so doing the uh the age to\nShow from the Waldorf Astoria they almost didn't let me and I think no I I Belong to them during the show premiered preventing enjoyed I I Need to come back like Steelers fans in falcons fans are hoping from their teams this year which of ah\nThose two genes may both teams are neither James ... what do you see Jason will lead to those while going forward\nThey played this week so in writing this somebody\nSuperbowl um it's you know I\nDon't know I neither team can stop anybody I mean\nI Know Baltimore only putting only in air quotes 'cause they're playing verse they're hated rival I'm On a Sunday night in front of a hostile crowd and Baltimore let's face it hasn't had enough as it went to the Superbowl although that seems to be changing but regardless they only put up twenty six last night\nBut the ballots collars that far more the one and you know Crabtree and Flaco connect on that early bomb that they might have hung a forty burger on an easy\nSo Pittsburgh can stop anybody and I mean Atlanta with the injuries that have a really shredded there if they can't stop anybody and\nI don't know I mean that Ryan has been very good at home but it hasn't been enough they just play three straight home games and it only won one they're they're in trouble a landed in trouble that's a tough division Pittsburgh I I Know the AFC North looks better\nAnd it's playing better but I I just don't think the Bengals and the ravens are going to completely run away and hide so [laughter] I don't know what to make of that game um I I I guess I I mean to the Steelers because\nThe one thing about them is every time they're they're kind of like the patriots to me and then every time you're ready to say it's over you know last year with alcohol drove Illinois ever being left out there for the anthem by himself in their locker room and chaos\nYou're kind of ready to say oh it's the end and then they get hot obviously they had to beat the box a couple of weeks back and they did now they didn't follow it up but um I I don't know I I I guess I still going to them but these are very flawed football teams and and I don't think either one is going to find much joy in January\nJason logging for here on the show speaking of teams that can't stop anybody I Know the cheese are all the rage\nHomes has been incredible the audience is the best in the NFL Vegas has moved their line from I think thirty in the warm for weeks ago Jeanette tend to one range when the super bowl for thirty minutes isn't particularly impressive are you buying the cheese and the level\nThat a lot of other people are the season Jason log and [laughter]\nI mean [noise] they're going to live and die with their off it they're\nThey're like you know a lot of teams in this league do like\nTo me New Orleans their life to me Green Bay or like to me in New England they're like to me Pittsburgh um [noise]\nEven the rams now that they're secondaries been decimated by injuries and\nYou know there there there are certain conceding [noise] a lot of points that a lot of yours there just offsetting it because they've got enough that it's only going three and now about six percent of the time and you know it's like four times\nUpsetting it because they've got an often that's only going three in al about six percent of the time and you know it's like four times less than the league average I mean they you know they're they're doing they're they're basically unstoppable right now\nWhen they have the football in their possession I don't know if that will be the case all year but yeah I'm buying the chiefs I mean\nDo for a coming into this game was second in the NFL in quarterback hits and hurry\nYou know he's been getting home I'm just in Houston uh I'm not sure how much he has left in the tank but you know could he have some big games along the way yeah and and they just need I mean when you're often says that good\nYou need to be middle of a pack in turnovers and you need just to you know two to three thirty down stops\nA game you know a third in eleven get off the field or you know a third in nine for your opponent get off the field just a couple of those a week and because of the fence is so good you know that that's that's really all you need I mean look at New England last year\nThat wasn't a playoff defense that wasn't even a middle of the pack defense but because of Tom Brady and because of the office\nThey were one stop away two steps away from winning the super bowl so\nI think the chief's office is that good I Know tonight it's not showing but it's you know the first time a homes is on Monday nights at their arch rival it's on the road it's it's Denver's one of the most imposing\nA you know than environments and no league and I you know and there's still some football will be played and I was still wouldn't be shocked if at the end of the day the chiefs of scored in the high twenties and homes has another feather has kept\nJason lock and for here on CBS Sports radio me bill Ryder Jason tightened three in one my ... are you buying the notion in ... these cases that this is the signs the Mike ... indoor met nag eras are going to be really really successful\nI yeah I don't know about the arrows I I don't know about projecting you know long term success or or what have you um but especially with Tennessee they\nThe the matter with which they want I mean let's face it the bears wrote a defense for three weeks and then all of a sudden the often showed up against the Tampa team that's given up more offensive points to anybody in the league and at the end of the day I'm not sure they're cutters survive the season and\nUm I think this will be the last defense Mike Smith ever coaches like that but you know I'm going to get to ... he did was awesome they let them kind of lose any cut loose but I think Tampa is destined to be picking at the top five and a half of their building blown up so I let's see I'm I'm I'm I wanted to see ... you know\nBecome the quarterback they drafted him to be [noise]\nTennessee [laughter] I mean the whole season has been one bizarre thing after another and

word you want answers I mean you\nCan handle the truth each time to find out from Ryan on\nThe\nHey they'll make the case Ohio State will win this year's college football playoff and national champions ripping the band aid off island going right into Israel or to make the case I'm Sorry to win the national championship for them the whole enchilada buddy [noise]\nOkay um well I mean\nAs you can see that they're not they're not afraid to go into a rockets atmosphere a hostile environment and get the when they're very young team as well um and I think if they can go into a white ... offensive because it on Saturday Night on a big stage you get the job done even when I mean they really didn't put it well let's be honest I there was you were dropped a lot of balls or\nThey're running game didn't really get going their office ... a little bit they could play a lot better so if they were still able to get a window on the road against the top ten opponent\nWithout playing the game I think if they continue to get better or their young guys continue to grow up a little bit by the time playoff time comes by the time and they play in Michigan and the yeah they should be hitting on all cylinders and at that point if all the guys are playing the way they should play that could be anyone in college football traits um [noise]\nI Know she has been jumping in and actually got to be one more choice [noise] sure sure sure make the case that you're Notre Dame\nCannot be the only top twenty five teams currently on their schedule and lose on Saturday at Virginia Tech wow I mean\nThis segment we just completed and this one right now uh yeah yeah I um after the case for why they can't win\nAll right I'll preface this with again it's not something I Believe I'm just playing the game so\nIf they work to lose I Would say it's because the magic is run out and vote he's played well the last two games that you started maybe some tape is gone out on him and just first really true wrote start in a hostile environment and other put out by force for granted it's at Wake Forest and a new game the stands were half filled now you're going into\nVirginia Tech to mean Nike enter sandman we blessing or those fans are going to be really going crazy can be tough environment that Virginia Tech different ears really good I don't think I'd let up I Old Dominion but don't forget what they did the first game against for say just absolutely stifled ...\nTheir defenses has their ears pen back behind the crowd maybe invoke a little tentative and his first starting to true hostile environment\nVirginia Tech possibly possibly could get that went [noise]\nAlright trace next one is from ... fields race other real not good neither neither felt good I'll\nSay that not good choice not good I'm next one for me is make the case for urban Meyer being the best coach in the country\n[noise]\nI write one just continued get harder and harder um [noise]\nWell if you look at the record I don't have the record offhand I Know that but he is selling ridiculous like Seventy seven and eight or in his tenure at Iowa State he continues to win again even though he had the recruiting classes like Nick Saban as Alabama he's\nTouched below that he continues to win the Big Ten underrated Lee I think it's a very tough conference in a lot of people like always talked with that you see how that is they feel like a weekend and we got especially not division we have to go play Ohio ... I'm Sorry I play Penn State Michigan State and Michigan\nEvery single year those are obviously rival games for all those it's just a very tough to go out of them obviously has Auburn but the SEC especially of late has played lesser opponents um the bottom of the agency is really kind of dropped out a little bit this year picked up the Kentucky playing well but it still has bottom LSU has not really been as good as it were up until this year\nSo we take the level of competition that Ohio state's played not for don't forget or mired in the playoffs last time these two teams played beat out a Nick Saban when the towers or the number one team overall in the play offs to take all those considerations and you could make the case that over Meyer is the best coach and cause trouble\nAlright trace make the case that despite signing a massive new deal like last year at the end of the year teams frankly will choose to leave your PIN say team for\nOther opportunities so the cases to make it that he will leave yes [noise]\nWell\nI'm just messes you ... you know to that it's fucking are measuring the nice thing ever sent me thank you usually segment years left to pile on and give me the most uncomfortable situations\nOr ... I got one more now\nMake the case that you should stop feeling sorry for yourself in this segment [laughter]\nUm yeah I guess I'm being too much of a baby you know I just really powers are truly a lawyer as Kathy wanted me to be outside on a brave face strap on my boots and we'll just go in there and fight every case to the best of my ability\nTo all trades of gays over so I don't want to you

chief who's going to at some point level off because they had been phenomena and andme homes had been off the charts good shoot I call them the MVP league last week\nAnd even if they don't win tonight I don't know that I Would move somewhere else to the top of that list a Kansas City has been that good but well I can still be a tough place to play I thought the Broncos were in for a bounce back here\nI picked Denver to win that division is year\nMainly because I didn't know what ... is going to be\nI thought that was the possibility that he could hit the ground running at this level now I didn't think this was boss\nI'm ... and there was the possibility that he could struggled as a first year quarterback that has not been the case for the first two games and I wouldn't say struggling tonight\nA buddy does not have a touchdown pass and he has been a touchdown throwing machine for the first three weeks of the season uh fourteen of twenty seven for a buck forty eight\nOr no touchdowns knowing sapped indicted but he has not been able to throw a TD jets she had had a chance last possession achieve sad uh he threw a past it was unbelievable that he even got into his receivers ads\nGoing left on back right a was a tough cuts make I'm not blaming the receiver but it was a hell of a throw buying homes just even give them a chance to be there but a Denver it's got to lead\n[noise] 'kay scheme them not playing badly himself Fifteen to twenty two for a hundred and fifty six Lindsay and Freeman the two headed monster a Denver is running backs both effect up tonight Lindsey ten for sixty seven Freeman six for fifty three\nSo the Broncos uh been able to a gash the chiefs defense a little bit which is the reason why I didn't pick density to win that division as well as not knowing what moms who is going to do I like Kansas city's a weapons I thought they had the chance to score points of homes didn't turn it over but I thought he might turn it over some\nAchieves the fence was questionable coming into the year for me and they had been here tonight the Broncos been able to move to football pretty well against them so far and they just for stay a three and out from the chief so the Broncos up seven uh with time\nRunning out in a third quarter we'll keep an eye on that one for you all night long any other NFL games when the weekend\nThat

I think it's more along their off into blind\nI Know it's early and we've got a lot of football the sea yet but I think there's a real good chance the giants are going to be able to take whatever quarterback they wanting to draft issue just because I don't think they're that may teams in\nThe hunt for a quarterback going forward next year and if the giants don't have a great record which is kind of look like that's going to be the case they're going to be up near the top of the draft\nHow is the quarterback draft this year compare to the poor guys five if you put the more Jackson in there for when the top ten or five in the first round as issues quarterback draft but compared to last\nYou know you make a good point first of all that it it might not matter to an extent because you know that cliche I've been using a lot of us have been using for a long time is that there were thirty two teams and the slave thirty thirty two franchise caliber quarterbacks\nThat number that that supply and demand is starting to get close to where we've had so many good young quarterbacks come into the league in recent years whether it be just Sean watching on Carson when some charity often unless you Patrick ... making his ... his that coming out party that\nYou know between the guys who just retire on this and continue to be back there and the young guys the original up there it's very hard to find anything that she got maybe Jacksonville maybe Miami Vice tannahill is paid well the doctor and\nI'm at a rapid jak that\nUm you know Jerry Stiller sort of on what's happening with the buccaneers ... object but there are many things you can find a couple that are in desperate need for a quarterback right now and so\nUm that complicates things\nNow drew Iraq was a big name last year who sticking around for how the Missouri in and out of the dust in that range but nobody stands out\nLike last year's drought curious to know is going to overdraft or trade up for a guy just begging chance and even at the guy turned the top ten um then then competition for one of those quarterback that are seen as the top and I can strap because we had a record four quarterbacks jacket\nIn the top ten or just a few months ago at some point the ... just get dry in terms of the the the demands\nAgreed I talked with doing some things that you you too\nIn the top ten or just a few months ago at some point the top just get dry in terms of the the the demand for these guys\nAre great art ... doing some things that you you do a couple out there I Want to throw you a couple of more tell me if you think this team during this off season would take a quarterback with their first round pick Detroit\nI don't think so I think I think they believe Matthew Stafford again look at Drew Brees record pay a Tom Brady Peyton Manning all these guys extending their careers to forty ... and not used to average thirty early thirties and so I I think they believed he can still be there a guy and still come into his own and the second half of his career here so I don't think they do it\nWill Dallas ... press got that quickly\nOh man you know what if if you ask me that a decade ago I'd say so but you know Jerry Jones to his credit has it well whether you believe in Prescott or not to as credit has sort of gain some\nSome patients and and just the very fact that Jason Garrett's been given practically a decade as the head coach of that team despite this the one playoff when\nIndicates that they're they're hanging on it and I think they believe in and Garrett along with Prescott and Eliot and when they are totally healthy that often the line you know the weather coverage Frederick misses the whole season or not\nThey bounce back next year regardless of what happened to see and I think you're getting at least one more year and a dark and so I don't think they're going to jumping to drop records out just yet no matter what how\nHow about the two guys that came in to the NFL the same time to be like did same draft boat all three of the top ten picks Pittsburgh take a quarterback for the first round her we look chargers took a quarterback with the first round\nThink I think can be leaning Pittsburgh more than than the than the chargers two rivers just continues to kind of below the radar get the job done\nA for Los Angeles I think he's got enough gas left in the tank I think they think they can contend on an annual basis at this point in time\nAnd and you know you look at rock Pittsburgh you wonder you know and a few years in a row now we've asked that question about\nYou know what is what is Ben Roethlisberger have left in half and is he looking to retire and he would have been talking about retirement to opt seasons ago and now you've got the lady on bell situation where you might walk in the off season that even makes it to the off season with Pittsburgh and Antonio Brown's disgruntled and Pittsburgh is off to a rough start this year so\nI can see them and potentially getting to the point next year when they say we don't know how much we have left with Ben if anything at all and that and we need to get a new quarterback to sort of take take take the reins there\nTalking to our buddy a bread gun you from a police report NFL insider here with us on CBS Sports radio\nI Believe you're about to curb today\nI thought man or he was either going

I thought the division will be tricky Baltimore in Cincinnati aren't bad I taught Pittsburgh was the cream of the crop I said that's not an easy division to win games and\nSo the best I could do was seven and nine they get a real shot it well it could be a six nine and one or seven eight them on because they've got that thinking tie against Pittsburgh but yeah I thought the browns are much improved\nAnd back when we talk and the ... the than they did Jeff Gordon was you know supposed to be part of the team to me that a big void they're missing I think I told the local people here you know where like one good receiver shy of being a dangerous team\nBecause you've got a lot of inexperienced guys you know this whole NFL is all about passing receiving and four hundred yard you know passing games and the quarterback so\nIt's all about receiver tight and the you know like you saw with more homes and Jared golf and my point is another thing I Want to mention is up tonight's announcers I think the ESPN Monday Night football announcer really that I just wanted or maybe you don't want to slam into a fellow you\nKnow I got no problem slamming and I'll I'll give you this much\nAnd I'm not a you're not the only one to question a Whitman I've heard several uh NFL Insiders lace media members say that he really hasn't a dumb as much I think he's being unfairly compared to a role model\nWho did the same thing coming right off the field jumping right into a prominent broadcasting broke and he's not as good as Romo but I don't think he's bad and I didn't catch the first\nGame of the year I think I was on the air so I couldn't ... rarely listen to the broadcast a dive listen to the weeks since\nIt shouldn't eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five or resorts release dot com very\nSatisfied with the results that reserve released achieved\nThank you very very nice they catch we release resort release eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five or resorts release dot com call now\n[noise]\nSports flash I'm done with this report Ross Dubai guy go great news as a quick way you could save money switched a guy go go to go to our common and Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance if you were skeptical about just how good Patrick my home there's a W aren't any more than twenty three year old chiefs quarterback completed Thirteen of sixteen passes\nFor a hundred and fifty three yards jumped on the fourth quarter\nBut would it be enough on Monday Night football in Denver the chiefs trail the Broncos twenty three twenty with under two minutes left all\n\n\n\nJob in Harlan Westwood One on McCall hunt both the finishing touches on a twenty seven twenty three chiefs comeback victory as they remain undefeated homes finishes what three hundred four yards passing overall go along with a CD toss when he ran for another ... or other big NFL news that I used to be able to start running back levy on bell reportedly plans to play football season\nIs expected to end his hold out and reports of the team during the week seven by dream is worse than expected the sorry for the bucks against the falcons following nearby we've replacing Ryan for Patrick\nEmployers returning after their four game suspension includes the patriots Julian Edelman says running back mark Ingram ravens corner Jimmy Smith Bengals linebacker von ... and Panthers linebacker Thomas Davis have for jaguars running back winter form that he's out is definitely after ... creating a hamstring injury\nSo the diamond we go a hundred and sixty two games wasn't enough to tie breaking games played on Monday were needed to determine division\nWinners and who are playing the wild card game first Seattle central the brewers took out the cubs at Wrigley with Milwaukee leading free one of the night then you just one more out when it's their first division titles ... eleven\n[noise]\nBobby ... radio network three one the final ... seen five and two thirds endings allowing just to run against the victory Christian yellow Sharif or foreign an RV eyes the brewers limited vision and are the top seep through the playoffs\nSo in the wild card game it will be the cubs hosting the Rockies Tuesday nights that because Colorado fell to the Dodgers five to ... each with three run Homer\nWhopper Mueller solving six and two thirds scoreless innings allowing just one hits a notch the when the Dodgers and I was ... for the Yale Yankees hosts the AIDS in the wild card game one day the winter effects on the red Sox and the other reality ...

Patterson if she'd be a sports dot com college football national writer inside a Gyp\nJob doing well have you are\nI'm doing ... D do gain not as well as some teams in the country but better than other teams in the country so I guess we'll take bad ... let me start here\nClemson and I know the polls mean absolutely nothing right now the only poll of matters is the college football play a ball and that's not coming out for another couple of weeks but uh we like to look at the coaches ... people in the like\nClinton dropped in both poles and they're down to number four and there are a lot of people at the beginning of the season we said well it's Alabama Clemson ... drop off I thought that was unfair to Georgia but that would just make a Clemson now down to number four\nAnd the ATC isn't exactly a killer conference this year it claims and schedule gonna hurt their playoff camped\nSilly but I think it only hurt their chances if they lose\nI think after seeing what happened about being able to just saying not only the transfer Kelly Brian but also an injury to cover Lawrence even be able to beat their team which by the way\nI think that he might prove to be one of the better than that they are down here for the eighties or the ACC but still I think a big step forward or dino Babe Ruth and his building\nOf this program I think they get out of that game by just running the ball with on the head that we want to play old school are going to run the ball and play deep now\nI think run the ball on the plane even\nWith this constant theme that defensive line and with the skill position players they have I\nI think that's good enough to go twelve and oh and when the ACC but uh you know you mentioned the strength of schedule and overall trying to the conference at Clemson lose this one game\nA then all of a sudden they're going to be potentially in a tight spot trying to compete with other one conference champions and if they lose who they'd be fighting an uphill battle because no team in the four years of the college football playoff has made the college football\nLosses so in that case yeah they could potentially be hurt by that but again I just I'm looking at the team and and especially knowing whatsoever larger feeling is if you stay healthy I I really think of something being able to get out of the regular season and out of the ACC Championship game undefeated\nWe've gotten a little more information on travel Lawrence today or leaves the game seemed to have taken a bad day on the day a report or out of Clinton today was more of a next screen than any significant head injury\nThat you form these specially if you could go as early as this we give money you may only missed one week something along those lines that certainly plays Clemson a favor [noise]\nSome people question the fact that demos Sweeney may do switch at the time maybe did or didn't know how bright was going to react and walk away and it was pretty damn dicey when Lawrence goes down and there's no Brian started to pump the bench\nPersonally I didn't have a problem with the the ... decision or al ... and I don't have a problem with Brian either did he decided hey I've only played poor guy can walk away I can transfer ongoing somewhere else I didn't have a problem with either one did you\nKnow I you know what it was a tough decision it was just a really really hard decision and I think that you uh you know or whatever or someone believes that you should say in your decision making\nFor the senior for the leader for the in states kid I I think that a lot of those\nConsiderations were built in to the chances that Brian got bad that he was the the number one coming out of spring he was the number one going into fall and he was the number one to start the season and win the game\nGot tight again Texas saying them in College Station you know out there but there is no doubt that uh some of that production had had slowly started to fall off and you know in the whole Clemson quarterback situation I look at it like this\n... ever since Trevor Lawrence committed and we've just seen quarterback after quarterback after quarterback decided to transfer\nAnd I can't help but that just thinks I just can't help but think that that is a complement of ... and his ability and what it could be that all of these quarterbacks who are forced star players are five star players that they would look down the line like oh that kid yeah I'm not being that kid out and so I just\nAgain it was it was a weird twist\nOf the college football cosmos for him to get hurt in that game after an emotional week but like you mentioned at the injuries that major and they've Trevor Lawrence\nWell then go and knock off your rival who just happens to be the teams then running the big twelve for the better part of the decade and that's I think that's where a lot of the injury is\nMinutes on their plate this week we'll see if they can snack it up chip greats appreciate you coming on board when it's thanks much will be renewed all week\nSounds good to be well she Patterson

does between now and then um at worst I think they would only have one last and they might be undefeated so it might be a battle of undefeated they play in the last regular season game\nThey beat Obama win the big twelve championship game yeah I'd I'd think they'd be hard to deny a spot in the final four\nThat they are in now is being seen by George ... well\nI think they did last year there's no reason why they won't do it again\nI think there can be to SEC teams I don't know if you heard it I had a a ... just old twenty five minutes go somewhere there about a foot ball comfortable inside of CBS Sports radio and I asked him specifically about the possibility\nOf two SEC teams and Notre Dame being in the final four\nIf that's the case then that means is only one spot left\nOr the ... twelve champion for the big twelve champion but the Big Ten champion and the ACC champion\nWhich would include the likes of climate thin and Oklahoma and Ohio State and maybe even Michigan if they run the table there were only lost to Notre Dame at the end of the year um there's then a lot of good teams\nI don't know that there's a pack twelve team that can get there this year I think there were already in trouble um I'd hard pressed to think any practical team is going to be able to make the final four in Stamford beat Notre Dame this week than Stanford stays in that mix but because they lost that game\nI I'm I'm Sorry I just don't see a packed off team and I I I liked the fact well the reason why I'm a ... fan is I'm On the air till ten o'clock eastern so now I gotta commute home I got a link to commute home I'm going home I'm watching it back to our game laid back to a game every single week\nI haven't been greeted picking it this week would be another week of me not being able to pick the right side because I took Arizona plus points against us the groups that didn't quite go the way I thought it was going to go um\nColorado is still undefeated or do I really believe that they can run the table Stanford's got lost Washington\nThe alibi the Washington wants to Auburn won't kill him\nBecause Auburn is that good they were a top ten ranked when they played was neutral site game one ... one of the game but it was certainly more of a home game for Auburn 'cause it was way down in Atlanta or and they had to come all the way across the country to play it I Would say Washington as the team that still has the chance\nWhen Oregon just handed that game to Stanford a couple of weeks ago all they do is take any they take any of the game is over for some reason they decided to end the ball off and running back get stripped and Stanford go down to ...\nSo I think Oregon blues that Boo Boo their chance yeah I don't know there's going to be a packed up to him in a big I I Would say it's an upset if a pack twelve team makes the playoff at this point Neal sent from ten cities up on CBS Sports radio now that we're doing Jody good you\nDon't agree hey ah I'm In Kansas City first off what didn't graduate with you on athletics on making another wild card game maybe it'll turn out better than two thousand fourteen and here in Kansas City but we got bigger fish to fry out here in the city\nAre you guys have been complaining about ... you want a World Series\nI Know that well that's what I'm saying with the greatest baseball game ever played with came city

season\nWe got a guy slinging the rocks are on the playground yeah things that I've never seen before I'm thirty three years old\n... the one hand it to ring man who that going to be some change that's my only question like after you Jody\nAre they they're they're crammed into crime any AMC right now nobody's going to argue it nobody can argue it ah let's\nGive some kudos to Andy Reid\nAnd I think it was purely and Andy Reid decision then they change general managers um so Andy's power base there as as big as it's ever been even though he adds an ad postseason suggests yet in Kansas City I'm agreeing made a gutsy call to move away from Smith\nAnd just hand the whole shooting match them homes now he had him in practice every day last year they loved them they moved up in the draft to get them so they had I owe ... and they saw enough to believe All right he's good to go now\nAnd they took quarterback was one of the best statistical years in all of a the NFL last season and said yeah we're going to trade you and we're going to move on we're going to end it along to kid who'd never played before or when you're a defending division championship playoff team\nI'm Sorry that's gutsy move\nIt's a stone cold gutsy move by Andy Reid and that's why I didn't pick the chiefs to win that division Senate right here and CBS portrayed it I said if pat homes is as good as advertised you can see she wouldn't have debated\nWhen I wasn't ready to say\nYes I Believe that's going to happen I thought was going to be a growing pains year are you ... ... in this past week the\nRookie

market to good markets baseball markets a guy no the cubs won the world series a couple of years ago I think that only added to the cubs fan base or not some trucked in from it because you get a

did last today\nThe networks would have been shaking in their shoes a little bit 'cause you know you're losing either LA or Chicago now at least you get the cubs going tomorrow if they win then you keep the Dodgers and the cubs both\nIn the mix so Ah yes the I always think that it's one to speculate on\nWho the networks the broadcasted the rooting for not that I think that any of the announcers will route openly on the air they do a great job their national announcers unlike base and that's the one thing about baseball\nTeams pay the announcers now these days it used to be the broadcast outlets pay denounce now most of these broadcasts set ups the team's pay the announcers their members of the organization\nTheir employees of the organization so you're going to get a hometown call and when you get to the playoffs there you're not talking about the radio and TV stop is all nationally broadcast so you lose your local team announcers on the baseball side\nI guarantee you you're going for her I was going to get calls I'm going to call anybody on CBS portrays going to be called the announcers are blatantly rooting against us I Can't believe they put this guy's on again 'cause they're rooting against no they're not they just calling it down the middle\nThat's the way national announces it's supposed to do it you just get so used to listening to your home town and now to do

somebody does something even if they're not that exciting apply 'cause that's what they're paid to do\nThese national announcers are paid to call it down in the middle and called just what they say

pitcher yet\nI'm telling you right now it's gonna be J. asked\nFor the Yankees he wasn't the Yankee when the season started one Yankee dog us as a matter of fact he's been pretty Democrats and be the

year\nAh I'm I'm a Billy Bean guy even though some people think that he's over the top with is all a Billy Bean's way of doing things and the fact that they made the movie and Brad Pitt played them in the like I had never been a problem for me I think Billy Bean has done amazing things\nHis excuse that they haven't been aware when the world series or you can only do you do for the regular season and then it's just kind of a lot of the draw when you get to a policy that's a cop out\nAnd Billy Beane went down that road ... one year when his team got bounce from the playoffs or I'd add that I didn't appreciate but\nHe works with a smaller payroll a smaller fan base they play in a let me see let me be nice\nHell hole of a stadium\nPolicy um should not be used for ... professional sports anymore I'm Sorry just shouldn't\nAnd they've had issues in attempting to build a new stadium and get financing and the like and I I really think that Billy Beane is asked to push a rock a pill a year

were\nDefinitely postseason factors that were riding on these games but as I explained to my mom she wanted to know why they she thought the playoff games and I said no and and that's the total difference is that both\nOf these games featured teams that were already in the postseason regardless so it wasn't a one and done scenario it wasn't a win or go home scenario so it wasn't the same type of\nTension however we almost got an an appetizer if you will an hors d'oeuvre\nTo what's to come\nOn both Tuesday and Wednesday which I like I appreciated having two extra games so that was kinda fun to wake\nUp and and have those as the daytime entertainment or and then to go right into Monday Night football I mean jeeze sports can you give us a chance to breathe you know the answer is knocked in October\n[laughter] and so here we are we're completely through the first\nMonth of the NFL season and we've got major league baseball postseason from now until what feels like forever or it starts on Tuesday and it just rural\nRattles on for the next month until everything is done and we have crowned World Series champ we'll see whether the Houston Astros can defend that title because that starts in the next couple of days I Know a lot of you don't like the wild for the wild card format I absolutely love it\nI Love the fact that we start with\nTwo games that mean everything we start with two games that have all the tension and the drama\nAnd the intensity it sucks you in from the very beginning there is no ramping up to the major league baseball postseason\n... you start with elimination games which I really appreciate and let's be honest it gives to more teams the chance to be into the playoffs as opposed to what it used to be pre two thousand twelve it was only four teams from each league now we get five teams from each league\nAnd I like the way that that day were expanded if you don't that's cool you always know where you can vent and that's on my Twitter a law

season for heaven's sakes until they were down in the first quarter after the Broncos put their first feel go on the board and so they're they are on the road against a division opponents in a\nTerritory loud loud loud atmosphere there in Denver similar to say a Kansas City where they've got arrowhead stadium and they've got\nHome field advantage simply because the fans are so loud when they're trying to uh throw the opposing all fences out of their rhythm and it worked a couple of times the fans definitely\nHelped to force false starts by the chiefs uh you got guys who are jumping the gun and get nervous get Nancy hard to hear and that's what a great home field advantage will do however the Broncos\nDefense was was gassed really tired after being on the field for a good portion of the fourth quarter and he often didn't help uh you can't go three and out in a drive which your opponent has just put it touched down on the board and held the ball for seven minutes it's it was definitely\nA smart athletic\nImpressive response from the chief\nWhen they started the fourth quarter down ten points or because it was early in the fourth quarter it's after hours with Amy Lawrence here on CBS Sports radio so we're asking you your top three storylines from the first month of the NFL season and we're saying get out of here Monday although his name was a pretty good day Monday was

yards a great compliment especially from the rookies who are running the ball on Roy screaming and Philip Lindsey\nAt least the Broncos have that part right and I want to know you saw this or not um but the touched down that was scored\nWas hit by Philip Lindsay and then he he um\nGave the ball to Garret bold one of his often to blind men or to give him the chance to spy get how cool is that\nBut it's kind of neat\nAnyway just as a side note um but you ... you end up\nPutting so much pressure on your defense when the ... isn't able to maintain possession and that's obviously the glaring issue for kingdom and the Broncos in that fourth quarter\nWe'll do better job waiting game you know we're about ten points um [noise] you know we got to put together drugs can go through you know so that's that's the owners are going on right now what I Want to watch them on the court\nCases agree to a really on the records were given the problems are we supposed to do but to go through so he's he's a

at the bar I'm close enough I'm driving home falling in from Brooklyn is that the\nHardest thing to do is throw the ball across the bodies you're running down view ... does it impeccably\nHe definitely does he has only be athleticism and the body control but the strength to be able to have it one body's going one way and he's not able to play in his foot the way they want and then he can throw back across his body which is led by they\nI don't want quarterbacks doing that because general you'll have a DVD or so that will uh hop on a ball that is weaker right 'cause it stands to reason physics wise\nThat you're if you're throwing across to your body without your whole you know motion behind the throne that it it might be a week or throw it might not be on target but that's just not the case with him I feel like he could sit down and have a ball fifty [laughter]\nYou know and you'd think every time you gonna do it you just you're waiting for the picnic but it doesn't happen and

boy that way\nThese after hours he Laurie [noise]\nAs started with\nA triple header upstarts on Monday [noise]\nDon't know if it's just because I'm getting older and this tends to happen when you get older you pay more attention at time and you're more reflective about time you obviously have more to look back on 'em and I this is\nNot meant to be as more of it as it sounds but you come more face to face with mortality when you're older because you have grandparents who passed away or you have friends who are dealing with things like cancer at a\nA friend right now who's going through treatment for breast cancer and while the doctor is declared her cancer free after the surgery um they also cut off or chemo because it was\nEssentially killing her and the doctor said we don't want to lose you it's you know it's not worth going through more this treatment and she's really sick right now and those types of things I kind of forcing you to take a look at life in a different lens then what\nBeen civil and everything else is is always going to be sunshine and roses and that's just not real life and so when you get older you start to think more about time people around you get older and a life kind of smacks you in the face and\nMaybe that's why the years seemed to pass so much more quickly two thousand Eighteen is going by it light speed for me it just it was just February I was just as a Super Bowl ... it was one of the coldest winters I can remember but I I said that every year and now here we are we're through one week\nI'm Sorry one month of the NFL season two

Tuesday question you certainly can do that\nAsking you what are the top story lines\nFrom the first month of the NFL season\nAre definitely for me it's\nThe same thing that I think we get\nAt the start of every pro sports season but it's so much more magnified in the NFL because there are only sixteen regular season game and that's\nThis transition process adjustment process of trying to get into a rhythm trying to find consistency it's a search for identity it's a search for consistency\nEven for teams that have a lot of the same guys that they've had you know for a couple of years now established quarterbacks\nWe think about Tom Brady could you be more established as a quarterback them Brady and yet they've gone through a a a roulette wheel of wide receivers and different running backs up there and and mostly wide receivers but trying to come up with\nSome way to get a consistent target on one side of brain a consistent slot and the guy who's going to be able to stretch the field on the other side and and uh I I mean\nFive six seven different guys they brought in and they let go they brought Corey Goldman in twice and let him go twice and we're talking about teams even who have\nNo transition on their coaching staff do I know Matt Patricia ... so it does happen but uh one of the most established coaching stabbed in the NFL over the past ah ten years for sure but\nYou know for Bella checked he's been there for a couple of decades and still uh the the struggle for identity and consistency is very real for every NFL team\nThat it was interesting to hear what Tom Brady had to say in his conversation with Jim Gray where they do this weekly on Monday Night football uh and it's on Westwood One so I always make plans to hear it\nAnd I get mad at myself to get sometimes this is what happens very often when I'm listening to the radio I'm doing other things at the same time so I was on my bike\nAnd I was listening specifically to hear both Larry Fitzgerald and Tom Brady on Monday Night football or the pre game and then I start taxing so well by phone as I'm listening to the radio before I Know it's the talk radio interviews done and I couldn't have told

was Thirteen Years old before even understood what football was about and trust me I knew nothing I couldn't figure out while the whistles were for uh the Broncos have really struggled to find a consistent run game over the past couple of years\nPart of that had been the personnel part of it it's been the injuries and part of it's been the office of line just\nHideous but they haven't made much of a commitment to the run game well they've got these two rookie running backs who are making a dent and changing the identity of the Broncos often which is great it's been good to see 'em and I

I\nAnd so he was left out of those to read that and went on to describe the decision making process like the buddy system so more like a popularity contest where he says that the input of much of the team was ignored in favor of a few select\nNames now he didn't name those guys but Tiger Woods Phil Mickelson I don't know about fail that to me doesn't feel right 'cause uh maples and didn't play it all on friday hit a watch on friday a and then\nThe the other idea would be that it's more of a popularity contest than it is about what might be the best for uh for the the us Ryder Cup team and then finally read says it's obviously that Jordan didn't want to play with me\nToo that would makes me cringe the most so singling out Jordan and saying it's obvious that Jordan didn't want to play with me I'm Me first of all what are you five years old\nOkay maybe or maybe you're setting yourself and you're worried about whether or not Jordan's be the likes\nYou\nYeah just um maybe if you'd\nWaited a month and come out with the particular comments they might have been taken more seriously\nBut part of the problem is you're making these comments and the hours after the U.S\nRead that the U.S lost the Ryder Cup and really did not look good at all against Europe so this was not a a Ryder Cup to write home about for the for team usa the parents did look off they didn't look like ... other than speed and Thomas\nAnd to think who else looked good I mean there wasn't a team that looked as good as Francesco military and taught me Fleetwood I mean those guys who are so good together and the United states has always seemed to struggle with the team concept of golf\nBut to make these\nComments to the New York times mere hours after the Ryder Cup is over and to kind of go into the politics of the whole situation when\nIt was talking about how wonderful the atmosphere was and how you're here and get a fantastic job as captain um it it makes you a loan on your island it isolates you it obviously identified as you as a guy who was not a team player and then\nWhat does it reinforce any idea but Jordan speed or others might have had\nHigh everybody this is W.

and that and it's fly by light speed\nBut it's good it's good for business I Love October and the baseball playoffs began today as well as a lot to be excited about the sports that's our toys alert

four to two seven it's eight five five to one to four to two seven or certainly the emergence and the excitement and the just the enthusiasm\nFor the youngest crop of quarterbacks that we've gotten the NFL that spearheaded that group spearheaded by the moxie of one Patrick homes\nI think he is better on the run that he is in the pocket now he does not run first he didn't think does not to run to pick up your own and she's not a running quarterback but he's an athlete\nAnd if he needs to scramble if he needs to run to extend place there's a reason they don't call running plays for Patrick ... there's a reason why he scrambles there's a reason why he takes off its to extend place similar to an Aaron Rodgers\nAnd it's amazing what he can do when he's on the run right handed or as it turns out what did we got to see that on Monday Night football\nAndy Reid said he'd been practicing shifting the football for one hand to the other and moving down the field with his left hand that was it a pretty throw no it was more like a shot put kind of shoved it or to ... kill five yards down the field\nBut the fact is he was able to do it in the moment as bond Miller is draped around his ankles and about to bring him down and the sec\nThird down nonetheless so what I appreciate about ... homes yes the athleticism yes the ability to move and extend plays and to make these unbelievable throws across his body when is the art set and he's off balance all of that's awesome\nBut there are other guys who have that kind of arm strength and who can do it I appreciate the field vision from a guy who's only started five games in the NFL\nWhat he sees and how we see that when he's on the move\n\nAnd when all heck is breaking loose when the pocket as disintegrated and he's being chased by men who would like to fall on him do of course they're gonna raise or on the ...\nLike I I I don't think that's not a flat\nHappens every single time now that the quarterback it's hit the defensive

no brainer I mean I N management what are you talking about just give 'em your management All right Chris what about you\nHonestly out and write off or was it right up there with the horseradish that

it's after\nHours here on CBS Sports radio or you could make your own because it's all of like five ingredients and takes thirty seconds to whip up a badge of horseradish did\nAll right let's do a little ... news before we get to the top of the hour I'm holding in my hand right here it's actually confirmed by the two guys and the other side of the old paying glass I've got Julian Edelman a book that was written with Tom current loose on\nA guy from the patriots for years I knew and when I worked at Providence he's does a great job\nEdelman book I'm not sure it's supposed to coincide with his return from a four game suspension uh probably just to ... eating a buddy is back in the facility he's back with the patriots\nAnd itching to be out there on the field and as luck would have it the paths or on a short workweek and so they take on the colds on Thursday Night Football Tom Brady is getting back his security blanket uh the guy who's got the most familiarity with the most snaps with over the course of\nA their time together they obviously rely on one another and and Edelman knows what Tom Brady is going to do and anticipate what he can do a and is able to to find ways to get help him\nAnd he's a tough athletic\nWide receiver I was gonna say short but that's not really fair he's tough and athletic and his side also makes them extremely mobile and difficult to tackle right how 'bout that that's diplomatic a Brady was a guest with Jim Gray on Monday Night football on Westwood One and a half\nTime I talked about how it was really good to Seattle and back at the patch facility\nIt was great I saw him I Know he was in here as early as you could get in the uh you know he's working out and kind of trying to get his football legs under him I Know you've worked hard unless you go with me for a long time we have such a great chemistry camaraderie\nYou know he brings a different energy as a whole team you such a tough scrappy hard nose guy do raise the level of intensity just him being out on the field you know I'm I'm really excited for Thursday night to see\nYou know what we can do when we get all of our guys out there\nAnd considering that it's been a revolving door at receiver for the\nPatriots and the first month this has got to be such a relief for Edelman to come back office suspension and be available to Tom Brady the name of the book is relentless and actually Edelman was offered to me as a gift so we'll see if we can as a you know promotional tools for the book\nWe'll see if we can make that happen let's see what is the date but the book\nIs released a good question um but since I have one of my hands you can bet it's not going to be that long so it's a I Wonder if they did an addendum to note they probably did not do an addendum to include what he was doing over the last month or so\nAfter hours here on CBS Sports radio Brady and the patch looked a hell of a lot better against the dolphins than they had looked the two previous weeks against the lions and the jaguars and Jim Gray also asked Brady about the improvements in that game against Miami\nWas lot better for us really in all areas and I thought that I think there was a big portion of the game we had we converted actually more third down yesterday against me than we did the previous regimes combined so being on the field I think we ran like eighty one place so there forty eight when perfect\nJust watching the on the day you know I just hope it goes to meet on the phone and uh we got to figure out how to keep going after and practice there was a lot of improvement that was made last week and we need the same route improvement a very short period of time over the next few days before we get ready to play on Thursday\nAnd we all share and the

goalposts moved here after ... going to roll run this I Am all\nMitch McConnell weighing in on the procedure of seeding Brett Kavanaugh he's going to forge ahead he was struck\nBy what happened with Jeff Flake but holding flake to the friday deadline and the FBI investigation which got some terrible power from the president yesterday when they told when he told the FBI he'll follow leads where they have to be but you get it done\nSo he's not going to pursue the drinking but they'll pursue the incidents in the allegations I Am not sure about the third accuser though we'll talk about the countdown to confirmation\nNumber one\nAnd just a short while ago we learn the FBI has interviewed capitalize friend mark judge we do not have the details of the interview but his attorney says it has not yet been completed\nThat is the great John Roberts talking about the mark judge the childhood friend yeah childhood friends of the fifty three year old Supreme Court justice nominee\nHe has an alcohol problem he had cancer and he's dealing with depression but he did step up and answer the questions and more to continue today not only an accuser Wanda but accusers three unbelievable what's going on or were you hearing in on the truth\nAnd before we go up and over the edge of your calls and start getting some feedback I Want to go out to Washington DC what chat program\nIs pushing his own knowledge of the confirmation process because in some cases we're in uncharted waters not so much the controversy with a nominee but what it takes to actually get a boat Chad welcome back\nUh Jennifer based on the Republican side that's what's what's unclear\nA that is the risk of doing this so close to the term elections one way or the other and again you know it is a political question\nUh you know it it says nothing in the constitution about what the process is to get there on a Supreme Court justice you just provide advice and consent you don't have to have a hearing I reported how they didn't even really have a modern confirmation hearing in the way we think of it it's a Nineteen fifty five\nYou didn't have have the nominees even showing up just to listen to their hearing until the middle of last century um you know so there's nothing that that is by the book of how you have to do this the question is whether or not you have the votes on the Senate\nFight so through real quick I just to recover recap we could be hearing Israelis say the FBI is done which I'm sure Democrats will be up in arms if a then Mitch McConnell would make a move on cloture at which time we have to wait how many hours before we get to the point where you can have a vote\nWell even for the procedural again if he files it at any point in the day Wednesday any point in the day one o'clock in the morning or even fifty nine at night you still got to wait a day for Thursday which means then friday you would have the procedural vote and then thirty hours after you take that proceeds will vote if you have successfully cut off the filibuster is if\nYou got to have college Murkowski got to get to fifty one then thirty hours later you would have the confirmation vote and that's why we tend to think that happens you know earlier than Saturn\nMan that Doug Jones the means a lot doesn't it and now you look at the fact that you know the no Democrats go any confirmed Brett Kavanaugh they would just be in my mind they would just be a a ... doing the going in the aftermath they would go and\nSend in and hike camp would only vote yes if they if the Republicans demonstrate they can get to sift exactly who in mind you\nKnow I ran into Luther Strange who was the Republican senator from Alabama he was in the center of the other day and uh you know he lost the primary to Roy Moore Doug Jones flip the seats democratic and guess what you would have been a fifty two votes Brian is about the math it's about the math it's about the mass\nSteve Bannon thank you very much

Wisconsin quitting because America hook up screwed up in the living wage for the most was less pressure for them to Mexico\nNow why hasn't the media wasn't immediate creating this big labor coming out and praising Donald Trump\nWho you know why it was her ... don't hop obviously cares more about the Mexicans than the previous Mexican governments have\nI Know you've got the first deal with Mexico it shows he's not biased but people don't want to emphasize that they show the wall has nothing to do with Hispanics that's everything to do with a secure border north is better off in the south\nIt's not Hispanics or we don't want to keep us panics out we just want to keep a legal south because we have a legal process you and I get that because we're saying\nOther people just want to marginalizing vilify but Donald Trump ... balanced is when we start looking at this I Can't imagine a Democrat fighting this because you know that in Mexico he basically fortified Mexican workers unions\nDo you know that he is going to help every ... lower middle class person get to middle class status because the wages will go up now we might pay a little extra for cars but\nThe average American be willing to do that knowing that we're bringing some control back to auto manufacturing and some plants back here where at least made it close but\nWhat about the dairy farmers to put this president in office they now or getting access to the Canadian market\nAnd not having the ridiculous tariffs and the only thing that ... has got that I could tell him sounds like you know more details than I Do is is this uh this the outside court to do to solve trade dispute just still\nIt's still a factor the Canadians wanted that we didn't we gave in there\nBut Justin Trudeau gave in at the eleventh hour\nSo those people who say the president just fighting with the world are not noticing that the world is coming to agreement and with the president said yesterday about Justin Trudeau is true you know he was tough negotiator uh we were going at it for a while but there's no hard feelings so here's what the president said\nAbout uh Justin Trudeau and the NAFTA thing because I should give it a I should give it proper or said um\nHe's a professional I'm a professional we had very strong tensions and it was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or Canada and now it's a fair deal for everybody it's much different deal to a brand new do not NAFTA re done it's a brand new deal I just spoke with them we have a great relationship but we're going to work as a partner\nAnd was keeping the steel and aluminum tariffs then I'm not sure why we're doing that when I asked\nA when I asked a Peter Navarro why you're leaving that and he says it's apples and oranges I don't get it I thought we did that to bring them to the table so about this deal and thanks so much for the call Peter Morici was on Fox and print search this morning around four Fifteen that quickly or emailed a Eric to see if we could pull this off\nThis is a bigger message it's a bigger message beyond North America cut forty\nHitter the Europeans said and this is important that you know that Mexicans agreeing was one thing but don't think we're going to roll over like the Mexicans 'cause you know you you've got a lot of leverage their Canada\nWhich is really squarely in the European camps got a free trade agreements with Europe and Britain won't have this is a clear message that China and Europe that this president is serious about not putting America above all other countries or really America First\nBut by putting America on an equal footing and giving American workers a fair and decent chance at competing in the world\nYeah so is a mess because we are dealing with them on on some level by the way this just in march judge good friend of Brett Kavanaugh when he was in high school has a ... had an interview yesterday it wasn't done it's finished\nSo mark judge would definitely be on the on the hit list you have or the woman friend of a doctor Ford she's on the hit list Dr Ford might be I'm not sure they have hours of testimony with her and might not be necessary\nOr ... might ah with the one we saw yesterday I don't think she should be I think she's an absolute travesty of justice and if I'm a Democrat\nI tell them ... and his client you muddy the waters on the farcical claims from Brett Kavanaugh and you try it almost de legitimize is the other two the Debbie were mirrors the students and that's why\nAlan Dershowitz at one of the FBI investigation and I would have started with Julie not with the doctor for\nA NATO why because it's such a joke or Steve listening in Indiana Hey Steve\nNot with the doctor for a NATO why because it's such a joke or Steve listening in Indiana Hey Steve\nHow're you doing great will tell you mine\nWell I listened to your diatribe regarding the soccer kid that his mom is now suing because he didn't make JV\nWho was thrown out and I yeah I'm listening to the on the radio so I didn't see what was going on\nBut I just wanted to point out I agree with you a hundred percent unless I find out you through ice\nThrough I I'm Sorry I I'm leaving on your own\nPace Steve I might have done worse in ... in high school I think I might have done something I regret in high school and college do you think anyone listening right now has done things in high school and college they regret\nI can be perfectly honest with you that I Walk the fence mostly through high school and college and I was fortunate enough to fall on the good side I turned out to be a pretty good guy a but I'll tell you I had some close calls\nYeah and a lot of people listening now I'm not as if people say well what about sexual okay it's an accusation that Brett Kavanaugh

S. MCA or after two point oh or however you want to raise it uh there there are when there are winds for dairy there are winds spur the wheat growers are are wins for other ag producers when it comes to the U.S cattle man or woman\nThere isn't much in the agreement shore it secures a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico shore were working on rebuilding those relationships but we're missing a crucial part of the agreement which was a lost opportunity to to reestablish a country of origin labeling program\nCould you know I'm I'm gonna I'm not going to argue with you on this okay live but I Will push back so that people understand exactly where the U.S the stands on this the origin of beef can be labeled voluntarily right now can't it\nIt it sure can yep\nOkay there just needs to be some economic incentive out there to do it now what have you seen that a that would indicate consumers are willing to pay for the cost of absurd to find your gender the beep\n[noise] you know we've seen many studies I Know the national farmers union yesterday quoted that Ninety percent of consumers not only are demanding this origin information but are willing to pay for it uh\nThere is this increased a need for consumers to know where they're beep comes from and that\nIs something that we should be able to provide them and uh you know the the U. S. cattle means association we were the ones in twenty Fifteen when the WTO a ruling was coming down on us and we saw that a mandatory country wasn't labeling was headed for repeal\nWe worked with senator Debbie Stabenow and many others in the Senate to bring forth a voluntary country of origin labeling program and and that bill would've preserve that program at USDA so it would have kept that program on the books that we could've avoided a lot of these issues where we're seeing now where a\nMeat Packers can bring in beef from outside the country [noise]\nHaven't undergo a significant transformation which is\nAs significant a sticking a knife in it and then claiming that made in the usa label so we were for that voluntary labeling program unfortunately others were not and we we saw the retail country of origin labeling and twenty Fifteen\nYeah so the significant transformation every time I see that Leah ... is\nA kind of grand because I don't it's such a strange description of what the beef has to go through what exactly you you just said stick a knife in it is that all of this\nHonestly yeah that's what we heard from the U. S. D. A. because I'm right there with your chip when I heard significant transformation well that could mean a lot that could mean no did undergo a a transformation that qualifies for made in usa label but what they told us from the department was that that meant either like trimming\nOr re packaging or honestly and this was a direct quote stick a knife in it so that could be an insignificant transformation at least from where I'm standing\nNear ... there's there's no question about it and you know I think what we're talking about here Leah is there is some of the consumer preferences that we're dealing with\nIn a very very much changing consumer environment author writes the consumers do want to know more about the food that they are consuming\nAnd that the origin of the beef is\nFor for ... Peters out there that might be very close to the top of the list of of what they want to know\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah truthful labeling has been a huge concern a especially this year with the renegotiation of of NAFTA and with the labeling of alternative proteins and I know a that's a topic for a whole nother day but yeah truthful labeling consumers are are demanding it\nYeah no question but the thing that has always concerned mainly a and I'm not saying that I understand the the the cost structure in the labeling process and and the certifying over the origin\nBut it is that uh that added cost and and you know how it is in the in farming and ranching or means any ... cost on the production side gets passed right down to the producer themselves\nIt it it concerns me that we need to get paid a premium for the product in the ... case if it is us origin and that that might be tough to get\nLook yeah you are on the right path way there there is certainly a cost associated with labeling but I don't think it has any more uh impact on that final costs of the product in fact I think consumers would pay more for that us beef in in the meat counter a\nProducers watch country of origin labeling we are ready\nTo to do whatever it takes to bring back a viable\nWTO compliance country of origin labeling program\nA and whether that means a added procedures on the farmer ranch we're talking trace ability or there's been a large job than in the countryside on animal trace ability or that could tie directly into this new a new re establishment of a country of origin labeling program\n... absolutely there you go up next up next up Japan another huge market for us to be and it's a big market already but it could be much bigger\n[laughter] yes absolutely no so that was another part of the good news of last week of the president and Japanese prime minister sat down\nThey released a joint statement affirming the importance of a strong stable and mutually beneficial trade relationship that's a direct quote a which is good there was not anything formalized there and that meeting but having such a\nStatement really helps both countries move forward in these discussions and and hopefully we can ... help um you know capitalize on some of that\nThere was concern that we would have lost out on market share after the uh the U.S pulled out of the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP us and we're hoping that we can help gain some of that lost ground there in and move forward with Japan\nBoy if we could find a pass away to some lower tariffs on us be going into Japan that would be a win win situation there and then of course Leo there's the ... you would put and go to sue us to be able to do is that a big were under my saddle\nOh goodness yeah the e you ah have we heard anything from the EU it seems like things have been pretty stalled over there they have been grinding their heels into the ground and a really\nAvoiding any sort of trade talks especially when it comes to us be if I Know there's been some positive movement in other industries but uh the the us beef into the emu I'm not sure we're going\nLet's see if I Know there's been some positive movement and other industries but uh that the u._s. peace in the email I'm not sure we're going to see it here this year or or even next year\nYeah you know you talk about a protectionist market that you use the market is about as protectionist as it gets it if we can find any way to put a change in their armor I'm all for it Leah Leah thank you so much for joining us really appreciate it\nThanks for having me absolutely that's Leah beyond oh she is the director of policy and outreach for the U.S cattle men's association asset African swine fever what if it shows up here in the U.S we're talking about that next on average on\nFirst generation farmers are special breed farm journal business senator ... how these unicorns tell their story on a new hunter the first year\nOh absolutely it it would have to be brought in somehow I mean yes you know we were we talking about these viruses a s F a foot in mouth disease classical swing fever we kinda almost given this you know like mythical you know ability to ... apparently it's not the case um it would be brought in you know it's not just going to spontaneously pop up\nRight okay so obviously the U.S is doing a lot we've got our bias security efforts out out on farms but what if it happens or what if we do get a confirmed case of a U.S up here in the U.S what's the protocol OK\nSo and anybody in your listening audience that you can go to USDA's website and they have what they called the ... website\nAnd on that website is the um a SF strategy document that USDA will use in the face of an outbreak um now each state has a response plan as well and those response plans are are to mesh together so you have\nBasically your state that's office and their counterparts in the federal office veterinarians they're\nUm they're basically going to be in charge at the state level and so since this is a regulatory disease they have the regulatory authority\n'em to do what they need to do and so the industry plays a supportive role um to the state of animal health officials as there I'm stepping up what they call their incident command in order to um respond to the discovery of a U.S up and stuff is tricky\nUm unlike F empty and see us F where there are vaccines A. S. F. doesn't have a vaccine\nAnd so what we end up with as a disease where you have to use Disease Control measures stop movements quarantine uh and and high levels of biosecurity to control it you don't have another tool in your tool box so that's what China's experiencing right now is how do you control movements to prevent the spread of disease but not destroy your industry\nBy wrapping up too many people that don't have the disease and can't stay in business so at the state level the first thing that the state is going to do is they're going to if they're the unlucky state with the first case\nThey will be setting up a Disease Control area and a couple of critical things need to happen in that area for them to get to the point where they're going to do things other than stop movements first they got to know where everybody is and so that's why the pork industry has been so I'm a progressive with premises registration\nUm state that's going to have to find all of those holdings that have pigs and we also need to know other things that fall in the area where those pigs could pass through like a packing plant or buying station\nOr sale barn so first they have to identify who's in that area a second thing they've got to do is I got to communicate to them\nAll right so what's the new rules what can you can't you do what will you be looking for how do you report if you think you may have the disease I'm and more importantly hey when do you need to move next um you know these type of things for the welfare of the animals are going to be important because if I throw up let's say a a ten kilometer Disease Control area\nI'm going to wrap up a lot more producers that don't have the disease then do right and but all of them are going to be treated the same and they won't be able to move until they can demonstrate their different\nSo the state to got to know where you're at gotta communicate\nThe minute that we have a SF our our status in the country of of a sci fri goes away and so sites would have to start developing a status and so that means testing that surveillance testing in the area so that would have to occur and you'd have to be taking samples according to the protocols at the state federal health officials give you and then reporting those results back out to them\nAnd then there's the elevated by security on all the sites and what what do you have to do as a producer that doesn't have the disease to keep the disease off at a ... with a high enough confidence that the state back in\nThe security on all the sites you know what what do you have to do as a producer that doesn't have the disease to keep the disease off at a ... with a high enough confidence to state back and then start looking at ... Richie aiding you out and so\nUm stop movements the sites that do have um African swing fever\nUm you can bet that are probably the first step there is going to be a euthanasia industrial zone and cleaning up this infection of that site that's it that's probably going to be a given 'em and that's just part of you know how you try to control the ... like I said we don't have other tools we don't have a bad idea that you could bring to bear so you know\nAnother challenge with a U.S up at this particular strain that's been floating around over in Russia and eastern and western a you and and now he's the one that he thinks in China this one's pretty pretty aggressive it's pretty virulent so\nDoes a really good job of getting in and you know the animals get it you know they're going to die a but over time and and in other parts of the world where there are different um different strains of of air so\nThey've kind of adopted a little bit and so these animals can become carriers and kick ironic disease so that that's a bit different than say put mouth disease if it gets put mouth diseases they have some blisters you don't have to you know you ... and because of welfare reasons they'll recovered kind of like if they were to get flu\nThe other thing with the family and there is NO CARRIER state unfortunately SF there is\nSo again you're you have to fall back to the whole you know euthanasia disposal and\nPreventing things from moving okay we've only got about Fifteen seconds here Patrick of what about impacts on exports doesn't shut down exports to deport from that area yeah you\nKnow since we're on the it's\nOne of these diseases on the list of the world or organization parental health has [noise] ah we would see that first year or do the fact that we will be shut out of our export markets an eight billion dollar loss in revenue to the pork industry\nAnd for billions of corn in one point five soybeans\nDebts bottom lining in right there Patrick thank you so much for the time today really appreciate it thanks for having me you bet that Patrick ... director swine health programs for the national sport\nCBS Sports radio weeknight six Saturdays it for Sunday's would want my\nFeet are killing me and my boots are shy all of my shoes are all ... out is that\nListen up you're both in luck and the kids do renegade boot training they always back\nYou are right now through October twenty they're bringing it over here when we're in any condition and take twenty percent fair use your twenty percent trading just cannot work the western goes back to the kids even are huge so casual shoes it's easy all you have to do is dig through your closet is binding old\nOut uncomfortable even though I was like pack up those ages you bring them over the gate and claim your stating festival all usable trades will be donated to the ... and send to those in need across the globe today the day to get value for the invaluable and help them re caught so happened that fucking hit a renegade working western\nInside the sense that pleasant next target in Norfolk\nA great deal I tend to renegade you can all guy renegade your camera because we have to work in fashion headquarters\nHey thanks for coming from our house warming wouldn't have missed it for anything so what do you think fantastic we're thinking about building during this next year you better get to ... now and ... century lumber center we started playing with century longer center last year that gave us plenty of time to get things right before I'm building started\nThey were right on our budget that price and the quality of products they delivered were exactly what we want it will be going to ... percent or\nTomorrow the the experts today by where the builders by century lumber shattered downtown Norfolk [noise]\nKnow JAG sky watching whether the whether our weather center\nSome patchy drizzle it's still possible end of the day today as we otherwise stay cloudy with either low sixties southeast Wednesday tend to Fifteen cloudy skies tonight temperatures steady in the sixties and a chance for a few showers or a storm\nGets the shower storm early Wednesday or by high temperature readings in the mid eighties with gusty winds up all probably for news talk W.

yeah\nVery strong labor support right there at five oh five we was pretty ho hum at midday came on and and finish strong it does feel like there might be some new news coming in this market or it could be exactly what you said we was just doing a little bit of catch up to what the corn and soybean markets did yesterday\nThat year yeah yeah\nI got all support for that I mean I did ... you better be a ... and living there and Milwaukee for that long good great great so so give me your prediction what's gonna happen\nWell I think the cubs are going to win and then the cubs get another shot at the brewers and I think the brewers are a relief staff and their bats when this yeah\nAll right so that gets you to go to a series and they make it to the world series look at you you're stepping right out there you know the national league I'm Sorry it is a tough tough son of a gun this year isn't it a beach\nYeah and I ... at the American league teams look like the they're they're probably set up at this point and whoever comes out here American League I mean they look pretty strong and uh\nUh but I looked\nLike they looked like how hard is traded today widely mix yeah their records are either unbelievable or they suck\nRight and and uh you know for the like the cubs a cards are stacked against them I mean we've played what forty five games last forty seven days or something foolish like that I mean you know it's just the year it is we were without a\nAre closer um were ... back today yeah so uh we'll see but uh he's probably going to be pretty wild I Would\nNot pitch for a month he\nCould you could write him out there every day and you'd still be worried about where the ball's gonna end up I just don't do it again okay Wilson could end up in your ear\n[laughter] All right we'll take a guy on base\n[laughter] All right let's get to what's going on in these markets Jeff we've got some really good news here over the last couple of weeks when it comes to trade issues South Korea last week um Mexico Canada agreement this week uh it it it feels like we've got momentum going in the right direction\nYou also got to throw in the fact that we're we ... announced today that we're going to do TPA talks with Japan\nYeah and there's also plans to talk to the Europeans so what we're doing is we're basically getting these bilateral try lateral deal done and we're going to isolate the Chinese and we're gonna make it very difficult for them to continue their shenanigans\nIn the world Trade Organization of not following the rules right so hopefully this changes it for everybody to the benefit\nAnd and in the long run it turns out to be a very good deal for agriculture for the world markets and a ... for all those other you know developing countries that have been kind of shunted aside by the Chinese or economic machine\nYeah you know Brian Jeff brings up a really good point there when when they ascended to the world Trade Organization status\nOr that we thought that I read I remember writing the story for pro farmer saying that this was a big win for the world because they now they've got it will abide by the rules of the world Trade Organization well somebody forgot to tell China\nWell in ... you know the argument has been are they a developing country are they a developed country you know the the whole along the line here and uh you know the world's number two economy I'm a huge buyer of commodities obviously the world's largest buyer commodities ah\nBut ah I Do think that if in the end\nWe can get them to the point where it's a level playing field or level or the you know what it is now a it's a huge win right uh we just have to get to that point we are going through those pains right now but\nJust exactly right uh what we're doing is or in the Trump Administration and you can argue whatever size you want on what he's done with the trade stuff\nBut uh he's trying to now stack everybody against China and if you get that done a then it becomes harder I think for China in the long run a you know\nThat they're going to hold out as long as they can but let's keep that night I they're digging in their heels here um you know they they don't want to be embarrassed but the fact of the matter is\nUm they're they're having to source food from other countries have every right to the United states right now and uh that becomes more difficult the longer this thing goes I guess\nIt was probably about a month ago you turned me onto the fact that there was some social unrest that was starting to bubble up inside of China what's the update their\nIt's it's very difficult to get a lot of information out of there seems like the government is really trying to crack down in fact the New York times at a store yesterday saying that the government has told the\nThe uh the government controlled media outlets not to report any negative economic news read so they're clamping down on information um\nI I don't I have a lot I don't have a Chinese yeah in or reading ability to try to follow anybody on\nTwitter or anything like that but\nThere is a groundswell from what I've been told from people that are in the no is it just no one wants to get stuck in a position that could cause hardship for them or their families\nAnd a is a situation that can only get worse if something more catastrophic happens with Africans wind fever now they got avian flu over there I mean if they start to have problems not be the mail to feed themselves at a reasonable price than things could really get a little more nasty\nYeah and the age when you come or when you get right to the bottom line if you get enough social unrest going in China\nThe Chinese leadership isn't going to have a lot of choice left then they've got to come to the table\nExactly right and you keep your eye on the CPI the consumer pork index okay because you know it it's consumer price and yes but pork accounts for thirty percent of that in China and ... and keep an eye on that pork prices are still down year over year about ... I think four point nine percent as of last reading\nUm so you know they don't have an issue right now but those pork prices are rising relative to what they were there are still below year ago but they're they're rising uh keep that in mind when when that starts to turn off your over a year\nNow they they've got some issues that they have to be addressed and and I think that that's probably a one and it gets a little bit more difficult for the Chinese\nOkay now let's go back to South Korea here for just second Brian I'm\nWell and in Mexico and Canada the next step there is we need to have Congress ratified these trade agreements mhm uh with the amount of political\nUnrest that we've got in our Congress will get done\nA there are question marks a obviously a ... you know if we didn't have Canada involved in it was just a U.S and Mexico bilateral and then there were going to be some major question marks and it probably wasn't going to get through Congress based on what we heard um but uh uh I think it will add in Canada\nIt really puts the pressure on Congress now to approve it ... it would be very difficult I think they would have to go back and prove\nThat this was a deal that is worse for the United states than what the the old NAFTA was or what the current NAFTA is and uh I I don't think based on our initial ratings of it and then now says that I've seen from others are that this is a better deal and as a result it's going to be really hard to vote down\nYeah Jeff even Schumer\nGave gave Trump a little bit of a preys on this deal\n[laughter] how can you not give them a little bit of praise I mean he talks everyone thought he was dead and water with NAFTA you know everyone you know it was we were we were all mad about\nJumping out of the Asian free trade agreement ride a year ago and now here we are we got Korea and the ... we've got Japan coming in you know basically what the markets are saying is\nWe don't really want to or the funds are saying we don't really want to be short just in case something happens so we're adding a little bit of risk premium and the funds are starting to slowly get uh they're pretty big net short positions especially in corn and beans\nYeah and Brian for that to happen at this time of year that might give us an opportunity to do kind of a a very uh organized I guess I Would say a rotation of positions in here because all this grain coming into the commercials we got a quarter of the corn crop already harvested it's gotta be hatched\nIt it it does and and you know we're in a interesting situation like Jeff mentioned with the fun so heavily short are coming out of those now or the the rotation of the commercial side of things which has been long a moving into short where a\n... it's going to be an interesting time I do know that history says that are in big crop years when we know that the the crop size is really big\nAnd the low now that doesn't mean that we're just going to go screaming higher price\nWise but it does give us the opportunity when the funds covered those short position to offset some of that seasonal much pressure yeah\nYeah but boy the timing is really nice with those\nFunds rolling out of the short position at a time when a hedge requirement is on the way up okay we're talking with former editor brain Grady Pearl Harbor senior market analyst Jeff Wilson right here on a TV [noise]\nWelcome to no man's land a new podcast from us farm report has ...\nBacon is that the way the quarter a lot of people who are vegetarians\nThat has to be thinking of our listeners bacon is the gateway me I invite you to join each week if shine a spotlight on powerful women and agriculture fallen ... all women in agriculture knowing where no man has gone before\nThe difference on corn or we don't anticipate encourage changes right off for more USDA was back in June round soybeans we anticipated reductions so you actually could get an increase in the field on soybeans\nReduction and acres and it offsets in in a wash right or you know I I think that that's maybe a or we get some potential of friendly data on soybeans sided\nThing okay so Jeff we've got this attitude that big crafts get bigger yet we raised a the the price of pressure that we've seen since uh September twelfth crop production report and both corn and soybeans I mean what gives there\nWas typical of democracy over shoot so we got undervalued which is clear when you can basically by us beans pay the twenty five percent Chinese tariffs and ... for less than you can ship amount of Brazil so the price has got to cheap\nAnd just thinking about this way the price of beans from the U.S is probably cheaper than the cost of production anywhere in the world so why wouldn't demand start to improve and the same as almost grew with the core of the court that you've ...\nIn the world to encourage us five prices so we're we're going to control the markets or anything that's outside of China for a while here we may receipts or you're heading to China\nI mean that the problem is you really take that risk unless you're a government owned\nA entity over there and ... had the government maybe do something to your longer term\nBut it does appear that uh you know the price it got too low and now we're back up to or what would probably be considered a pretty fair value based on what we know today with anticipation of maybe bigger crops in the October eleventh grab a crop record and then we just need to see how it all plays out\nI Do think the farms want to start getting along commodities that means is so great golden today up Fifteen dollars ... at a four year high\nSo the tide is turning stocks are at record highs want to keep putting money in the stock market where you want to buy something that is relatively either undervalued or at fair value with the chance it could go higher\nGas it it almost feels a little bit like you're talking about an inflationary situation\nOne of the ... going to fight that they've already said to raise rates\nAnother four times and the next year so uh you know it may be inflationary and a few spots here and there but uh the fact that we had this rally in the in the grains in the face of the uh the dollar index rising through a I think it was a two and a half week director and a half months I today\nYeah pretty pretty telling in itself so\nMaybe that is and what's important maybe it's all about appreciation of of that underlying assets than just a higher interest rates you know I don't think anybody thinks inflation's going back there for five percent but three percent inflation that could that could give a ... a ... a boost the commodities\nAbsolutely absolutely be just lets a switch gears a little bit go to livestock uh the the us MCA agreement\n... we felt like we had good odds of getting an agreement with Mexico any way by this solidifies that boy it it it makes you feel better about our chances continue our pork exports where they need to be\nDefinitely and and rising numbers you need more demand and and the you know the one that's red hot right now not the domestic demand is is poor by any means but the export demand is red hot and uh you know both pork and beef and and we need that we have rising a hog supplies rising a feedlot supplies\nAnd uh so you need that extra demanded chew through it and and uh these trade deals are we've talked a lot about what they mean to the grain markets but they mean as much if not more to the meat markets or you know and and\nBecause we're talking about gaining access or or more access to uh Mexico obviously on on the porch side of things uh South Korea now with Japan I mean we're talking about you know top five customers here all\nAll of them yeah yeah you know people talk about South Korea heck they bought one point two billion dollars worth of beef from the U.S and now we've got a better trade deal with uh yeah and and I think that\nA lot of times in the marketplace that gets lost because the the ... so easy to focus on\nUh that the meats kind of get brushed aside and and you know oh you know it it's these are great deals for the U.S on on the the meat side of things yeah\nSo what the real quick what your attitude in the livestock markets moving forward well a cattle their bumping up against a you know their contract ties right now so we have to watch that and make sure that we're still moving forward the cash market still needs to strengthen because we have the futures out in front of the cash\nSo that's a key component there the the Packer margins remain very strong ah we just have to get them to use more of their margin or to pass onto the producer and did pass down the line\nOr on the uh the hog side of things\nHuge recovery twenty five dollars that we've seen in the futures a Contra seasonal have those yeah you know through late summer into fall or\nCan we keep it going [noise]\nYou know what what are we going to do to to moved that forward I think in in that's going to come down to the cash fundamental\nAlright thank Brian [noise] and Jeff we'll see you on Thursday and Milwaukee [noise]\nFox News Sunday Sunday

and physical and I mean it just it really brought it to I was proud of him and uh you know he's he hasn't said a word when everybody else was getting the ball and they just kept plugging and did a great job\nDrunk games aside from week Seventeen last year where we're Travis ... he was an active\nDenver's really struggled to have an answer for him thirty seven targets twenty six receptions almost four hundred yards and two touchdowns\nIt appeared that part of their defensive game plan was to take your tied in and out of Patrick homes tool belt in for the first three quarters they were able to do that but in the fourth quarter you go to your temple often and it's as if Travis just said enough is enough and he began to roared alive yeah he made some uh\nSome a ransom nice rouse mission plays especially yards after the catch and they did they were\nThey they uh got after him a little bit early and they got after ... and the guys just kept kept pounding and Patrick Patrick what can you say some great things have worked hard on him throw a left handed and you know it makes life so I'm a ... you know the guy stepped up and I thought\nJust at a nice job overall ... and you take all three phases so the defense when when we need to step up their defense stepped up and before the half at the end of the game and listen to end with twenty five and ... it was unbelievable there so I mean it just all in all\nGreat win for this team short weeks we gotta we gotta get ourselves right back on and get going if he can\nPress schedules are just part of the challenge of the national football league these days you mentioned to my homes you mentioned the left handed through he had a number of long conversions after what seem like a plague of very untimely second half penalties what does this type of signature when do for a young quarterback\nWell you know listen you're looking at being ahead and ah everybody's what's he going to do with adversity or against adversity and\nAnd ah so you had that today we're behind and\nThings weren't going all that smooth it is a nice job defensively against us um he got hit and and we had penalties and we're going backwards long heritage situations and so now you've got to see what he does an adverse conditions ah\nWhereas back to the wall and they move around and may plays and got away from pressure and and do the things\nThat you need to do to win the game I'm proud of for doing\nYeah it's hard not to be impressed by this young man you know we've been preaching all week last week on the air about how important it is to look beyond the points allowed when judging a defense how fans need to consider the context\nWhat Bob settings defense does and the conditions for why they're doing it I said yesterday on the pregame show\nOr the chiefs defensive held opponents to an average of two points in the first quarter and just two points in the final five minutes of each game\nYesterday they do that again they hold the Broncos to three in the first quarter three in the fourth quarter the moral to this story is really about your defense playing tough when the game is on the line\nAnd yesterday was another example of that for ... for having a monster Dave Parker with an interception another huge is Mitch would say timely sack by who else the whole gallon daily\nBut the game is still in hand and you bring into passing you for the injured deep Ford evaluate Ninety two used performance for us\nYeah so does grind tightened up and [noise] a ton of comes in and uh puts it out there you know he did a great job I thought I was just pressure and and just being big it was six foot seven and he played six foot Seventy you got came off the ball and they came off again and again and again as I did a real nice show could certainly\nThings to clean up I mentioned the untimely penalties while the Broncos two running backs Philip Lindsay and always Freeman man they deserve a lot of credit for the way they ran there seemed to be an inordinate amount of missed tackles and some over pursuit how does this game help you improve how do you get better from last night's contest\nBut you can't have ... we would say that it's\nA big gains and all of a sudden you're coming back and\nA huge in the foot we have a turtle or if it was a great job a turnover in the way of penalties and and so it takes you out of either a field goal or a touchdown ah with big plays happen so we've got to make sure\nThat we take advantage of opportunities and uh when we do well on defense you follow it up and do well in office and that's as how to sing real\nWell we know how the NFL roles in that schedule was released last spring we all looked at it and said wow this first six games are going to be tough sitting here at four knows wonderful but we're looking straight into the can and they called the Jacksonville Jaguars who won three straight two of those wins against the falcons and Vikings
