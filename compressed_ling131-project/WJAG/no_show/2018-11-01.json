there was a Nicorette ...\nFor the tigers\nRatings games sell by carries for forty yards but that is the uh that's on the very unofficial Jeffrey stat sheet\n[laughter] second out at about five yards to go\nHave better to have an unofficial statues and no statute at all I Will stress on the one very unofficial counting as quick as I can hear [laughter]\nJak information Eisenhower\nFixed or gives a hand up and\nAnd that's a woman [noise]\nCan and finally brought down just genuinely Christian I'm standing nearby answered it highlights [noise] rape that your job I'm not even ...\nSo many just dug all through the middle of the defense and almost broke into all the way but was able to be taken down at the eleven yard line so first intend for the beans up the house than eleven with three Fifteen to go\n... thirty eight yard Gallup here on my cat ... eighty eight yard for the night he has been the workhorse with obese than I\nAm the bees will spread things out here they have to receive it to the right one of the last\nHere's the handoff number thirty six with the ball and there's a Logan Johnson gets down to about five or six yard line [noise] it'd be after the five [noise]\nGood job of rumbling and bought one therefore him he gets about six yards and and that gives a book deal a second in short [noise]\nIt's just use third carry a tonight he's been a little under utilized but when he got use them in a tearing up the real estate he is boy you wanna you wanna feed the monster\nThat's right keep keep feeding them on certain that's a boom feel is\nLooking like they're in position to score again here are they going to spread things out again to the right one of the left [noise]\nJohnson in next died in Harris faked Eisenhower Eisenhower looking now he's going to cause a number of flips does right let's say he goes in the end zone but I think it's got to be called back and we\nMight have a whole [noise] Eisenhower does get into the ends on for the touchdown but we'll see what the penalty of\n... bills walking back the other way so the bees obviously feel it's going to be\nAgainst them and the penalty is against them it's holding [noise]\nSoviet ... federally moving back ten and that'll the gate the Eisenhower touchdown Seventeen to go here in the first half [noise]\nBut that is the only Bloomfield second a penalty than I Do believe or twenty five yards or versus the what do we think poor penalties against Osman worth fifty so ... in the middle is for twice the artist tonight it's pretty tough when you down sixty eight [noise]\nSo the bees will spread things up this time or to the left in one of the right as the Eisenhower picked snap\nBooks now goes to his right you scrambling still looking I was going to throw it across the sides of the middle\nTouched down for the ball field being doing car getting only reception in the end zone I think this one's going to get called back to\nEisenhower may have been passed the line of scrimmage [noise]\nWe'll see what the what the penalty is gonna be\nOh wow yeah he was well fast scrimmage about about forty arts yeah so that's a that's a legal forward pass you have Eisenhower other why the scrimmage just about the sixteen yard line and I let that go from about Thirteen so he was about\nThree yards past the line of scrimmage and or was it was a great pass going going the other way kept wide open in the in the middle of the ends on there and I caught the past but uh again or not only there for being passed a line of scrimmage\nAnd that is a a spot fall so that'll be a ... yard penalty from the spot of the fall so that's going to march back to where where are they about the ... Eighteen yard line now [noise]\nSo ... that that's a minus two yards on that penalty to but\nIt's a Lhasa down and so now third down and Eighteen\nEach autocrats in his body and that usually meets with an interception and it was just about intercepted\nAyers Bloomfield here's a decent and getting the ball up the metal gets down to about the a yard line\nSo there'll be facing a fourth down if they can get a first down at about that to them about a fourth in six\nHere with one forty seven to go here in the first half\nBoy that puts a branch gives them an over a hundred yards from the Knight on the unofficial Jeffrey sketchy one hundred and two yards\nAnd you know considering the way this thing started out with both teams are three and out for a new series a that's a quite a\nQuite an effort here ... years running downhill right now\nDue to the right one of the left for the bees\nEisenhower fix your hand up now also the left side he's going to try to get to the first down and I don't think he did [noise]\nHe is out about that about the four yard lines is not to yard shorter the first down and the tigers are all on the on the effort there and that\nKeeps the square sixty date with one night and he's going to have all even her own territory\nWhere in remembered that stop too because that is huge cause of Bluefield scores there and goes back to touchdowns going to ask\nYou know just a from a psychological standpoint a pretty tough now Osman can or maybe didn't run the clock out here will see their deep in their own territory you don't want to make a ... here and turn the ball over in a still give up the score before halftime\nThose teams to try it out in the final Seventy nine seconds\nFind that over center power formation\nHe's going to take a sticker right up the middle and uh\nIt's about seven yards out at night I still carry that for a Hyman coming out of the quarterback sneak situation one tend to go here in the first half of them\nYou don't want to do anything fancy down there you just want to go forward and not backwards and you're in the shadow of of their goal post here\nSo I was on with the ball second down in about four from their own eleven yard line fifty five seconds left here in the first half\nWas on the left side\nAnd brought down by about three or four room feels defenders gets to the fourteen yard line and I believe that's gonna be a first down [noise]\nSee when the spot that [noise]\nThere's going to be sure it's going to be about a half year old sure she'll be third down in less than one as the clock runs who was forty seconds to go here in the first half\nOff and maybe just contests\nHalf the our shores of ether down in less than one as the clock runs that we're forty seconds to go here in the first half\nOff and maybe just content with a\nRound the clock out here we'll see\nWe'll see what they're doing shotgun formation island takes it goes to his right side that's back to the point Fifteen to Seventeen and down to about twenty yard line it's a first down there and and stops the clock would only or seconds left in the first house in Iceland thereby I'm into a gift genes will be for us running neck gets in the shadow the ends on\nTime and it would just like to maybe find some a real estate and a waste the kid would get into some space here look out but right now it's just ball security we don't want to make a mistake might try something now that we've gotten a\nOut do about the uh what twenty two yard line\nVersus Jen I'm looking to his left looking just I'm not so long are we go\nHere's cancer mom and I kinda under thrown [noise] Eisenhower was there on defense that was kind of another thrown ball I don't think and I'm really had a\nUm I I have to credit him he he runs the play give it to pass away he's looking for receivers down field but we saw a late in the second happier you get called for a throwing the ball half the wind a scrimmage yeah a lot of green space in front of you know I I think he he could have probably darted left in may have been able to run the ball in himself\nA but that's probably just good discipline the coaches wanting to look down the field and throw the ball but as it is he's got himself six Russia's work forty four yards in\nLogan Johnson the big the big band pulled back he's get three carries for for well earned yards or a Bloomfield uh Trenton hopes he's got to catch is one for Eighteen one for Thirteen totally thirty three yards on the jeopardy unofficial stat list\nAnd a quarter of ... you know we knew coming into Anthony Hyman the quarterback or he's the he's the guy the teacher on off and he runs the ball a lot he does throw it and as a matter of fact thanks to that arm or they're on the board but Anthony he's got Thirteen carries for twenty four yard so obviously that average isn't real good\nA lot of times he goes forward seven yards and the next day he'll go backwards seven yards or credit the Bloomfield rush for that Josh can demand has to carries\nFor minus two yards and kind of ... has a ... yard Gallup and adjusted ... with a a three yard run tonight to cap off the rushing for a ... tonight but let's run through the scoring summary for you\nAre in the know scoring in the first quarter at the end of the first quarter it was a no score at all and then with nine eleven to go in the second quarter\n... or the one yard run to the point after a few points puts Bloomfield up eight nothing and then it was seven Thirteen to go in the second quarter was driving deepened Bloomfield territory but a pass was tipped twice and that uh they gave us a Bloomfield picked it up to nine yard line\nAnd Bloomfield would later on score was Bible or to go with the second quarter rating Eisenhower with that thirty eight yard Gallup to pay dirt and the point after the two point conversion was good\nAnd that put loop deal to sixteen nothing and we said at that point that I was ... to answer and they did indeed was four o nine to go in the first half it was Hyman to justice Martin's on a forty eight yard TD pass the point after was good and that's where we stand here\nBloomfield sixteen and ... eight and we're at half time\nWe'll take another quick break send it back to the station here and we'll bring it back and we'll be ready for a second half action here up in Bloomfield Nebraska Jeffrey and

twenty Eighteen with blue ... sixty to eight a and as we head into\nThe second half my cards or what has to happen for the ... tigers are\nWell I'll tell you that the the first thing you gotta do is just south of the families I think that for families are all three of them were major penalties in the first after you you know you really cannot I give a give up yard is like that in a when you get to the playoffs and that they really do a better job of being a little more discipline or in a couple of settled down and as if\nThey show that they can throw the ball fairly well I think if they can\nThey can they mix set off a little bit more and I\nGet to get the ball to ah to Britain's and and that gets off of their receivers I think they got a chance to to they open up your all of it and make this a really interesting okay\nWhen Anthony Hyman you know credit him for the the passing game because the Bluefield Raasch is just really something else than it is all as men can do\nTo keep them out of Anthony's face the past that he's got not gotten away I mean he's just literally just gotten them away he doesn't have much time you step back he's got about two seconds to find new receiver so uh the past that he has grown they've been quick\nLast down the field otherwise it's been Anthony Hyman right Anthony Hyman left for a\nFor us and so a little one dimensional right now and you can kinda see that uh you can see the difference um Bloomfield is a little warm or they've got a dual threat quarterback now he can throw the ball but he can take off and run but obviously the workhorse ... spring it's an easel and if you're ... I don't know how you find\nA way to slow that guy down but you got to if you slow him down or you got a chance here\nReally got it penetrates on of attacking and try to get that get into that field there before they they get a chance to add to your guinea a kind of momentum going and yeah and uh but you know I think that's still is the game is up for grabs will be of Shamsi how he how these two teams come out here in the second half\nIt should be fun you know and it and it's fun when you when you're in the playoffs part of the season and you've got to close neighbors playing each other you know it's tough but you know sooner or later you get to play a everybody but it's always good when you have to go on the road\nIn the play offs and you only have to drive about twenty miles\nDriving five six hours like like a Helen how to do today against John Rocker I\nYeah and uh and it happened so it uh Bloomfield went tonight and they will travel Johnson rock that's got to be a what a three and a half hour or hour drive for them or at least in the field and if your husband if you went to a football game you go home and you wait for Johnson ... column on anew and they've got to make their that four hour trek up here too so that's what we're facing here\nAnd uh that would be the next step in the next round up the next round games or a man one in eight men do will be next Tuesday they play every six days because of course they have a thirty two teams and they are playoff bracket as opposed to eleven man\nWhich went down to succeed you ever see on that subject my ear see\nEight man wanting to going down to the sixteen teams\nThere's been been calls for that to to take place and I to me it's an extra around a playoff says it's a it's really a kind of silly I think you see some of the some of the scores in the first couple of rounds ... there are some things that\nYou know I don't want to not I'm not knocking the teams themselves the fact that your your three and five teams are playing in a playoff game yesterday to know team there's there's such a\nDramatic difference there that the era and I think that they may have to do well to to do what eleven men did a couple of years ago and that would be to switch\nSwitched ... format the sixteenth team playoff get to you know get the best the best playing at this time of year right is it just it just seems silly to me to see the a team you know get a get blown out and call themselves a playoff team when they've only won\nTwo or three more ... more eight man teams actually get the night game because you know how many of the man and one or two or ... aren't getting that\nNight the NSA schedules or does the schedule now so they would get nine games they have a say has taken over scheduling of us for the football today we'll go to the sixty they'll say if they went to a sixteen play off the interstate what was scheduled nine games for him but ah\nThat's when you need a Homer Simpson don't do\nFive penalties for thirty five yards now for Bloomfield\n\nSo the tigers were the first five now from just inside the twenty five eight thirty four to go in the third period trailing by fourteen looking to score here and make a game of the\nPast or the left side that scares a mom within thirty five twenty five twenty down to Fifteen and down to the eleven yard line nice halfway there a quick past play by that I went over to get them on the left side he read the blitz come in and was able to get to pass off quickly and get the first out\nWith you about a Nineteen yard pass they're nice and so here we here you go ... or with a nice Dr trying to answer a Bloomfield early score here in the second half\nAs one with the ball first down in ten policy Bloomfield eleven yard line [noise] who all in motion on the right side is time and get the ball\nEscapes one tack we're down to the\nFive down to the three gardeners for their [noise] about one tackle or a way they're like a ... look like a deal it costs are making the touchdown saving tackle air on that\nBut it gets about nine yards will be a second down and one from about the ... to ... they get a first down without a touchdown\nBut I think it's been a all things\nConsidered would rather have the six [noise]\nAnd they need the six year\nOld will extend the time and the ... and finally breaking center\nType punched him about his looks like on the rugby rock here the\nNot getting the quarterback sneak I don't think he got in but he may have gotten the first down [noise] look like a\nSecond round play a little rugby there for a second I couldn't\nEven see him I think he was on the bottom [laughter] they were all all tied up punched up in their real tight and\nSocial time out they're going to measure this\nOh look at some other uh other scores are going on in the playoffs or just a just got word that ah Kennesaw has now forty two to sixteen over riverside in the west a racket there and that's a that's a huge win effect Kennesaw and gone to get that one\nOf those wars we saw at the end of the first quarter Samuel separate ate over six the end of one and that and then we mentioned earlier a Creighton big over ... wasn't high northeast with it and I actually now at fifty four twenty six the\nMidway through the third quarter there over us to a high plains and how's dodge leading guardian angels fourteen to six after one quarter here is the first and goal at\nThe one yard line I don't know if I haven't got it or not or does not look like he did\nBoy I don't know if you could mark down any closer to the goal and

JAG sports club tonight so here we go eleven fifty three just under way\nOr the or Rubio bees struck quickly in the third quarter just as we started to the second half Fifteen seconds into the third quarter they scored and now a just a few seconds in the fourth quarter the Oregon Mike so they like the beginnings of quarters here tonight\nTo score early and get to everybody excited now do you have a couple of playoff games and the one that night that was kind of strengthened over south looping overtime way to fourteen uh extra Milligan friend defeating Horton tonight or twenty eight they'll move on if they wonder if either house dodged or guardian angels how's dodge leading their out the hat\nHere's a script ... takes a funny little bouncing here I was going to get to that is that had been with us at the twenty\nAnd twenty five breaks away to the thirty and down after thirty two yard line kinda funny little a script ... there are as I looked like somebody will get as a mom look like you're saying about twenty five of the park right over his head and ready to die of Kansas twenty people to get about twelve yards turn\nNo they're dodging what don't discount the tigers though there's a lot of ... I see a lot of spring and their staff you know you look for body language at this point in a in a football game down thirty to fourteen I'm not seeing any body language that would suggest that I was majority to mail it in\nAnd got a first intent on their own thirty two here with eleven forty five to go on the ball game trailing by two full scores thirty to fourteen I'm In shock information he looks to left throws it oh what's it look before he caught at a gesture you had the bomb us started go right through is right through the numbers and read through his hands and to the ground below\nBoy he just he took his his uh I out the ball just for a second he started looking ahead where he was doing because he saw a lot of green in front of him and if you're caught that he would have you with a check for maybe ten or Fifteen Years down the hill but you gotta catch it first\nKennesaw riverside tonight Fifteen to twenty to riverside was the two time defending six fan champions moved up to eight man bowl this year and that gets knocked out in the second round playoff Kennesaw will get out of his Lawrence Nelson\nSucking down intact Iman looking right now going laughed and gets by five yards on like or Harry there are still dealing with a tackle for the bees that sets up about a third and five for the tigers who need one air with eleven twenty seven to go [noise]\nWas just a typical high school playoff picture here in Bloomfield and especially on Halloween Night you've got kids and costumes running all over the place we can see the infield the baseball field there's some kind of another football game going on over there too\nSo there's we don't have a scar on that score now on the looks like we just got touched up out of that I play\nOver there and I think they're using a popcorn boxes the ball\nThirty five jak information highway that now has to get away from pressure goes down the right side forty thirty five to thirty looking back to his left\nHe's got a black twenty five twenty Fifteen ten five touchdown\nWhy its cage to pressure goes to his right side cuts back over the middle the to the left and goes all the way for the touchdown about forty eight yard run as the as the tigers are not dead yet\nNo and I think he ran about a hundred and eight to get to the uh forty to forty eight yards to pay dirt but man they just keep answering the the the the tigers just keeping answering Bertie did twenty now they really need to point after if they get the a to point conversion it'll make it a one score ballgame\nYeah this is a huge to point play here for the tigers and he just wanted to make it a one ...\nGift to his right\nThe books like the passes batted away and I defend their ally uh Trenton hole up in an over the top of the nation biker\nDefense their ally uh Trenton holes up an over the top of the nation by Kirk I Believe it is\nAnd was eight or excuse me that as a justice Britain's that he went over the top I knocked down to pass and the captain at a ten point eight thirty to twenty which and forty five to go\nSo it's it's really been difficult for us when they just have not been a converting that point after and let's see if we can look back here\nBecause they don't have the memory to remember a but their point they've not been good in converting their point after is in a you gotta figure you're near a what one two three scores\nThey've missed too so that's for a valuable point say they've left on the field you know this could be a thirty to twenty four foot ball game right now but it's thirty to twenty as it is to score games\nSo they're going to need a score twice out here in the last ten ten forty five and then after that place in big defense here on this uh this next series ear and tried to tried to get to\nGet the ball back this is the hump that Osman hasn't been able to get older they get it down to one score and they just can't quite get over the hump you get this thing tonight so let's see if they can do it here\nRight tigers didn't kick formation going from right to left [noise] ten forty five to go in this one the winner gets Johnson rocking the quarter finals on Tuesday night argument will be at home if you will be on the road on site kick or doesn't quite do ten yards but it's recovered\nAnyway by one of the other ... like a block that recovers it for the ... the uh thirty nine yards while they were never went to the full ten our own and you know\nLanded on it or inside the inside that ten year\nOld a Google was looking for that and they just didn't get the ball hard enough and if they would have kicked the ball hard enough and it might have gotten past that first Bloomfield receiver there and I might have gotten that ball but now you gamble and now you lead Bloomfield is thirty nine yards away from score\nSo the bees\nWith the ball and thirty nine is an option pitch diesel men thirty five down to the thirty wow right down there by justice Britain's\nGaping brands and use one is just one of those back where he reminds me of Billy Sims of Oklahoma the guy is always running downhill and\nHe gets tackled and you'd think you'd get tackled for about four or five yard ... ... and then he gets up and he's got a Ninety arguments like he falls down for or yard no matter what\nSo second down in one for the ease up the thirty yard line ten thirty nine to go on this one ... by ten thirty to twenty over the tigers shack information Eisenhower\nThese him into his right\n... thanks left I was going to go along and he's got 'em all but he had had a whole\n... out there but that just a little too long let them a little too far and that's how we are now faces a third\nOr one or two or three three thirty is going to solve the big winner riverside fifty to twenty two we want to the quarter finals here in the east brackets St Francis over a hundred and fifty four six multi Sacred Heart overran off sixty to twenty two of those two teams meet each other on Tuesday and then that Johnson ...\nWill get the winter this fall game after reading Alison I Seventy six to nothing so fourteens out of the teacher three bracket uh actually all six of qualified for state for the team survive the first round three of them have or have since uh uh gone it's gone down to defeat today won't feel there's lasting standing in the Detroit three district in their five thirty nine away from a advancing\nSo they got first out on that play that wasn't an exact ten yards so first in ten\nYears or something like almost got the ball stripped away maybe he did get strip\nStripped away I was when people are calling for the ball\nBut these men or has the ball\nAnd again of three and looks like he's kind of tight [noise]\nWell I Can't imagine why you got a hundred and Seventy three yards tonight and I think his carry the ball about Seventy nine times [laughter] if I counted up let's see\nI've got a job for about twenty two carries for one hundred and Seventy three our branch and use them and me and he has done it all for the Bloomfield beside you carry the ball and he's making tackles on deep in\nFive minutes to go in this one that was again of free second down at seven Eisenhower second formation he's going to follow the blockers on the right side thirty five forty and he will run out of bounds up the thirty ... thirty nine years I think are a good enough for a first down and the bees will stick\nWith four fifty to go there and and territory at the tiger thirty nine leading thirty to twenty\nBloomfield sitting pretty good here if you're a ... a Britain\nWith four fifty to go there and I've been territory at the tiger thirty nine lead thirty to twenty\nYeah Bloomfield sitting pretty good here if you're a rent a Britain Eisenhower maybe your coach would rather you stayed in balance to keep that clock when we're inside five minutes now for fifty to go and the ten point lead but\nYou know coach rep I can it's cold outside I don't want to get hit I'm just going to step out of bounds here is your is your quarter you want your quarterback to do to do that to protect him so\nI ask you something in the wildcat formation he takes a direction that goes to his left side thirty nine thirty five down to the thirty three yard line gets about six yards on that Kerry and more important keeps the clock moving number as she gets or six yards on the play Sacco was made by Patrick and [noise]\nFor thirty four to go in this one second down and for for these\nThat area game in class the one last for reports early in the third quarter a guardian angel central Catholic is headed up with\nA ... dodge all tied up at twenty six apiece\nAs to uh northeast Nebraska teams going head to head there and the one\nSecond down in six\nDecent takes a snap [noise]\nThirty five thirty twenty five\nAnd six it down to about the twenties for yard line [noise] but yeah that will be a first down Logan selling it on the tackle as well as justice Merten number so they uh [noise] we'll get a first down six moving keep talk moving as well for for to go\nHere is they are down in uh near a red zone here for twenty five yard line first down and check\nOut the winner of tonight's game right now it's looking like it's going to be boom boom the uh we'll travel to Johnson rock and you'll be able to hear\nLive action at a game that we don't know obviously the time that that would start but you'll be able to hear that over on Ninety seven five ... ESL\nEisenhower it gives them all off to Johnson who is a right down in the field and that is a ... a who all ... tackle in the backfield\nAnd we have time out often it's called time out here with three thirty nine to go\nSo we'll just keep it right here tonight's game\nRocky by many fine sponsors including customs force of ... personally screen printing ... your team get to a competitive edge in sports for customs Ford CEO dot com also big thank you don't mind the electric motors servicing irrigation pump to generators and they sell green been saved now in superior green beans\nWith winter specials yeah just finished my thought here a Bluefield does a hang on and that's looking likely they will travel to Johnson broccoli next Tuesday game time to be announced it\nWill carry that game lie for you over on Ninety seven five K. E. X. L. over in creating the crate bulldog took care of business against a wizard filter tonight Lutheran high northeast also the winter\nBut that means Lutheran high northeastern they traveled to Osceola tonight they get the home game so the crate bulldogs you have to go on the road for the first time they'll come down to Norfolk on Tuesday Joe jade and live coverage of that over on one of those six kicks cake UK ... one of those six K. I. X. dot com that will be on Tuesday as well will\nAnnounce a those game time it's likely the Bloomfield Johnson brought him would be an afternoon game because of the for our travel time for boot too but we'll see\nSo don't feel with the ball first or second down in long it was a fake can often use them in the [noise] the blockers they will cut back and gets down to about twenty ... about\nFive yards to go here on down the ones that are that great living high northeast game will be out to be a dandy both teams have a put up a ton of points of the season in fact I wasn't\nHigh first two games this year sixty eight sixty six here in the playoffs are Creighton eighty two in their first round game and that I don't have a file on their other game that left they thought they had fifty eight yeah I saw both teams can put up a ton of points that it was a high earlier this year they\nThey actually scored sixty six in the game and loss\n[laughter] you can't believe that they lost a Wakefield Seventy to sixty six or middle of a\nC yeah and that upset them they were not happy with that but that's how it goes\nDown in five years he someone taking the drug snap posters right side tries to get down to the first down a marker but comes up a little short it's like he's going to be a lot to do our short on that one\nAnd I get him to tackle there for us when our soldiers are into so you're going to be looking at a fourth and two for the bees to thirty five to go off and does have one time out left and I'm sure they probably want to try to hang on to that if at all possible\nIn case they can do something else that's the way they but they need to stop here fourth down into this is this is a basically a ball game right here\nI don't feel with the ball shotgun formation Eisenhower goes to his right gets the first down down to about the\nThird one yard line zone number nights and that'll be a first down for the Bluefield beans with two twelve to go\nAnd I got you got to feel if you're if you're coming back coach back to what your guest feel pretty good about where you're at right now\nYeah absolutely ah now you just kind of want to hang on to the ball ball security and to keep the clock moving here and finish this up and go home with a nice solid win\nAgainst your neighbors here the ... tigers who have nothing to be ashamed of tonight they uh they have put up an excellent fight and they showed why there are seven and two\nIt's been a great ball game today here between both teams here for ten and a\nHusband a defense getting a little jumping\nAnd that they're going to get a flight for five or federally be off sites and making the first five inside the tent out [noise] but yeah you got to got to give\nKudos to uh to coach Scott Morris than in the housing tigers yeah there there are a really have a great group of kids that play really well throughout the season are put together a nice record and the uh you know really a of a solid football unit there in August and here they have nothing to be a shame that are on a ... regardless of the final out\nAnd right there there were just trying to make a play you know there are still in the ... they want to get after they still want to get off the ball rolling down by can\nNow feel going to take their time here and what clock right as much as possible\nGet so many going right side down to about the five and close to the goal live\nDown in up to what\nThe official is gonna put his hands up and give them a touchdown and then he just thought ... got about half way up and he thought better of it\nYeah so first thing one yard line with one Nineteen to go\nAnd if a Jeffries unofficial than she is a anywhere close to a financial and I'm not going to claim that it is but that puts brands in the eyes and our over the two hundred yard mark for the night two hundred and four yards\nI'll tell you it definitely has been a player the game for the bees tonight or that it's done a fantastic job running the ball and I also has done very well on defense as well so he comes out of the game the bees look like they're going into victory formation here Eisenhower under center\nAnd yep he's had Sammy and I only lines that I've left\nArgument has one time I left but I don't think at this point it's really a relevant or they'll be able to run the clock out regardless\nMan you had all of that they're they're down on the one yard line they could easily probably just punch that a ball in\nAnd make it you know maybe thirty eight to twenty but uh that is a real tip of their helmet to a ... and a lot of respect for for these guys were just going to leave it as it is thirty to Twenty one run this clock out and get on outta here shake hands and a\nOsmund wishing Bloomfield the best\nAs we're just going to leave it as it is thirty to Twenty one run this clock out and get on out of here shake hands and a\nAugmentation Bloomfield the best of luck in Bloomfield same\nThing for a great game and

... was scary in a couple of different ways\nI'm certainly the biggest which was a when he's across the aisle fence of mine from you and you got to try and keep them from killing your quarterback

the football field when he was scary period\nAnd Eve is a good guy who was a happy guy who's allowed guy but he could grow up here in the arts of just people hanging out with them you know not that

the\nPresence in to the left hand batter box or the ... that can Candlestick Park or anywhere else that he was facing off against when they're most feared power hitters in the history of the game or give me a chance that they might be something in sports today that scares you\nOr if you're a fan of another team and this team being in division scares you do us and just ram should be scaring some

the tea was these days is a Jimmy Butler\nA because he wants out they've ah opened up negotiations with other teams\nWas a report last week that are used in would be potentially willing to offer for first round draft picks\nFor Jimmy Butler that park has cooled\nI don't know if that came out of Houston or came out of Minnesota you never know who's leaking watch for what purposes\nOr it seemed like a pretty stiff price to pay but if you think about it have used them believe they're going to be really good for the next three years and I'm One of the best records in the NBA like they did last year where is that first round pick on a land\nTwenty nine twenty eight twenty seven somewhere thereabouts so if you're giving up that kind of pick every year are you really crushing yourself\nA well Jimmy Butler didn't play tonight and I heard the report that it was a scheduled game of rest\nThe tubes and told them ahead of time I want to give you a game like not a banking or Jimmy Butler didn't

confidently being a ... a key word here because I don't know what's going down confidently in Cleveland these days coming up and just ... talked to\nAndy Baskin from uh the ban in Cleveland I my heart goes out to Cleveland fan\nI'm a truth be told I thought the Indians were a notch below the Astros and the red Sox and the American league this year they turned out to be they won their division more handily but it was because\nThere are divisions stomach or the ... tribe themselves whereas you had a a good team Oakland chasing the Astros out west and a good team Yankees chasing the red Sox any so I thought the tribe going to be one and done but at least they made the post season\nAt the bears and the cabs you been living in this hour days the last several years with Brian James in Cleveland as far as who goes but with LeBron decided it was time for him to get closer to Hollywood or and move his tact to the west coast\nYeah you know it was going to get bad in Cleveland I didn't know would return to the dark days of pre law Brian as quickly as it has they're off to a lousy start and they've already told their coach\nOr your services no longer needed they bug out or Tyrone Lou and have an issue now with the guy who just sitting in as the part time coach or so or on the basketball ... not good in Cleveland and the football run you Jackson got fired this week too\nI I liked your Jackson and from what I saw in the HBO show this year I thought he was not a a pretty good year and a could even take his job past the season\nI didn't like the relationship between he and some of his assistant coaches which was a problem um but uh it it just ... once the season started\nThey got a whole bunch of very close games that they played bunch overtime games they played a and I just came out on the short end of all is not lost with the browns I still think they're heading in the right direction but if you thought this was going to be a buy a somewhat large step in the first year that's not happening\nBecause they've had to fire their coach seven games in I don't think Gregg Williams the front corn I did they hired to take over as the coach is the answer going forward or any experience will be good for Baker may field\nBut this was slowing down the process of getting the browns turn around so I went to a Cleveland's by coming up uh coming up in a couple of minutes with

especially because it's that you're working ten does that kind of stuff um I really really thought that are generally has wanted to hang on to\n'em won and hanging out of the huge accent and I think he took it took a little\nTalking to you for him or to let him go so I you know ... of those too you know I just think that it was one of those twenty four hour period forty eight hour period work just like\nThe shoe was dropping out of everything and I'm not I mean I'm not I wasn't surprised that either one of those guys got fired I think the biggest thing that Todd Haley got fired and they took out to a rather than just one with a browser\nWhy do you think that was the case um 'cause I Try to at least ... which is a team I followed day in day out\nA and wasn't the biggest fan aries had six cents in a couple of stops including Pittsburgh I wasn't impressed by what the browns would do an up and simply this year but um I was just a half a season why were you surprised St Louis given is walking papers I thought in watching hard knocks\nThere was some hard issues that needed to be hammered out there in Cleveland and I think ... was helping them why the surprise\nI I think maybe ... thought what's best for Becker may feel they're what's best for our office or what's best for our often what's best for the entire team\nAnd there's infighting going on between the two of those guys and it was becoming public and you didn't even go back to the beginning of the season when\nYou know your tax and it said um that they were they were going to do some things that they weren't and then all of a sudden Todd Haley decided that he was ... was that was the guy in that scenario where you know who's the judge court documents are we're we're a deal is himself here and the next thing you know tell me we put them on a field\nAnd so you know those two guys weren't on the same page from day one and it's hard to do these arranged marriages\nAnd Jim Hansen finds himself in those positions all the time and I just think they're disastrous and head coaches need to hire everyone you know from the head coaches pot all the way down\nAnd I think that's true the general manager to that the general manager and need to hire all the way down and so that everybody's in sync and so that they're not having infighting and you're not having a issues in the locker room isn't looking one way at one thing and another as the other way and\nYou know so you run into these issues because I think your basic organizational structure was a ...\nWho is going to be going to play sort of brands this weekend\nI'm a I I there's no way a great way as they call themselves a pretty kitchens is going to do it his the officer coordinator so uh you know he did it in the fourth preseason game of the year I'm you know his his background is pretty stellar um he's got a pretty good resume and\nWe'll see what he does that he's never called games in and out of the game before so and they got their hands full yeah Kansas City this week so are there are a lot of things that do not spell good news for the house\nFor them and they're going to have to score points because can send you go to score bunch against their defense we can't take a deep bench isn't good it died shortly not grain I don't think it's all that good but they just got the capability boats going anybody um how has banker Mayfield handled all the people in Cleveland this week\nYou know he sounded pretty good uh from what he set up you know just being a leader and you know be a man we're going to find out what kind of men we have in the locker room this week guys that can handle the reverse of the guys that can you know play through one of the problems are out there and\nWe're about to find out what paper may feel is all about this week because\nI'm One of the biggest problems for the team is the defense has done their job as far as fortunate turnovers and if you look they leave the league and forcing turnovers they can't score points to some some way to solve this got up on the end zone when the defense is doing what they need to do by popping the ball off or the other team\nDo you know if they offered ... ride tell around at all um yeah he's a really nice backup quarterback they bought them in to be to start or just to to like do I make always ready and that\nJust happened to be very early in the season um but I thought there might be a team that would be interested in them or did they not want to train him or did they not hear what they wanted a year in any of the phone calls they made on\nWell I I mean you kind of have to go back down and wonder what John door she wanted to John Dorsey ... playoff season that might be something that might have been realistic because he wanted to make sure that his quarterback was ready when his quarterback had the right line in front of them had some office of weapons so\nWaiting to see how this plays out for the next couple of weeks\nIf we can get some clarity on you know ... Taylor why there were so you know vehement about him starting and then all of a sudden things switch and I think when they switched against the jets won the brother able to beat the jets and Baker made from came onto the scene that I think they all just said look we know the bigger matrix of us ... back to your right now in our ... our we've got to play up\nTalking to a a buddy Andy Baskin from the fan in Cleveland their midday guy here on CBS Sports radio I jumping already cabs Tyrone getting ah like go no great surprise I Know the bride and he was a Tyrone little guy\nI wanted to bring them in when they swapped out the coach when the wind came back\nAs soon as the brine left ... time was on borrowed time and that\nBecame a handful of games this season so Larry do on the bench one at a higher paid assistant coaches in the league so why is it gets elevated to interim coach\nBut they're already having issues on how much they're going to pay him this is something you never hear about the interim coach stepping up and saying well wait a minute I don't like when I'm being paid what's the deal\nI don't know that it plays out exactly like that I mean if you look at Larry Drew in where he's been to I mean he's been pretty screwed over the last couple of places raise ban I mean Milwaukee messed him over um and I just think that when you look at him and Atlanta also I mean Danny Ferry came into Atlanta and just fired him because\nHe wanted to bring it might put nose or which you know I can understand that\nThat he wants to bring in his own guy that's the problem the browns at my at the gym didn't bring in his own guy so when you look at marriage or what happened to Atlanta I happened to them in Milwaukee\nI don't believe for what he's doing right now and the ... I kinda just look at them like what are you doing you decided to keep her coach right and you whack them after six games that's fine but what kind of a plan B do you have\nAnd they didn't have a plan B because literature is now saying you know what I'm just the voice I'm not the interim head coach I'm like the acting head coach but I'm happy to do this meanwhile he's ten and one with\n\nNo huge age sky watching whether the whether our weather's are clear\nSkies tonight with a low of twenty seven wins out of the southwest around five miles an hour\nMore clouds in sun tomorrow ice around fifty nine cloudy tomorrow night chance for scattered showers thirty seven year old just stare kite for news talk W.

Baltimore's a bay Britain home the Steelers seemed to have gotten a little little drama under control I Know they beyond Bell's not there but I think that they're a resigned to the fact that he's probably not even going to show this year\nI think there's now a fifty fifty chance to just sit out the entire season I Know it makes sense that he's going to want to try and come back for the last six games here that way he gets a full year in and he doesn't have to worry about a franchise tag again next year but I don't know what kind of shape is in I don't know what kind of attitude he as I\nAm the Steelers might even say you know\nIt might not be worth the pay him eight hundred thousand dollars a week and they may just release them at that time they don't have to do it now ah and if they do that of course later on we become a free agent immediately but also I miss out on an entire year's paycheck\nConnery played so well for them I think Pittsburgh is wrapped around the fact that\nThey're going to be late last all year long and I think they come out and play a whip they knew for this week and when a rivalry game in Baltimore\nJody you couldn't tell me what the point spread is on that short\nCan read sky the ravens are three point favorite it all\nRight good talking to you and that we're we're a missing girl up your narrative right after\nI got my grand thank you I appreciate it I just try and keep the seat warm while Scott\nHe's out of dodge a and you know he's going to be back next week I'm trying to find the printed out the Vegas odds are earlier here they are okay uh Pittsburgh and\n... below I'm pretty sure it was a three point yes all of the across the board\nOr I go to Vegas insider dot com which gives you six or seven different casinos and they can vary half point here or there every single one of them as the ravens as a three point Joyce game open did three has stayed at three\nThe over under was forty eight and a half when it's come down to forty seven or was\nThe ravens as a three point Joyce game opened at three has stayed at three\nThe over under was forty eight and a half and has come down to forty seven or was forty eight has come down to forty seven and a half at almost every single spot as well so the over under has been reduced by half point but the line has held steady ravens a three point choice which means\nIf you give a home field advantage eight three point edge\nThat they believe on the neutrophils these two teams are dead even\n... I think Pittsburgh is the better the two teams I'm leaning toward Pittsburgh I don't know if I make that one of my six pack picks I've given them to you on a friday says I'm going to be an ear friday night for for al also give you some breeders cups pac\nWill have a Breeders' Cup a guest on tomorrow night I got to work on one for friday I haven't been able to land my guy for friday night yet 'cause I've got a five big races on friday and then a full card a million dollar races\nFrom Churchill Downs on Saturday on Breeders' Cup Saturday but I'll give you my uh football picks as well or we'll hold off on those see if there's any injuries are updates and announcements and the like I'll tell you one way I lean and I'd lean toward a the spill is being able to go in\nAnd beat Baltimore um there are those two teams or even I Will tell you that at least one gambling outlet doesn't necessarily look at them as even right now that's bow vow to dot L. V. uh which is an offshore gambling site and they're good enough they always send me their current updated odds\nAnd which this week included the a new a Super Bowl ads\nThey change every single week team wins team loses a they take some money on it and teams can go up or down in their eyes are low lay\nOut does any NFL or you right now the rams last week were fourteen to five to win the super bowl which is just less\nThan three to one after their ah when on Sunday beating the Packers they're now eleven to for\nWhich is basically the same thing fourteen to five and eleven afford them close but the came down slightly Luke chiefs worst six to one after their when they came down to uh they went up to eleven too so they went\nUh know came down slightly five and a half to one or the patriots were eleven to to the state eleven the to\nThe saints were eight to one came down to Thirteen to too so they went down to seven and a half a slight reduction and then there's the drop off there's one two three teams at sixteen to one so you got the rams that\nLess than three to one\nThe chiefs at five\nAnd a half two on the patriots at five and a half to one and the saints at seven and a half to one\nThe chargers the Vikings and this the alerts Donny I still like to stay on my two Super Bowl team what are your started with are still isn't around so ah both of my teams are in the top five as part of the list things as we gumbo vodka\nCharges Vikings Steelers all at sixteen to one uh LA charges held at sixteen and one Minnesota went up\nFrom twelve to sixteen after they got beat by the same says leak and the Steelers came down from Eighteen to get the sixteen they get three teams in sixteen to one Panthers at twenty two\nTexans at twenty two eagles at twenty five twenty five went over and beat Jacksonville in England stayed at twenty five you defending Super Bowl champions bears came down from thirty three to twenty eight the skins came down from thirty three to one to twenty eight to one um\nRavens are thirty three to one\nSo if you're judged by the Vegas betting number for just the individual matchup game this week it looks like do the two teams and dead even if a judge by future\nSuperbowl odds\nThe Steelers are sixteen the one the ravens a thirty three to one if you think these two teams or even\nYou want to get your bed and on Baltimore this week to win the game and then you want to get your bed and before they win the game 'cause you're getting thirty three to one now just Raymond's have to win the super bowl Joe Flaco has won a Super Bowl\nBut I'm Sorry I just don't look at the ravens as a thirty three to one team here is the one thing I Will say about the rabbits and this goes back to conversation had last night one of my call this year and a had with kj who is filling in for Bill Ryder earlier I came in in the last five minutes of his show in case you missed it\nOr to a sucker him into a bat\nAnd his teams playing my team this week Jason get bad a dolphin fan I'm a jazz fan so I said I don't need your stinking three point a homemade vantage points up get straight up to beat the dolphins and Jay Giedd I better cold went on that one a he's a charger guy he thinks the charges", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Norfolk", "day": "01"}
