I was it became a big Penn State fan could not ever go against my alma mater so you had a different connection so it's while\nYes I'm fans of two teams it's like a different type of fandom for each\nOkay so frightening thing\nLongtime pack you know ... [noise] yes he's a frequent other show won a super [noise]\nGave me a hard time with the bears for years [noise]\nThe other day that he was a bears fan his entire life growing up\nThere I said he's still very than he left no\nBecause he understands the Christian Church is trying to tell you\nYou can't you can't be both\nI mean a very [noise]\nThat that that phrase so I guess when he went to a rival play for rival team unless I'm sure if the bears are better for a long time I'm sure his tumor change [noise]\nDo you look very disappointed in the ...\nYeah I just I don't think it's a good excuse [laughter] sorry trade 'em okay\nMake the case that let's say you got to get rid of one of these teams out of your life just done to not be a fan\nI think I Know which way you're going but make the case that you know you would do that\nI'll be the Notre Dame or ... or any of my team\nA known in Penn State what do you do how many times you go you know a difference for the point in the\nSense that her name you had to Christian Kirk see shows back up and just the same man I was serious\nAnd I said no no way I don't think that's good as long as possible when he says those words to you again which I can say it again if you want and you're like you know what you're right time to give ... give up one of these who would you shed in order to truly love\nYour true love Notre Dame where Penn State\nI'm hoping that my family's listening 'cause I'm going to actually the ... two weeks so hopefully we'll hear this all the you know they will they'll still let me go on the trip but when you go to university it's just different connection so I really can't throw away my Penn State fan dumb\nBecause when you go there when you know the student athletes near surround the culture it's just it kind of a beach you up it's it's just a different sort a fan of a different sort of connection that you have you see people wearing ... and you really have no connection I was just like in the football team\nSo gun to my head where I had to choose one hour choose Penn State the cats are my Christian correct see last year what happened ... Penn State just you know he wants to throw some daggers that me I'll\nJust say watch the tape and remember that Dr Penn State did down the field bang bang bang to score with no time left\nAre you going after Christian Kirk she is that what you're doing\nSitting in front of a reminder that's all ... [noise] yeah I mean he wasn't to find them either and I really can't you can't it's not like I'd be like oh let me just see in the back out he's killed me so that's the best but that's where I can dig out it\nMight have heard several I signed up today and I've heard of only from you that you're an athlete so\nI wouldn't disagree with that statement and you\nLose it and not in sports or not but\nThat was an exaggeration\nJust ... a fly on a sports and I could trace make the case\nDo you say that none of the team you're given up [noise]\n\nHow do I say this without getting clipped to weigh over use against me\nIf I had to choose one the other\nThe ... the university that I went to I Would choose\nAs his aides name make the case trace that the university nerdy and that you just turn your back on after so many years of love well actually when the national championship [noise]\nActually when it ... okay well they have a great defensive especially a great front line of defense of wine or moms listen by the way and she says she's throwing ... oh no\nThe guy that just doesn't really know drew me off I ... I Can't focus after that um they have a great defensive line\nAnd look at Alabama really the only the biggest teen or the biggest threat to winning national championship suicide the lowest I've gotten a lot of times and disruptive maybe go on the spot the norm is a pretty good secondaries well I think if their defense plays the way they've been playing that can shut down in Alabama as much as\nPossible and they're often since it's just ridiculous by as much as possible in both continues by the way he has no running or when the national ... the teams are in your back on you know when the whole thing while I wouldn't say turn it back on it just the trail [noise]\nSure you guys when I went oh I'm sure I just I'm just straight from Kate understand what you're making the case for\n...\nI Do your favorite team Penn State the one you like more to Notre Dame fright the ones who chose the one you chose they have a big game to speaking at Michigan State made the case for Michigan State political ...\nOh my goodness you're as everyone\nI knew I knew when I sold a segment I knew what I was doing oh you guys both a lot of ... oldest together a misuse of actually having has ...\nIt's just I knew I see I knew when I saw this segment I knew what I was doing\nOnly guys a lot of ... oldest together\nA mission to actually I think has the best run defense nation hold their opponents to sing sing like point five yards a cat or something crazy like that [noise] um so ... uh you know at Penn State is unable to run the ball [noise]\nA Michigan State has a Cindy defense and playing well and it goes on and off into a never ending playing that well supplies you a million up to their potential but this will be one of those sneaky games where in Michigan State gets written off may Penn State of all it's a little bit maybe still hung over from that Ohio State last week's ago where Michigan State not leading by many comes in\nSnakes in and upsets Penn State at home\nMom writer by the by listening riding simply [noise]\nWhy can't trace give up Notre Dame followed by sorry\nSay mine was on my side too I thought she you know right try to explain it to her that she said oh okay\nEight by five to one to four CBS is the phone number talking about I think it's the best game of the week\nAnd there's some good games ... patriots chiefs is going to be not just I think a great football game but really instructive all both where the patriots are and where the chiefs are\nIn New England they're aware of the chiefs undefeated record they know bedroom homes as the hot new thing right now in the NFL and they are going to be built ... check I mean bill Belgium right now somewhere in a basement whether it's already on licking his chops watching tape daydreaming endgame plan on how to slow ...\nWho you got an eight by five\nTo one to four CBS I'll start with jail fears in Topeka what's going on brother you're on CBS Sports radio\nAll her she ate a bill first to a first time caller but I'm a longtime listener big big and Chris she had to show that man\nYeah so a chief patriots I Believe that the teams are going to go in there they're going to put up a lot of points and we're really going to find out what that is really made up can they repeat what they did against the jaguars\nIf so then I think that she might just do it\nI Love and I'm banking on the chief's to win this game I Love that she's optimism out at the peak of Kansas that she's territory\nI Am I'm I Am bullish\nOn the chief's I'm a\nBig believer moms there really talented obviously and a lot of this is going to hinge on Patrick moms 'cause I don't think that the best will slow Tom Brady and the patriots down much interestingly and will kind of see what happens to operate he's looked pretty good\nAnd Tom Brady is Tom Brady he's the rain MVPs and absolute ... but I don't know if it's under the radar but Brady is thrown six interceptions already this season he has had a propensity to turn the ball over this year in a way that he has not\nNecessarily in years past and I'm not saying that and just put in perspective the last time the Brady through more than ten interceptions in a season with two thousand thirteenth\nHe is to ... away from his total from last year\nIt just a little to live right like age it expresses itself in different ways now to be fair to Brady he's playing pretty well he's completing a pretty\nLarge mound as bad as almost Seventy percent sixty percent he's look good but I don't think braid is going to put up forty points against the chiefs to get the defense\nWill probably put up in the in the thirties twenty eight to thirty five range feels right\nThe question is can ... go in there and be a star and be started again and it's going to depend on a couple of things one\nWhen does mom's gonna come back to earth but to when we talk about this all the time in sports in the NFL every week to mom's place there was more tape on them to try and exploit and find a weakness moms to have a couple of turnover just persevere of his own against the jags last week\nI Would argue there's probably few on earth maybe no one better and coach you run out the NFL level than Bill Belichick and his staff at looking at tape of players and finding weaknesses and devising strategies that work\nMy homes to be such a key to this thing and an mom's a young rookie quarterback he he knows it and he addressed this week the expectations for Sunday hadn't New England against the patriots\nOf the greatest quarterback just not the greatest quarterback to ever play and so for us we're going to just go in like you said I'm going to get their defense but as a team and go in and just try to compete and I mean they're a good team in a uh see every single year and so just getting compete against one of the best teams in Italy\nI'm going against their defense but I as a team when they go in and just try to compete and I mean they're a good team in a uh see every single year and so just getting compete against one of the best teams in the league is when the awesome opportunity ...\nThree kills ... amazing weapon the hands of Andy Reid there's an argument to be made the Travis Kelsey is now the best tight end in football\nSammy Watkins is really to I mean there's so many what does what does walk into fourth option\nBombed us all the tools it'd disposal andme homes\nVersus ... check is going to be a really interesting test the young quarterback against the grizzled head coach is going to be I think insightful both on how high the homes can climb before he and everybody does before he stumbles\nAnd for Bill belch out just how good is this patriots team are they back to form and I brought this up I think several times here on the show they've started slowly a lot the last few years\nBut they've always found a way to get it done they always found a way to turn things on when they have to they I think they've turn that corner I think it's three into their hands on the right direction\nBut it's still going to be attached to that and build bell checked himself Mr loquacious Mr talkative Mr ... talked\nAbout the obvious which is this chiefs gain is she's team is going to for a New England ... a real test\nReally good football team to a lot of things well and um [noise]\nMeal out of it a lot of fun prepare for the same [noise] give it a lot of problems with their scheme of players a verbal coached I'm as they always are with Andy\nAnd I'm very explosive crew\nYeah and and and he knows he gets it I um\nI Love I Love the chiefs are three and a half way underdogs among Kansas City with those points and I feel really good about that but I Do think it'll be a close football game and I do think the bread is going to have a massive game because that chief defense is so bad but\nAnd I'm not going very moms to ready\nThe only people you can compare to Tom Brady I think our Montana breeze Rogers Elway that level of greatness\nPut some day Brady is going to hit a wall someday he's going to have happened to him what is happening to Eli Manning some day\nHe's going to have his greatness stripped away by the time it happens is part of the deal nobody ever ever escapes it\nAnd it doesn't always happen overnight it's not like you go from being the MVP one moment to bomb the next there's going to be a slow decline in the ... case probably fairly so because of his willpower how how ridiculously he's obsessed with taking care of his body and the things that he puts into his body and just trying to prolong his career\nMy point is is Tom Brady could very well have a small\nStep back this year that doesn't become really clear until a few years down the road this could be the beginning of the decline maybe that's what we're seeing and if mom's is capable of going in there and being as great as he's been maybe he gets the best operate in this group you know Andy Reid who's obviously having a a blast and having a great time\nHaving his quarterback of the future now\nThe instrument maybe as eventual hope is understands\nI'm sure this is another big test another big confidence boost for his young quarterback and that's a lot of it right you want more homes have continued to believe\nThat not only is he the man but that everything he's being told to do everything with Andy Reid and Reid staff is instructing them to do\nIs going to have huge payoff confidence matters and so's believing your staff especially with like for a guy who's instinct is is to be a gunslinger and you want to you want to utilize that confidence that swagger and we've seen some of that in the\nImprovising the moms have done but you also want mom's a freelance too often when he gets under pressure started to think that you can do things that they can't and part of that product part of the way to make that happen is for moms who believes in really good hands every time he when he was going to look at the end you read more and more like the guy that he can trust with every part of his talent\nAnyway Andy Reid or they can get said he gets how big this game as and he talked\nAbout facing this patriot seen this week\nI got a heck of a football team court rational to that either he's a he's a good player so all at all it's a it's a great organization um should be a great atmosphere for football game obviously there's excesses\nDocumented and and well done so ah\nAnd bill bill's phenomenal a job that he does ah especially the veil sustain it for many years as they head has\nReally weird to hear bill bell jak an injury based on ice you know and do so and he's like oh Bill Bill so like a cool\nGuys the things that are holding hands come by on and being best friends but can we just get back to teams that hate each other and Bill Belichick monitor into his microphone with the disdain of man doesn't want to be there Stewart I'm Kovacs is the executives are the shown us to I'm trying to keep\nIt straight but the raiders your favorite team I think the chiefs are your favorite team and the and the pages are your six favorite team at present you with kind of an emotional dilemma\nWhere you know like the trace where where you know if none of them play pen say we're going to this game where where's your what's your heart what's your head tell you\nActually very much disliked both teams but I don't you don't like the ... of\nYour writers fan right you know like the patriots have because you don't like sports\nI just wanted me to [laughter] everybody everywhere you have to admit\nTheir excellence is utterly and totally ridiculous\nOh of course it is um after the game I think the cheese are going to go in ... when I think will be a close game probably end up low thirties high twenties but I like the chief died I like what I see from patch moms and not ... I think they're going to be New England\n... even though my dining in like in the living dirty little little a\nLittle Jersey I mean usually usually on that game 'cause ...\nI might I actually know what I might put some money on it\nYeah get I Can't stand them on the line registration Kansas City yeah make that cash\nFelt like well I like the way you're thinking I might have to do that\nDr ... city you know\nCertainly he would only say throwing dice are you more of a blackjack guy or is that you know do you like a little bit of everything\nMore mostly a blackjack and slots Iraq in like the high stakes lots oh yeah I have to be I say come on like a thousand\nDollar token just one after the other ... Kovacs has no fear\nTotally every time you're the homes of slots are just as your gunslinger and I respect that about you trace where uh want to bring it back into the fold here without any uh you know hardship or or anger over your decision to turn your back on Notre Dame which I'm sure as emotional for you know we're just not going to bring it up anymore that that trail where do you have you gotten this game\nThe more you all the more you can say if you have at least ten thousand dollars or more in credit card bills this debt forgiveness program can be very effective coal for free information and find out more now\nEight hundred to knowing one six six seven oh there was no cost or obligation for the information don't wait called eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh let's see hundreds to knowing one six six seven to get your debt problem solved called eight hundred to not even one six six seven oh today not available in North Dakota\nCBS Sports radio we saw in northeast Nebraska ... am seven eighty five point nine FM news talk W JAG Norfolk\n\nHome mind Lisa ...

I was live at the athletic\nIt is good it's good to paint a picture for\nYou and the listener I've currently a back in a\nHallway at the SAP Center in San jose we have Lakers are coming to and fro and warriors coming to and fro and little preseason action as the LeBron era continues to unfold but things are good\nI have you may ... by one hand the phone I'm not gonna be managed and it's all\nWell you would take the brunt over me I got\nOne question ... it may make you one question that given back to Sammy I Love the story you did on Jeanie Buss in the things that went into her decision making her leadership\nTo try and learn the brawn James I've been saying something for a while that I've been I've been accused of hot take as much as\nThat I thought gee and the potential to be one of the best owners in the NBA and and your story is laid out why why that might be the case\nUm there's a lot here but one of the things that struck me was there's a there's a part of the peace where we're Jeannie meets Kobe Bryant for lunch and he convinces her that she needs to move on from Jim bus and Mitch cub jak for this franchise what can you tell us about that conversation and where it came from\n[noise] so I mean timing wise it's early February and I don't believe they had announced the decision to add\nMagic as an advisor just yet but he was on board entirely and she's and try to figure out and do you got you know Jim ... Jack in the front office do these are not positive good times and you have the gym and Jeannie dynamic it's been tricky and you know got a pen three years and Jeannie doesn't know what to do that\nShe has a data provided about why let gym in ... in the front office get through the summer which based on\nJim's kind of self prescribe timeline that was that raised about quite a bit you know that summer would have been the first time that he would be a real danger and and the expectation would have been that he might walk away like you said he would\nBut this is pre emptive because it's February and she says I got to South Dakota and I want to lean on him and they have a obviously a close relationship and she's still a door to all these years later and wants to hear what the ... say and she gets in her car and goes down in Newport Beach there's little joint called the coliseum grill where they get a table by the pool\nAnd a little bungalow and they talked for quite a while and and like you said bill Kobe just doesn't you know for a conscious he says you can't go halfway here if you go out a way they're going to have knives in your back its it's time to clean house here and get rid of the gym and mentioned an elevator magic and then obviously you gotta love with\nThis is a Coby move that ever there was one you know if you move after that was like a rock lake or if I Walk on aging the the general manager and lo and behold that's what happened\nOne of the things that I ... I Know the ... there's a lot more that goes into I'm oversimplifying it but\nMitch come check and Jim bus give Coby Bryan a major two year contract and I think you could argue if you were to take his you know just to the bathroom perspective maybe he's not worth that much money and the people that the person they negotiated with his Kobe's agent rumbling or\nThat contract then leads to some of the problems Sammy and making then it turns out that when those guys go away the person that they rewarded pull Lincoln Coby take power it's a ... it's just an amazing it's amazing how much politics go on behind the scenes\nYeah I mean it's good work if you can get it right and you can get paid on both sides of the transaction that's not too bad\n[noise] uh you're not the only thing that I'm a nuanced there certainly would be that\nYou know Jeannie was a hundred percent\nBehind that Kobe contract at the time and you know I think a driving force behind that decision and and yeah I remember talking to her time her said she thought people were crazy who thought that it was too much money to recall because you know she\nWanted to send a message to NBA stars all over the league that lake or land is a place where we take care of our own and you know we don't all of a sudden try to get you at a discount deal because it's late in your career and so you know that that obviously was a controversial contract but it is pretty wild to go from that to what we're looking at now\nSay make from the athletic here on the show Sam certainly genius fathers someone that she's talked about with me with the with everybody how close you was to him and how much she lived up to him up one of the things that Dr busted so well as have remarkable relationships with the stars that transcended business and there was some trust there\nObviously is your story walks us through in great detail and it's a great piece of the athletic you should check it out if you're listening right now Jeanie and Kobe very close what do you know about Jeannie in LeBron's relationship\n[noise] so I mean that is at the end of the story and you know it was interesting stuff because I was waiting to maybe get a couple of anecdotes from er about\nHow maybe they've gone to lunch or maybe they caught up in some capacity and I I was surprised that she is actually said I said how you know how's the getting to know your process going round so far out wealthy you know ...\nAnd she kind of laughed and she says well he he retweeted me the other day you know that was exciting and she is kind of staying at arm's distance and giving them space I'm you know they have interacted here and there but there was no\nDieting and she is kind of staying at arm's distance and giving them a space or you know they have interacted here and there but there was no relationship\nGoing in you know they they had been at the same room when there was collective bargaining beatings during the two thousand eleven lockout abroad obviously part of the executive committee and Cheney being on the you know I don't want her on the board of governors was part of that as well but no foundation there um and she's been trying to be supportive of\nDifferent Hollywood endeavors that it has on social media or you know I think it's\nSmall so it was a movie he was involved in she's tweeting about that you know we saw\nHow she she does have that kind of a mama bear mentality where when President Trump had gone after the brown with that tweet awhile back you know gee and he was having his back and putting out a statement this kind of you know pushing the narrative the other way so that is the extent of it I really you know there were no story is at least at this point\nAbout Jeannie LeBron really sitting in a room and connecting she knows that\nPutting magic in the spot you put a man was the move is certainly paid off because he's the guy that once you got in the Bronx house and went to a broad realize what that partnership might look like they said you know help get the idea of a\nSemi making the course of your reporting were able to ferret out any more detail the things that really\nWith the Lakers had a poll for LeBron and I know there's a lot that goes into it and he talked about his family and his family's decision making but in terms of the Lakers culture Dr buses reputation gene whatever it may be do you know some of the things in the basketball side that mostly appealed ... brought about being a Laker\n[noise] you know I feel like all across the board forget about the family stuff in the business stuff that that was a those boxes are checked into that 'cause that would be positive for him personally\nIt was almost from there just a case of\nAny of the other boxes not getting back to the mess it up to the relative so if ownership was best if ... were still\nThere are the same roof and fighting\nBeing uncomfortable having all this history of even Mitch you know no no offense meant ... a longtime respected executive but I think if your liver on\nYou know the idea of a clean slate like his agent rich Paul says in the story was a feeling they have to be part of building a new culture so that mattered on from there the basketball stuff\nIs he likes these young players quite a bit\nThey were a little surprised to to have no edicts from him helping in the door of you know move this guy that guy\nGet older they're more experienced veterans that they were going to have he was going to have patients that tried to let this thing grow and I'm Still surprised by that I mean this guy's not in the prime of his career anymore even though he's playing like it and uh you know he gave a lot of freedom there to figure things out\nSammy make in terms of the relationship between ... and Jim and obviously a sister making awesomely the decision for\nOrganization or father's legacy to fire and embarrassed I noticed that the intention but it's a tough thing for Jim bus to to get rid of Jim bus any insights on what led to the attention to the distrust of that relationship not working out in an ending the way they did\nAnd Nineteen I Belong to clip the ... report on Charles

I I Want to draw I was looking at your sleepers and everything so one of them you like Josh Gordon a and you think he's starting to science and magic when Tom Brady up in a box bro\nYou're only going to get better as he gets more practice I'm and we're finding time and so last week you saw a slight uptick in target I'm\nYour quarterback down and you know obviously was number five hundred but ah I think this given the the match up again you know sixty points as what they're expecting between these two teams and\nYou know he's at this point better than Chris Hogan who you're going to be behind that I'm going to grow up with a they'll take some shots and you know if you want to just play the higher ups are car he's got a high upside is you've got to hire an upside as anybody on the on the on the slate for the ...\nAnd ... who had won catch a for one yard last week you think you'll have a bounce back week\nHe's off the Andrew report you know so that would tell you that he's getting close to a hundred percent as he could possibly be with those issues are the raiders or bad you know and so uh I don't know the Russell Wilson having high volume day but you can be efficient as we saw after Twenty one attempt to three touchdowns in those the only one of them\nUm it's a risk but that's why there's we prefer eating ... the guy who need the money and you're stuck I I Would take a chance on\nA show I shot I hear a favorite started the weakest famous genus\nLoves him as this week you know you know you just look at what the opposing quarterbacks have done I guess an Atlanta defense\nOr twenty seven or more fantasy points is enforce straight games they can't stop anybody because they're so banged up and he stepped into an office that he's never played in before you know Todd ... system is allowing these guys to go down a field you saw it with his Patrick I think they miss a lot of success as we can and most likely going forward as well\nI ... and the steel city around the Jamie hanging in the\n... what's up for all of them got um I got receiver too and my blacks and I got four choices Chester Rogers Philip Lindsey Dionne Lewis and um\nHe has made a tiki cutie\nYeah I I I think Wednesday for sure ah the standard or PBR maybe are sorry\nYeah then um I I think maybe even take a Wednesday and goes both receivers of Rodgers and and you see uh they're they're just again so heavily involved the last two weeks it's hard to overlook that\nUh the colds obviously need Rogers would help them out and ... you know just a song lots of leaning on the ... number one receivers against buffalo because baby is why it's so good I've been very successful not that you're getting away from ... in your case you can a teenager soak up talking to\nA data Jackson my man Steve in Portland, Oregon\nA frail hey I'm looking for a PBR I've gotta flex I've got ... I've got Royce Freeman and I've got Aaron Jones and I'm also kind of question whether one of those should go ahead replaced a democracy I had him since she's going against a Richard Sherman\nOh I think the ... destroyed Richard Sherman at this point I'm so strict with Adam and\nYou know it's interesting I I like hearing Jones a lot this week I'm lock it's a very big high outside places because the raiders have a lot a lot of big plays on the field and clearly that's his specialty uh but I think you look at game situation game pro Packers at home should be winning the game\nOne syllable shores Rolling Stone who you are just off\nThe specially when you're doing it rose Bush\nShip has sailed the team is never going to win a title have had long enough and the windows closed on comedy that's gotta be some shows or the Jewish he is gonna get absolutely mellow by and they are going to a huge him like enemy number one\nWhere the useful\n... by a guy go everybody has a quick way you can save money switched to a guy go to Nate homeowners runners motorcycle or boat insurance to add that to\nGo to guy go dot com help people affected by hurricane Michael ...

Richard guys are going to get in front of your just try and knock that off there's not a lot of Russell is like that it that that high level besides like a ... or you know or a bigger who's by ... there's not many guys I haven't read or going to be ... to\n... lounge mounting him yeah most of the guys that I'd rather God's stripped down in front of your tried knocked\nHim down again and and he and I not only that he's got him he's not data them right and then he's just landing these bombs to everywhere is ribs and face I mean ... gray is despite already one right the dirty won and he's won both rounds total domination then the ... decision without a doubt\nYou'd probably say both are probably\nAround age strikes out swinging with the runners on a coroner's with a horrible strike out\nWas your ... now you bomb ...\nOh my God did you see that last strike\nTerrible event before them on the one one county just complete with two\nHe left to manage on where the terrible strike out swinging\nYou lose you lose you lose you lose\nLaugh to demand on with a terrible strike out swinging\nYou lose you lose you lose you lose\nSome mafia you haven't told me who you're taking a wood tomorrow would ah shale charcoal Simon and fate or for a rally in and go\nOh that's such a tough fight to pick his tail is under SARS and that division and they should have been you know be ready by some of these guys with the way the Muslims have worked out like I said if you're a good wrestler by the heavy weight you know where you could actually take all these guys down described it out like he's done\nEspecially because the law because before it up and coming up we're and even you know normal everywhere to find a life heavyweights before you got to this year so\nI think you know there was one of the best ever and the guy who was much better ticked on the fence and some of these other guys with the way he saw has been going through these guys I have to think that he's going to come in they're just trying to take him down and burned out a win like you've done before ... ...\nYou're on San and yeah I think so I mean ... or is it better fighter but whose legacy is really Turner's over the last couple of years he's gone way down hill from what it used to be\nAgain nothing left\nI think is very little left I mean the the last that he probably left the exposure to them as your own probably both marked each other down at the same time and then that you got back up and finished them\nI don't know what happened but they delayed that San Diego state Airforce game I don't know what's going on there usually there's not a whether a problem in San Diego but that games on CBS much never again it's it's in a delay and then to Utah game is twenty eight nothing huge at rice that goes over Arizona I got to tell you\nIt was only fourteen now and maybe they put the er the fares asleep in the in the wake up to continue\nMy question is is how his cabin someone\nLike ... is that I\nCouldn't be any worse for this guy than what he's doing in Tucson I mean this guy was that and I'm making what seven million dollars\nAnd now he's in Tucson it at Arizona and they are just atrocious now they said there are three and three to one of the bad job but they don't look like a tonight do they down twenty ain't nothing it does not I mean maybe it is just a bad night is that what it is because it looks like a football team is are not prepared\nThat they are not ready to play your down twenty eight nothing on the road they I mean they look awful\nDown population you know they don't look like a a a good football team to me at all they do nothing right and they ain't got a chance to take a couple of laps at the end zone he didn't do that\nA try to get a veal they miss that I mean they are doing nothing right than I is it just a bad night or does he have a terrible football team down in Tucson\nI think is a turtle football team you got to try to get some big recruits and over the next couple of years it's not as a school is brought in a lot of high level guys that have really you know the big thing in the ... told they might get one or two players here or there might get a one good quarterback or one good running back there never seen a stocked with talent\nSo this fight is going to it's three and a half minutes left in the whole fight is going to win unanimous only been over since the ... or ... but didn't wasted time right and they just like end it\nBut and he's done there's always winning he spent the entire fight on his back getting his ass be by date or who's been on top of them just mounting in like a horse so that's a done deal so he'll fight ... fight the winner of the other side is that what it is hard to wonder if tomorrow by us and when when they do that\nSometime next year probably early in the year for the world for them to rebel right\nCan you imagine that 'cause it's painter guy looks really good on the ground and me\n... wrestler and if you're a guy that's going to try to you know just opposite Donald's he has a good right here on the knock you out to\nDo is one of the top guys in the euro seeing the light of division when they lost in the developed or that was a big loss for their you know Peter worry McDonalds you know some of these guys that they've taken a gate guard with saucy they actually have some guys are your top ten fighters and their division the belt to us so that will pay you more or less a All right\nSo the bottom line is they are but I'm more money and they left\nYeah I mean all the depth of the U. S. C. dogs but they're doing some of the top part are still\nSo uh tomorrow you got college football all day long and we can talk about any game you like\nI Can't even fathom that you're not on the phone and they right now talking about college in Berlin football I mean you got two hours left to talk to me about games and you know if I'm you I'm running to the refrigerator right now getting a cold one and I'm just cracking\nCalled once and calling for us [noise] but I'm Talking about [noise] every game [noise] you know ... game every game all the games whatever you want\nWhat are you doing what are you waiting for the second coming I mean this is your chance on a friday this is what we do this is how we roll on friday we just doling out locks\nThere is a lightning the life of they send you to go see therefore it's getting really a huge rainstorms coming over them\nWesterly wins five to ten miles an hour\nFifty eight tomorrow chance for scattered showers chance for scattered showers tomorrow night thirty three a dusting of snow Sunday I mean you're all ... for news talk W.

Wisconsin\nCalled a George Web and the original owner back in Nineteen forty eight made a prediction the brewers at a time or a minor league team\nAnd he said when the brewers when twelve straight games I'm going to get everyone free burgers so it never ended up happening\nUntil all the way until Nineteen eighty seven where they want twelve games in a row and they gave out over a hundred and sixty eight thousand hamburgers so the restaurant it sounds a new ownership they have continued the tradition\nAnd last night the Milwaukee Brewers won ... games in a row\nThey're planning on giving out\nA hundred and Seventy thousand park or coming up on Thursday from two to fix the ab\nFab ass I I that's fine I'll go have a few burgers out\nIn Milwaukee\nLet me ask you this ban Horwitz 'cause I think you will happen is through observation and you know a thing or two about burgers ... fatty acids are going to be given out they plan on a hundred and Seventy thousand burgers how many buttons you think they've already ordered\nIf they're giving out a hundred Seventy thousand burgers then that would be three hundred and forty ball that stretch of forty thousand top and bottom that would be a hundred and Seventy thousand fold one reason I'm counting top to bottom says because I was debating last week was what Donald's\nThat their pick that up for that to bottom by\nNow and whenever I think burgers I think in terms of the bottom yeah that'd be a hundred and Seventy thousand but they were clown they order two hundred thousand burger about the case in case they screw it up a little too much catch up on a bond you never know often out or maybe you plan to give a hundred and Seventy thousand maybe at the end up giving out some more burgers well\nApparently they're only giving out its limit one per person sure which stinks\nMaybe I have to end up giving out some more burgers well apparently they're only giving out its limit one per person sure which stinks who eats just one burger I got to be honest it in fast food\nWise you go to regular wise no go to regular rattling Reiner one yeah and one burger right fast foodie you can't just want to be fair I don't know the sides of the burger at George even if it's a fast food joint and ain't that big\nBut you gotta order extra bunt because I'm sure their idea of the promotion is yeah we'll give out a bunch of free burgers its good publicity but all the fat asked is out there like Ben James and that are going to come in they'll get their free burger and then order another to\nDo you think that as well end up going you think will make the trip because he's been traveling the world that eating a lot they were just in Idaho\nI don't think so ... what's the date that they're doing this Thursday hers 'cause I Know he's going to Atlanta this we know nomad made out of Milwaukee no\nBy the way I did you watch the most recent nomad that da ... did it was excellent the one at a joy Boise yeah it was great morass by the

and murder has just goes gets a husky taken that's never had\nThat in the video and all that food right now are you one more thing on the burger trivia\nHow many pounds of beef you think they've ordered oh so it's a hundred and Seventy thousand ... let's do some quick Matt probably about a quarter pound per burger right of the science that you have on this\nSo\nI'm going to say seven hundred and cause I'm accounting for a little more burgers seven hundred thirty thousand pounds of beef\nThree hundred thousand to four hundred thousand pounds of beef fat so dancing there was a big burgers and now the that's half the fast food burger I give them credit so maybe you only need to give out one person not even that yeah and a half\nPound before cooking which means it probably goes down to the third pound yeah you you can crush too easy\nYou know fun fact about myself by the way a job I had when I was at high school I was a fry cook at five guys that you know that\nNo I didn't but now I really want some fries\nYeah yeah and when you were trained there they taught you to\nPacked the bag with fries\nThat was how 'bout that over pack mhm that's the type of that has been slow yeah that's how it should be when\nWe went to orientation you know what they did they showed us how it should be done they had the entire staff there and they said we're going to cook up this bill in less than

strapped every few hours to do so much grease in these burgers I dropped the grease bucket oh no first day on the job or are you afraid you were going to get fired\nNo but\nEveryone's reaction it was as if it was the worst thing that ever could have happened here's here's the question though because I've always wondered and I always said to myself I worked at name your fast food joint I always said I I I wouldn't be able to survive because I Would just you know one for me one for the customer type of deal how much\nDid you eat so you would get a free burger or a free whatever if you wanted

everything that you're saying here's ...\n... show CBS Sports radio talk it about hotel back them juniors interview with ESPN which just see the end is that I Love the way just add there's did and\nI interviewed oh del back um she was right to the point followed up with a nice job just no reason for a little white just no reason whatsoever for little way to be there and it's done the giants are no good it's I Know the back of them are no good and the giants right now the last two years they continue to be a laughing stock\nA lot of laughing going after way of the blue right now and hey we'll see where it goes from here and this is a bad football team will see when they eventually pull the plug on the line manning baton let me ask you this because I Know you're a big a giants fan\nUm you don't think\nThey'll go to ... until the final what four games\nMay be of the season before they even consider it\nMoney that they'll they'll consider ... they can consider before just to see what they have in house because of the season continue like this you're dropping quarterback so the question is you know what what is ... because if you dropped a quarterback he's never going to get a chance to see the field\nBut\nYou'll see him before he the tanning do I think that it's highly likely no\nOkay so you don't go on and we'll play at all this year I think there's a chance but again this notion that they're going to you know hand the reins over to Kyle a letter the truth is that he has no future here if the teams as bad as what people think that they're going to be fair I Would like to see him for the final four you'll you'll see him up here\nYou I think that he's going to start for games I don't know about\nThat which is fair but if you if you're that far out of it why not at this point just play in the final four games because it's the same thing with the situation last year if they would have went to Davis led I think that that generation is totally different than what happened last year\nBut again that could do wasn't ready just to go you know sit on the line now reportedly what you know they wanted to do\nWas well you give us the best chance to win but if we're not in a game at half time then we'll take a look yeah it was a terrible situation right so this notion that you know based deport communicated we knew that what they needed to do was get wet into a game at some point\nBut the way they went about it wasn't right because if you want to see whether we knew a Gino Smith well any stinks yeah and he's a moron [laughter]\nIsn't that if you ... got punched in the jaw ... lost his playbook last year oh yeah I saw call banks say that it's on the ban in New York\nHe lost his playbook last year it was like too afraid to ask for a new one right is that all are year lawsuit in training camp and been hard says you know the inside information on the football giants and your sauces sources of sauces sources\nOr say that that is a true story it was confirmed by two sources so two sources of sources that lives on your sauce of some kinds of source\nSaid that they couldn't find what Carl bank said where\nHe lost his playbook for what the entire year was reluctant trying to get virtually the entire year quarterback how do you lose your playbook you're all lose their everything\nNow is done digitally you know there is no play book yeah everything's on the digital so he lost his eye pad yes coral banks pointed out\nThe coaches have the ability to go in and see how much time you're spending\nA lot of oil so to be the like lose it in the airport or something or again I maybe someone taking could they couldn't stand I cannot\nGet into the details of it I can just confirmed that the story is that\nSo you can confirm that he lost his eyes that yeah but maybe there could have been some conspiracy or someone just didn't like him and they may be\nTalking to make them look I'm not going to dignify that and make people think either way I'm just going to say that is that a good guess though by myself again I'm not going to dignify that I can\nTell you that we're going to do what they do in radio all the time that actually\nThe question again you could ask now a patch of them are bent harvest\nWhatever your name as did he have his playbook for the entire you\nKnow\nThat someone take his playbook I'm not going to their coach taken play ball player I'm going to say the answers that I Want to right now\nThe giants legend Karl banks was accurate in what he said on our New York affiliate today which is why Gino is a clown how dumb every quarter back do you have to ... playful how dumb of a quarterback the out to be just show up\n... because you're in San Diego going to movies\nI I once heard a story about your Marcus Russell it was a former NFL executives on Syria is a few weeks ago and he said they\nThey won the game to mark his route to a certain amount of place and they once gave him like a blank play book or nothing on the film and he came back I watched everything\nAnd there was nothing on it and that's what ultimately lead to him getting cut by the Oakland Raiders that was the final straw with your market so like if you're a quarterback it just shows you a quarterback wondering what quarterbacks don't want it if you can't keep control of your play ball\nThis is only an eagle for the best college

thanks for your time how are you\nI'm doing great how are you doing\nClub doing fantastic what a win last weekend down Seventeen nothing seven three headed into the fourth year defense get some touch down do you make a big play and you guys just put it into an extra gear twenty four nothing in that fourth quarter how about that\nYeah it was a live or one of those uh once in a lifetime type deals were to deal with ... percent and then the game\nAnd you guys have an opportunity to continue to distance the gap in the AFC North at a forum on start you got Pittsburgh coming in this weekend there are fence it's been up and down throughout this started this season just what type often do you expect the Steelers to bring on Sunday\nOr I mean remember you know so I was a competitive game on replay them they're going to bring their you know turf running game and you know been going to get water for and to Jews you and his checked out or extend players come in Pittsburgh football you know as it always is when we employ them ever see north\nTown tell you the first thing that crossed my mind when I thought about this match up I thought about the defensive lineman because big band is a bigger quarterback and you know it's almost impossible to hit the quarterback now in this league even though you guys have found a way to do it how do you approach trying to tackle Big Bend with the emphasis on now in the past are now\nAre you taking normal approach you know just once you get there you got to be mindful of the rules um uh you know sadly that's the difficult part of that we're in right now with this late but\nI'm not going to stop us from getting there and we're not going to think about it um as a mindset for for getting there are you know our mindset is to get there first and once we get there make sure you're secure in a way it won't be or whether they can take it away from you\nKnow I'm going to Carlos done lap right now and CBS Sports radio oh what's the new emphasis on not putting your body weight on the quarterback you've been taught to play football a certain way your entire life just how frustrating is that right now when if you even these on the quarterback the referee throats applied for Fifteen Years\n[noise] um it's very difficult [noise] um you know it's just one of those\nThings that you know the league took a stand on so we have to adjust his players and as you see a guys are trying to adjust to it I'm not really in favor for the players but I guess is in favor for them so we just got to you know respect it and just\nBut what it could just tell ya in trying to adjust to it or even referees went inside did they give you an how you should approach it\nOr just you know once you're secure the quarterback and tackle try to follow up to the side don't don't put your body weight on them if you can't keep from falling off the side to try to brace yourself put your hands on the ground and uh you know hopefully their social remorse\n[laughter] we don't have much of an emotional game that says when you make a big play and then it gets called back I Know you've got called for this and the Colts game earlier in the year how do you just put it behind you and not let it really eat at you and it affects you the rest of the law\nOr you got to take a deep breath reset and um go get it right back you know like you said on the coast game\nWas a huge critical pray for us uh but you know how to let it fester it might have kept me from making that next great place so I'm just got to take a deep breath reset and go get it right back\nWrapping up

I think that the parents is the difference maker in this one I'll tick Miami lie in the six and a half par with ...\nI agree with you which isn't a good things problem [laughter] I think the difference in the game it's a deep and Miami defensive line it's been incredible they're forcing takeaways and the truth is is that Virginia\nHasn't done a good job of keeping you know\nPass rushes out of their back you know I think that causes a lot of problem for Virginia gimme Miami minus the six and a half I think they wouldn't be the number several interesting position he could try to narrow the gap here just to be different or wait until you go with what he's actually feeling on this game for ... for what you got to really vote\nIt's both I'm going to take Virginia I feel like they've had a while here for to prepare for the game I Know Miami just is better up front on both sides of the ball but I think the uh cats even close\nI'm going to take her junior I feel like they've had a while here for to prepare for the game I Know Miami just is better up front on both sides of the ball but I think the uh cats keep a close\nEye ... takes the Cavaliers plus the six and a half let's get to the next game in them but to Texas and I'm coming off the victory up against Kentucky which was one of the worst defeat the gambling that you will ever say Kentucky\nHad a field goal and it's the cross bar for cell phone I on the wrong end once again because then a an animal they needed was a field goal they get a touchdown they win by six and they cover\nWhich was just such a pat boss at Kentucky was five and a half points on that one that really really hurts the reason why Harwood says such a big lead and and the\nAt South Carolina and two and a half points favorites and I'm the only two last is this your Alabama and constantly played pumps and really tight and they played Alabama as tight as you can so far for what Alabama has been this you're under a save it into something done by law\nHere but there are parts of the game for me it's the rushing attack and the ... and then this year\nHas two hundred and twenty six yards on the ground [noise]\nSouth Carolina is averaging allowing a hundred and Ninety four on the ground so and I'm should be able to run the football run it all day long on the flip side South Carolina been able to run the football hundred and sixty nine points to yards per game but am has only allowing eighty two and a half yards ... yards per game on the ground\nSo a better rushing attack brand and the better on defense for and um I like getting them to run their way to a victory even though they're on the road give me an on line two and a half\nWith what you got [noise] I really\nHate agreeing\n[laughter] because what is going to be the way you lose\nYeah and and that's why I'm a little nervous about the book and I also agree with most of your rationale\nThat we disagree a little bit a little bit on the lives not terribly as much as we were disagreeing and a few segments ago but now we're agreeing and all the pets yeah hey your picture on the decline that\nThat might be the case if I'm agreeing with you\nAll go into that I'm not the I Am Ron defense is just stellar\nI mean there's no other overall no other way to put it this game is going to come down to the quarterbacks I like I Know that mine just turn the ball over a few times over the last few games but I think that he is slowly becoming a star I think what we've seen with\nA a and M. over the last few weeks is they're slowly rising towards the top of this FCC [noise]\nThey catch we release resort released eight eight eight three away fifty nine fifty five state aid a thrill eight fifty nine fifty five or resorting release dot com call now\nKnows he says only fulltime sport's director Joe J. news talk W.

fourth\nThis Penn State have let down up against a Michigan State we shall see Baylor in Texas these coaches know each other going back to the American athletic conference Tom Herman when he was at used in ... when he was at Baylor the bailout funds has been good this year Texas fourteen point favorite maybe ... upset broom with Texas Texas\nHad a tremendous victory and a great victory last week up against Oklahoma let's see if they continue rolling at now five and a one\nHow 'bout that ever since they lost the Maryland they have they have not\nBeen concerned ever since ... they run the ... the rest of the way I'll tell you if you want to see all sense I think the over under the eighty one eighty two points you got what you see at the Memphis UCF undefeated\nOnce again top ten team in the country Memphis\nIs always often softens often you see as a ton of often they should be a high scoring game at the Olympic passing game definitely tuning in three thirty pm eastern or either ABC or ESPN two depending on where you do lie and that is UCF and Memphis we detect a say in South Carolina or Alabama plays Missouri\nCome on any picking gets help him out of this year until they go down not picking against\nThem if you want to watch bill Greer maybe do a little scouting he does play Iowa State that is it seven pm eastern here's a tough game it's a really tough game\nAnd the question is do you trust Jim horrible or not that's what it comes down to for me\nI trusted harbor earlier in the Europe against\nNotre Dame Michigan threw up on themselves up and we had such a terrible attack offensively to start out here ever since then Michigan is five into after that loss Wisconsin is foreign one this year the one last to BYU\nWhere Michigan's beat western Michigan then they defeated um\nSMU Nebraska\nNorth western and\nAlso Maryland this is a huge test and I mean an enormous task for missed the harbor because if he loses that another big game and now you're playing at the big house\nMan that would be a rough one now this line was interesting it opens up about a touchdown six and a half and is sky rocketed up to ten point so that means the money is being put on Michigan so do you follow the money\nOr do you go the other way this is a game I Would not touch I Want no ... this touching it I'm looking at\nSome of the numbers right now it's time for this year as one in four against the spread Michigan\nThree and three this this game that either machine's gonna blow 'em out or it's going to be a dog fight and they're going to crawl right to the finish line ESPN as Michigan projected at a Seventy three point eight percent chance to win this game\nCSPAN thinks it's almost\nSeventy five percent of a chance that Michigan is going to beat Wisconsin\nI have questions about Michigan they're often appears to be rolling after the Notre Dame law and I don't know what was confident\nBecause Wisconsin the thing that sticks out to me is that lost to BYU and ... dock is why twenty four and a Twenty one I was ...\nThis is once again I came I just wouldn't touch\nHorwitz let me ask you since you are very clear point\nAs I'll give you a little credit and make your ego even bigger and bigger and bigger than it already is if I put Wisconsin and Michigan on the schedule and we were picking them Horowitz where would you go in Wisconsin and Michigan bet\n... on the line is now ten by the way\nAt ten I'm probably taken Wisconsin I think Michigan runs this game but I certainly am not trusting gym or born that program with ten points against the ranked opponent and a lot\nOf the money is all been on Michigan it shows you ask people trust through harp on I don't get it\nHold on the money meaning on the spread or the money's on the money why 'cause I'll take the money right now we're going to write I Will start at six and a half now it's up to ten\nThat means people put the money on Michigan early at six and a half yeah but I I even then I don't know if I'm trust them at ten points no lab point no chance but I ... I mean look\nAt it with my own money I don't touch this game no not as a federal is if you're asking me to picket a handicap it that's what I'm telling you there's no way that you can trust your mobile I think Michigan wins the game but I I think it's going to be a little bit closer now how about one more Washington and Oregon your future quarterbacks\nThat you can trust your marble I think Michigan wins the game but I I think it's going to be a little bit closer now about one more Washington and Oregon your future quarterback Mr Herbert you're going to be watching ah Oregon and Washington but\nUh I'll be here but yes I'm going to be watching it for thirty pm that game you're going to do is it\nWell I'm assuming just because it's out west or no then I'll be at work on the show I only found like the times yeah 'cause I'm paying a pattern that tactic and it was like literally\nYou know hundreds of college football games I don't know when everyone's kicking off a regardless if it's three thirty that's going to be on my phone at work I'm excited about her and the prospects of the giants potentially getting or rover drink a beer for ... yeah I'm not into those dopey little you know stuck for\nSam [laughter] here's\nYour rolls his eyes they work out so thanks Mario at work but I mean do we really need a slogan that sometimes you do I got taken time out Jake Bell alone will join us next eight by five two on two for CBS beers ... latest CBS Sports update [noise]\nBecause we haven't seen somebody of sheer size in stature a play the position\nGoing into the year Jake everyone looked at the Senate seat south they thought it was the three team raised with the Panthers the saying send the falcons after the falcon slow starting I Know it's early it looks like this is going to be to team race what do you think it comes down to between saint Panthers\nWell last year the um the Panthers lost three times to the same uh\nAnd and I'll be very honest with you the Panthers fans actually did finding those games there was the secondary Carolina which struggle mightily against Drew Brees and company um and certainly look I think I'm surprised as anyone else about Atlanta I really thought this was a theme that was going to make a run now granted they've had some\nSome very tough injuries to overcome on the side of the football or they've lost a couple of games right at the end this year that it could have gone either way\nBut um you know the same outfit suddenly Drew Brees like we all saw the historic night Monday Night but that's every week I mean the precision that he plays when he played within the path in game\nAnd they just attack us so many different ways and then getting a marking on back\nIt certainly looks like they're going to be on a collision course when the division I think there'll be battle tested um you know I I think playing indoors helps the saints so having a very good record of teams have to go to New Orleans because I think they play different on the grass than they do indoor whereas the Carolina\nUh having a quarterback like Pam in defense the way they do I truly don't believe they have the carrier a carry than whether with them they they're they're kind of weather proof so to speak\nGoing off to things you said with the ... Jones still can't get into the end zone and then with Drew Brees he's thirty nine and he's still dominating the game that must be fun to watch for yourself\nWell start with Julio first um\nOr I just think that really kid as reaping the benefits of Julio being so good to be very honest with you ... and send new and tied in and I just think things are so worried about\nA really all that is opening up for some of these other guys so I think that will come um but that's just the issue that they're having and back to drew\nI'm at his age and he takes care of himself obviously very well but I like I mentioned earlier the ... fish in the path in game\nEverybody has to make sure that they are they're correct yeah and that correct angle on their out because the ball is coming out it's coming out and eat you listen to the receivers that played with him\nThey say you won't see him half the time because of his stature you're just going to see the ball coming out of a a bunch of men from the from the a lot of scrimmage\nAnd that's where I drew is so good you know I think we get caught up in these Arpaio's and some of the new little trick some teams are doing in the NFL well Sean Payton and Drew Brees I've been running the same place as two thousand and six\nAnd they've had the same success so it's about it's about precision and getting the ball out or because they run in the same place they haven't changed much and he and through is still on fire like he has been since two thousand and six\nDon't get to the former NFL quarterback data Jake till I'm right now is that guilt show on CBS Sports radio and they had a brief staying Cleveland but let me get to one of the other former teams in the browns maker made build has brought a new level excitement to Cleveland also with some other younger players in Denver a war and and also mild Garrett\nWell I I was only in in Cleveland for one year and truly you felt for the fans you want us to give that team a winter uh fortunately it was the end\nUh I was only in in Cleveland for one year and truly you felt for those fans you want us to give that team a winter are fortunately it was the end of the career and the body was breaking down to only started four games there but I Want to see them have success\nAnd I truly believe they will and I think it starts in the front office or they have a guy they finally have a football guy in charge and John Dorsey\nAnd this goes back to when I was there it was it was such a fractured organization from the top down but now that they have a true football guy and\nI guess Dorsey is pretty good because that team he left behind in Kansas City has a little bit of talent on it I Would say that\nBut er Baker may feel I think he's brought a\nAnd I'm using this term it and and I truly think it's in a good way he's brought a ... and it said listen we're going to win we're going to fight to the whistle and we're going to play to the end of the game and he's helping change that culture and they've added some guys in there I think the Jarvis land resigning was obviously very big\nUm but they're getting guys in there that they're going to change that culture and his team should have more than just a couple of when they really and truly should but Baker very impressed with him keeping his eyes down the field\nA feeling that Russia really a very very well and not looking just run out the pocket and its accuracy he's really really doing a good job very a very happy to see that\nYou talked about Dorsey you talked about my homes and the quarterback you got to be loving mismatch 'em coming up on Sunday night on Fox tomorrow between the homes with the chiefs and also breeding in the past\nYeah absolutely I think you know how tall than the gold standard for so long and ah and I just this New England team and I don't know what's gonna happen Sunday night but\nWhich is Josh Gordon can just give them a little bit\nI mean when they start lining up in this weather's going to start getting bad and braid he's got to be at its best and and you're going to line up and you're going to have you know Josh Gore and we're going ... Edelman Hogan and in the ... the little running back um ... it's a it's a matchup problem they're going to start to\nSee New England I think starting to really start to move a little bit in the next couple of months and and that's\nThat's kind of par for the courts for them and certainly my home what they're doing in Kansas City that is very fun to watch I watch this kid playing college they played LSU I Believe in a ballgame one time and he was a young kid and LSU just always loaded with talent defensively\nAnd this kid's singlehandedly kept Texas Tech in the game you knew his special care and certainly his arm talent is pretty darn spectacular and the way you can kind of moving moving the ... in the pocket\nAnd a and move around and make place it's certainly fun to watch\nWhat is it like for you obviously I Know you want it to be on the winning side of Super Bowl thirty eight but that didn't happen as the patch to defeat your Panthers by\nJust to be a part of one of those Super Bowl that breeding did playing and you look back at that match jump it was a high scoring a fairly late in a very good on the fence again but it didn't turn out that way as it was defensive dominating early\nWell the first and third quarter were obviously very boring and only a defensive player or defensive coach would have enjoyed it\nBecause there were two defenses that would just stalemate in both our fences and back then this is the old for Super Bowl o three season if you go back and look at statistics lay that New England defense was one of the greatest statistical defenses of all time they didn't allow much of a passing game running game of points allow that\nYear at all so we knew we were up against it um but yeah I think both teams just kind of the old cliche kept chopping wood oh and then play started happening in the next thing you know and ended up being a firework show so to speak\nI'm In good old Tom was able to get the ball last and steady all out of Venice area was able to kick it through so but I just still marvel at times age and the consistency that he's still playing with to this day\nThey do such a great job and no one talks about okay yeah belly ballot checking braiding and they're they're obviously hall of famers there that the cream of the crop but that off the line what Dante starting next year the year and year out\nUm went without office of line that is truly amazing to me I think that's the true MVP of that team and for years I've been saying that the U.S with some of the guys that he works with or with on the office of line it gets so overlooked and I just don't think he gets enough credit for what he truly does\nNo doubt about it on ... what he meant to them patriots coaching staff I Want to ask you about the giants you line man and he doesn't get a whole lot of time from the ... line but\nWhen you get that time it just seems like it checked down university for big blue you look at it also oh del back going to be doing this interview with little Wayne um by his side just how about the giants right now the state of that team and also Eli Manning is it looks like his career is coming to include sooner rather than later with the giant\nWell certainly that was fun to watch last night it'd be very honest I'm you know he lived a very simple he didn't have any time to do anything first and foremost and I'll walk them against Carolina last week\nAnd then they throw the ball down the field some and he made some pretty good passes but they're struggling so much an essay on Barkley\nThe reason he's having highlight film runs is because there's no light to run through in these creating its own lanes with his jumped cuts and jumping over people\nAnd running around people went through people are struggling up front you know and\nThat needs to be rectified but it certainly doesn't look good there and with the whole interview and things like that and in that market in the New York market are you kidding me I mean this is just\nThis is just so much feels that fire so it doesn't look like things are kind of going in the right direction to say the least and that's unfortunate to see I Know as a as a fellow quarterback it's a\nWhen you see things like that start to unravel you just kind of hope that the ink and pulled together a but it doesn't look too promising\nTo get a check Jill I'm

L. C. S. Dodgers the brewers in Milwaukee and things started off okay for the Dodgers\nThe N. L. C. S. Dodgers at the brewers in Milwaukee and things started off okay for the Dodgers they didn't last very long Dodgers get so little black by Machado and the second they're up on nothing and then it was a disaster for the Dodgers and the third and fourth\nAs Milwaukee's through the during the fourth inning they get five runs Brandon would rough hits home run a relief pitcher that's the third relief pitcher\nIn the history of baseball in the post season to hit a homerun you also get Santana Braun mix it in some singles and Britain do for the Dodgers was just absolutely horrible behind the plate defensively\nTo pass balls to errors and a catcher's interference so it was five on it looked like the brewers are cruising to a victory they tack on a solo blast or to make it six one and as I'm driving and I'm listening to the radio on here and then the aid\nThat the broadcasters started saying all Milwaukee is it a great spot Milwaukee's gonna be able to set up their bullpen hater won three things probably wouldn't be available for what was coming up tomorrow which ends up being today\nAnd you start to think Milwaukee's positioned himself nicely not to burn some of the other arms in their pen however the game was it over there were still sick doubts to be made for the Milwaukee Brewers to get the Dodgers out\nAnd you started to see that lead quickly quickly quickly get slimmer and swimmer swimmer in the ... Machado gets the R B I single Mac can get the RBI single as well\nAnd the next thing you know the lead gets down to six four\nSeven six for the next thing you know and you move ahead after two weeks or strikes out\nYou moved that I'm Chris Taylor he triples Lorenzo Cain the ball is in his love ... catch the ball is in the love of his glove you got to make that\nHe does not and then just in Turner is that what the dish man on third\nYou're down in the ball game six five you travel by one run well no you got to turn around and professional hitter he's had a miserable night so far one of the strike gets to be fair should not have been a strike at the ball so outside of the strikes on it was almost in the other side of\nThis box but they call it and and then I then with the guy entered\nThe approach on Turner was to go high on him was he kept on going high up on Turner sometimes ... other times he felt for the bay and he fell for it too many times he strikes out to end the ball game\nAs the Dodgers lose game on six sauce and it's a game of the Dodgers\nWhere you look back at it and you go from and let's let's start it off the car saw crochet kennel a home run to random order off the pet you just can't do it\nNow a lot of it was the poor defense for the Dodgers but if you're the Dodgers when you're down\nSixth one and you go from\nIt looks like we're just trying to just cracked away at Taft bullpen chip away and get as many people into the game as possible and use up that brewers both pen to then you make your clothes and the eight and then you make an even\nCloser in the ninth and you have a guy at the plate and Turner who is a good hitter and you had a chance to talk of the game\nYou wonder how that carries over into next game because you go from not even being into the game to them thinking oh we could tied the game or maybe there I said even when the game so how does that translate into game too are you still\nLiving in game one where you're depressed they lost the game they didn't play while they saw the chance to win it and they failed to do so or do you use that momentum\nThat you got late and you use your experience and your sports some fear into the eye and into the bodies of the Milwaukee Brewers so game too in the series is going to tell me a whole lot\nBecause if the brewers win game too there are too well or they go back to LA for three but if you're up to oh not a guarantee that you in this series you seem teams going through before and lose a series\nSatisfaction guaranteed ask about our indoor air package that includes the wave ventilation unit\nPlus a six stage portable air purifier dealer opportunities available for more information visit drawing house now dot com that's dry house now dot com or coal eight eight eight nine seven nine wave that eight eight eight nine seven nine W.

got Washington and Oregon you of course have a LSU an action as the LSU game to me it's it's good to be so interesting to see\nWhat happens between George at LSU as Alice use a team that\nLose to Florida last week of the ... top place to place had two other really good wins this year that should be fun and I met South Carolina Miami average in yeah just to name a few and you got a little Michigan\nPosting was constant and we could see if I miss the harbor a finds a way to get a one of these are big victories as if he loses is one\nThat's going to be a bad book especially when a lot of people expect them to win\nThat line opened up in about six and a half now at ten depending where you look so\nThis should be an interesting damned palatable when we first started that and I'm really excited that much for the play the games but as the week goes on you got some good match if there is do no doubt about that so I Hope that George Allen's you lived up to the hype and like I picked Ga land the seven so\nAnd I'm starting to jump off the LSU a train that I've been on for most of the white but hey you never know if it happens so makes the top funding by so fun each and every week gift teams they never expect to go down and end up going down like who would have predicted that Wisconsin would have lost to BYU this you\nKnow to protect to the ... you wouldn't have predicted that\nMost people not pretentious someone out there saying yeah I'd pick BYU I Want to be why you to beat\nWisconsin but I\nHappen to him what happened and\nThen there's always these these top twenty five games which are always a whole lot of fun let's go to Dallas we talked to see their next up CBS Sports writing ... how are you\nGoing on that doing great my brother what's up man I talked to them a full season baseball with you man go ahead no you know and I thought I was watching a walk in the large secular or last night after they met with the you know things in Milwaukee was gone Cruz right through\nWhat you meant the exciting part of the game then\nYeah yeah you know wake up a way to go to work\nAnd uh I wake up to go to work you know look at the fire at all and it was picked as far as\nYou know going out going down the box score and all the stats and everything that was like wow you know I miss I miss the most exciting part you know I think I think the Dodgers have all the momentum going into the game to the way they finish the game one I think though that was that when game\nTo game three go go back to Milwaukee when a and and finish it off of up there ... what you think about that\nAll the game to get to be very telling Caesar\nUm but here's the problem you may have a little bit more meant to be able to do late but it's still lost the game like the Yankees for example in game one it was very similar up against the red Sox same situation they were getting beat early they tried to make the comeback they fall just short and ended up losing the series\nNow the Yankees did win game too so maybe that momentum carries over for the Dodgers endgame number two and you try this thing up at one of the peace but if the Dodgers go down to low with the way Milwaukee is one\nTwelve and a row and now everyone's going to be getting burgers on Thursday a and Milwaukee from that promotion and they were they make a hundred and Seventy thousand burgers\nI got to be tough to go than have to win for up against Milwaukee if you're already in a a to a whole\nAnother thing I thought you know I didn't I didn't know Milwaukee has to Beth Reagan and then they looked at the yeah the bar\nOr yesterday told me you know he tells you a writer and I was like wow you know I I thought dodge add a better record but they were on getting better than us\nYeah they told me you know you do the uh it seems right and I was like wow you know I I thought dodge all add a better record but there were four game better than a dollar you\nKnow yeah and and that's why the Hannah and that's why these games that Milwaukee but it's a good point because for most of the year a lot of people this credit Milwaukee 'cause we thought that the cubs are going to win this division\nAnd then the last week of the season Milwaukee did what they did this start really getting this wrong going\nAnd they beat the cubs in game one sixty three we can go on to lose to the Rockies that regularly in the wild card around in the next thing you know Milwaukee is the best team in the you know\nA on a record standpoint going into this postseason the Dodgers had they went to the world series last year they lost in a very tough fashion at the end does not surprise me that they were as dominant as when people would have thought going into the air\nYeah and you know what I'm Talking about the American league you know I Would say Boston goal when it you know I've been there at all you know you you know they're feeding off from from what they say that that's that's\nBetter than what they were last year ...\nOr ... times better me starting pitchers and better me\nA note David prizes on me\nI I think I Am I going to be paid right man he's going to be pitching buddy better show would actually pay fees or I appreciate the phone call\nBut that's the beauty of baseball it's a beauty of all sports\nHow many times we look at NFL game like for example last year\nShe's been tied in Tennessee what one of the game and you are gay and even when the chiefs are up all those point you have a tendency to get on the game the Tennessee came back to when the game and baseball same thing I bought four hundred and eight games this past year\nWe are capable of winning form or games to get to the world series\nBut you just look at this juncture not\nThat is used in right now and you look at them and you say how do you beat Dan\nAnd that's what Boston their starting pitching staff to come up the aftermath of starting pitching abused in the aftermath of starting pitcher gave Houston and it's tough because you're selling game on you think it's great but you going up against her lander\nAnd then the game to call up against practical all day but maybe sale\nOutages Berlin's er and he'd be David Price does some magic trick doors that some prayer and ends up finally put them out in the post season so we'll see what ends up happening it's tough to discredit and count that Boston I'm not going to tell you they can't win the series\nBut I just have a hard time picking against Houston right now\nPeter Schwartz this year good morning Peter how are you I'm doing well how 'bout you doing fantastic guy real quickly Milwaukee takes the lead last night do you think Milwaukee wins this yeah I said brewers insects beforehand okay\nBetter way sorry I didn't mean for you to hear all that grumbling but seriously I just have too many containers in mind utility room for recycling they're stretching out in my door way\nI Want to recycle I feel better when I recycle not really I think something what would I Do\nI have an idea what am I ... everything that can be recycled into my one talk trash cans of it and just start at when I get to the recycling center\nI could get rid of my

that involves driving from Florida to northern New Jersey\nAnd at one point my girlfriend at the time her father said oh that's not good for the corps um you know at one point I drove straight through leaving Orlando at about eleven o'clock at night ended up in New Jersey in about three o'clock four o'clock in the afternoon\nAnd my girlfriend's fathers that that's really not good for the engine I said what really why he said well the oil that that's not good for the oil at all and this has been plaguing me for probably twenty five years now does the oil he implied that maybe the oil needed some kind of interesting period\nThe driving for Seventeen hours would degrade the oil so you should stop every once in awhile to regenerate or something and it does bug me and I'm just wondering um

edition and all of a sudden this thing just decided to stop a running one day I'm pulled into a a parking spot went back there\nYou know thirty minutes forty minutes later and it just wouldn't start with spin but it just didn't seem like it was getting spark so I\nGet under the hood I'm I'm pretty uh mechanically inclined so I tested out the coil\nI thought it was bad I replaced it replace a spark plugs and wires out there that some other things to things still wouldn't start so I took a thrift shop just to kind of helped me out\nThe guys at the shop came back with a a estimate that said five thousand\nThirty dollars and Seventy they yeah they were basically replacing the entire\nEngine [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah ... and they they told me that it was just in the ... and you know whenever he can disagree had compression values that he gave me and stuff like that well\nHere's the funny part as I'm going out to take the car I'm actually brought a trailer to get in a trailer that they're\nBringing a trailer to ... I just looked at him with the key and I said hey\nLet's just get it why one good luck shot here I go there like starts up like it does every time and it occurred like a kitten his face drop [laughter] literally I\nI mean he was [laughter] I got I got to ask you a couple of questions here to kind of give some foundation at this question here I think I Know why would do the guy in the shop a Honda Civic\nVP addition is you know I I I Know most of these nomenclature what year is this car\nNineteen Ninety nine\nAll right and how many miles on this fine automobile\nOr about one Seventy and I got this thing from my grandfather after he passed away gave it meticulously maintained and I really darn good at it too\nAnd the only real challenge we hear about these engines there was a no one\nI don't know it was a recall or Bolton but I Know they ... for a while that they had problems with the mating services between the head gasket heads there was a cracked\nBlock that would occur and oil leak in and it was that was something that was pretty well known on those but it wasn't it wouldn't lead to what you're having happen and yeah you know now\nWhat's funny is it's been about five days and it's running every single time I've been using the town car you know not taking it on the trip\nThis thing is running like it did before and\nYou know there's there's always been a little league on this car I Would say you know maybe five little drops a quarter of a teaspoon tonight you know kind of thing but nothing nothing big and yeah\nIt's been running so\nLike I said I replace the oil and the whole distributor assembly there and it's been running you know\nLike a tough I I just don't understand\n[laughter] well any\nWrestling too soon for a second this repair shop was not completely trying to rip them off yeah I ... and now they're interested in start and when it didn't start like he's been having trouble with maybe it founded our annual\nIt got full of fuel to where it was just washed out and the compression was off so they said hey you're gotta you gotta compression issue is the engine needs to be replaced it's going to cost five thousand bucks well that sounds realistic in that case I would've said there's no way I'm spending that much money on this older car I'm going to go the Kurdish part a cop and pick up a used and\nWanted to keep the car going that'd be a great thing to do that's\nThe way you do it or if you wanted to keep it going but\nNow that it started I'm going to say well\nHey it starts in runs perfect there's no way I had a compression problem and then now I don't I think we've got an electrical thing going on where we are not well obviously we're firing you inject or is that we've gotten a few in the flooded out and make it to ... you know spin like that without compression\nPistons assuming somebody was not completely trying to rip them off\nWell that's a measure of time that I've actually got a new story that you don't want to hear that will make you very angry with ... small for some people out there that do that kind of stuff to make it so hard for what he's trying to do it right and I I just I don't know of any personally that I've seen it over a decade federal else that I just want to read the news story wow okay I Do\nBut I think it's got an electric thing we're going to find it the next time it doesn't fire we're going to find out do we have spark\nDo we have you'll I'm almost that and we're going to find we don't have spark and it's going to have to be diagnosed and even if you replace the whole distributor assembly\nWhich is a huge problem on those cars are we went through you remember that one car which then we went through like five three ... three at least at least three distributors before we got a good one new ones brand new that we're supposed to be quality parts so they fail and they have repeat failures often you gotta make sure you got a good\nQuality I Would for fun district just because I'd be curious person may be on this deal has the right of compression test on it now that it's running yeah yeah yeah yeah that and just confirmed that this engine is healthy 'cause a hundred and Seventy thousand miles and that's the big engine has not been done and\nYou know what right I'm betting that shop that got that look on their face of a if you still you know given the benefit of the doubt they might actually do a free compression test for is just to see 'cause I knew in ...\nI mean I Would if somebody went like that is if you know what I Can't believe I missed that I Want to see why they pick is yeah we're human things haven't we've had vehicles that are in a way that vehicles or auto recycling facility that will start\nAnd they've gotten to Russia service Centre and we found out just the opposite that they had gotten flushed with fuel and it doesn't happen a lot but they'd gotten ... feel ran through and they just they they just had no compression left and so they were able to\nDrain everything out and let it sit with the plugs out for a little bit and turn it over and and\nRemember when I parked on a on a friday and a Memorial Day weekend and it\nHad no compression the plugs route nice stuck back in and I said we're going to push it outside because it\nIt's going to be junk that's going back to our recycling center were just checking it out it was wrecked a car and uh the tectonics started up and he was what was wrong with this new one\nOh one [laughter] and we checked it and I've even read pretty rough to build and how this thing that we've received this well a long time ago we checked it again with a so key ... that we need to really look at this\nThis isn't a building on this thing without which we see that as well a long time ago we checked it again with a so key ... that we need to really look at this so\nEd thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk to Jeff Jeff you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\nTo two dollars or to do it in\nAnd out of the radio in the car\nWith a couple of years ago and uh\nA few years is okay I didn't know if there's

circuit only has the one fuse\nOn some of the GM cars they run an accessory\nFuse that does one part and then they run another fuse that does another part on some of the gym vehicles but if the rest of doing that thinking look too if you can think of the ... on the Ford is there anything else on the radio circuits well the ... circuit could come into play\nI'm for my first thought is I'm going with the the radio piece of it\nI'm going with the gym thing where we've got two circuits and the old Ford's yes but we're seeing more and more vehicles now that you were a correction and they have one power circuit\nJust like your home computer has one power plug now if you don't get it will keep its software in there because it does have a built in power supply backing it up a lot of these radios are going to hard drives and different things but yes you can disconnect them for like\nTwo years before they'll lose all their memory and it'll yeah a lot of them\nJust have the one circuit in there but if it's losing memory I have seen some radios that we have had to replace it in the last couple of years now in about seven or eight right in there when they switched to the started putting newer design radios in some with\nMore features ... feature radio or whether it's each the radio or my link with the GM and\nYou know Ford's got sink and things like that and those rodeos yeah there you turn to Kiev and they're like I if I turn the key off for two days I lose all my stations but if I just drive it every day is fine and and that's and then the radio you have\nYou ever completely dead I mean that's how ...\nHow do you know there were ... ... ... that's a lot I mean part of your if your friends you care about yeah I Know I'm a big heart and\nTell them to bring their Britain

you're going down the road your you know your engine is turning at let's say two thousand rpm\nAnd if it's in direct drive your drive shaft is turning in two thousand rpm\nThat doesn't mean you're wheels are turning at that speed because if you've got up for like say a four to one rear end\nYou know you're turning around the dry chef four times for every one time and the wheels so if you're

it's there's the computer handles everything so you wanted to zero so what you do as you started up unless they it says plus Thirteen that's enough to turn to check engine light on so what you'll do at that point\nIs you'll move the distributor the direction needed to\nGo back toward zero move with their then tightening down start the vehicle up read the scanner again and if it says plus to\nShut it back off move the distributor just to hear more tightened it up fired up until the the engine read zero you don't need the disconnect and then you just do that until the offset says zero if you have advanced\nOr retarded a little bit they actually call that now instead of a distributor a high voltage switch it's just really which plug it goes to if it's awful little the engine may run really well but it'll burn a distributor capping Roeder up quickly so\nThat's why they want that perfectly zero so that's how you set it you need a of a scandal do I'd be scared of that scandal thing it

six yards does have one touchdown pass the colon Johnson that being a forty four ... part of Johnson's big afternoon six catches Ninety eight guards and the touchdown but Blue Shield does have one interception that perception led to the touchdown drive in this quarter for Baylor Baylor\nA lot of self inflicted wounds that rich they couldn't handle an interception in the end zone dropped a touchdown pass also nice penalties for eighty seven yards all told obviously going to be a one score games going into the fourth quarter is number nine ... leads Baylor twenty three Seventeen as we get ready to go to the fourth quarter here in Austin\nYou know Judy how about the job ... rule is done down there I mean they took their lumps last year I mean he walked into a situation that was just brutal\nThey won one game they won four so far this year and ... and again the bulk of their schedule from here on in is not good uh but there are four and two at the midway point of the season and down by six in ... in Austin\nTo write a they're they're looking like they're ball bound which if you told a the Baylor fans listen\nA new coach going to be a building for sheer second year a bowl is a given night telling what kind of a ball but a bowl is a given I think most of the band the fans have been okay with that and they say if the coach can pull that off we're happy with our new coach\nYeah I think it's going to be a tough one the way the rest of the way here for them but the fact that they're in this game right now after three quarters in Austin after what the longhorns did the last couple of weeks I think is impressive or speaking of impressive South Carolina today against Texas a and M. team coming off a big win or we could go a chicken with heat climb\nAnd the Yankees are back in the lead here but\nThat has been the story for them often today they put together a nice driver and had to settle for a field or small from thirty nine yards out give them the Nineteen sixty lead capped off and eleven play fifty\nFive yard drive to more than six minutes off the clock uh at one point it looked like they might not get any point would like to have an interception in the end zone but they got lucky enough to not want to have accounting and so again ... small thirty nine yard field goal game Cox now\nWith the ball they sport touchdowns and to point conversions on their last to dry it's trying to see if they can stay hot against this ... D than\nI'd love to go ... sorry about that he's going to do just fires right now Michigan State and Penn State's fourth quarter all even here's Jeff\nSaid has really out quite safe for the third quarter of the game you're a fifth day the farms came out a lot for a month prior an interception of for Penn State has all the preventive measures and put it together should've scored drive through the wires\nRoped in an opportunity to take away to here early in the or late in the third quarter rather thirty seven yard field goal it's\nHitting the right up right and that's no good by frustrates ... ... ... why is right now have to support their and their own Nineteen yard line basically a third of your life and we have fourteen but it's fifty three seconds remaining in the game ... fourteen Penn State or the\nLine has been pretty today for UCF uh at the liberty bell but they have pulled in front of Memphis early forth let's get more on this one from Tyler springs\nNumber nine UCF has capitalized on a couple of Memphis fumbled ... happening over the course of seven plays between the end of the third quarter and the store to the fourth quarter here the liberty ... it was UCS tightest Davis on the phone more recovery at their own twenty sick when the first half of the of the fourth quarter\nUCF then completed a third and eleven with a twenty four yard throw in the Memphis territory for Michael ...\nPreviously they were one of ... on third down\nEnding that drive of the seven yard touchdown run by McKenzie milk new helicopters over defender end of the end zone crossing the plane\nSo at the twelve fourteen market a fourth quarter number nine UCF finally claim their first lead of the game at thirty one thirty the last six Memphis drives ended in puns or fumble the tigers only have about nine and a half minutes left to go\nTo get something on number nine you\nKnow I thank you very much Tyler and McKenzie melt and trying to lead that come back today a fourteen of twenty five to Seventy six well Daryl Henderson nearly two hundred yards rushing\nFor Memphis it's been a good one still nine minutes left there and still fourteen minutes left and regulation in Baton Rouge Georgia trying to rally here down by ten with the ball here Scott Harrison\nSays why rich Georgia did not\nGo there first touchdown and ... seven seconds remaining third quarter and it was a nice one by a large Holyfield ten yard run for the score actually odd that Dr j bomb he was involved with her it would it be plenty for E R whatever ... you know so often but again\nWe Georgia going forward and now they now call now who really ... you know they are being taken this whole style\nAnd hundreds of thousands of people today big while they're not able to ... I'm not quite as you find that ... we're looking for work\nThirteen minutes remaining regulation at right now it is how a shoe leading Georgia by that is the issue like the Georgia nine that latest which for that route\n... thanks God and Jody ... has had such a rough day I'm surprised they haven't gone to Justin feels a you know waiting in the wings but from eleven to twenty seven hundred twenty three yards you just a second second ago and he's got an interception he really has done nothing\nHe's out of bed day a and I'm not going to make any excuses for him other than the LA she defines has really gotten after him he's been under siege all day now very bad at all the best of the best estimates\nWith guys around him and pockets collapsing and getting out on the edge and make 'em play and then shortly has done none of that but uh he has not always had the best protection from his office of line he has as I say I had been under siege all day long\nBut just maybe even just giving them a different look in the fields did come in for a play and then it was right back to from but you know I I just wonder if you sometimes you just need to\nA different look here and I don't I don't want to overreact but the way from his do and they just haven't been able to move the ball to which it up for a switch up sake they don't just a series give it give them a different look or something to see how it works I\nThe problem is undefeated but the season and he's been dynamite yeah he's having a bad day if you're making a change you're doing it because he's having a bad day yeah and I don't think they're ready to\nNo no no I'm not saying they should you know on see them as starter I'm just saying just make the change just to try to get something to go\n[noise] that would be nervy I'd give ... credited me I Know you know that if I were to go to I don't know that I Would you know\nHey look I mean ... ... has done it with Trevor Trevor Lawrence and you know obviously it costs Kelly Bryant the starting job and he subsequently transferred\nUh you know Nick Saban wasn't afraid to do it in the in in the in the championship game a year ago or he still has Jim and hearts on the ...

Harrison\nYes a big driver Alice another drop rally issue that we feel the victory but first let's talk about oh LSU store a couple of months ago Joe ... second time today on the quarterback ... ... in one yard out\nAbout a couple a significant ... plays on that drive it was just ... percent of\nWhat they forty one yet reception remember you had a yard earlier in the game and I'm forty one younger egos over one hundred yards reception or the afternoon and also why were you there yeah the yard rather that makes the ball gown with a one right before Roach scored\nAnd that's what you learned over one hundred yards she's on the day and then just moments ago after the war it was a ball on the kick off\nBy Georgia oh issue currently has all the lifestyle so with seven fifty eight remaining here in the water is Thirteen like LSU with a commanding lead over number to Georgia maybe about ready to add to what it's all a shoe one eight six George ... back to the rich\nNo thank you very much an UCF in Memphis a nail biter ride now late for the IRS Tyler springs\nMemphis down by one was about three and a half minutes to go here at critical third out of it coming up for UC up their own thirty three this could be the ball game right here members had eight thirty to yard touchdown run called back to the whole day and then got going out a field goal range if you have can convert here on third down\nMakes things very dire for the tigers UCF on top thirty one thirty\nAll right thank you Tyler so a lot of great stories today another great story has been the Cincinnati bear cats football program which went for an eight under its first of its first season under Luke fickle they have turned it around dramatically eight six start they are off this week at a chance to catch up with a bear cats second year head coach and\nAsked them how this drastic turnaround has come from me for an Eighteen to a six you know start\nTalking about coaching no [laughter]\nIt probably has a little do with coaching and has as much to do with relationships and\nBuilding some trust and respect and a lot of the things that were doing um our our guys play harder they play faster and and it has so much more to do with you know just relationships and and the buying than it does with fundamentals are technique or scheme 'em or anything specific to coaching to be honest with you\nYour defense gave up thirty one point eight times last year it hasn't happened yet this year in fact you've only allowed eighty\nSo that you start confidence that they play I mean you would say they play a lot faster I there are a lot of the same guys\nI'm I'm not sure that if you just timed him you'd say well well yeah you guys upgraded and are a lot faster but they're confident they understand what's in the wise um that makes them anticipate in look a lot faster as they play and then I'd say tackling I mean we've done it much much much better job of tracking the football\nAnd eliminating those big big place that uh the plight of so much last year\n... you know you never really know what you have in your quarterback until he goes out there and does it did you think Desmond Ritter would be as good he is he has been coming into the season\nYou know if we if we would have we probably would have said he was the start up from the get go but\nYou know it it's been a battle in in\nBetween doesn't and hate and more that they've you know fought it out all through camp all through spring football and really even fought it on the first couple of weeks of the season I Know that he didn't get as many opportunities after he started the first game but um you you knew Desmond had some some real gifts and I don't just mean his ability to throw the football I don't just mean his ability to run\nA but some of those other things just the natural confidence or the way guys kind of just tend to flock to him or he has some of those natural leadership qualities\nAnd you and said what you were looking for in a quarterback is someone who can make everyone else better how has he done that so far in Europe and\nKind of what I just talked about his ability\nUm you know they're not always be the ... you have to put himself out their first he looks at how do I help others and then return others are starting to help him or he just he has a natural gift that ah that charisma a little bit with the with the confidence behind him but he doesn't have to be the cocky guy always saying stuff you know he has the ability to do it\nUm you know with his with his actions every bit more than he does\nA with his words and as a young guy especially a freshmen coming\nIn I think that's the only way for guys to truly kind of buy in and believe in what you're doing a and he's done an unbelievable job of that\nYou have a freshman quarterback in the ... more running back and Michael war in the second who was that a lot of calories in part due to injury how happy to have you been with the way he is responding us for\nWhile he's obviously done a great job I think the unique thing about Mike as his durability um you know we kind of always talk about durability is more important than ability\nAnd to be a tale backing carry the ball as many times as he has in the in the first six games um maybe and for those games in particular are and to be able to keep on trucking I think it's it's just unique you never\nYou never know it's such a unique position that you know whether you're recruiting um every every high school team together a really good one and\nA lot of them are very similar and a ... it's hard to kind of determine the difference between who's gonna projected that next level and who has the heart and the will um that a guy like Mike Warren has I mean obviously was Mr football in the state of Ohio are and all those things have translated over or just to be the guy that\n... tough physical or can do it every single day even though the sophomore\nDog with Cincinnati head coach Lou pickle to bear cats at six in ... already bowl eligible in there by week after for when the season a year ago in your first year and there but as far as this turn around and one of the great stories has been and yet tell me how you been able to do this often to leave with a line that consistent to graduate transfers\nA sixty or former walk on we'll get more on him in a moment but a former hockey player and somebody who never played it down a college football until this year\n[noise] is called development and you know that kind of goes back to that believe in in in those guys and uh we want to be an office of line driven program we came in here saying that the thing we got to focus on of those guys up front and in a lot of times guys coming in\nJust in our program but college in general a specially a friday it's become so much of a scheme 'em game nowadays that I think sometimes we lose focus on whether it's really about and development of those guys up front of you know blocking and and and moving people in developing the strength\nUh and and that's what we put all the focus in and not that it's us doing it but it's there by an and belief\nOf putting those guys and positions it it took a little while um but I think we're starting to see some of those some of those things really pay off and those guys as we talk we see better that way here they do too\nAnd if they see some success and and I mean success from wins but even success from you know having the ability to move the football have ... to move the line of scrimmage\nYou get that by and it really really helps\nAnd I walk on that I mentioned Gary Campbell out for the season or out at least with a broken leg brains that are a considerable time you know he's not playing how has he been able to make an impact\nYeah don't count him out exactly as he is he is bound and determined I'm to be back in the minds of most powerful thing we all possess and\nIf there's anybody that can do it and anybody that can can help this thing here with his with their right mind is is Garrett but um you know he he his presence is about every single day yesterday at practice weren't by week\nYou know and I'm trying to pushing pushing pushing there's Garrett up there in the stadium I'm sitting up top because he couldn't get back all the way down with the with the scooter but watching the practice attentively I'm watching his guys and you know it doesn't take much to be able to point up there and say hey guys\nWhen you get tired when when when a when you think this is you know kind of crazy that were granted in pushing through this thing just think about that guy up they're sitting there watching with love and give anything to be down here with you guys for what he's put into it or did those examples um I was going to give us an opportunity continue to push\nTheir or Lebanon beaten teams in the nation your one but all three of them happened to resign and the American athletic conference not only the bear cats but also a central Florida in South Florida you play them as well as navy all in a row how Europe that final month of the season\nWhen we got to care for the final six weeks to be honest with you and it's ... I knew coming down the stretch it you know what I wanted to get up to a good start like any coach wants to get off to a good start but ah the ability to finish the ability to get better as you go through this thing we knew\nThat stretch run is going to be really really really difficult and I'm excited to see what our guys have a you know inside them you know they've they've had some success if experience some success but you go to ways either you you you get the complacency bug or you you get a hunger bug that\nYou start to love this feeling of of having success in winning and you start to get a little bit greedy and it really drives you\nStart when Cincinnati head coach Lou pickled the bear cats having a terrific season at six in the future is also a very broad you're among the bond youngest teams in the nation\nAnd during the season you brought in the best recruiting class and the conference and best among a group of five schools and of course sometimes you have to take those with a grain of salt but it is a measurable standard so what does that say about where this program is not only right now but we're going as well\nThat's right eighty percent don't wait until another

good one\nMy back and tires bunch though off to a great start after a down sees a year ago ever really having a breakout year\nBack in twenty sixteen but they have one of the best and most electrifying up until players the nation and ... and Stephen Montecito has taken another step and development as a good quarterback he has been a terrific quarterback so far this year completing Seventy five percent\nA chance to catch up with a Buffalo's head coach yesterday I talked about the big season two years ago before the ... but now the terrific starts what's happened in what's been the key to the turnaround\nWell our our young men are just playing really really well or coaching staff has done a phenomenal job with them and then in our quarterback is excellent and Steven Montana's and he's making a lot of things happened to portion defensively we've gotten a um a lot stout or on the fence and I'm just proud of what those guys are doing\nYou know you mentioned Stephen Montoya isn't how well he is playing he's always had the physical abilities which is seemingly become a much better quarterback at least from the outside looking in each completed over Seventy five percent of his past is this year one has made him transform from an athlete that is a quarterback to a quarterback\nWell you know quarterbacks need that experience and he's gotten some great experience and and played really well I'm In his show signs of that and he's now learn really he understood are off and it's really well but now he's learned to understand that these dances and what they're trying to do to him so he can see it coming he's been able to anticipate he's able to react well\nHe's much more on balance fundamentally when he's throwing now and uh that's making him much more accurate um and he's and then you can also make plays with his feet 'cause he's truly a\nSix four and a half these two hundred and twenty eight pounds and he can run and he can throw it\nA huge a great athlete but he's also now have a great quarterback\nYou have a terrific ... it has been an electric combination of ... uh who right now is one of the best college football players in the nation has he been a victim of the east coast bias in the sense that you shouldn't really be in the Heisman conversation right\nNow this is a an extremely um excellent player he plays really well removing all around he's able to handle all he's able to fight in the ... like Titanic place wide receiver um this is a great player and he'll continue to make plays this year and se continues to play well in it and we hopefully continue to when I'm all those accolades will come as what\nWhat has he been lying to coach or a guy not only is extraordinary talent but to come back from one he's been through growing up seeing his father killed in a car accident while being in the front seat it's certainly far she's real fast\nYes it does that he is an exceptional young man a very humble um he was a little shy when we first got him but now he's totally opened up if he really wants to trust people and and uh he's a pleasure to have on the team all the players\nLoving care about him and he does now he is just as happy for the other guy this court test out that he does for him so he really does and uh that shows you what kind of character I guess\nAnd I also don't want to forget about the running back position because that has been a big big key to the store and as well and Philip Lindsay and I had a terrific career and is now not too far from campus with the Broncos but how much this is\nNow nobody ... gene or building the rains you leave the airing till seven o'clock tomorrow morning gave you within twenty five miles north of Nebraska maybe continues on translator came to nine zero Eighteen at one point nine FM\nHard work and play and relentlessly and Trayvon they mail and has played really well and um you know has had four hundred and four hundred for a different one hundred yard games in last week he kind of put us on his shoulders at the end of the game and made some huge place to to run the clock out and just very excited about Trayvon and what he's doing\nWhat made him call Philip Lindsay and get the kind of get the lowdown on on the program before deciding to transfer\nYeah that was crazy I literally get a call from silk like eleven o'clock at night I watch all of your coach he goes on the back from um Virginia Tech trade like no I'm just calling to say okay I don't know who that is I don't know anything\nAnd he goes well he's a call me want to find out that program and obviously that and he's going to be transferring from that so I Can't talk to them until they get a release and all of that he had a\nCouple of days later there was a release in which he was talking to other schools too and he just loved it here and I'm In ... in love with Phillip had to say about it was a big recruiter and getting shows but it was kind of one of those things they found each other Trayvon found him on Twitter and\nMessaging him and then call\nHim and that's how they have this how the whole thing started I'm pretty amazing and fill up the you know we love Phillip Phillip loves the University of Colorado and of course he his energy and enthusiasm I think jumped right through the fall into Trayvon than ever since ... been here a guy here in June in may excuse me\nAnd he's been phenomenal it off as a as a student as a person at the team may and of course on the field as a player\nDocuments Colorado head coach Mike McIntyre is buffalo is a fundamental ready to take on us see which is going to be a tremendous contests in the past twelve and you know you have a chance to seize control of the pack twelve south this weekend of course there's a lot less of the season but how would you rate this opportunity that your team has in front of them today\n... definitely it's a big opportunity as we keep winning the opportunity to get bigger and bigger and that's what our kids\nCame to the University of Colorado for and the football side of it is to play in big games and keep pushing that forward so this is a big step for us anytime we play a team of the pack twelve south ... almost it's like a double double down for you and so our guys are excited about playing the game I guess a very good football team\nWe talked earlier about the big turnaround this season and obviously you know there are there are some great physical attributes whether it's Stephen ... or ... or anybody else on that team but a teen chemistry from the outside looking in seems to be quite close this year how is this team come together\nAnd they're really close they truly use the word Brotherhood I mean they really have each other's back\nThey really don't care who gets the credit um they want to sacrifice for each other to to help each other be successful and and they've spent a lot of time off the field together and ah you know I see DVDs hanging out with off as a line and I see you know all those different types of things going on in shape closeness and ah\nI see a team that's always focused but always loose and that's how you want them and uh you don't always get that and we're getting that with this football team and it's exciting and it's a lot of fun to coach on\nHow important is the word development been to this program you know you talked about Steven ... and how far he's come hobby or Edwards has lost so much weight has become a force in the middle on defense for you you know there are guys up and down this roster was ... were were hobby your Edwards receiving Montana's then that the development and\nHow far they've come in a short time really stands out\nYes our we have a phenomenal strengths that we have a phenomenal training training staff\nThat works with these guys I'm away from us you know they've done a phenomenal job developing them and then our coach staff has done a great job of teaching fundamentals and coaching the bear essence of football and sometimes that gets lost in the shuffle and I I Am at this thing that I stress all the time and\nHow we practice and how we prepare we always say practice makes permanent and uh so our guys understand that and I work at it this team loves to practice you know there might be ... they are tired but I haven't had one day when they come out there and really want to get better\nAnd really want to get coach really push each other\nAnd when they do that on a continuous basis they start showing up on Saturdays and that's what we're seeing\nDog with Colorado head coach Mike McIntyre is the Buffalo's owned beaten getting ready to take on us see one of the guys that you worked for in your career is David cut cliff and I've always said about him he is one of
