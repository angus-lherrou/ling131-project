they're living the dream or just talking about Aaron Rodgers and what's going on with with the Packers and let me ask you how good a job or or poor of a job do you think that organization has done surrounding Aaron Rodgers with the town he needs to be in a position to to capitalize on it was Super Bowls\nI think is Asian as a whole has really they really let Aaron Rodgers down in my opinion and I say that based on the inability to fire can sit with the on the defensive side uh it's been that way for quite some time and granted they want us to go\nAgainst the Pittsburgh Steelers the team I was on ... and we made me feel like they were set up to do great things after that but then they bit of an inconsistent as far as being able to be and that civil conversation a year and you're out and the only reason we talk about the Green Bay Packers as far as it's\nThere's been there's been a bit inconsistent as far as being able to be and that civil conversation a year and a you're out and the only reason we talk about the Green Bay Packers as far as a Super Bowl contender that's solely on air Roger shoulders them solely on Aaron Rodgers show to so I think not\nNot being able to get legit defensive players start household names and to the organization has really been a big let down\nTwo time Super Bowl champion Brian ... you're on the show we're not going to ask you your job was trying to stop quarterbacks who's trying to shut down quarterback and their attempts to get in the end zone what do you make a badge of homes in how how real is this\n[laughter] it's real is right now you know with teens not eating I have an ideal\n... because he has its field as for starting the that is to take time management teams are really understand what he does well and when he struggles with not to mention when you look at when he asked around him is that very difficult to\nSay we want to devote all our attention on stopping factor mold and then allow got like ... to have one on one opportunities on the job is said to be safe or semi walk to attract the scales so I think the best way to stop Patrick my whole take a piece of what the New England pages do that gives them a home a few weekends ago\nPut time we'd pressure on my home's keep them in the pocket most importantly and hopefully you can win some one on one batter battles in the secondary\nBurn it then she seemed did did hold the Bengals attempt point but for the most part early on and all those to help with one of the season Adidas has been really atrocious that she's good enough\nTo win the Superbowl this year with the defense of what looks like a liability\nNot right now how\nNot right now building I say that based on\nThe injuries they have on the difference is that eventually they will get Justin Houston back right he's the best past Russia not to mention he's a quality force and stopping the one and then hopefully they will get very very bad because not only one of the best offenders on their team he's one of the best offenders and and the national football league so if you get those who guy\nYou have to see\nA huge improvement you will be a huge improvement based on the experience based on their big play ability so I think right now it's huge for the cheap to continue to do what they've been doing whether the store without those two elite defender's office will continue to score points I don't see those slowing down anytime soon\nBut when they do get healthy I think that could provide a huge impact in December football and January football\nPrimary Ben you're on the show Brian you spend a lot of time competing against that patriots team in the AFC you play is very different position than than guys like Tom Brady was that there was five years older than you I mean are you are you ... that he is still out there slinging the football the way that he is\nNot that I'm not I think watch in town the last three years and not seen any\nAny decrease in production you know I'm not surprised to see him doing what he's doing right now because he understands the system he's been under working under Bill Belichick his entire career not to mention the last ... plus years a Josh Lee Daniels so he understands everything off as sort of ... related to the office aside\nAnd they continue to implement quality guys here or there I think that helps them a continued to improve and he doesn't take a lot of hits you know they all of his lap protects them pretty well does it take a lot of ... not to mention the NFL protects quarterbacks anyway\nLike their prom dates so you know they have for him as far as you know getting moving getting beat up but I'm not surprised he's a very smart cerebral quarterback and you could say use to either be with his arm or with his intelligence\nWho's the biggest threat in the sea this year right now to the patriots attempts to get back to another Super Bowl\n[noise] [noise] right now right now based on what we know right now as\nIt stands the Kansas City chiefs\nThe Los Angeles chargers they're the biggest threat\nI just talked about the parents the the cheese and we know the issue with him has been their defense but I just gave me two quality lanes that particular will be healthy Justin Houston Perry Mary I like the charges in they had really been under the radar and the defense has been doing some good thing but guess what guess who's back\nJulie both so you get Joey both back when we saw what type what Tara ... and ... with a group provided for opposing quarterback for a year ago and that deep is has been better stopping that one right now based on what we will meet with the scene that\nI think those are the two best competitors as far as stopping the patriots from reaching a nother Superbowl now

[laughter]\n[laughter] it's not good at it you're listening to the new CBS Sports radio\nWelcome back into the show but writer with the magic or otherwise thank you for being here really excited to talk to Los Angeles ramp safety John John from the third right now on the show John thanks so much for for making some time for us\nThanks for having me as my\n... and congrats you guys are off to a hell of a started this year undefeated and I interviewed your teammate endemic in two days ago and I asked this question I see the same question at what point did you personally realize this football team had the chance to be really really special\nOh I think you know the first day we all got together um you know right away we figured that you know\nIt's all paper where we look good on paper but we had to put it into work to in order to have success in a from day one we've been working towards that\nJohn jobs in the third here on the show safety for the rams as three interceptions so far this season which I'm sure John how does that means you now how how awesome as it is that feeling when you pick off the opposing quarterback\n... great I get the ball back the probably the best office in the league you know we've got a great office so I can do anything to get the ball back to the show is good\nWhen you pick up a quarterback what's the move is a very standards that thing just hand the official keep your eyes down do you look at the quarterback and like wink or maybe give them some choice words vote you think about his talent like what the what is the John Johnson move\nOh no I bought my teammate to celebrate a\nI think I've my first one to see that I had a low dance but as of late I just I'm a teammate celebrate and get up to ... talk if they get home\nJohn one of the ... there's so many things to get into about your football team that are that are so interesting one of them is how young your head coaches and when he came last year last year to LA you're a rookie season your first year with with the rams\nCan you give us some insight on how this guy in particular Sean McVeigh at such a young age has so quickly helped your football team become one of the best in in the national football league\nBall he's younger days in in his whole life I Believe you came on the wall and you know football pedigree and do their own life so he knows what ... what it takes to win and he knows exactly what the players the in order to have success so he's young an age but he's definitely not noted okay\nHow intense is or how intense as he compared to\nOther football coaches you've been around your career\nUm he he said he wants to be oh he's not really you know yell and scream a guy that the boy genius I think the mad scientist to me so it's all ball with him so it's not really about you know you have this term is definitely at that level I like going to do that so it's good to have\nYou guys obviously employed really well you haven't lost a football game yet and yet early on you had some injuries Marcus Peters got banged up early on a keen to leave still allowed what the ceiling for this event when everybody's healthy and you guys get the point where you feel like as a unit urine rhythm what is the ceiling of the Los Angeles rams events\nIs scary even you know what the guys that are out it's still scary you know the back of can be ... of stars or every week I asked what is that's what I'm happy to see we're getting better every week and we want to play out as football in December January February\nJohn John's on the third here on the show John ...\nYou're undefeated you're you're the talk of the national football league in your universally considered the best team in the league what is the balance for you and for the guys and enjoying that pre she ate in what you've earned but also not losing side of the fact that it's a long NFL season and things can change if you don't keep your focus\nRight um you know Sunday that's what we we celebrate you know we did a good job in one of the game but a come Monday we're on to the next week and it's it's a one game season the whole season so that's our mindset and uh we can take it one game by the time I Know our best will be good enough\nYou know you guys are building a brand new stadium it's not ready yet it will be in Inglewood I was in LA for four years I was there when I'm In New York now but when the rams came back to Los Angeles there's a lot of questions about what the feeling was going to be like at the coliseum\nHow hard it was going to be to get the city to embrace using a lot going on in LA it's a very competitive sports market what has the vibe didn't like what is the coliseum feel like as a temporary home field advantage Venus you guys rate for that stadium in Englewood\nOh well I wasn't here to first year I'm the rams got back to LA but my work here it was it was kinda rough you know the all white team usually had\nThe same amount if not more bad than us but um I had to let you you could see the growth and you know we're winning a fan base back when in the city back and it is beautiful the coliseum but it's been enough it gets rocketed there and I'm I'm loving it\nJohn you guys go up against the Packers this weekend regardless of what the line is or how big an advantage will think the rams have your ramps have there in Rogers and obviously that guy is a hell of a quarterback when you look at the tape when you study what you have to do what is the key to trying to stop one of the most talented quarterback suddenly\nOh man this raw eh he's probably the best doing it right now but um [noise] I think if we if we play off game it will be enough\nOh man this raw eh he's probably the best doing it right now but um [noise] I think if we if we play off game it will be enough you know I don't think you can completely shut that guy down but you can limit him and you can put pressure on them and put them is a bad situation that we just got to capitalize on it so that's our plan going into the game\nI think a lot of people I I Would agree that he's the best and what he does in in the game you guys have a young quarterback and Jared golf who's been really good what do you see when you look at your QB where does the rank of the national football league\nHe's up there ... people show up there or a bad day you can put them up to anybody but I'm\nI'm just like there he's young he's super young but you could just see him growing up like I said I wasn't here the first year but just from my work here and now you could just see how much you've grown and how how comfortable he looks back there in the play that he can make you can pretty much do everything so [noise] um if I had her more\nJohn who's the guy who's the best trash talk on the ramps\nBest trash talker I'm you know that that stuff is probably between the two corner that came to leave him August the ... I I don't I don't want to give it to\nYou know I actually I wasn't the beat writer back in the day but I I worked at a newspaper in Kansas City and and a key was that Kansas other around a lot when he was he was a great trash talking in college so Peters versus illegal it'd be like a draw you to pick one guy like you had to put money in a trash talking contest and you can either have\nLike a fantasy trash talking contests you draft in ... grams of markets\nI think I'm Dr Nikki [laughter] he's been around the\nGame longer you know he said that at all if I I think I'm taking the lead\nOn talking to John John's on the third here on the show it's such an interesting story line right now from Los Angeles the world series is there goes back a Dodger Stadium tomorrow you guys are undefeated I Know the Lakers are often slow start but they'll figure it out they have LeBron James\nHow is the vibe change over the last few months with what feels like the sports epicenter in this country being in Los Angeles California\nOh man I'm happy to be here is a blessing of like you say this we've got a lot of buzz right now but we just got to keep doing our job we've got to uh put off put our jobs first before we go out into the city you know a mango and do whatever it may be so this all the then we'll be super fun but right now we've got to keep\nBuilding and keep doing it so it can be that way in LA but it's it's unbelievable here\nJohn jobs in the third John really appreciate the time congrats on your success good luck on your ... I Know it's not for a month but but I I feel like you're going to connect you the truth how excited are you going to be when you get the opportunity to go up against Patrick my homes and that often\nOh man listen [laughter] first of all the games in Mexico so that's already enough in itself but um it'll it'll be fun you know there is a high powered off that um you know they're going to make them play but um it was just be fun to play against those guys you know they're the best at what they do as well so\nYou root for Penn State and Notre Dame you can't do that\nTo trace thought that was put on it wasn't my mother speaks truth period appreciate down to the great job and we got it on the show today and our zooming hanging out and his nickname is zoo which opens up a world of possibilities for a ... segments down the lot\nGotta be careful of we get can you know get a little carried away can be a zoo in terms of the various things all the time just made a a\nA happy sign that he is very excited about the the series upon bigoted on the board training hanging out with the pride of West Virginia whose teams currently about Baylor last I checked three thousand two hundred and three\nZero the score happens to be a five five to one through four CBS is the phone number to the phone call or two are due Jane Alaska Jay you cannot be in good spirits my rent what's going on here on CBS Radio\nYeah Bill ... year I got a new a segment idea for your call this the rational Thursday bro I'm In a really bad place to start out with this for the Dodgers with dust off communist or bringing backed out of the rich Dave Robert you suck you need to get to the curb\nSame thing with the Lakers um Walden should occur let's bring back ... or ...\nFar I'm already\nYeah I like him I don't I don't think he's going to do a good job\nWe fire grew into the top stories out of retirement to ... ...\n... ...

Shaw and the performance disease and the post season and we brought up in the numbers lotta DRA over the course of his very luxurious remarkable career in the regular season isn't that two three seven range is\nTo fool earned run run run run run more\nI'm really good at radio his poor point three ...\nSeats in just listen to it that way writer fancy ... fancy dog or\nThere's a lot different perspectives about what's wrong with her Sean I referenced earlier and I mentioned to Bradley is that I had a guy or a source of the Dodgers said that he thought that crucial was speeding up was going too fast wasn't going through is normal motion wasn't going through is normal routine he was getting behind the counter overthrowing was basically\nPanicking and maybe it's an unfair way to describe that's not the words and source shoes ... wasn't going through the methodical process he usually did he was rushing and everything was\nGoing wrong as a result and so I ask Bradley age who did play in the world series who did not win the world series why he thinks his perspective on these ... postseason struggles\nI think there's there's a couple of things that that kind of go into it I think what he was doing a little bit harder he was out of it is it is crime in terms of\nA large city and he was facing the St Louis cardinals I I still believe to this day after talking to some ... with the cardinals that's a kind of a understanding more about it that he was taping his pictures that they had his pitches that those series\nAnd I think that kind of got him off to a real fast heart in the post sees it um and it was very hard for him to overcome that for a while because once you get off that that starts then that becomes a narrative that you're not a good postseason picture so he had a really a kind of fell down and and right the ship so to speak it figure out things experience has had a slow the game down\nHe was able to do that and you know he I think he you know at this point probably is is one last record career on the post season is right around five hundred if you've got a real fat starts so more often than not over the last couple of years he's thrown in good performance is but uh he did have a tendency to actually slowed it down now they're all of a sudden I don't know\nHe's learned how to you know slow it down but now the stuff isn't quite as good so it's a little bit tougher for him he's got to be a master pitcher out there on the post season with your face these lineups\nOn ... and you're facing the great hitters especially when you go on the road in a place like Boston all those great right handed hitters they have even if you are focused in concentrating at slowing the gave download\nIt still almost impossible to navigate through that line up so um\nHe's kind of a tricky spot right now if he was facing a lesser opponents are heading back to LA I Would say he'll be fine and I still think you'll have a good outing game five I in fact I think I'll probably have like a fix setting rewrite quality start type outing but you just can't keep the red Sox lineup down forever no matter how comfortable you feel that are focused yard\nYeah

and a great job there I think you know when I saw it at a game against Maryland where are they held on to like a hundred and something yard literally like a buck or something like that I'm watching this game and I'm thinking I'd never seen that before\nReally have not seen a team play that way defensively and a big game design and I use guy and we we know what happens to them and football but that believe me they they they allow a hundred and Fifteen every five minutes so like I mean when I saw you got shut them down I was like I I think it was Maryland I'm thinking wow parents just doing it again\nA hundred and fifty and every five minutes so like when I saw you shut them down I was like I I think it was Maryland I'm banking while parents doing it again in ah Connecticut in Iowa City got a good football team\nYeah I Know you're a Hoosier and that's okay you're you're a big guy but um [noise] uh you know from norm Parker to fill Parker the defense hasn't changed much it's a top five defense and in total points allowed in to point seven yards against the run to your point\nOf Maryland came in averaging two hundred and twenty five years the game are rushing\nAnd they got a hundred and Fifteen yards totally only have the ball for thirty nine players I don't know in a forty years of covering ... hold a team to thirty nine players but\nIt is it is what it is Merrill is going through a real a mixing bowls you know of a emotions but\nThat doesn't take away from the ... the show I Would do French which is really legitimate it really is one of the better teams in the country defensively and starts up front and you know ... or a God rest his soul always sort of you have a really good quarterback and a really good defense\nYou got a chance to win every Saturday and you know Iowa has both this year\nIt's such a great a school and and such a great tradition\nOr you know I I go back I'm fifty three so I've seen it all with Iowa football when I was at a in Bloomington and I I remember a just everything about the program but demand the whole scene and there's incredible take me back to the uh Wisconsin game when they stumbled\nOr at home and lost that ... you know for me I mean that's obviously you're looking at him and they got the uh advantage I knew since they beat you what happened that day because ever since then\nI mean really the only blemish but they've been playing great football since then but Jamie back to that game\nYou know they've got two three game winning streaks for after on that one loss and you know they they brushed a punch at the tone yard line they they must have pont\nWhich gave the badgers attend your driving you know whether you give a good team like the you lose the turnover battle do a good team like that\nOr you're typically going to be to to me it was Iowa drove the ball to the five yard line early in the first quarter and turned it over on down so they tried to quarterback snake uh and and Wisconsin or you know shut them out on that drive and then late in the game they drove into the half yard line try to toss sweep\nAnd got knocked down for a five year old law and so you know good for the three for defense or the ... are very good\nUh defensively they've had their ups and downs sense but uh you know it's two or three players in that game and in Iowa could be seven or no but they're not and and you know parents who doesn't make excuses we move on and so that they are not only are they uh uh you know Wisconsin as a game and then because they won the football game and the west\nBut Iowa feels we still have a legitimate chance but when you look at that that traffic jam he got Purdue\nYou've got to northwestern foreign one officer three in one Wisconsin has a a couple of losses is going to be quite a dog fight to the end but really they lost the turnover battle against Wisconsin at ... stadium on that Saturday Night it was a beautiful night weather wise and and and you move on

and on CBS Sports radio dot com and then on a base for dot com slash proud of that you see your boy lefty\nYeah I Know why he's sitting there there's only one reason why he's sitting there why announced today what the price of oil yeah there is on TNT while they're they're doing the production it's not on TNT there during the ... right\nAnd well that's why he's sitting there at the Laker game which is on the in the right is every Laker game I guess I really like games on national TV Now right oh every ad I been pretty obvious to the first ... moved here in Los Angeles right from Atlanta\nBut that's why I feel sitting there because they are going to try to ah Rob twenty dollars out of everybody to watch that a one on one showdown which I said to see your months ago I think it's a really good idea\nReally good idea I think it could have been a lot of fun right and I think you could have been a decent number if they would've put that on\nA ... point on that friday is you need a skins game they could have put that on that just what it is that Friday after Thanksgiving weekend right three o'clock in the afternoon and I'm with you and it would it be great but\nThe greed twenty or\nGo and charge people twenty dollars to watch it they will get nowhere near the audience they would have got\nI really I I agree with my I don't think we may be voting in a band that\nTo watch these two guys play golf you think they'll have the highlights on ah sports center\nI don't know and they ... they might just show you still remember like with a boxing matches on paper they like the Holyfield ... that they show generally the stills 'cause they couldn't show you the right of footage maybe we'll just get bills of the audience you know on the green\nWhy would anyone watch that on a later date like you know what I mean like if you had it and then like a ... like your record it or something in and watch it later no one's going to do that I think\nThey took a good idea and they ruined it\nSo he's at the game right now and did they not just like go to a commercial break instead of interviewing him or was he didn't he might have been sitting there saying he might have been ... doing the interview\nI guess he's he's pushing is harder than anybody who do you think Wednesday is probably the last big\nPayday that he ever gets ... and when it any more tournaments so you don't think now he's he's washed\nWash so you think clouded that clown going into the blue tent for a little examination\nSo who do you think wins the golf tournament the one on one thing yeah like tiger one tiger ...\nDo you like and the mafia could care less like unless I'm drinking patch blue ribbon on the golf course I don't care what anyone is doing\nIt will be back or just like to ask them what my ... nine percent of the time that matched up in a major and I told him I mean just reporting one on one now is going to change the result of me I Know a couple of years ago I Would have jumped on building soccer was go there was issues but now it seems to be at least part way back and even when he was off you still do better than almost arms\nSo do you think are the story of the rams their schedule and the next four weeks they got the Packers this week at home and then they go to the superdome debates just saying\nThat the November fourth they hosted game that play down the closest Seattle which was thirty three thirty one\nNow that's November eleventh and then they play the chiefs in Mexico city on Monday Night three days at a Thanksgiving\nIf they make it through that they'd be eleven or no and then there'd be a somewhat of a shot at going on through the entire season I mean I don't ah frankly think they can do that like\nI think they'll probably lose it New Orleans that

of Lakers nation pod cast and a Lakers nation dot com you was inside\nStaples Centre for this first win for the two thousand Eighteen Lakers in ... now that they've won their second consecutive game on back to back nights how much fun to watch it to be inside staples with the crowd and the team play well\nOh it's been it's been a ton of fun I mean obviously the staples center crowd with ... you get the ... when it gets a team that is quickly becoming a rival of the Denver Nuggets that got them from hardly conduct the battles recently even increases and see what your two teams don't like each other very much ... you know when was\nHuge for the theme of definitely big for the family that was a that was sort of a little bit a little bit worried up since ...\nLeBron has his first a triple double as a Laker and it doesn't really matter I guess in terms of staff because people are so thrilled to have him there but what is he had to say about the start of a season\nYou know he's been preaching patients from day one he's been saying there's going to be re bumps along the way it's going to take time and that that the team got to look a lot better in January or February than they do right now and he's been praising the young guys and and the growth pretty much during everything you'd be hoping for\nHim to say I mean when you've got you've got some people wondering is is he going to grow tired of the growing and you're going to grow tired of losing ... games and things like that but so far he's given no indication of that and he's been enjoying his time in Los Angles\nDoes it feel like a pop a James role to you in some ways\nYeah in some ways that's funny you mentioned that I Do a little bit in the game against your BMX\nOr last night there was a some time in the third quarter there with the Lakers were probably about twenty and I'm a ... store there on the order was pretty clear wasn't going to play the fourth quarter of a bond just standing at the top of the of the key right up to three point line and you just collect the ball and kind of dribble a few times and\nGrow a path you wouldn't really caught or move from that spot very much he was\nKind of in coach ... user kind of hanging out what the young guys do their thing and then hit him with ... and ah he's\nHe's definitely been uh been good at that I've been to go to to preserving himself and in that way it seems like he's a he's enjoying setting up these guys and trying to build their games and get them to the or the next level\nSo that his role as the Popeye's so to speak than the young guys they would be the kittens in this metaphor how have you seen them respond to working with LeBron James\n[noise] I think that the cool thing is that they weren't overall I mean these are guys who grew up watching LeBron James I mean on the ball round said many times what Braun was his favorite player growing up and and they came in knowing became it already planning on working hard being ready with when\nThe Bronx I thought it was like they just kick the whole new year so\nThese guys have definitely up their game they understand that but there is pressure on them to produce because it's not just you're not just about\nThe growing rather developing his players can they be the guy that will go and it's going to win with long term because\nBe real if they're not then they're probably not going to stick around with the Lakers team because this seems to bring in other superstars so in a weird way these guys are all kinds of edition and for their own spots\nOn on the future team here so\nThey've uh they've responded really well and it seems like the the chemistry on the team is is real and it may be that easy to say right know guinea are going to see what it looks like come February but for right now it seems like the old stepping up to the challenge\nLane is with us from Los Angeles he's the host of the Lakers nation pod cast and also a senior writer at Lakers nation dot com it's after hours with Amy Lawrence here on CBS Sports radio show is if you've got this now extension of the coach on the court or that definitely\nYeah sports radio show and if you've got this now extension of the coach on the court that definitely changes the role of Luke Walton the bat and the\nQuestion about how those two would match considering the agents and considering the success of LeBron James and other places one has seen different or what have you heard different from coach Walton if anything just start to see that and\nI'm actually it hasn't been all that much different as far as his best to go on and he's\nEspecially last season he was really on board with the hey let's let's focus on be friends first let's use or even turn it off and that will get his transition points were going to get out and run and we're going to try to try to do things the right way and\nHe's pretty much said all of the same stuff he has given I don't want to say some control but he's definitely giving what brought a voice and guys like rage on bond there was well\nA voice in things and they're they're able to contribute their thoughts because I mean they've been referred to many times by many people as as basketball serve on those as geniuses out there on the floor so I think he's done a really nice job of maintaining control of the team and maintaining his\nAuthoritative position while still allowing those guys to have a voice and contribute and and be a positive influence with just their their basketball knowledge\nAnd so I've been really impressed by his ability to strike that balance and again we'll see how that plays out of the season goes on but for right now it seems like what we're doing as good of a job as as anyone could imagine coaching this team\nIn winning their first home game they shoot fifty percent including\nTen of twenty nine from downtown I started out slow from beyond a three point are ... but they managed to pick it up and we saw Alonzo ball hit a couple of big ones and land Stevenson coming off the bench and hitting a couple of threes what does this team do well when things are going the way they like it to what does this team do well Trevor\nWell it's actually it's kind of funny because it's the inverse of last year's teams so far last year's team was a was a good defensive team but I very inefficient often seem to have to rely on their ... time and time again\nAnd so far it's been it's been the opposite that season they've been a poor country team but they've been a very good on the offensive and they've been finding ways to get buckets and part of that is the attention that brown draws that that's opening up guys is passing has also been\nInstrumental we saw a few times tonight where a guy like how whose mother would make a pact or cut because the Denver Nuggets were so mesmerized watching O'Brien with the ball\nAnd you find them for an open dunk\nSo that's been uh been what they've been it'd be really successful at it the the offensive end of the or the ... able to play at a very fast pace which a lot of people weren't sure what brought you to do but they've been getting out there running like crazy last I looked and we'll see\nWhat it is that after tonight's game but they were in the top three an increase in the NBA they're getting out and running and they're able to score points officially and uh so so far so good on that um\nSo you mentioned the deep end but in addition to that when they don't play well what does it look like\nWhen they don't play well the the big determining factor has been rebounding and you see them getting beat up on the boards especially when they try to go small that's been a problem we saw that at that issue in pre season we saw that a little bit or against the spurs but Marcus Aldrich had a few big offensive rebounds I think you have to in a row\nThe salvation army is on the ground across the state of Florida and the Gulf Coast

I Wish this was the weekend we turned back our clock but I don't think it's this weekend I think it's not until the first weekend in November but still very soon there will be a weekend night with an extra hour of sleep\nI Will not be wasting it\nSo here we sit on the cusp of the weekend I got some yard work done pretty excited about that it just it's ... it struck me like a wild hair I have no idea why I got home from walking the dog it was sunny was Wendy\nBut I wanted to put this bag of debris out on the curb which they only pick up on friday so I had had one half full or in my garage for the last two weeks or so two weeks ago it was the last time I did yard work and if it sits too long the the bottom of the paper bag\nIt gets too wet and then it gets a hold of it if you go to pick it up at this has happened to me recently all the grass and the leaves and the debris just fall right out into the garage in which case I might have set a swear word or two\nThen so I was worried about this half full bag of law and clippings and debris sitting in my garage any longer and so I decided that I Would do some yard work and fill the bag and then put it out of the curve that I could pick it up on friday\nI don't know why can't put half full bag out there I guess because I paid for the bag so I feel like I Need to use them and fill them before I put them out there I Am frugal I Will tell you that [noise]\nSo I decided I pick up sticks 'cause we've had a bunch of really windy days in my neighborhood in the past couple of weeks in there it's a pretty big sticks that were laying around the back yard ones that you actually had to step on and break multiple times before you could put them into the bag and I don't know what got to me I picked up all the sex and I thought you know what\nAnd there were a few leaves on the ground not completely covered but some leave so I took my lawnmower out and I mode and then most of course because there were leaves and so they ended up at the lawnmower ended up serving as I'm older\nAnd I'm very proud of myself and uh that was how I thought\nOK I'll get a jump on the weekend because actually it's supposed to do pouring down rain and crazy when set in my neck of the woods over the weekend there is a coastal storm Atlantic coastal storm it's supposed to affect a good portion of the mid Atlantic and the northeast but doesn't really

will be outside trying to play some football\nIt's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio or inside the Quicken Loans studios national mortgage lender Quicken Loans apply simply understand fully mortgage confidently so you're finding me on Twitter Ala radio and you are answering the question\nWhat athlete in any sport right now would you trade for first round draft picks to obtain so as much as I appreciate the some of your going past\nIt it doesn't work that way we're talking about right now for the first round draft picks up so I don't know that it's a smart idea to trade for first round draft pick for Tom Brady I kind of feel like that's a bad idea it's a bad investment because Brady will likely be retired before you would\nUse those for first round draft picks\nNo way I said that backward Brady will likely retire\nBefore those for first round draft picks will play out\nIt's it's not you want to look at the age it's not a good and\nBut for those for first round draft picks will play out so it it's it's not you want to look at the age it's not a good investment if the guy that you're obtaining wouldn't be retiring and you're still giving up those draft picks\nSo as much as Brady is awesome and Drew Brees is awesome what Aaron Rodgers thirty four now that he turned thirty four year is he thirty three I mean as much as I Love Aaron Rodgers\nHe now and then\nIs playing through injuries he's had some serious injuries in the past couple of years he's worried and me race he's thirty four years old or you're really going to give up for first round draft pick for Aaron Rodgers as much as again I think he's phenomenal\n\nSo you gotta consider the age factor and I like some of the answers that I've received so far like Anthony Davis that's a great one I feel like he's a perfect example of a guy for whom you and trade for first round draft pick because barring some crazy injury which you you know you can't\nYou can't plan for injuries there is no way to know when they're going to happen or how they're going to happen or if they're going to happen\nBut he is a good example what about Seth Curry now that's an interesting one we had this conversation during the

Hopkins will solar fighting scenes finding pockets of space do you\nWatch it only completed passes to four guys and Tyler urban only caught one ball so essentially he was throwing to only three guys will full already under Hopkins Jordan Thomas that's it\nAnd yet it worked go play golf too but the Texans and they really kept that Miami defense off balance\nAfter starting out oh in three ... and the Texans have now one five consecutive games that are on top of the AFC South\nThere's a lot of panic outside the building of forces were a fan of when you started on three but um I started out there you know we we have a lot of guys we've been through a reverse it whether it's in your life whether it's injuries what whatever it may be we have guys who have been through stuff and I know what his wife to be done and now I Know what it's like to fight back I'm so nobody was apparently\nWe just knew that we have work to do and you had to play better start to do that no we're nowhere near where we need to be I mean we're only halfway through the season\nSo we need to keep it going I'm but if we continue to work the way we work during the week if we continue to play together have fallen whether lose\n'em we can definitely do great things but we have to just take one day at a time which is how we got here from authors\nWere often running into weaken number eight so not not quite the

out\nYeah I wanted to I wanted to call in about ah the for the first round draft pick some um I Know it's about Jimmy Butler and I'm not saying that Jimmy Butler is is LeBron or do you are\nBut he's he's he's a he's an all star level player a really good defensive player an officer player and I believe they can stretch those draft picks up quite a ways out and the rockets don't really\nUse first round draft picks other than just to be assets as far as I've been a fan for so long and then around and seeing Darryl Murray work so\nI uh I Believe it's steep but I Believe it's a it's something they can recover from and I think it could help them when now what ...\nWhat if he leaves after next summer\n[noise] yeah that's a big risk unless they were able to uh have any communications with him on whether or not he would agree to an extension or time with them I'm I'm Wondering if they're able to do that or if he's given them an indication but uh if you didn't stay that would be a big problem\nI guess but I mean that kind of the risk Kennedy now yeah he says he wants to explore the free agent market which you can understand\nOn and so while it was a situation that Oklahoma City was willing to get it with Paul George by making a trade for him after one year and they convince him to stay it's different because they didn't give up three or four first round draft picks the mortgage the farm for the future they gave up some players instead um so yeah that's\nBy school football playoff pigeon you on the run of the battle group Braves visit Sutton and the opening round the clock V.

and\nSome strong score whatever driving between but do you understand what's going to be some back and forth and those can be given to age I'm going to be some times where you know you're playing

a mile runs or four or five years apart so\nIt's a it's just part of the games part of the process um\nThan in the defense will move your worm down and now the runs or four or five years apart so it's a it's just part of the games for the process um you know we feel like are awesome such a toll on the fence throughout the course of the game where\nYou can say that again\nAre often takes a toll on a defense over the course of the game yeah you can't let down for even a second as for Mike Zimmer well someone asked him to the question of why and Peyton Manning Drew Brees off and is so potent why they're so productive\nAnything anytime call anything second in one in my ... so [noise] traction shots on first possession some formations movements personnel groupings um\nHe doesn't care here and I

you're talking about both they don't care what the situation is they're going to call anything at any time and they're going to take advantage of what they can see and what they're facing and how they can read those defenses it's obviously something that takes time the more you do it the better you get\nAnd and that's one of the things that young quarterbacks tend to struggle with jak Prescott\nHe struggled a bit with reading defenses but when you get to the age the experience\nThe number of snaps logged by a guy like Drew Brees or Tom Brady or Ben Roethlisberger Aaron Rodgers mean then is

twenty first in the league\nWhen it comes to scoring and the red zone as just touched down in the red zone they're fifty percent twenty first in the leagues so that's one area that they need to improve\nIts been week to week I think last week we were\nToo on the foreign red zone maybe and I mean it's just a point of emphasis for us we have to do better than regime we get in there I mean you know we'd like to be\nYou know a hundred percent but you know we've been fairly good defense in the red zone and so you know that that that's one of our areas that we're always working on with the

the weekend\nWe're asking you in light of this report that the Houston Rockets offered\nNot are offering or\nWould like to offer or plan to offer but have burned\nFor a first round draft picks the Minnesota timber wolves for Jimmy Butler now the idea for Houston is that they're one of the top teams in the west right now they expect to make the playoffs they expect to be contending for championships they really are trying to unseat\nTop teams in the west right now they expect to make the playoffs they expect to be contending for championships they really\nAre trying to unseat the Golden State warriors in the west and then also as NBA chance so the idea would be that these are lower draft picks right we're not talking about one two three four unless something goes drastically wrong\nFor not talking about threes we're talking about theoretically a team that would add a Jimmy Butler and then their first round draft picks would end up being\nTwenty five twenty six twenty seven somewhere in there maybe even thirty\nKind of the idea is if you're stacking your team and you're adding a Jimmy Butler will then these draft picks that you're giving up aren't going to be the top flight rookies coming out of college hoops or out of Europe\nThere's no way to gauge that there is no way to know for sure we don't know who these young men will be we just do right now\nBut they would be a\nPicks that would represent the opportunity to ask you to your roster and start to build or transition to the next generation\nSo it it's a ... and the the real concept but the idea would be that Houston would be so good that these draft picks will be lower in the first round still if Jimmy Butler leave after one year which he's indicated that he wants to test the free agent market\nAre you really prepare to give up for first round draft picks to rent\nA player for a season people are freaking\nOut over one first round draft pick in the NFL for I'm Ari Cooper so our question tonight is which athletes out there would you be willing to trade for first round draft pick four straight up like right now straight up for first round draft picks guinea\nThe most popular a through so far is countering David of the ... which is cool I've seen some Austin Matthews as well I Love\nThe Anthony Davis answer absolutely he is a game and franchise changer and he's in the prime of his career he does everything and he can carry a team on his back\nYou want to keep in mind the age now the NBA caps the number of first round draft pick that any deal you can't offer more than four okay so that's why the numbers kept it essentially the rockets are offering to max number of picks that they can\nBut also they can't threats out over seven years\nAnd so we're kind of looking at

Thursday there is a report\nIs this a new report or an old report there was a report actually for multiple sources that the Houston Rockets offered for first round draft picks the Minnesota timber wolves for one Jimmy Butler\nMan that caught my attention there are a couple of stories actually on Thursday that caught my attention but this was one of them did you know after doing some research I found out that for first round pegs is the max number allowed in any deal under the NBA parameters and\nThey can stretch out farther than seven years down the road\nNow butler here's the biggest issue he is planning to become an unrestricted free agent next summer so I Can't imagine any team in the NBA giving up for first round draft pick for a guy who\nNot be their past one year that's outrageous and also bad business so I don't think they'll do that but if they could do aside and trade of some sort the idea for the rockets would be hey world when now team we want to unseat the Golden State warriors in the west and ask the chance which means\nIf we can be superstar super ... team well then we're not going to be getting number one number two number three\nIn the draft order we're going to be drafting twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine and a perfect world thirty\nNow that changes the rhetoric doesn't it if it's for first round draft picks but it's\nFor a number thirty in a row\nYou know it's different so that's\nKind of the idea it still sounds outrageous though doesn't it people freaking out over a Mari Cooper\nGetting\nOne first round draft pick in return in the NFL and I get

want to think about five years so we're not going to do the seven and that just gets a little complicated convoluted but the next five years which means you need that guy to be if not\nExactly in the

no sense\nYou'd still be given up draft picks after the guy retired more than likely it makes no sense for Drew Brees and I'm not even sure it makes sense for Aaron Rodgers though he is an amazing

I Am a a Desert Storm work that\nI Am black\nI Am a conservative and\nI Am a national is just like President Trump because I Believe in America marriages first and I don't understand why the Democrats don't they say why they're there to serve the public that there are served this country\nBut yet we create chaos confusion and they fight fight kill kill marriage you ... ... ... ...\nIf you'd asked that their support or anything\nI I agree I mean it all this I'm going to I'm just going to\nBe just to push back a little bit I Love doing the president brought those cameras in and negotiate it on camera especially when it came to guns and we came to immigration\nAnd I would not have minded and a lot of people will be mad at me but I Would not have minded if the president got his twenty five billion for the wall and exchange forgiving the DACA or the DACA kids now young adults a ten year path to citizenship\nI Would not have minded that because then you go back and you realize that chain and lottery\nOr something even Democrats aren't very ... they aren't necessarily against boot of the beginning of possibly a cascade of deals now I'm being optimistic but they said the Democrats they feared he was going to start with infrastructure why\nBecause that would have made them play ball instead it was his fourth or fifth thing and they said well you know what we we just we don't like what he's doing you know with his tax plan and everything else so we're not going to participate Scott if he could hold the house and Senate I think they're going to get stuff done I think they're going to get stuff done if they could hold the house and Senate by any margin\nI think so too I think so too I mean this the first time since I guess since Reagan that I've been\nOptimistic about America and the benefits are how America is that like that you know I feel that President truckers doing these amazing that that in there were just the drier to do right and he put a lot\nWhen I say he has this market charities she didn't hurt is great ... said that you do this and what people were being able to cope with their own special actress\nSo now what the FBI has to do is go back and try and I'm In reverse\nSince these crimes actually occur in from the time the packages were mailed and placed in the mail saying they have to figure out what happened in between and where the packages were and try and pay all this together you know the the things we talked about before finding cameras finding potential witnesses right in the mail saying that handle these devices\nAre so that she was doing and that's where a sense and I hear there's a there's a lot of activity in Florida right now we know Debbie Wasserman Schultz was on the return address for just about everyone what do you think it means a Shannon and we're glad about this that these are bombing it looks like a bomb but there's no detonation ability with these\nMine I mean you know somebody that I talked to off the record who is also very deep into these kinds of investigations not this one in particular said you didn't have to really look at this if you're you know the people who are examine and he's the bomb techs and the specialists\nThrough the FBI they know almost immediately whether something is a viable device or not unless the authorities in New York have said these are not hoaxes these are potentially viable devices um but not one has gone off and apparently none of the packaging the way that normally they would expect something like this\nTo be done if they actually want to hurt or killed people is it the packages booby trapped to go off when you open it they\nSaid that wasn't part of it either so easy just to strictly in the work quote terrorizing me to instill terror and people to frighten people or is it actually about harming people I mean these are two very very different objectives and I think they know a lot more about that than there saying at this\nPoint you're talking to ... by the way is also an attorney handles or legal stuff here now that my personal stuff you will notarized anything and that bothers me when he won't tell me I'm\nNot a stance are free don't you feel bad uh charging as a notary\nI don't I don't know that I Need that four dollars and it makes a difference for me so if you want your document I'm going to need the four dollar\nThat's fun so a lot of people are saying the president should have taken a more conciliatory tone on his stump speech but he said he's fighting back and he's saying listen maybe if you weren't ripping mean Ninety two percent of the time going just at CNN and MSNBC you wouldn't create so much ate usual Rush Limbaugh said cups of tea\nBecause they're not they are trying to pass responsibility and there's lots of Donald Trump in and trying to get us to shut up in response and in opposition to we're supposed to sit here and saying oh no no no and we know the facts recap comment while they comment left and right start ragged on Trump\nOr his supporters or what have your while we're supposed to sit here and be polite and have good manners and not say anything about it\nAnd the that for the most part I Am stunned I thought on the Sunday show to get a lot of opinion and talking about President Trump's tone and Maxine Waters and the horrible comments Eric Holder said we're going to kick 'em and ... this was happening hours after the packages were found Shannon\nMhm so you're gonna get worse until we find the guy\nIt's interesting because guide Benson a vote apiece in town hall yesterday and he pointed to some um\n[noise] video of Nancy Pelosi after the shooting that nearly killed these ... and she was in a press conference and it it must have been within a day or two after this had happened to shooting it happened and she asked about those who are trying to link is to potentially someone on the left or somebody who was upset by the Democrats which we now know exactly\nHow that played out and her comments where this is outrageous how dare dare you go there\nThis is disgusting this was a terrible event\nHow dare you make any links between political ideology or try to blame this on anyone\nBut for the president for the White House they feel like that's exactly what's happening to them by now I mean we had a guest on last night um who was the deputy chair of the DNC or vice chair and Michael I'm Blake and he started immediately saying with the president bear some responsibility to this and I said wait a minute\nWhat exactly are you saying then the person who put these devices together and mailed them and put them into the stream to try it frightened people or wherever the objective was\nThat's the person who's responsible for this and he wanted to have it both ways that they don't put words in my mouth I'm not saying the president actually did this and I said well what you're saying is the president's bears some responsibility for this and you have to be very clear about that because\nYou know and those conversations in the weeks a after steep squeezed was almost killed there were a lot of folks who are objecting and saying it's not fair to tide us to a particular party and the truth is it is the individual who pulls the trigger or makes device that is ultimately the person that is very troubled and has a problem and they're the one\nUh left or right or center or if they're just disturbed in some way they're the ones who's made who have made this decision to um put these things in a place like\nOh I should be a ... that's a big topic or the other topic of course the midterms and the caravan but I Want to bring into the Robert Mueller investigation because on radio and TV we had George Papadopoulos remembers the twenty eight now thirty one year old who is the unpaid foreign policy advisor who pled guilty to lying to the FBI\nNow he's starting to put his whole series of events together and he believes the D. O. J. and the FBI along with three separate countries combined to set him up because they didn't want to be president when he did become president they wanted to hurt him and he uses evidence of actor John ... of his original contact\nThose original contact in England the malls a professor and now we find out a working for British Intelligence\nAnd then we find out to the ambassador down or Evans says Clinton ties also supposed to be linked to Australian and British Intelligence and now we also find out this stuff and how for an American who worked for the FBI all targeted him\nWhile he sat in house arrest in Chicago apartment watching all this money go out the window he wants to know over a overturn a overturned his conviction in his plea he was with Mark Meadows said after going after hearing what do you have to say behind closed doors yesterday and the committee hearing cut thirty two\nI can tell you that I Am very trouble that his Fourth Amendment rights may have been violated and the way that this was conducted was certainly inappropriate and not what we would believed to be standard protocol for the FBI\nDidn't like it and he went on cut thirty three\nYou know listen I have if he testifies publicly based on what we just heard today uh I think the American people would would side with George Papadopoulos uh uh regardless of party or when you hear it and and yet I don't I don't see a public hearing happening just to be Frank\nNot happening but he was pretty moved by what he heard behind closed doors what are you hearing 'cause he's starting to realize that all these people were setting them up\nI think it's really interesting your interview this morning I'm which of course I was not awake to see it but I read the transcript\nUh he lays out a very interesting set of uh events and circumstances in people and timing that raises a lot of questions I think for anybody who had a real desire to know exactly what was happening with the ... and how it got started\nUm who the players or what the aim was I mean what he lays out\nExactly what was happening with it that's the case and how it got started um who the players or what the aim was I mean what he lays out he makes the case for himself and for the you know his theory that he was being set up in an effort to then be able to go after the Trump campaign in some way or the president himself said he when\nI'm I think people should listen to what he has to say and and make a judgment about it but you know he's drawing some links and connecting the dots a in a way that I think raise a lot of very very serious questions\nAnd I'll I'll paraphrase Shannon and he said that one of the tweets that Peter Struck had\nA was a that he was we are beginning to what our source or or or Russian source or our source in England where in Britain is beginning to talk about Russia connections it was the same day that ambassador downer a it was the day after he met with the bachelor down\nAnd he ended up being a tape conversation to somehow Peter ... get that he does not believe that was a coincidence faces on the Russian source there is no suicide know rushing connections you missed it came up to me and approached me and asked me if I if they told me that Hillary Clinton's emails were about to be released\nSo then he gets an information ... unsolicited and then these asset by donor who

all of yesterday's losses plus some doesn't mean the wheat marketed stern volition but it is rejecting the new selling seen the past two sessions\nMaybe he's a hawk market is put in the best performances week last week so sharply lower prices and adds up right now the market has gotten back all\nI mean all of last week's losses I think a lot of that has to do with China's confirmation that African swine fever continues to spread across the country and and you know what officials are doing\nI don't know if they're having a tough time or if they're just doing a really poor job of containing the highly transmissible disease were ten days from the two thousand Eighteen national elections and some well known Democrats are receiving terrorists packages\nAnd a caravan of immigrants from Honduras Guatemala other Latin American countries is making its way toward the U.S Mexico border\nIs it just it ... that these vents are happening this close to elections\nMany do not think it is trade issues harvest progress upcoming USDA reports we've got a lot to talk about on today's free for all\nWith pro forma policy analyst Jim Leach Meyer real agriculture Sean Haney an Iowa farmer timber Iraq straight from the combined in northeast Iowa\nIf you've got questions or comments for today's show give us a call ... five five for talk egg that's eight five five for eight to five five to four and of course you can reach us on Twitter just include hash tag ... we're talking the message\nRight now let's turn it over to Clinton grabbed his get an update on the news what's\nGoing on or

at you I'm laughing with you it's been a couple of hours just either of us were in a cross country reds chip\nI've been a couple of years that's right you know now I'm more likely to run when chased\n[laughter]\nThat is exactly right you know I just try to stay fit enough to beat the guy next to me in case of the bear attack you know that I Am on on yeah that that's why I carry a knife [laughter] so you don't have to worry about it by below the food is just carry a knife it's not for the bear\nAnd there's been twelve twelve confer pipe bomb so far they've been sent out so this is a wow\nCrazy Sarah is ... ... oh\nThat that's the person sorry I Am reading I'm reading this is breaking ship but yes I understand she ... she's the one that's confirming it she is not the person that has sent it out she's confirming it\nGot ya got ya hey before we get onto the free for all today let's make time for this industry spotlight\nDuring the twenty Eighteen growing season element farmer Brad walk was asked to take a closer look at a bunch of what the vote to call you know\nFrom planting to harvest this is his first impression\nI'm ... ... corn beans we small amount of ... so we've been using a sea treatments my whole life and you know initially I think they were more to just kind of control or somebody insecticides insect problems that we had\nTwenty years ago Thirty years ago anymore it's it's definitely changed into biologicals I'm\nTrying to generate a large degree mass to stomach control of insects or fungicides or\nDisease you might pay for it [noise]\nGoing with controversy well pretty anxious\nTo see how that turns out I think ah it makes things easier\nIn the sense that you may not have to buy what what's\nAh yeah we're hoping to see larger rude masses and also still maintain the movies as control that we're\nPiece of mine on the confidence to\nSee it as is going to be protective with Disease Control and you're looking for the New Jersey the peace of mind to ah maybe plant earlier\nThe scene is is going to be protected with disease and then second trolling you're looking for the news in the peace of mind to ah maybe plant earlier\nThat is always ... just\nTry to maximize your you'll\nYou plant procedure at a hundred percent possible yield and a mother nature sons her trials and errors along the way I suppose possible zero or you know treatment general really does lost jobs protecting the corn plant from a lot of those\nGoing to say that they simply a no brainer with all the expense of investment just put the crop out you'd be taking a large risk not having the treatments and clearly going with controversial TiVo gives you the added benefit of microbial as well as insecticides\nWill return reds farm and harvest the how much of a team of two point oh impacted yields\nAlright take so much John Harris were that industry spotlight let's get onto the\nFree for all here on a friday we've got Jim least Meyer pro farmer policy analyst joining us how are you Jim birdie good good and Sean Haney from rural agriculture is with us we heard from him at the start of the segment and let's go straight to temper I guy will farmer up in Arlington, Iowa how are you today can\nDress great chat hasn't rained war veteran corn were buying land ...\n\nRolling on corn today and got a ... that's the fault so we've got to get bailed out fortunate and happy\nGood good you know I was watching the radar this morning and I think that rain got into your section but it but at the state just south of where you're working I think\nThey'll\nBrutal or to go [laughter] hey I met somebody last week a week ago today a\nI talk to them before but I'd never seen him face to face and he's from Arlington Jason Anderson\nYeah yeah there is one of our favorite son worked at all or reserve economist now at Purdue\nWere that's exactly right he's he's an associate dean and the college your bag therapy or do I tell you what you got wrecker you got for Iraq you've got hit or is it is pretty impressive what comes out of that little community\nYou asked you [laughter]\nOkay so you said you're happy tell me about the ... are they holding up did you lose much from that harvest delay\nThe buildings were her ... you know things are going to average in the fifties or this is good for go over there were some good field but overall they were down\nWe're just starting corn you know it looks like it's going to run between one Ninety two thirty a lot of variability depending on how to read and it is not standing\nSo we don't need that big when Sunday we gotta keep rural and we don't need rain but ... year olds are good ... stock quality is bad\nYeah yeah how's your market told not to um are you getting any recovery in basis yet\nWell the ... the market uh you know we go to the river here and it's gone October now become November just created a last November tend to have an eighty seven Ninety range so you're below a dollar on being\nAnd a corn rice report today that was all before today I heard today and corn ethanol plant which three Nineteen last night to\nOh I guess unless your comments about Sonny Perdue I ended up you know there may not be any more trade with since I was reading about that that really drew the Ira some farmers I notice that really got comments are people out there that are really unhappy with their\nYeah Jim I I'll admit I was a little surprised when he when when I heard that\nYou know they've been saying all along that this was a one time deal the market facilitates them program payment is what I'm Talking about a buck sixty five on fifty percent of your beans a penny on fifty percent of your corn eighty cents on\nA on sorghum did there's some wheat payment hug payment blah blah blah all ... you know all those payments that are out there\nAre but and they've been saying that it's a one time deal but Jim\nAccording to Purdue they're serious that this was a one time deal\nWell there will be a supplementary a a a ... Eighteen crop\nHe has consistently said not that I agree with that that this is a one year one crop year\nProgram the pressure's going to mount on either the administration our Congress or for a second year program a but we're a ways away from that job but I I think that they'll they'll come out with either Congress or the administration will have to follow through if\nWe don't see any progress in the U.S China talks\nThat they can have some sort of hesitation on announcing that second program because they don't want to give people the impression that this could be lasting longer than they want you know then they want to rate so that that may be a part of the two\nYet Kim I don't know yeah I Know it got the Irish some farmers like you said but it\n... ... I I think people understand what what Purdue is saying though that lesson you know now because because the terrorists came after the planting season\nIn twenty eight teams there was nothing that guys can do about it so what he's saying now is OK well adjusted for twenty ninth team because this is the the world that we're living in now\nAll of that is great in theory Milan or get a little trouble understanding that the drop two dollar\nA faster at the uh uh taxes that a little trouble understanding of the fertilizer jumped you know it's a hundred dollars a ton more than ... last year that found that nitrogen alone\nSo it sounds good but your reality it looks like it's going to take another area and urge them on there every people\nYeah yeah I don't blame them and you know I think the one of those in unhappy people would probably be paying Johnson who by the way the last time I saw\nIs working her job what Mayes all and she is that the world Trade Organization meeting in Rome\nA so she's off representing a U.S corn growers there at the at the er at the world Trade Organization just wanted to let everybody know where we're paying is but\nIt it uh\nI don't know what to make it to him I really don't because ... they've they've made it out as one time program we do have the the uh\nThe increase in the fertilizer prices that's probably got something to do with the expectations of the adjustment right Jim that we're going to see more bean acres ... I'm Sorry ... acres more corn acres in twenty Nineteen\nAnd Sonny Perdue sat and again this won't make farmers ... that the markets will will reach an equilibrium in other words they'll adjust I Know that doesn't sound well to any ...\nLike farmers ... that the markets will will return equilibrium in other words they'll adjust I Know that doesn't sound well to any producer negatively impacted by this\nYeah no it doesn't sound very good [noise] okay when we come back I Can't believe we're at the end of the first segment here already but ah when we come back on what we got to get to some of these trade other trade issues out there I Want to talk China in particular and guys get ready to talk about African swine fever in China\nBoy\nThis situation I mean we're trying to figure out just how severe the outbreak is and I don't think anybody can get their hands around just how\nThe situation that they're dealing with\nWill do that not known them remember 'em\nNo matter what you do you're always raising the bar trying to do better than I ever knew to lower oh fungicides for corn and soybeans and help you get the edge are looking for\nYeah yeah hey Jim the comment that Tim made there I Know you're a little bit hard to hear there for a second uh but the comment there was on the farm bill the requirement to work on the snap benefits\nAnd you know there are work requirements already in place on this it's not like when you get right down to it it's not like there are major changes I think what chairman house chairman Conway is looking for is for the work requirements to be enforced for the most part alright\nYeah I I think it's important that I have high expectations on a farm bill vote will occurred during the lame duck session they don't want to boost that they don't want to bump into twenty Nineteen you'll have a little change of tone on these controversial issues about food stamps and title one\nFarm safety net once we get through these election so I Want to see the tenor of the comments\nOn both sides of the issues after that I think it's an ability to compromise on both sides\nOkay now my question for you here Jim is if we do have a four or five the difference either way Democrat majority house majority a in a in a Republican majority in the house\nWhat does that do to change the dynamics of the house\nWell to get anything done uh you'd have to have a form coalitions intra party so I I think uh that that you'd actually seem more getting done because you you would have to have\nCompromises gifts from both political parties with each other not not in total one party uh other than that you won't get anything done sold the narrow were the spread\nThe more a potential need for compromise on some critical issues infrastructure spending immigration reform farm bill et cetera\nRight right okay let's switch gears here let's go to African swine fever in in China a Hany I meant yeah I mean Canada big hawk producer or looking to export some of your product as well what's your take on a U.S and China\nAre well immensely concerning and I'm not sure that over here in North America we have fully grasp how concerning it is and I think there's a lot of focus on the opportunity for export that we could see from the Canadian and us perspective let's be honest I'm the only way to control this disease\nIs a radical eradication of herds right there is no vaccine we're years away from a vaccine I talked to Dr Egan Brock off yesterday a pork that are on that very topic the reality though chip is that we need to focus as well on\nAre we doing everything we possibly can to make sure that this is not hit the shores of North America\nBecause it would be absolutely devastating so it this is a very very serious highly contagious disease that uh has the port community of obviously thinking about opportunity for more export but also very concerned about how we keep it away from coming here because that would be devastating\nRight right a gym we can come back to ask the question comes in on Twitter I Want to get right to it\nOn this one from at big sky farm her that's Michele Jones up in Montana she's been on the free for all she's been on the farm reform she wants to know what you think about the potential for the house or Senate to make efforts to scale back terrorists if the Democrats\nReform she wants to know what you think about the potential for the house or Senate to make efforts to scale back terrorists if the Democrats when\nI I just don't see it I Know the the effort will be tried\nA but Trump what the toll it anyway so they would not have the votes to override any well expected Trump veto\nA but I think this grows as an issue on the tariffs the longer they remain so I'm not saying forever I think you'd have to be well into twenty Nineteen before you have a change of tone on the Republican side especially in the Senate on this issue\nGot ya got ya okay so they may try but they may be unsuccessful in an effort to scale back some of the terrorists Jim ... what's the latest that you've heard on a U.S F\n... is one of the I think the one of the potentially bigger stories as in my ... from a reporter's perspective and it's going to grow this this story has\nHas octopus like a a young chap ah\nAs far as the uh the the concerns of the ... this is where industry is working very well with government and thank goodness not only do you have to prevent this from coming in you have to have fallback plan says it what you what your what would happen if you did uh get any ...\nUh the ... I was told this week when I researched this that whatever China gives us a number on cases you multiply it by at least a factor of tan and this is going to grow exponentially and as far as the vaccine you're at least at ten\nYears away a decade away from having an effective vaccine in this area another avenue that they're pursuing as genetics because the wild boar all out there a carrier of the U.S they do not get sick\nFrom ... that's in the future as well ...\nAbsolutely you know when it comes to the reports of SF out of China I said if it's twenty it could be two hundred and two thousand and twenty thousand we don't know I'm going to get Ken's take on that now\nCBS Sports radio week nights at six Saturdays it for Sunday's at one hello\nI'm Keith Coby in and asking for your vote on

I'm Talking about Patrick mom's been eliminated in Kansas City\nAlex Smith going to Washington\nAnd Kirk Cousins moving to Minnesota\nEvery one of those organizations and making a massive change your quarterback\nAnd there were some bold moves that when the each one of those decisions now lead their division and I recognize to varying degrees of success\nBut I think there's two Super Bowl contenders in that mix and Washington's not that there are top a really bad in a cease there are really bad division but there's still a topic and I want to start with Al Smith were just a moment 'cause I think he is grossly underappreciated\nHe's not a super star he's not in the homes and he got replaced for reason he he did he needed to get replaced my home to the store and he's going to take this team to the next level but think about the incompetence and the lackluster play in Washington for so long\nIn the current cousins era they made the playoffs they loan time one time and as has been tossed around\nHe was unable Kirk Cousins win that game haven't won a playoff game a very long time and Alex Smith is a quarterback who will get you to the playoffs and can when you are gay or at least not lose you again\nThey're foreign too and he's doing what he always does he's protecting the football\nHe's got just a couple of interceptions through six games so far this year he's got a one percent interception percentage which is remarkable and exactly the interception percentage you had last year\nHe's not a star but the guys always been a winner people forget that number one draft pick to the niners he won there until ... took his job beat him out because there was a ceiling their coaches owners' knowledge that they're limited themselves that's fine\nShe's due to the right way you let\nAlex Smith build something in a culture and a lot of things and Andy reading that and then you have to move on to somebody who can take the next level it's a dangerous game to play to pick the wrong guy you can jeopardize what you built\nObviously moms was the right call but lost in all that last new limitations of Alex Smith calling again manager whatever you want to say that he is I don't mean has put down he's a winner the guy was Fifteen and twenty six of the starter in Kansas City Missouri\nAnd that she's organization went a generation without a playoff when until recently in this century they've had some nice teams but they have never been successful in the postseason going back in Ninety three until a few years ago and now Smith is a big part of the reason the chief built themselves into a contender\nAnd he's a big part of the reason that Washington is when he put ball games now my homes the guy that the chief traded up to get in a drought last year and I do need to build labor the mom's point too long but I think it's worth just reminding people wanna gutsy move that was they had Alex Smith under contract for another year\nThey had just come off a really nice season last year the chiefs opened the year five and all they showed a little bit down the stretch they had some injury issues as well especially defensively\nKarimov emerged I mean they won the division they won their division and they sent out the quarterback who had gotten in there and go on Fifteen twenty six as a Kansas City chiefs that takes some real guts to elevate\nOr do they played a single game his career from the end of the year last year end\nIt says the Kansas City chiefs that takes some real guts to elevate\nDo that played a single game and his career from the end of

I\nI Believe probably the weakest link of the four teams right now only because Aaron Rodgers of keeping us in this thing we play three times against our riot against our opponents and we have a five hundred up winning percentage 'cause we got to win all off in the ...\nSo I mean I Would say the of the the three quarter back to your wanting to talk about I Would say the one that has the strongest defense if that's the confidence that that that quarterback is going to have gotten into the playoffs\nThat's ... yeah because in the\nMinnesota Vikings but if it I Know you're not wanting to really talk about Mitch to risky down in Chicago but this guy I Am excited I I'm I'm a Green Bay Packer fans don't get me wrong\nBut I'm excited to see the Chicago Bears competitive and that scares me because that defense if they if these guys are I think to Chicago Bears or for real I think they're for real I think our defenses for real and and and I'm I'm not ashamed to say I'm I also believe that the Mike mccarthy is going to get canned at the end of the year and now we've got to get something fresh\nFor Aaron Rodgers for the last five years of his deal although I I mean there's just a lot of Packer fans in Wisconsin right now that are just kind of sick and tired of the same old same old but then again if you're under the table and we ended up in the NFC championship game it's\nRight we just throw our hands on the air like what the French were never to get out of this is just like insanity here here\n[laughter] I Love the optimism or I Love the bears kind is to quote

that we're talking about with the most confidence\nThat's the question mark for cousins he's got not as common as the defense he's got the talent he's got the weapons and we don't talk enough about and I'm feeling that guy is so it's just a Diggs is to be nice of them to get healthy but still there's a lotta options in that all sense\nFor current cousins who exploit questions Kenny Brandon Oklahoma City bank for less than a brother you're on CBS Sports radio\nHey what's up man that friday to bind that in front of a man\nMan so uh talking about your three quarterbacks you know looking at Alex Smith looking at Kurt cousins looking at the home\nHonestly um I gotta I gotta give it to my home\nHere's the reason why it and you highlighted on it earlier is that correct cousin um fantastic\nMan is he's he's phenomenon on Alex Mitt and he said he's probably not going to regret unlikely right but the fact is what they've done in the playoffs and these guys while they got great intentions in the regular season they're not winning in the playoffs now\nI agree you know what I Will say is is we haven't seen what the hell is going to do in the play offs\nBut if is regular season play is anything of the nature of what he's going to do in the playoffs I just think he's going to be the best\nIn terms of those three guys and who I Would trust in January\nBrands actually call

LeBron's mine for what he hopes and expect that she looks like next year\nBut look do do I think he probably has a vision for what the tea looks like if this is why are you at Iran's have this discussion one way or another about how many ... your deals their work on or would you take a look at the last ... rod do Octavian Caldwell poll jail the key\nAnd then figure out what you guys are part of the future it out it looks like\nA grub coups Josh ... certainly could be part of that\nUh but yes just LeBron have is I sell the house set\nI getting one of those types of players whether it's ... or anyone else it's going to be really difficult though to pry Anthony Davis from New Orleans which are right now or even at this off season and so what's going to take a lot of give feed off\nOf the Lakers part if they say that's what they want to get that job but do I believe what Brian has a vision and it talked about it with Magic Johnson Iraq a Laker about what do you watch the chiefs of look like you're\n... you're on the show we talked about this yesterday and I got pretty animated how frustrated I Am\nThat when players when star players demand they don't want to be somewhere even when they're under contract they don't have to be there anymore ... Leonard see Paul George C Jimmy Butler perhaps soon it drives me crazy\nBut why would it be any different if it was the other day I mean the Davis who signed was club sports ... represents the brown the bronze buddy rich people that have just said I don't want to be or any more\nWhat is there to prevent do you think the ... and then to say too bad we're going to make a play\nAh I I Do believe it or going to look this up for for this reason alone if we start to look at some of the other guys all of this\nAnd you know\nThis year it's hard for Anthony Davis\nOpt out if we want to look at next year they'll ... what's the Nineteen twenty season he would be edited\nTo the last year he has a player option for twenty\nTwenty one it's what we look at that I teach what he sees it that were put him in a civil war situation to attribute butler is it now can I strictly envision that at the ... you know some of the off season\nCertainly cat and you know the ... of Asia should rich Paula tried orchestrate this stuff and a little bit of it does bother me to a bill ... it's part of the trend in the SBA but what you also seen\nIs is is that all George did it get traded to the destination that he wanted it to look out for their best interest that Paul Georgia's best interests\nThe same say ... all the talk about why why do you do go to ... she gets up at Toronto and by the way I really liked this raptors tea with quite wet or whether it's sort of keep it there for a long term deal will see and I'm not sure that you're the butler is going to get out where he was either it's you know\nHow ... Hitler was ownership the front office they're going to try to get what's best for that and so there is also ... Davis porches or their health dealt that that you work out that does go to automatically trade is to achieve with the western conference with what brought you\nJust don't get here on the show and I guess probably um you know it's not like David Letterman given cares reference on Dell right to sort of move\nThe ... bill real quick right away I started with ... ... yeah we do get that\nArticle what's your what's entertaining real quick David skirt did say that you know he had somewhat fired a it's a somewhat fire at USA Today which at our our guys we can't come up with that person at\nAll I missed the ...\nYeah ... any talk about the reasons he got to do this because he attacked the family well was it that what David Was just do it without that attack the the the family I just thought it was sort of bizarre at let's carry out\nI Love and Jeb zillion firing the shots in true here on the show or do you have you brought up\nGuam Leonard ... I'm with you man they are holy cow they're good what is the I don't refined games in ...\nAnd I'm not going to the whole overreaction a long season\nI'm ... I'm with you man they are holy cow they're good what is the I don't refined games in ... and I'm not going to the whole overreaction a long season bond is ... ... what's the best case scenario for the Toronto Raptors\nNBA Finals I mean I really do a bill of you know this was achieved that couldn't get past LeBron James you swap are the barter roses for ... ... ... s debate the value of the greed of this team they had six fan of the year candidate\nNow nobody GE gene or building a brand new leaves the air until seven o'clock tomorrow morning within twenty five miles north of Nebraska program we continue on translator came to nine zero Eighteen at one point nine FM\nSep discussion you have to start there's ... out of there will be ... by ... top you have served her back or is it paid off I really like ... or here's a little though a that I'll throw out there\nIs that there are so has decided to split up played ... surgery back at the same type uh their dog or Sherry better so out of the court's together\nIt takes up a little bit deeper or you got ... is well it it's just a really good team it up if you don't get gr says innovative off of coach who's really going to take advantage of that dot and\n... ... five sets of cheap last year as well go routed against a team that already has a cat do any there's no reason they will be at the top of the east to get a at a at the end you and I are going to overreact but we see that Boston has a long way to go to\nAnd I'm with you on Nick Nurse and all that is fun fact he is from the state that studies show produced the best people just don't get Iowa would you like to know what I'm saying I'm from\nIowa yeah uh it it well the ... coast Iowa Energy or the machinery he did yeah yeah\nYeah it was because there are so great coaches who get started that are in that leak it worked or way off by to fetch a job at the FDA and then eventually get a chance to take over AT T\nOrigin they'll get let's play the overreaction can you tell me any of these teams as part of the overreaction conversation slime games in the NBA season actually might have something to worry about used in the in the wind was under the Celtics in the last ... lack of often so far and or silly\nWho look I I think all for Bill I go to overreact but are there are so flaws there that are being highlighted that maybe we did it she\nUh I'll probably least worried about Boston or overly because it was going to take some time to leave Gordon Hayward carry you back into the light up figure out some say it's a book if they continue to give effort defensively\nThat's got to keep up with a lot of gates\nA Philadelphia you don't have the ... page with that your team it's not entirely surprising but uh if you look at why do we there's no guarantee that you don't feel he's going to have that third spot or even the for spot if Indiana plays really really well ah he used it as the chief bill\nThat are worried about that just because of the James Harden injury that's going to keep them out at least a couple of apes or or the Chris Paul absence from this dispatch it\nI think it's losing guys like Trevor ... a a loop was shipped by a bouquet of people like that still really make a difference I get sick they were able even with the issues of car how bell apathy\nSort of get back what they lost with those two guys they were starting to see that there are just a little bit and that thank you very well we'll see what ends up happy but why your old Boris try that they just push for Julie ... or who's a a very ... to a player\nOf and so that's the the were really worried about it also the author you would've expected there\nOr if you don't do is get a victory here at least for gays I I did that and expect to old for stark did it so what it also illustrates if this goes back to what I was just vegetate about the Lakers the difficulty if they could play asked how many really really cheap there are in the west or ... or the season now\nLet's try to take this conversation bill probably ... another four weeks so we get a little bit better idea but yeah I think there's reason for ... or ... and yet there's certainly plenty of time to turn this just don't get here\nOn the program writer than you with me bill writer Jeff\nFrom USA Today's weren't ... pistons and book Tempe to new and very eye out for me very impressive and ... respectively and I know are getting certainly but each of these teams are undefeated on under these coaches who have had some success other places\nDo you buy either of these teams is real competitors real threats in eastern conference over the course of a long season\nSo I don't buy the pistons is a threat at the top of the east\nOr above the top five teams uh I think there'll be hide Toronto boss is Philadelphia for a walk you through the at a however if we're talking about the team's going for the six seventh and eighth seat which they haven't done it a few seasons it make the playoffs I
