here on the show does your does choose your own adventure job of\nDo you want to get the ugly stuff out of the way he wants on football first\nOr the great stuff I think let\nI'll just let you use or that you're say here I Am certainly disgusted by what is your reaction to Maryland reinstating DJ jerk in in the athletic director Damon habits\nI I've been going there more than Thirty years you know going into my four decade I'd never seen any more hang in there\nWhere the guys on on the watch of their head coach in in the corporate world he'd he'd be fired just because you let it happen on a

dominant player and everything is good I I've never seen anything like it and forget forget about whatever the media says\n... think about the players who walked out of that meeting this morning NPR could imagery face that's all you have to know what happened today now\nAnd and obviously it's it's specific to Maryland talking to then it's out here on the show but Dennis are there any conclusions we can draw about the powerful at universities around the country and how they view so called amateurs ...\nAthletics they're athletes from from this ridiculous yeah\nI mean this is your ... this is the latest example of this so called\nAmateur collegiate model crashing up against a is an every day for profit business model the only thing that is not the only thing they wanted to raise it makes it where did you would almost understand where did the right\nYes that you would other than that in some perverse way they take their opinion was had won a couple of championship today we're seven into\nA because I always say they're winning percentage always wins out a example urban Meyer Ohio State but there there that are the regions who wanted to bring him back on the hill of a guy who's head of steam and it's something like five and a Thirteen and that they care I don't get it\nIf there was ever a time to clean house this is\nWhat I mean we joked hear about this issue and other issues where it's perplexing about do they have photos on the people in power but can you hear that\nGas I I mean what shorter than actual photos of the people in power what is the motivation and what is the impetus for this university and supposedly learned men and women in positions of power beyond sports making this kind of a decision\nWell from what I saw their conclusion but yet but she had died yet to function in the program yeah but that coach got you know it's got too much blame for that wait a minute let's say you're putting it all on the French toast strength coach box well guess what they can't even tell that\nGot too much blame for that wait a minute let's say you're putting it all on the Frank shows strength coach his boss well guess what they can't even tell that they don't know how we received survive to abide by there was no chain of command there\nA remark about bringing Damon evidence ... love the president and I frankly didn't pick up and all three of them get through job fair\nOr much less be retained a power play by the boosters ingredients into ball of low if you don't do this if you don't announces coming back you're fired because they have that power to talk about the tail wagging the dog athletics when's again that I I'm I'm Glad to be part of a\nPart of MCA sports when I hear that aren't being sarcastic\nYeah I hear I mean Dennis down here on the show and Dennis ... are you a Missouri grant to er there's so many of I I Am I Am yeah I Am too I'm for the most part part of my school and I I Can't\nGet my mind around how I Would feel like how I Would feel about my alma mater industry where everyone out hold\nIf this were 'cause it's getting in Missouri as much as Maryland or anywhere\nWell there is a there is a a a little bit of a comparison I my column I just wrote about look this is such a\nFishing now the players just make a statement need to walk out the need to protest boycott sit down strikes something because you live at stake literally um you know this guy had walked into home there are obvious you walk into a home and tell anybody's going to take care of yourself when this has happened\nUm and look in the comparison them as well is this actually happened very three years ago with the players threatened to boycott must have moved to president\nWhat they term to his racial insensitivity and that president did leave they weren't going to play football\nAnd I I think this is what's going to change if it ever changes this model they're talking about it's going to have to be in the hands of the players because they're the labor force\nEvery unpaid labor force to play for ten million dollars a year coaches and stuff like this happens whether it's in Missouri I'm or Maryland it's a more cars and they have the only way of controlling the games don't go on\nThat money doesn't get paid for the schools those commercials don't on at the worst thing you can do to the network or a university\nDennis down here on the program writer than you on CBS Sports radio with me bill Ryder Dennis not that long ago we got our first look at the college football playoff rankings what um what struck you what do you think\nI'm ready for for ah UCF night nation to implode they started at twelve or I think they ... and white and he said I Want to see if we are in the top and uh they are still are going to hope that they will be in the top for I don't think the good news for U. C. F.\nI. one I saw the top for I don't think that kind of a surprise to anybody\nI Want to know what Michigan is path is to the tops for if LSU when Saturday you know what I'm Talking about because I don't think Alabama drops out of the top for how can you do that and what they've done this year the high test at the same as last year they one of the best teams in the country\nHave right now the vaccine next saved and padded Alabama they lose their field goal LSU\nBut when the rest of their games how do you keep them out\nI I don't know if you can and more and more than you're comparing them to Michigan and they have one twelve in a row at that point a Oklahoma as those twelve and one of who else was in there I'm Rob Jordan Kentucky are going to take care of themselves but\nUh you know I I don't know if if she wins that's very bad for the\nDentist do you think there's a scenario where a worn out last Alabama team in any in any scenario doesn't make the college football playoff this year\nUh yeah if they have the last the last would have to be the LSU a ... a very good that it happened last year\nA on November twenty fifth they lost the game and still got into the top for because they had built up so much equity\nIn the minds of a selection committee and then they were right they should have been one of the top four teams now they can't lose I'm trying to think they probably one of these\nCharleston southerners somebody they're not going to the front of a medically they have left but\nUm so I I think that's one of the great conundrums of the rest of the season if they lose one of those games\nThose the committee leave them out um and I and that that leads to a larger question I'm going to write about this week but you know this is a game of the century three with al issue like I just said I think they can afford to lose it [laughter]\nActually the best result or did you actually need to get through the ... Alabama without fighting in the championship game then whoever wins\nThen his daddy are on on the show does a lot of people and I am on that list danced on Jim ... grave\nEarlier this year do any of us do\nSome of us all horrible and apology and whether we like him or not maybe a a rethinking of his place as a college football coach in the country\nYeah I don't think it's an apology I I think that criticism is just a lot of it coming from a message and when you lose the Notre known your wife fix against their their three bigger\nActually four biggest rival and therefore\nI think that criticism I I always said he was a great coach they never could get a you know I I always said that in summing up him are part time at Michigan Mexican fans are going to Ohio State more can they ever loved you in are you could do there Twenty years and that's going to be cut\nHis hair they hacked to beat the clean up north I'm from down south or wherever it is on the honor so his his seizing will be determined by what happened later in November at Ohio State I think there's a better team I think they're going to win\nBut I think I think he has to fulfill that so no there's no apology I mean he's a before he knows that the fake for having said that he's done a fantastic job you know where I'm then he opened up your friends for ... what kind of shape Patterson the deeper than that given\nAnd they've got it got a few climax there's not many passively I mean the amount of time to believe that there are just scratching out enough yard isn't enough points to when I got a heck of a job this year\nEmail phishing attacks cost businesses billions annually in real cash data loss and brain damage fishing emails are hard to get attacked because the messages appear to be legitimate to unsuspecting employees\nIntroducing barracuda fish lined a groundbreaking cloud based solution designed to help employees recognized sophisticated email phishing attacks do interactive training reinforced by continue with the elation\nTransform your employees from the liability into a line of defense go to barracuda dot com slash appeal to learn more\nCBS Sports radio we saw in northeast Nebraska on AM seven eighty five point nine FM news talk WG gee north of\nThe\nParty divide it I'm Lisa ...

guy who ignored the NBA for about a twenty of his first\nForty years old and the last four I'm like hardcore because of my son Rocco so we're going up to see the wizards play the Sixers November thirtieth\nIn Philadelphia and I told him today that I think Scotty Brooks will be fired by then and between auto Porter Bradley bill John Wall at least one of them will be gone by that am I crazy or\nThey're going to happen right I think you're right and one or two I think I I'm not kidding jails yet Dwight Howard is a spiritual cancer and even though he has been activated yet\nThe fact that they were bought muscle I mean it's not it's not\nQuite the central wizards right there\nHe's a torn by muscle media while we're ... yeah I think yeah I like Scotty a lot\nToo but his main you're right his main strength is to make this locker room work it has in\nThe ... they just paid out of so much money is not playing well so I I'll I'll say Scott he's gone but man I guess it depends how well they play between now and then they they get back to the semblance of a playoff team they're not want one of the one in five right now\nWhat is it five and all the other thing and a half time to the grizzlies yeah\nOh that's all right let me ask you to random quite All right do you believe in ghosts and having ... real Iraq okay but I respect it All right question number two\nAnd I have no

could force them to watch one ...\nWow that's a hard one\nYeah well you know a couple of you want your ... your life where like the ... going to Philadelphia to get that marked down all\nYou wanna

both be way up there what was the one where he's the alcoholic pilot\nOh that was good I don't actually watch on an airplane flight and by the Crimson Tide an air I did I was like well that would have\nLiked to about Fifteen minutes in I Would have just put my ... and pretended that there was nothing going up\nFor what he did make it alone but he came down my God let when you're in room doing

the matter of L I guess a couple a very active trade deadline day that's an anomaly a one off or the or the new normal\n... interesting I I I don't know I think we're trending in that direction I think trades I mean I've been covering this week for twelve or Fifteen Years and I feel like when I started covering it trades was almost like a taboo ... not a subject to be talked about and we don't\nDo that in this league yadda yadda you must know the system from the off season now shall be ended the commitment of what this team does it do TAs and if you weren't out here that\nAre not welcome and I I think a lot has changed even just in the last decade so\nI don't know what I mean we saw five significant trade today or I mean a lot of time in our mission there yet but you know five traits four of them probably significant plus another for trade you go back to the Josh Gordon trade another four or five significant trades\nOver the previous month that's by NFL standards that's that's a lot\nIf you go back to the Josh Gordon trade another four or five significant trades over the previous month that's by NFL standards that's that's a lot that's activity of the highest order are we going to see that every year I don't know you know maybe not if they moved it back a couple of weeks I think we see even more\nBecause there's a lot of teams pretending that there any like Miami could still pretend that they are in in Jacksonville could pretend that they're in it even Baltimore foreign for but God they the foreign for every year and what if they want if they won the super bowl you know five ... five and a half years ago um\nTampa Bay did nothing but I mean are they really going to win anything so I I I think there's ways that you could kind of set of eyes trades even more than what we have going on right now but\nI Do believe that more in season activity will be a way of life\nAs the cap keeps expanding exponentially as we see more and more young GM's young executives who are not as sort of bound by the rituals of the past and ask people start to look at things more analytically\nWe in the days mocking for here on the show Jason we've seen in other major American sports some of these trade make a difference on the deep years was a major name of the guy just one\nWorld Series MVP we've seen NBA trays make a big difference any of these trades and happen today or in the lead up to do they strike you as potential actual difference makers and who has a shot at are actually win the super bowl this year\nI mean possibly I think gold Tate how football player\nHe can't win in the slot he can win as an outside receiver\nAnd you look at what they have they're already with hurts and now they can push agar were bad they don't have to worry about Aguilar into slot anymore or trying to do stuff underneath for winning tight quarters you but Aguilar on the outside on one side Jeffrey in the outside of the other side\nPut a golden paid in the slot on one side put herbs on the slot in the other side start spreading people out I mean I Love their office of lines of well you know we'll see\nHow long lane Johnson's out and we'll see if Jason Peters can kind of stay upright but I you know I like that move I mean\nGoing take rolls out of bed and catches Ninety boss you know so of everything that happened today that's one where I feel like the eagles and really not that far behind the Redskins and I don't truly believe in the Redskins and I like what they did for a while you know with high Clinton did I just don't I I think at some point\nPeterson

other are you being\nA good man first of all I I just wanted to say like cut and dry LS you're not getting the respect that we deserve\nTheir number three days roots back said\nI'm Talking about in your opinion because of the fact is that here for now it doesn't matter where you're now we're going to be here after Kate\nOkay no no no no you're wrong you're on around me me me me me if I didn't explain it well enough I Apologize here's how I Will explain it to you in\nLA she was not going to stay number three here's why who do they play this week\nSaving in no body\nYeah Alabama okay so if you when do you think you're staying at three\nWe're better be number one oh okay so in other words you're gonna move if you lose the you think you're staying at three\n... no no I think that clearly what my point was to be their number three for now by the time they come out with a poll next week they will not be three anymore they will\nEither be moving up to three from three because they're playing Alabama every day when they're going or at least to to have Clemson goes to one ordinarily\nBragging Clinton and going all the way the number one if they lose the game they're not saying that the way they're falling they're going back\nTo Los ... you're not staying at number three would to losses so that's what I meant by their not staying at three if you didn't understand me I'll apologize when I stand all over what I said\n... and I would have your apology but my thing is okay that national media and everyone expected us and go what may be fifty fifty as far as our record is concerned we have\nFor CNET and flows when no one thought we can do things and my thing is I don't care where they are now when we played him\nWhen literally there from Miami to Georgia\nTo 'em out to go against the gators\nHave we didn't play like we should have all the way down to our competition but whenever we play\nWhenever we're quite a ball there's not a team in a country that can be\nYou know then you better you better be ready to play ball on Saturday because Alabama's pretty good\nEh oh no no they're they're great at how galore guy is awesome but my thing is the last thing to do it and you can cut me off\nThat quarterback from from Georgia is legit and we made him look a whore\nBeer your plate that was that that was your best game of the year beat in Georgia I'm and yes I Will readily admit I thought the Dalai ... was a team that could play in in January first of all\nI thought you could be two three four and the SEC I made five hundred no you are better than prime on team everybody knew that ah you had more talent or not coming back but yeah I waited boat Alabama and clams and Georgia\nOf you in the SEC prior to the season started and you would not be the dogs are so you\nCan lay claim to being in the top floor while they sit outside the ... you were in that spot\nBut you're not undefeated you didn't step you're told to Florida so yet you'll be Ga Ga turn around and be Florida in Florida beat you there's a couple of teams that have beat up each other and oh by the way you know when you eaten up by Alabama yet so uh do we have I ever\nCall me on Saturday it's probably a night game or you don't have to be had caught what time of your shoe Alabama game is my guest is the night there's gonna be eight o'clock yeah so\nUm I'll beyond either right at the end of the game or you can call me Sunday you're on the gas for radio\nAnd evaluate you when you go back and go Jody guess what you are right they are moving to LA she was not staying at number two and number three they're going to number one they just beat number one and he got to be the chance to beat the camp and we beat the camp\n... roll tide roll all the way you when I Want to hear back from me on Sunday I Want you to rub it in my face I Want you to reveal rub it in my nose I take all the abuse that you can handle\nBut if they lose\nThen you've got to call back and go\nEven while he's off

J. from Richmond up on CBS Sports radio DJ\nYeah and he joined iMac I doing good you\nOn making it through another day man I\nBut I just wanted to talk to you about the NFL trade I'm a Washington Redskins fan and I heard we got ... Clinton did and then all of a heart attack and I'll tell you know why\nA lot of excitement or frustration deal like it or not\nNow I like it and I go to the you know I had a heart transplant a couple of months ago and I was just like ...\nThat ran in a can make a decision is like the\nUh we're Redskins ... I I think you should be happy or decks is I think one of the better shape these in the NFL\nTo get 'em for for ... years so uh you're either going to get something back in compensation pick up the leaves do you resign them but either way you get a really motivated guy for nine games at the cost of a fourth round draft pick and you know you're going to get some ... back\nIn exchange I could damn good trade for the Redskins said they jumped in and just the right time\nIf he's going to be difficult to sign I think you have to read that into the Packers trading am\nThat they made an attempt to had some negotiations with his agent or didn't seem like they were anywhere close to getting him resigned who's going to be real difficult and said let us get something now something in the next ... rather than have to wait another year before we get a compensation picked\nI so I get it from Green Bay standpoint but does it mean that the Redskins didn't make a good deal I actually think they did\nOh yeah yes indeed agri which and I'm waiting to see what happened because it can't hurt you know there are paying her to know the you\nKnow it makes you better football team I think that's a good player um Green Bay\nTrading boat decks and time oncoming Montgomery isn't gonna\nHe he was a a part time a backward turn guy called modern backfill pretty well Rogers did mine thrown at two of them are I think it was a reaction to the are running the kick out against the rams the other day more than anything else they only get a seventh round in return but he put those two marched to trades together\nAnd it looks like the Packers are actually backing off\nBack off when you have ever Rogers and he's healthy\n... who's going to be out for the rest of the season like he was last year I can say All right yeah we don't have our guy were dropping off we're not going to be a Super Bowl contender\nWe can do a reset thing here we can take a step back take to boil down the road Rogers is playing every week we heard earlier in the year but he's been playing through the pain all year you got to sue me can continue to do that\nTo take a step backwards for future draft pick surprise me Packers surprise me more than anybody else with the moves they made today\nJones from Tennessee's on CBS portray a guilty\nMan good you\nYeah all the man I Love you know ... ... yeah every Sunday night and we're all act to say\nI'm uncle or law well all of the law here gotcha\nOkay well our football team you know or a transition but I was a little ask you about what you worry about the precision of it for the end of the volunteers at six elimination\nSurprising\nI think they're good but I didn't think they'd be as high AS number six I'll be one hundred per cent honest with you the SEC\nIs kind of open the FCC in basketball isn't quite the SEC in college football so or they could be the top team Kentucky is to say you got two teams out of the FCC and the\nTop six that's inside the FCC has been in a couple of years\n[noise] yeah that is awesome I tell you what we got to hurt them Eric bars from a from a pet\nAnd he he settled down here for the call or two or three years and I don't hear this guy is awesome has\nBurned like Brian ... uh when you got 'em out of Texas I thought that uh you you do have the right guy at the right time I just took a quick I didn't realize is\nTennessee actually had now they they won both ... doesn't really sway much of anything but your top twenty five prep precision top twenty five and I told you they got a great opening night double header in Indianapolis\nI'm with number one Kansas against number ten Michigan State or so and you know Michigan State is is a one or the all time great programs in MTA history and where there's always coached\nAlthough they come in at number ten they're still Michigan State but got top ranked Jay hawk she gives Michigan State\nAnd in in the second game you've got Kentucky who's preseason rank number two do coups preseason ranked number for that is a great way to kick it off that's a week from a tonight tendencies sixth as the caller correctly stated\nAnd they did get a first place vote\nKansas got thirty seven first place votes Kentucky Nineteen\nBin Laden got one but there must have got a bunch of second or third place votes because they ended up third overall in the uh pre season are voting\nDo ... for ... for for the first place vote Virginia got to first place votes they're fair Tennessee got a first place vote and Villanova who's number nine and of course you're defending champions\nBut they got hurt by guys believe in school early they got to redo that team they laws arguably there therefore best players to the NBA draft this past year but don't ever\nDon't ever run to sell Jay right he'll have built over in the mix will we get to the final four\nI I'm not ready to say no but I'm not ready to say yes either a I'm a huge Jay right fan a noble got a nod somebody do a ... up there is number one you know I don't have a problem with that\nIf you the defending champions and you've\nGot to vote for the AP top twenty five and you want to put a specific team up their number one because they are the champs until somebody does something on the floor for the next year I'm okay with\nThat don't take no was going to be in the top ten all year that probably drop out they'll get hot at the end of year to make a tournament run but to start or you want it to him a first place vote and that moves them into the top ten because you've got 'em all the way up a number one\nAnd hot at the end of year to make a tournament run but to start the or you want to do I'm a first place vote and that moves them into the top ten because you've got 'em all the way up a number one yeah I I don't know who can't stand vote but I don't have a problem with it even though they they don't match up\nRoster wise with the Kansas is in Kentucky's and Dukes and

okay\nAll right I think that it builds up some excitement for the college football fans that\nIf we can debate it for a couple of shoot I've already taken a couple of calls about LA to be the number three dating like I said the fact that\nThey're not going to stay in three there were all either move it up and they play Alabama Newsweek or moving down after they play Alabama they were there were three for the next five days and then it's going to be changed um but that's a that's a good thing if you got called ... fans getting excited about or ticked off about it\nOr ... or how they're

Jerry gets gets bombarded on Twitter or whatever it's social media outlet he uses to ah get a fan of feedback\nI think they did a nice job of settling in at this time of the year\nFirst time they did the football poll they did it from week one and then yes guys like me and other talking heads in the media are second guessing and questioning and\nWanting to get guys on we're on and go are women who are on the committee or to give them in get get them to give insight of how the debate where and how the conversation when they don't want to deal with that\nAnd I really don't have to you'd just go

South Carolina thought we'd be down but but I thought it all cup are also but I Am I tell you the habit of Craig Craig here and I'm real proud of\nTheir heads as well you should be a I said everybody thinks of Kentucky when you're Kentucky think oops you don't think what ball and the football team is earned the kind of respect and the ranking\nThat they have a they're basically the same thing to to ask\nThe the games are for this week\nUh where they would all these deep sea teams without ranked irrelevant because of Alabama loses their fallen from number one a question as to whether they fall out of the top for the valley you Wednesday or not staying at three they're moving off of that coming down St George in Kentucky they play this week\nIf you when you read Georgia this week\nGuaranteed you're climbing a couple of spots I don't know that you're getting into the top four but if you're going to be the leader and for you or read a side of the conference and you're gonna get shot at the other team in the S.

J. G. Norfolk\nOn\nTargeting birthright citizenship I'm Carmen Robert Fox news a fire storms brewing over whether the president can do away with birthright citizenship\nThis whole thing started when President Trump made comments during an interview with actually as as part of a new HBO's series data viewing this weekend watch was\nAlways told to me that you needed a constitutional a member guessing one and you don't need a number one number one you don't need that number to nothing to do well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe president went on to say we're the only country that allows birthright citizenship which is incorrect some certain countries out of the same law including Canada and Mexico\nTo trace Gallagher speaker of the house Paul Ryan disagrees with the president saying you cannot into birthright citizenship with an executive order\nWe didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws of action and obviously as conservative some you know we believe in in the constitution\nRyan during an interview with Kentucky WBAL K radio Democrats are unhappy the president found another immigration issue to go after they had hoped to take immigration off the table before the midterm and concentrate on health care\nThe mid term election is just days away but it's going to take the migrant care about a week if not months to reach the border now like top military officials as us has two thousand more troops ready to join the fifty two hundred already designated for the

you are\nYeah but the interesting trade deadline day I Would say with the busiest we've ever had but uh yeah some stuff with down\nAll right then get rid of me that we just moved may today or if you want to stay in the last week or so because the ... the deadline always put you seem to do something that we got a bunch today but they were deal done over the last week or so which one gave you the\nReally moment that the surprise moment that you didn't see a trade like this coming for whatever reason\nI didn't think\nGo hey we're going to be moved I I just sort of felt like\nLaw go why were blown away by the price of apparently a third round or was enough um that they were going to keep them in fact there had been some\nThought recently that they might even try to find them next year you know that was sort of assumed at one point okay he's going to move on and you know the the reality is they have these top they're happy stopped or the ... were great beyond that but that was really questionable and you look the wind or game out of first place but\nThey just said to them so we're getting a third round are now versus potentially getting up there around her at a competitive tore pick for rent or the end of the draft a year later\nJust wasn't going to be worth it so they get the earlier pick higher value they traded their third in New England already so they they really uh recoup that that's the one that may be surprised me the most I think\nAnd the reason why that surprised me was they went out and got an X. Harrison prior to the trade deadline so they looked like they were in it and going to hang in trying to catch the practice or to buy things that are bad or if you want to say they're competing with and then with this bill today it looks like they're taking a step back so it seemed like mixed messages out of Detroit\n... and you know here than it is still a player who can get\nAnd today it looks like they're taking a step back so it seemed like mixed messages out of Detroit\nYeah it and you know Harrison is it's still a player who can contribute for multiple years but you make a great point which is\nYou know it looks like they're buyers they are buyers and then they make a really in theory a bigger move a ... and weak in a position that\nLook I mean it sound like they're great tied to end the already that gets their path catching back he's banked up right now you know you're really been at the opposition and you know is it TJ Jones or any of these other guys on the roster receive are going to fill that void\nI guess I don't know where it's going to come from that's my biggest concern right there is how did they replace\nThe production of one of their most consistent receiver so yeah your your point is absolutely good in that they they do seem to be of of ah two minds here [laughter]\nSometimes do that sometime you try to split the difference and you end up either solving bowed to problems or need the problem we'll see how it works out for the lions are going to go to Philly for a third\nDairy asylum schools to use it in for a porous than a slap on the sandman which is probably gonna end up hurting Denver knock I tell them a different time different levels of seventh round packs\nA day or different types of receivers you know got the better deal\nYeah and the ... ... is a different type of receiver than will fuller whom they just walk through an ACL injure I mean\nYou know there was a time I think earlier in his career when Thomas could could be somewhat of a vertical threat you know he came out of college is the you know not not the Calvin Johnson type but I mean a kind of a a\nA ... you know a different version of that guy but a big strong physical receiver who's game it's kind of changed now I mean full or could run those over out she could run those nine routes and really took the field draw safe these back that sort of thing\nThe various Thomas More of a station to station receiver I Do think it'll help if they use them correctly I mean the Sean what that means all the helping get I Would have loved to see them get some authors of wind assistance but\nBoth teams are trading now so receiver was about the best thing that we're going to do right there\nI think it also says there may be a little concerned about kicking cutie and whether his health is going to be an issue as well so hard to do it I I liked the move he's a good team guys good blocker set issues with drops but you know I think if he can assimilate pretty quickly\nYou know and there's gotta be some carry over I Would think to what Josh make details ran in Denver when when he was drafted there early in his career and what below Brian's running now and

Neves St Louis the Los Angeles rams I'm\nTaking the lead but ... you know with our Rogers says his ability to move teams late stick and he had to do what he has to to get the game winning score or he runs into managing shows as well then quarterback and football I'm never got the chance\nBecause time Montgomery took it out of the end zone and coughed up inside the twenty five yard line\nRams got the ball needed one first down ended up getting it a as a matter of fact tied girlie could have scored on a third down a gutsy called they decided to uh run him outside and he ended up getting around the corner got inside the five and then just stopped\nBecause they scored a touchdown and they would have had to kick off you don't want to give it back to her I just it just went to the ground and the Packers were out of time out and they took a couple of needs and the game was over so well that's how the ramp\nEnded up winning the game by two points\nAnd Montgomery after the game was supposedly told\nDon't take it out of the ... if the kicks in the end zone we've got enough time let our and do his thing don't take out it ends up he made the play he decided he was going to try and uh give Aaron more than just twenty five yards on the touch back\nAnd ended up coughing it up a little consternation in the locker room afterward some teammates decks that go on for them because they are the coaching staff said don't bring out the end zone of a touch back we'll just take to touch that go from there while they turn around and they basically dumped them today\nFor a future seventh round pick\nNot even a seven draft pick a future seven drop after weighty here twenty twenty seventh round pick\nAnd Montgomery is has been an okay back that's all he is he's a a change of pace back is not bad catch the ball out in the background and usually is pretty good on returns he just wasn't good on a return to the other day when you're settling for a future seventh ... that's what's known as dumping a player that didn't surprise me\nBut they add to that by moving a hot a decks\nWho I think is one of the better safety simple but we had a cat or a month earlier this hour he thinks that this is a little overrated I'm I don't I think he's\nCertainly a top ten safety in the NFL it might not be top five or ... he's the top ten safety for me\nGet a fourth round back from Washington I think it's a real nice addition for the Redskins who have a good front seven little a soft and the secondary\nI Know they've got a lot of money Josh Norman but he's not been what are you supposed to be added into the mix and your safety they say uh in in the secondaries of safety can cover\nI as I discuss with Eric I firmly believe that Green Bay talk to them about a contract extension know what they think he's worth know what his asking price had\nBeen in the go jays into what is aging and said we're just not going to get this guy signed 'cause we're not making up this ground he's not going to play this much better the end of the season it we're going to say I we got a given and given the money is asking for wasn't going to happen so they decided to move them for a fourth right now\nIf it was the first the second round pick okay that's the good price to pass I bought a fourth round pick for a guy who is a former first round pick\nAnd as a top ten pick I Know he's a rental\nIf you've come to the determination that ah he's going to uh be elsewhere next year and go to walk as a free agent yeah you gotta wait a whole year before you get a compensation Beck and it's not even a given that you got to compensation pick\nIf you have any given year where you're aggressive when you go out and who signed the free agents you don't necessarily get compensation picks you only get um if you lose more than you bring back\nIn free agency so I guess they decided burden and better than to in the Bush\nThat to me marks you don't really think you're going to make the playoffs\nAnd if I'm Aaron

don't really think you're good enough to make the playoffs you don't train a key player he's certainly one of their\nFour or five five or six best players on defense and you drop 'em for a fourth

away\nWith that love the show thanks sir I Am looking at all the different case and the trade that I Want to trade really stuck out as perfect thing for which is that the Clinton the Redskins wire the Packers getting rid of their number one safety\nYou and I are on the same page I said this maybe as early this hour maybe last hour\nJust the fact that the Packers if they trade time Montgomery alright\n... he made a big mistake DL alienated a couple of T may she's not a huge piece you think's the addition subtraction okay you're going to let him go but\n... says one of their three or four four or five best defensive players how do you take him out of the mix of you think you still have a Super Bowl contender even if you lose them is a free agent you're still playing to make it to the bowl this year you can't give 'em up for a fourth round pick made no sense\nWith the golden age trade how does that\nGolden ... added that affect the right to the to the north there is no\nI didn't think the Detroit was going on where the Detroit trade the perplexed me more was them give it up a fifth ... virus in a last week um and snacks is a nice Larry's an ex jet which of course the team that I root for\nLeft the jets went free\nAgent to the giants just picked up and moved down to a easier accessible locker room or any play well with the giants\nEven though the ... defense has been good enough hasn't been because they get pushed around in the middle snacks has done an okay job he was good for both New York teams\nBut they gave them a good a salary a pretty good contracted jump from the jets the giants and they knew we could take a cap it this year and reinvest and go in a different direction next year so it made sense because the giants of stone cold buried\nBut Detroit goes and gets them tells me they think they can when not to Beijing because nobody's run away and hide a Vikings\nPackers bears the bears are better than expected but do you really think the bears\nAre going to run away and I had not been alright the winds have going for it I don't agree with it I don't think the lions all that good but at least I appreciated their aggressive nature then they turn around and dump\nGolden Gate doesn't make sense one one move flies in the face of the other\nEye Detroit's bad organization sorry live and so we got the lie of fans out there listening or maybe not the browns maybe not the dysfunctional the browns but the lions are pretty dysfunctional team as well and the ... the do trades just don't add up you either go for it or you don't I don't quite get it\nI ... like I said we've only done a little NBA Tonight a pretty good scared of games a Detroit in Boston pistons on top boss of eventually wins late ah thirty one for Kyrie\nThirty seven us could make thirty one for co why as well as Toronto bounces back after getting beat by Milwaukee the night before back to back game or they go in and handle Billy one twenty nine one twelve and beat a dirty one gets going thirty one point to the NBA at and I\nAre three and a route Kyrie go why and a Beagle at thirty one um but ... now just for him for a they were planning on getting out to a fast start them is a little bit of a disappointing foreign\nFor and oh by the way a perfect Road Home split sections of foreign our home and abroad for on the road\nOr if you think you're an MBA a championship contenders ... when was on the road you got to be able to win road games and the Seventy Sixers haven't yet they're sitting on a win for right now which isn't good um ...\nOf the games of note Tony Parker played well Charlotte beach Miami tonight twenty four for Parker Cleveland without Tyrone that totally I had to do they do run Tyrone Lou out the door\nAnd the cabs are going to get turned around\nOr maybe it's just the fact that they got to land at home and land is not very good um they get their first one of the year putting up one thirty six against Atlanta tonight to the cabs I'm Sacramento's gotten off to a pretty good start their above five hundred people writing the kings off before the average starts and [noise]\nI'm Sacramento's gotten off to a pretty good start their above five hundred\nPeople writing the kings awful for the average starts and that's been easy to do the last five or six years but they've got off to a nice start above five hundred they'd be in the eight seed right now in the west of the season where to be called the quits that juncture beat Orlando in Orlando um what is wrong with you that\nSomebody's got to explain that to me my Antonia was coach of the year last year he's\nGot some spleen and to do I know they add the big fight with the Lakers where Chris Paul got tossed out uh and uh that was I think that's the only game they won all year did they come back I ... I forget who won that game was that Lakers are rockets\nRockets one okay that's the only one that one at one of five\nOr ... just not what you expected they're starting to be I guess mellow as in quite fit in yet down there in Houston um yeah my damn tonia was coach of the year I always thought that he was an overrated coach\nBut I had to give them as props for what he did last year he's taking those pieces it made them fit darn close to perfectly not so far this year one in five they're tied with Phoenix for the worst record in the NBA didn't see that one common\nRock compared you tell me what's wrong with your basketball team not only do you get beat that I you\nGot pounded by Portland at home one oh four eighty five that's bad basketball I'd say when the Houston Rockets only score and eighty five points\nWho didn't shoot it tonight for them I take a quick because their box score and tell you I'm mellowed to for dwell\nChris Paul sick for Nineteen Erik Gordon for for Eighteen\nSo they didn't have a they ran VP candidate missed art and tonight that's pretty poor shooting shots thirty two percent from the field yeah that's bad they're bad basketball team right now I Do get a turnaround there'll be a a playoff team but after Golden State who's the ... second best team in the west\nI'll give you another do I tell you right now it's not\nAnd that's the Lakers did you see what Brian after the game last night like it's gotta be last night and somebody asked what brown about having patients and is your patients being tested by the way this team has started abroad and said\nYou don't want to be around me when when when I lose my patients which means yeah it's starting to wear a little bit in the Lakers are two and five you got some teams that you banked on being potential playoff teams in the west or below the men does align a five hundred mark\nA Minnesota three and four that's even after beating the Lakers last night Oklahoma City got their second when or the year tonight they were one of four there now too and or and the Lakers are two and five the rockets or one in five\nYou think for us not picking winners this week you may not taking a chance to Oh yes he is so all these off the air this week go check out Burrell on the bench dot com or check out his podcast or check out the pod cast which is around on the bats\nWhether it's the website or the ... the the way to make sure you get your bill of morale and your fill of winners both will be updated all week long daily through his return to the network which comes down next week hit me up right near right now no waiting eight five five to a two for two to seven\nAdjusted for Michigan's up on CBS portray adjust\nAnd Matt how's it going I'm good I just want to say you know lines organization used the wrong really bad but last three years since Bob Clinton was a guy in there is completely turned around with the trade that they've made more towards the future is in the past like next ...\nSigned for the next two years after this goal they watch science team from the ill so that's like a stray away after Ron drastic form was great I thought so science for the future and you know not now\nOkay year they turned it around I did did I miss their playoff wearing over the last couple of years did\nOh no you're not I'm not saying that I'm Out there and I made the playoffs playoffs why are not that I'm saying that they're in the right\nMotion forward and started writing game five Matthew Stafford they're starting to build a halfway decent sense the right way for a traffic so they can sign people in the future now they've signed failing Wagner Ryan game they've started you know three to see players can I Do have capital\nNow that science he failing Wagner ... Ryan game they decide you know three to see players can they do have kept from making these moves\nOkay um do you are a little more\n... nine and seven to me doesn't get me excited uh granted they add the uh one good year a couple of years ago and they went eleven imply that into the wild card um Cleveland when was the last time ...\nNineteen Ninety One was the last time they won a a postseason games um one two three four five six seven eight nine wildcard losses interrupt\nSince Nineteen Ninety One or that's not all that many plant appearances over that long a period of time I'm twenty seven years nine but once every three years and it's not great and to lose every time you get in\nUh the people just crush or Louis the coach of the bangles because he always gets in the playoffs and loses in the first round but at least to get more often than not the lions don't even do that\nAnd nine and seven the last couple of years seven and nine year before that three and four this year I Will save my Patricia the guy I as even though I don't think the lions are above five hundred team I think there'll be a native best\nA and not because of the trades that they made this past week not to snacks Harrison is going to lift them that I not losing golden Tate is going to drop them that far I just think there were an okay squad that's all that they are\nWill save map Patricia after you are one can take a big step up here too because when you take over a new program is going to take some time to implement your system your coaches your players\nDrafts and to get the kind of guys that he wants all while I'm not burying the lions going forward that they they have no chance to ah even ever win a division and whatnot division in forever though I'm good or a B the guy\nPatricia maybe\nI got to see it though when it happens I give him credit for it but I won't predict that at a time and I'm not going to say just because they hired him they now turned the corner\nI Know I was in New England as their defensive coordinator doesn't always a way that that means you've got to be a good head coach very much proven territory for the lion's Adam from Michigan gonna either agree or disagree with me here which is that Adam\nI'm here to disagree joining okay um I feel like gold or ah with gold and paid leave and it's going to open up targets for kinda golladay kinda kinda gal today showing that he's he's a free physically you got to see what they can do and go pay clearly was sending a long trip deal\nSo it's more of a building to the future like Justin it just sat in the previous call but\nI just feel like they're moving in the right direction and I agree with you to the point where you said it's not going to make or break a either way with snacks deal and whatnot\nBut they were this last game this week here against a Seattle they were a three point O. yards against Russia with snacks on the line up almost six with him not right on the field so it's more of a bill in the future golden was gone after this year a snack here for another two or three years\nHave you write about golladay if he takes a a bigger step forward because you're right he just going to get more targets not that they haven't targeted him plenty already he's he's played well and uh as the ball told him forty four times it's not like he's he's been a riveted to the bench because\nThey've got a Jones in a a Tate in front of them they run three wide receiver sets most of the time um I didn't carry on Johnson is the the biggest addition that they've made during his off season to help their ... or they could have their first running game since a guy like sent a name Sanders [noise] um but I\nI still just made me a Stafford maybe he's a stat scanner for me the number is always look good at the end of ... but just doesn't win or not he doesn't make the huge clutch plays he's one\nOf the higher paid quarterbacks and the national football league and he's never re top ten quarterback in my book these borderline top half in the league which is sixteen um he's probably top sixteen I I shouldn't a overstate how\nA skeptical I Am about a Mr Stafford but it's not a top ten quarterback\nAnd they're going to have to run the ball John's is going to have to be that good a and you're gonna have to be right about the golladay kid he's going to have to step up even bigger\nCourse Virginia is up on CBS portray Chris\nHow you do the same doing well you\nAll right hey I'm hurt a lot of talk about the Yankees going after ... in the day I heard a river that socks might be in the mix I wanted to get your take on that and then I'm lying up at ...\nSocks for a holiday or as a vice Harper Pearl Harbor no way\nThat they they were already good and the yeah they got three outfielders and oh by the way they got their deeds designated hitter so what else are we gonna play first base I Know they used\nTo Harper at first base from time to time did Washington they here and at least one person told me that there was Harper and going to the manager and rather than a manager going Harper and say and demos hurt so ah there were a little short at first base and he said oh I'll go in and play first base if you want\nA I thought that it was a well timed decision by am same thing is Machado saying he wanted to play short stop 'em Machado was a little bit more um let me pick the right word here of noxious about it I Am a shortstop I don't want to play third base anymore\nI got it as to why he wanted to do it my line of thought was he just wants to be themself that many more options when he gets a free agency\n... shortstop Slayer started basements third baseman slave shortstop they'd just brings that many more teams in because there might be a team that's got a really good shortstop needs a third baseman alright well but ... there's a team that's got a really good third baseman Juan Machado complete short and we're going to make the ah two\nAnd fifty million dollar investment uh we got a hold of shortstop let's talk about many Machado so I I understood where he was coming from he was a lot more forceful saying I Am with shortstop\nI Am really interested to see if there's a team that's willing to make him a the kind of offered that he's looking for but um yeah but no matter whether you tell us your shortstop not we're telling you your third baseman you want are two hundred and fifty million dollars you're going to play third base um Harper play him first base I guess could happen\nI don't think he'd even warm to the idea but again it might come down just to where he wants to land now there was a story last week on CBS Sports a dot com that they they\n... served a quote from Scott bars his agent from may Michael ... pay the voice of the Yankees are on the YES Network he also does a talk show on the YES Network you got\nFrom Scott bars his agent from may Michael ... pay the voice of the Yankees\nAre on the YES Network he also does a talk show on the YES Network you got bar assigned as a guest and bar I said well we already know where we're going to a deal done\nA book Bryce wants to tell you in person on the deal can't be done they only deal it could be done was if he could be re signed by the national he's not a free agent yet\nYou got to wait a week after the end of the world series and it just ended and this was from all over the weekend so yeah Boris was just calling Michel case Jane that's all it that was I don't know where Bryce Harper is going to go I don't know where many Machado is going to go\nI Will tell you the the Phillies will be significant bidders\nOn boat I don't think they've got the money to get both they've got a lot of salary flexibility that got a lot of young guys on a team they don't

college football world picks Tuesday because there is no competition from the NFL and even on\nTuesday where the train deadline was taking place or the dust has settled by the time the standings were unveiled and so they do college football knows to avoid the behemoth\nThat is the NFL and not get into a fire hydrant contest with the NFL because college football would lose so Rob ... lens is the new committee chair and of course he was asked about putting Alabama a number one\nThey do have a goatee when over ... now but it's just strictly on numbers\nTheir strength of schedule is is not you know your similar to a Clemson or LSU Britain for instance however again we watch the games and when you watch Alabama and you see the efficiency of that often you see the quality that deep and um you know\nThey're pretty well rounded team and so you know watching those games make a difference in when you get into that discussion or you know it was clear that we thought Alabama was number one\nSo that the Rob Mullins committee chair about the Crimson Tide Clemson has been dominant and\nThere's no doubt that Clemson should be number two maybe a little question about why LSU is three with a loss

on paper until\nWe get through talking about Syria sports hair\nIt's after hours where they knew Lawrence on CBS orange radio eight five five to one to four to seven that's our phone number\n... chicken with Iran shall we say are the only time defeated team any NFL and they've got one heck of a stretch that were really test their mettle\nAnd they were not boring at the train deadline either they went out and they added another piece for that wage Phillips de patch where it's headed to welcome Joe currently from the Ventura County star joining us from the Los Angeles area covers the rams\nJoe thanks for a couple of minutes the big move of course is acquiring jaguars ... Dante Fowler what's been the reaction to that so far\nWell you know it's interesting they obviously the rams head of a huge off season and you know they've had a huge beginning of this you know the first half of the season going and you know and you know that people talk about winning the off season and you know winning the first half of the uh\nUm you know the regular season but it looks like the rams to have one trade deadline day as well because they you know certainly have been um [noise]\nYou know that that are probably linebacker edge I'm kind of pass rushing spot has been kind of the week spot of of this defense I'm underweight Philips this year I'm you know they have a lot of young\nA talent to a lot of a young guys that they tried to throw at that position and and you know overall it's been okay um [noise] but certainly it's a position where they can improve upon it was really interesting how on um Monday Sherman they came out at his weekly pressure\nSaid um you know basically was honest and said yes that's a position that we'd like to improve on and uh we think we've got something that that may work out and you know reportedly today that a bit of a bunch of other teams\nUm for the players so obviously they liked the player it's a um you know it's an expiring assets um that they gave up a third and a a future fit for\n'em they got uh some of that ammo or to give up because of some of the players they've lost and free agency have lined up some contacts in the future so\nMaybe it doesn't hurt their future draft a situation as much as maybe some other teams up you know in a year in which the rams I've gone all in um you know trying to um put together the best team in the NFL and uh it's looked good the first half of the year\nI'm you know certainly they continue that on into the middle of the year so I don't I don't think rams fans can\nBe upset for a you know with with anything that the teen has done over the last\nTwelve to Eighteen months it's all coming up good\nRight now the rams lead the NFL intense action they add another former first round picking Dante foul over spending a few minutes post trade deadline with Joe currently at the Ventura County star with us here after hours on CBS Sports radio\nOr the the last couple of weeks because of the injuries there have been some questions about the secondary I how how are they evaluating that area that even tobacco right now\nYeah I mean that was one of the um positions they were kind of revert to to be interested in improving but you know when they were in in the offseason going into this you know with all the moves I made bringing in markets Petersburg you're going to keep to leave I really thought you know they maybe didn't have the best secondary in the NFL maybe that's Jacksonville but they\nYou know I thought they really had one of the deepest um secondaries a tray hill with somebody that that really played well for them down the stretch last year so adept peace and bringing in Sam Shields was a ... and under rated um peace um [noise]\nYou know uh the the safety so I've been really strong look is joining or and and John Johnson um you know really the the problem had been that charters game where they last for\nA former all pro quarterbacks markets Peters and the key to leave her in that game a Peters I'm really you know I don't know if it's the injury just hasn't looked the same\nSince he came back the next week against the Vikings and and played an and didn't look right but you know it was a calf poll um you\nKnow you wonder how you could play you know if it hadn't healed um but certainly he's been out there and you know has it been as is his plane making self them at the big losses been to leave I mean they they're really misses leadership and Mrs\nKnow stabilizing um nature about him but the um [noise] um you know the the other guy said you know trade has been up and down but you know he he had his first NFL under section two weeks ago against the niners I'm you know he seems to have kind of you know I'm you know one break down again but besides that he's he's\nReally been kind of a good piece for them sand shields went healthy has been um you know quite good and and you know I think the ... uh is one of the better slot corners\nThe leagues so you know it's a position where they could improve uh simply because they've had so many injuries there um [noise] but I think the only reason they would really need somebody if they made a booth today and that would signal that uh keep the baby was further from coming back further and as you know maybe not coming back at all\nHow much fun with the game between the Packers and the rams\nIt was something I mean I'm you know there's been a lot kind of reporters and said about you know how many Green Bay fans were there but I think that really you know I'm you know the fifty fifty nature of the fan bases\nWhat kind of reporter than side about you know how many Green Bay fans were there but I think that really you know I'm you know the fifty fifty nature of the fan bases I think really made it um\nYou know like a college like atmosphere really gave it I I think an intensity that you know a lot of regular season NFL games really lack 'em ... it was fun and memorable and and you know I think the thing that I've said repeatedly is that um you know a lot of people kind of chalked it up to you know Wisconsin nights traveling and\nYou know or or maybe vacationing in Los Angeles and those are people that don't know understand Southern California I mean\nI'm you know this is a a a a place that did not have a an NFL team for Twenty years that generation of fans were free to pick 'em you know any fan base that they wanted to associate with and in that time you know the national teams like the Steelers the patriots\nAnd especially the Packers um you know became Los Angeles teams I went on a with a radio station in Green Bay and I said hey you you're going to be surprised how many\nUh how much green and gold is is there and and um you know certainly ... the guy even surprised me\nA maybe a you know maybe more than than I expected but you know I think it really you know those were Angelenos and that's kind of it it really underscores you know the long term nature of this move in LA I you know the ramps have done everything right they put the best product you could possibly put on the field\nUm [noise] you know they have they sign stars you know keep you know people that ... you know\nPlay the type of players that people want to pay to see 'em but it's still going to take time they're going to have to do this over a long period of time um you know to really kind of um heal the wounds of you know\nAre these teams leaving this market share you know decades ago and um and it just shows you how you know the chargers that look at the situation the chargers and the the rams have done everything right um and they're still dealing with it the chargers you know maybe haven't done things as of right and uh\nAnd they're even tougher situation\nHow much have you noticed an added ... for the rams not only with the play offs thought the devil figure wins last year but as you mentioned then adding stars and and pieces in names that are fans might know how much is that contributed to an extra excitement not to mention they've started out eight now\nIt's it's consistent I'm you know a ... it's been a consistent build I um [noise] you know when they moved here um I don't think I had seen or grams game live on TV\nIn years I mean they had been really kind of invisible in St Louis on on kind of a national scale and you know ever since they came here especially the last two years under McCray I'm you know you go out and the community and there's you know you notice you know that there's more and more rams gear\n'em you know people are talking about the rams people are starting to\n'em and I think it's moving the needle not just in those you know hard core die hard\nGet all your opening information that could save you thousands of dollars a year or a month depending\nOn how much you owe direct the more you over the more you can save all you

sounds like a fresh start might be good for him as well it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio\nMy column for this week I couldn't help it\nWould sucked in I had to share my thoughts about the latest round of changes in Cleveland\nAnd as I mentioned to my tweet and my Facebook post when I put the link up for the article this actually isn't my first column about changes in Cleveland I remember writing a column not quite the same\nBut I think it was after huge Jackson's first year and people were calling for his head of course the only one the one game thankfully they did otherwise I Would have had to come to work in a Johnny Manziel Jersey they only won one game\nAnd they were people calling for him to get fired and I wrote a column about it and said no absolutely not they're not as talented they don't have the pieces in place it doesn't all fall on the coach how do you ever expect to build a winning culture if like a game of Django you keep pulling out the peace is at the bottom\nIt just keeps crumbling\n\nAnd so here I Am writing now after the firing of not just to Jackson but taught Haley and\nSome some numbers of course but this is more about workplace culture it's more about human beings and as I was writing it dawned on me to when we do when we expect unpleasant and negative and bad things that happened when we expect\nThat there\nThat are last was said could be the one that gets us fired it if we're constantly worrying about our job security\nWe breed ourselves for what we believe is inevitable in psychological world psychiatric world it's called self fulfilling prophecy you start to act as though that thing is going to happen that you fear the most that you dread the most\nIf you want to use a relationship context\nYou expect that someone's going to break up with you where do you think the end of your relationship is coming you start to like it you start to brace yourself for that you start to treat the other person as though he or she had already broken up with you and the end has already been announced well that's similar to what's going on in Cleveland\nIt's pretty much accepted that everybody there is temporary\n\nNobody wants down roots nobody builds the foundation because to me is roughly the amount of time that you're given\n[noise] and then the numbers are sounding not just the number of coaches at that made you know last night show\nOr is counting not just the number of coaches as I mentioned on\nLast night show ten\nHad coaches if you include Gregg Williams who is now listed on multiple websites at the Cleveland Browns head coach\nSo he's the tent in Twenty years but that triple that trickle down effect excuse me it's evidence among the players as well how many\nAthletes at any position go to Cleveland never leave how many football players spent their entire careers with brown\nI can think of one in in recent history since Nineteen Ninety I and I show Thomas\nAnd he is the aberration I Love and he's so proud of his tenure in Cleveland I Love that he had chances to leave and he didn't he's a future hall of famer\nAnd he never lined up anywhere else but do you know what he also never lined up in the postseason ever he never took a snap in the playoffs and eleven years not even when they were ten and sex and that's sad\nOh Ron ... you wouldn't know it from the

radio network so your choice for touchdown Tuesday pile on the Broncos Tuesday a five to one to four to seven and a five to one to four to seven adopting Greg who's in Houston Welcome to after our CBS Sports radio\nShow me thinking about what you said\nTo forward to to seven us up to ... who's in Houston Welcome to after our CBS Sports radio\nThing for me I Love listening to show 'em and I was thinking about what you said about the Cleveland Browns and a married yet committed I think you're right about the continuity factor and I think one of the other problems that they've had\nWith the team is here there is still bringing in the town I think the best move they could have made which really to bring John Dorsey in this year\nIn Seattle he'll do this this draft as well as twenty ninth team because I think there's too many pieces whoever you're bringing his ex coach if you decided to bring somebody else and you can give them the ability to them\nAnd what you already have put pieces that are giving enhanced what you've got to think if they knew they may feel even more time to develop in or get a good quarterbacks coach quarter there he can really really be impressive he's already\nShows flashes ... are we so he was at Oklahoma and I think I could get better over time is to shift the focus on the plan that they have\nWhich is why now that that yeah that's the thing I mean I think maybe one of the things that you endorse seem to want to do early on was just accumulate picks are\nEither trying to build the for this and I think that's one of the areas that they got from look better at it if you had a good pass rush but they don't have that\nExtra player that you can look and say okay here's the guy that we have to just be ready for besides my over here and they just have to continue to pay it with the hair and the ownership is to be willing to say this is what our plan is going to be and they have to be transparent with that plan and stick with it\nI Will say best about has I'm Glad\nHe didn't include John Dorsey in his sweeping changes so I I Would agree with you about Dorsey he's been on the job less than a year and he's very well respected some of his early decisions they're already reading benefits so you talked about the the defendants young it's aggressive\nEither tops in the league and take away a rookie cornerback Denzel Ward who they selected a number four instead of Bradley job he's a huge reason why I'm also they got their fifth round pick\nWho's been upgraded linebacker ... and then if you think about the couple of free agent decisions that Dorsey made no generally you don't see top flight upper echelon free agents land in Cleveland for a lot of reasons\nBut Jarvis Landry he's leading receiver and Carlos Hyde is they're leading Russia and and I do like the fact that he's found ways to plug holes both long term and short term\nAnd and obviously Baker Mayfield the reason why they went ahead and made this change has long said that but to fire Jackson and Haley sends a message that we do not want any more damage done to are are facing the franchise and the guy they believe is it's a future for them\nAnd and I think with the Broncos and the Texas trade yesterday I don't know if John always writing off this year\nBut I think can just see some things and whether we get to see them against Kansas City in sunny here in Houston and one of the biggest problem they turn over falter which really haven't had any consistency with case kind of a quarterback because\nThe difference I think between this year and last year she rarely ever return the ball over when he was with the Vikings and this year he's making the kind of drove plays visitors from Boulder interceptions it you know it's cost them games that were the other reasons\nYou got to just make some some decisions about what you want to do if you're John Elway and how do you want to put him in a position that they can be competitive for the rest of the season and then the next year\nYeah I think part of it was what could they get for him and getting a fourth round pick an exchange from was also big um yeah it's as much as dumb areas Thomas is the guy that's been there forever and he's he's one of the most recognized a Broncos in that community you're right about the opposite is not just that the turnovers it's also the penalties they've been at a big of a big mess\nDo they do like there are two rookie running backs that's been huge for them\nOr they feel like the friends of mine is getting better um I don't know that he's throwing in the towel as much as he's recognizing that there are likely even if they would make the playoffs which would take quite an incredible run they're not a Super Bowl contender so why not get something in return I especially when you consider that you know the guys who's contracts are coming out who didn't have to pay for some Greg\nI Hope that he works out in Houston because I Would love to see D.

and you know less\nGoing to put straight to my rear end because it's smaller than the regular regulation size [laughter] um but I mean it all depends on your willpower so yes the fund sides are in the

gold so little her she's gold\nCandy bars are great I had a bag of those are my candy dish for what quite a while so those are probably right up there with the white chocolate but definitely Allman

which is is grown too recently but major league baseball's\n... or ... deadline has always been the one that got the most headlines that people got really excited about now the NFL maybe deciding it was a jealous about all that mid season attention for major league baseball\nNow the NFL has has moved its trade deadline later in the season which means teams are more inclined to either part with or acquire players\n\nAnd so we've got major names changing uniforms in changing teams right in the middle of the season so some of the big names that moved just before the deadline\nAlso I mentioned this earlier but it made me laugh out loud Mary Kay Cabot who covers the brown for Cleveland dot com tweeted just after four o'clock Cleveland time just after four o'clock eastern\nThat the ... had made no moves in advance of the deadline didn't treat me one but they definitely made some moves in the last forty eight hours or I'd trade moves the rams who already leave the NFL with tens\nSacks they trade for Dante Fowler who is the edge Rauscher service\nTo the outside linebacker and that three four but at times weighed Philips will use a for three or use for lineman so he can more if he can go back and forth\nJacksonville did not pick up the fifth year option on his rookie contract so he will become a free agent barring some type of an agreement with the rams but they asked him to the mix a group that's already got Aaron Donald ... can sue a group it's already got multiple first round draft picks\nOn the front line of defense\nAnd so the rams get Dante Fowler big deal for them there'd been some talk that they might add to their defensive backs field\nBut instead they go with valor\nSo this is interesting both for the rams who are eight no butter going into a critical stretch and their schedule\nWe had the chance to speak with Iran's insider Joe curly from LA the Ventura County star and our first hour he joined us and and we talked about the trade and about how Fowler might fit in but also the buzz around the rams as a team that\nIs the only undefeated but also plays in a market where you know you have to win to get any attention and we talked about the Packers fans that were there at the coliseum for that game on Sunday but we also looked ahead to this stretching the schedule\nIs crazy they just lay the Packers in one by two but coming up I Know a

college football world and the the big five conferences and the playoff Khamenei they want to be top of mind they wanted to generate some debate each until they released these rank and\nThe only ones that matter\nAre done at the end wants all the conference championships\nAnd all this the season schedules had been wrapped up [noise]\nBut they're fun to look at\nAny surprises you can see you can find me on Twitter Ala radio\nAlabama number one\nClemson number to\nNumber three despite a lot and that Notre Dame at number four with that perfect record the first two teams all the outside looking in er Michigan five Georgia sex and then also noteworthy\nSo what about the new committee chair his name is Rob Mullins here from the University of Oregon so he takes over for Kirby whoa cut they have kind of this revolving system they don't change the entire committee all at once but they straddle the number of new members that are brought in and there's no transition to share for the college football selection committee we\nAdded six outstanding new members as you know that the Thirteen member committee but uh the beauty of these new members as they were fully prepared or they understood all the tools that were available them and they jumped right in they ... they were fully engaged and the beauty of this process you use that it is the human element when you have\nThirteen you know broad backgrounds diverse experiences and to be able to come into a room in debate something\nOr is extremely important and those different perspective you know they came in are ready to go they they jumped in um outstanding new members in really embrace the process an added a lot\nThat to me is so important because\nAs human beings we all come in with our own background her own preconceived notions it's not that we're biased because I as a professional can leave my rooting interest outside the radio studio but we think at process and see things differently\nAnd so it's important to have a bunch of committee members from all over the country from different conferences from different backgrounds who represent a variety a wide variety of ideas about which factors should be most important when you're choosing the top four teams at the end of the regular season it's after hours\nWith Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio not so much debate about Alabama at number one is that where they said who knows if they'll stay there but Rob Mullins it kind of gives you the case if you need it they do\nHave a goatee went over Texas day now but it just strictly on numbers\nTheir strength of schedule is is not now you're similar to a Clemson or LSU ... for instance however again we watch the game and when you watch Alabama and use the the efficiency of that often you see the quality that deep and um you know\nThere are pretty well rounded team and so you know watching those games make a difference in when you get into that discussion or you know it was clear that we thought Alabama was number one\nIt's good to know they watch the games in case you're wondering and I'm being somewhat tongue in cheek tongue in cheek but do you remember the old polls and actually some of the the current pulls a lot of times they're done by coaches or by more than ... directors by people who don't have time\nTo sit and watch all the games 'cause they're busy with our own college football program but it is required of the committee you have to watch the game not just\nHi nice to sit and watch all the games 'cause they're busy with our own college football program but it is required of the committee\nYou have to watch the game not just the ones that you're interested in not just the ones in your own conferences but the ones that will impact the rankings which generally there is a full slate of games every weekend that will play a major role in and we'll have a you know some kind of a determining factor by the way\nThis is kind of like a college football version of the Texans and the Broncos meeting right after they make a trade for various Thomas any swapped uniforms how 'bout right after the first set of college football rankings come out\nNumber one Alabama will be on the road at number three LSU so Death Valley here comes the circus that's the CBS game coming up on Saturday Night under the lights\n... by the way answering questions on the college football playoff Facebook page I'll just\nBe the first to admit I did not know that the college football playoff had\nA Facebook page but go to no doubt moving forward finally one about central Florida UCS at number twelve you know the self proclaimed reigning national champions its historic\nFor them to store where they are at number twelve why that position and and what about moving forward there's a\nLot of discussion and debate um you know 'cause they don't have a a good strength of schedule in fact when you look at where you started putting up resumes ah UCF was the only team in the country\nWho had not played a team with a winning record through week nine however you take that one piece of information but you also watch them and you know they haven't experienced quarterback\nOr a quality off and\nUm and you put all those pieces together and you saw we rank twelve that means they were really in the discussion on the border between ten and Thirteen so we matched those resumes up you know apply what we see on the game versus the ... um and and the committee felt they were the best team in the country this week\nSo it's really about somewhere between ten and Thirteen and and they agreed on that and then the debate ensues about where should they actually be slot and remember it's not happening in a vacuum there are other teams that are in that same category that that same level that I have to be considered as well and you're talking about trying to get Thirteen people\nOn the same page that's not easy if you know anything about the United states of America and in two thousand

I. B. acts in little balls New York Tom\nSo Jake center to take a powered who wrote that phrase and the amendment\nIs quoted as saying this will not of course include person born in the United states who are foreigners that's a pretty clear a explanation that people who are foreigners have their children born here should not well have citizenship\nTom so you're just tobacco track little because I'm not a constitutional attorney or historian so you're saying when the fourteenth amendment was written a the author of that amendment was ratified a said that it did not include foreigners\nThat tried the exact quotation I have is this will not of course\nInclude person born in the United states who are foreigners and I got from a website called [noise] Colorado alliance for immigration reform they've got all kinds of quotations an example of and\nHow people all of a sudden just started ignoring not praise\nTom thank you really you really helping the show and now the update you the president just tweeted this so called birthright citizenship which costs to our country billions of dollars in very unfair our citizens will be ended one way or another it is not covered by the fourteenth amendment because of the word subject to the jurisdiction there of\nSo each ... each party's is getting forty five point eight percent of the ballots so far what's important is this is a one point six point improvement for Republicans in a three point six point decline for Democrats over where they were in twenty six tape\nWhich means that that's a five point two percent swing towards Republicans now Democrats won Nevada in twenty six team about two and a half or less than two and a half\nPoints so if the swing and early voting is five forty two percent towards Republicans that shows that the Republicans could wipe out the Democratic advantage and wind narrowly the Senate and governor's races if this keeps up\nWhat do you think the president can do with these eleven appearances in six days\nWell ... ... ... yeah yeah he could do a lot of good and you can do not so much good it really depends on how he handles himself\nIn what he says I'm look the president was at a high point last week\nAnd then the uh the I eat these being sent to Democrats\nAnd then there was this anti Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh or hurt the president's ratings because of the way that he responded or he said the right things at times\nAnd he said some things that rubbed people raw and I can see it in the data it's affecting people around the country this is an election is going to be over so very close and because of that if the president says something\nGood and handles himself well and and keeps it puts his numbers back up to where they were like Tuesday\nOr Wednesday of last week that Republicans are going to do better than if they stay where they are because there has been a slight diminution other presidents standing largely because of his responses to these events\n... help was his response to the other day right so he's response is one thing I\nDo a scripted and they were fine but when he started when he looked at the television and I know George Bush really never did when he moved to cable news and so I was being ripped in blamed he went back at him\nDo you think he was being um do you think it was he was being fairly treated windows IDs or whatever you want to call them went to his enemies by that deranged character living in a band in Florida do you think he was being a a\nAdequately characterized\nOh no no I think it was being unfairly characterized the question is how to respond\nYou respond by taking it to buy for going after your critics or do you rise above it\nAnd cause people to say well you know what I hear what I hear what Schumer and Pelosi you're saying but I see what the president is saying when he goes on television and I I hear what the critics on CNN and MSNBC and other places have their say blaming him about it but he seems to be focused on consoling\nThe victims and setting the right tone so it's the contrast that people arrive in their own minds rather than necessarily\nHe what he has to say look people you know he's the president when he punches down at the media he is he is the most powerful person in the world and he is picking an argument with ... with somebody who has a lousy ratings on cable TV so\nI Would much rather have him be the person that we saw at that rally in Wisconsin who spoke so eloquently about what was going on the the president who called for unity\nThe man who raised the tone I'd rather see that and I think the persuadable voters voters who are up for grabs in this very close election they want to see that person rather than the\nGuy who's taken a slug as somebody who's mouthed off on some panel on on a cable TV show\nBut the list of targets was right on Trump's relentless rhetorical playbook the bombers enemies where his enemies he has said so again and again and again\nEveryone should stop pretending mid term doesn't really know what he's doing\nUm that when he when he says the things he knows exactly what he's trying to encourage\nDonald Trump failed the country he doesn't just failed Democrats he felt Democrats and Republicans and all of them all Americans in between\nHe refused to in any way acknowledge what role in rhetoric may have played in cultivating the current political climate has an obligation to stop\nHating on reporter the president has created Colts are\nFor violent rhetoric and an actual violent\nAnd this isn't a boy Ghana point I've been watching some of it there was for people for all have the same view he's horrific responsible and he basically everything's have pulled the trigger\nYeah the let's let's let's look at a thought experiment here let's turn the clock back a year and let's substitute the word Bernie Sanders or the Democratic resistance or Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer for ... and have those people say the same things about the Bernie Sanders supporter who shows up at the Republican\nCongressional baseball practice with weapons and bullets\nAnd list in his pocket and kill and almost killed ... and if it were not for the accidental presence of to a Capitol Hill police who who are companies ... as a member of the leadership\nWe could have seen a dozen or more Republican legislators are assassinated and ... and could any one of those people did any one of those people say Bernie Sanders or Nancy Pelosi or the resistance or Tom star in with their hateful language about the president and then you know it Clapper call it was a Clapper or somebody else\nRented gives him a treason Brennan what what did anybody step forward out of that group and say this is this is inciting people to violence and they're responsible for further Bernie Sanders supporters showing up and trying to kill Republican members of Congress plays for God's sake put our country first stop this\nI agree I I was done by the president got just as bad to be better if you had to do that if someone like you actually do that exactly especially somebody that's\nNot all lean on him but somebody who's calling balls and strikes like you to be honest so called a couple of things I just want to go over some major regions it surprised me first off why is Mia Love struggling in a in Utah\nWell first of all this is the most democratic district in the state it includes the city of Salt Lake people think of Utah\nAs a conservative state in it is but the city of Salt Lake I grew up part of my childhood in Utah

I actually filed a claim on the Sharon's claim on some beans and my insurance agents should certainly wasn't the only one he was hearing problem and it also has a corn claims starting to come in and just done fields and we're just too what\nYeah yeah and it's not just uh some last bushels out there I mean you can make some claims based on quality as well and the doctors that guys are facing out there because there has been some damage to both corn and soybeans no question about it there and ... up there in uh south east South Dakota Darren\nHow are you today\nThat means no question about it they're ending up there in uh south east South Dakota Darren how are you today\nDoing real fine or you went through some of the same issues that Chad went through with ... with the fears harvested near\nYes it's been a\nIt's been extremely wet um we're usually a little drier than probably northeast I or I were to begin with but ah [noise] you know when the ten twelve inches of rain and September alone and five inches of snow\nAnd so a lot of beans are still in the field and as as well as corn and I think er\nI think the big challenge is going to be we're going to get the crop out it's a good crop but the way we're cutting up these fields or the mixture is really going to put a citizen of interest far as getting some decent a planning conditions\nYeah Chad you are one of the reasons that are decided to call this rut season for more reasons than one I'm sure you guys have been cut and some things up up in northeast Iowa to average you\nKnow just a mentally I battled the last few of the beans or get stuck with ... to ... the new to this distributed you\nKnow yeah and and dealing with those issues you know we always we always think about the sins of the spring showing up in the fall but the sense of the fall can show up in the spring too so it's it's going to take a lot of work to get things\nSquared away for a for for twenty Nineteen planting season no question about it let's bring in an Burke colder from Nebraska and it has been a long time since we've talked our area\nI'm doing great good to be on the show again\nGood good good hey how things holding up out your way into feed yards\nWell we we've been wet now um for about twelve months\nOr so you know we we've rain is obviously a blessing um 'cause you can't grow anything without it ah but but it it has been has continued to be where we had a cold wet winter\nUm continue to pretty much have a wet spring got a little bit of a break from it in parts of the time this summer to get things kind of cleaned up ... conditions look All right but um we've had had plenty of moisture here late summer to tax that kind of laughed\nMy husband got nervous and was trying to decide when he should ah he does a little bit of fall planting and alfalfa um just to kind of diversify and and he was all worried if he didn't get it in the ground a oh I suppose that couple months ago in August that they would just stopped raining and um I guess I'm pleased to report\nThat did not happen and he's gotten a staff of new crop alfalfa coming out because it has ... has had plenty to drink so yeah yeah no doubt about it how is your crops turned out there and\nYou know we are running alfalfa three that the hydration plant for the last day to day um so we're we're getting to the end of alfalfa season pretty much got for cutting off of everything\nUm struggled with them lead this year I'm not that we had a strange spraying um steak you know it just was conducive for for wheat growing so I had to fight through some of that quality issue partway through the summer but\nI'm the last last couple of cutting have been have been really pretty nice so we're we're just getting that wrapped up beans or out\nUm and on Seventy eighty\nI'm for yield so pretty pleased with that we kind of have a a combination of of organic and traditional crops on a farm corn is coming out\nUm you know our our traditional corn is around and to sixty to two eighty for bushels\nWe're not getting quite that off of our organic um but where you know we're still seeing and the two hundred range so I Would say that it's been a good year for crops hopefully we can we can hold the weather pattern here for another couple of weeks and and finished getting stuff out\nYeah wow to under Bush will organic corn there and she's doing something right down there [laughter] you know she\n[noise] that sounds pretty good\nSales I don't have good yeah I saw\nIt was a good year this year we we had and you know we were kind of a conflict it house because it's not real good for our feed yards\nAnd when when things are really wet and makes her difficult conditions to to maintain pans and that sort of thing\nUm and you know obviously we're running hey all the time to massive cuts alfalfa you know pretty much twenty four seven all summer and so you kind of hate for having lots of rain than to wreak havoc with your quality um but boy it's made a nice real crop farming year yeah um and we've got good deals there some\nYeah good good good you know Chad and said something about ah dealing with weeds in in uh the alfalfa\nWere always dealing with we sat down and wrote crop production especially and soybeans\nBut guys it didn't seem nearly as as dirty in twenty eight teen as it as it has in the past few years there and what a guys what do you think guys did differently to kind of clean these beans up\nA an old song we we finally had to spring we got the pre down yeah we are perfect creams or to help pull that it probably made a big difference we planted extend beans or shear search June Marines and then it kept ringing we actually couldn't even spray\nOf the camera because they get too late according to label and so you know we did we didn't get to use that but the beams did stay clean it so I'm not quite sure why other than the ... really held this year\nYeah ... is that it was\nOnly agree with that we're getting the the good guys or understanding the glyphosate alone is going to do the trick to read the new super chemistries and you saw that around here too\nYeah yo chat up in northeast Iowa I Can't believe I I I mean as soon as corn was out as soon as soybeans were out there were a pile of drills out plans cover crops this fall\nYou know if I've seen a more drills running up and down the road as and yet they're twins joined in September and do\nWhat we turned on our farm where we have a cover crop suing the being grown are going to be in ... we can reduce or eliminate the herbicide parents and then it really takes care of the water issue\nYeah yeah so what are you got to do on these routes that you've got to I don't want to come back to that for a second I mean is there is quite a bit of work that needs to be done get fields fit for next year what what what are you looking at doing\nWhen we're going to have to come back out there and I've tried to get away from some deeper tillage but we're going to do some due diligence those areas and we're just neat things and it's just a little more experience to where you at ... ...\nYeah yeah Darren ... you're doing anything special you got any big plans for that\nKnow our issue right now is we're in Europe it's we still have standing water there ... murders in these low spots and so we won't do anything a\nLot of these fields the only reason they're getting the mouse trap combines I mean it is just literally or water table is on top two grown great on our farm I mean are from the artist\nThese fields the only reason they're getting the mouse trap combines I mean it is just literally or water table is on top the ground right on our farm I mean our farmyard is standing water and that is the water table you know there's\nThis time of year goes down small start up or down and also it's just a sort of those things it's hard to deal with [noise]\nMy gosh the water table is on top of the ground up there that is so hard to believe I'm going to be up that way this week and\nA half to take a look at what uh I'm I'm sure that the pothole the prairie potholes are back all throughout South Dakota this year okay we've got a farmer for going today and Burr colder from Nebraska Darren ... from South Dakota ... from Iowa\nWe got a short things up we'll find out what they're thinking is most important\nThe money the summer\nMonths just on\nMy section on more and more will make it look real green one of these new\nYeah and I think from what I've seen in northeastern everyone here is a little bit too with the ... be numbers dramatic come down\nWhich would be used to feel do we need to be able to get a ... I'm living on the ground are sitting in ... who\nUm corn little leaps and there is a religion that especially in Northern Ireland when we lost one of the nitrogen impacting knew that there is some surprises there are good you were in the union leader new\nYeah speaking of next week and surprises Chad the state of Iowa has gone through a bit of a turmoil here\nIn the last so forty eight Seventy two hours with our representative over in the northwest part of the state or do you think it changes much before election day in the state of Iowa\nType thing for that particular race a representative king's see that I think maybe the titans up some he probably still going to win but there's a couple of their seats a toss up should to\nCould set the direction for all the election guns in the control the most representative in the district wound and district greedy and those are kind of been you could go either way right now\nYeah yeah our our district are held by bloom in northeast Iowa that one is definitely a too tough to call right now isn't it\nOver there and I think really the moon's going to hinge around the house held their news to some very competitive races in the house that could go democratic and they go with it with the ...\nThe Democrat will win and punched him going to\nSay and what about out Nebraska is there any races that the country needs to be aware of farm country\nYou know in terms of the house of representatives were out here in districts three I'm as has actually most of the physical state if the ... ah basically we've got district three as as just west of Lincoln on Iraq across the state Adrian Smith is represented us for a long time um I guess I think\nHe's a man of integrity and character and I think he's done a good job I don't anticipate that that that's going to be going to be any sort of a race um so you know relative to add country out here in western part of state um I I don't really see any changes\nYeah yeah there and we know that there's a heck of a Senate race or just of the north it'd be up in North Dakota going on well into the northwest of years well over in Montana anything that we need to be aware of in South Dakota\nWell I think uh the way the polls look we'll maintain Republican because our soul representatives or in the U.S house um the governor's race surprisingly isn't even a\nEven a race at this point we have another democratic governor for thirty some years\nAnd our current us representative is running for governor so it it's a\nThing we saw just because we're so Republican base to said she would win easily but it's a it's a toss up at this point\nOkay All right hey let's get to one of my favorite questions before we bring in a Justin dug for the final segment here today and what is going\nGet to one of my favorite questions before we bring in a job and dug for the final segment here today and what is going on out in your area that everybody else needs to know about\nYou know you you you open that door that's kind of a dangerous\nDoors kind a like a little extra died or add things about the world\nYou know I I I think that we\nAre are in a really interesting place in our country's history and and quite honestly it scares me\nUm you know we've got rural communities that that have challenges today that we have ten years ago\nUm wait we've got a group of kids growing up in our town that that aren't coming necessarily from from solid families and um it it's bringing challenges to to our area is um [noise]\nI guess I I pray that that we as communities are going to step up and come together\nAnd then find a way to take a kind of give credit to that old adage that it takes a community to raise a child um but I I see that I Do a lot of coaching\nUm do a lot of mentoring in our town and um things are different now than they were twenty five years ago when when I moved to rural America from the city\nUm and I think that I think that it's going to take us all coming together um to to figure out how to to sustain and bring up the next generation in a way that it's going to continue to to have agriculture be viable um and and to see our community is Dr\nSam I think that that's that's really something that it's easy to lose sight of that we can talk about the market and we can talk about um you know animal welfare we can talk about lots of things relative to agriculture but at the end of the day agriculture takes people feel that our farmers and\nI think that they need to make sure that we keep on our\nRadar screen at the next generation is critically

I mentioned during the news that it was either last week or the week before that I felt like maybe there was an expiration date on on the expectations of more demand for us we win is that expiration date when we get tired of waiting for more export demand\nYou know I I think you'd go back and you take a lesson out of a year ago of all that back there and you go okay when did as things start to catch fire when did run\nYou know and we really saw the market stay week all the way ended December but once we and and we had a huge Russian crop last year you have to remember so they were export or making sales a little bit longer\nBut when we hit January market started to take off you know when you sat there and he had read that was\nTrading not too far over four dollars and by the time he got in there to or the beginning of march you were up there over five so I think the same thing can come back and play out again this year although I think are low will probably come a little bit sooner 'cause Russia with\nYeah a decent crop but a lot smaller crops gonna run out are we to sell center so I think it's probably your expiration date on Russian sales\nIs before the end of the calendar year\nIsn't going to be by the time we get to Thanksgiving and maybe maybe not\nBut I think that's generally the mental set I have somewhere along the way around Thanksgiving or a little after that business has to start coming to the U.S\nOkay All right that void that gives me something to uh send to target in on as we get into you know\nYeah go ahead and another thing and weight that I was\nDoing some work last week and putting the pieces together and and I took a look at some wheat price history it is kind of interesting when you look back at the last couple of years and the ... market every Fifteen weeks we have had a low\n... we'd doesn't tend to work with price cycles very well so I'm always real careful that has seized analogy but price cycles don't\nWork well other than seasonal allergies but right now last week was a weak fourteen and a half or are we seeing so we're in that window here where we have tended to set blows over the last couple of years from a time perspective\nThat tells me also that something's going to get ready to break here pretty quickly\nInteresting that's really interesting what does this mean\nWhen when you when you taking everything that you know about what's going on in the week mark a global domestic I keep hearing out of soft red country and you're part of the world Dale that guys were having a hard time getting ... seed a because there was so much\nSofter red going in the ground this fall are you hearing that\nThere was a lot of a predator wanting their ground this year no doubt about it but again we got to remember so pretty acres just like hard red acres you know it's been shrinking the last couple of years to so\nThis year was a natural um you know when you look we prices and especially over here because you have a lot we being slashed corn rotations in other words you double crop a lot and we being double crop really works well\nA lot of we being slashed corn rotations in other words ... and we've been double crop really works well against anything else if if the prices decent uh we got started in the eastern combo I should get out into parts of India in Indiana and Ohio which weren't too bad\nBut in the eastern crumbled Illinois in particular and south\nBeing harvest came off quick and conditions were decent so they opportunity was there to get the beans undergrad you go into the western corn belt or I should say we go into the into the western plains\nWe got an opposite story and if you look at Kansas, Oklahoma Nebraska we ... actually a little bit behind that was said to me last week by so he said you know out there it's also become a\nRotation where you have beans on here we go next to them so we planted on soybeans double and guess what being harvested has been slow yup\nYup ended up getting late ... wheat to yet so I'm\nReally question in right now you know do we really get a big bump it and we plan things out and the great plains because my calendar today for all purposes says November\nNovember ... wheat I may not\nGet a lot of growth especially when you look at the long range forecast that got cold again that uh yup\nYup yup no question about it no question hey let's wrap up the conversation with on on week with this how much of an influence getting we've market have on corn and soybeans going forward\nSoybeans not a whole lot other than\nYour you know you have a psychological dragged everybody corn and it's really important because you still gets up\nThen that that you look at it as far as speed interchange ability of the price differential at this point out that it really isn't a big deal but if the market can get some legs underneath it and start to move higher again it does help take the lid off the corn market and pays a way for the\nCorn market to go higher a little bit easier\nYeah so so much of a a big impact in court being just a little bit more mixed\nYeah and if it does have that impact on corn where it does make it easier for the market to move higher well then\nThat's kind of your your round about way that we'd has an influence on soybeans as well we're talking with Dale dirt Colts a senior market analyst there at agra visor\nOkay when we come back we've still got a lot of ground to cover I Want to talk about what Dale expects out as a USDA reports next week I Want to talk China trade issues I Want to talk a up as we got a lot of governors jailed Jericho on ATV\nNo matter what you do you're always raising the bar trying to do better than ever knew to lower oh fungicides for corn and soybeans and help you get the edge you're looking for\nYou know I did this after the November report said the final number could be\n... plus or minus two bushels a from what we had there just over one eighty back in in October\nI tend to think and everybody seems to be in a camp although neither you are seeing any numbers yet but I tend to like you know we could see a bushel laws and the ... beans are a lot harder call ... or got such a mix here you know in the eastern ... we we had just outstanding ... but then because of\nA lot of it harvest issues when he got into some of the bigger states out west a ... have been you know troublesome so you know I think there are a harder call I I look to the internal details of the U. S. D. numbers back in October\nAnd I think actually you know they pretty well pay the potential crop itself now with ... you know the problems in Iowa and a few places elsewhere out there during the harvest period yeah maybe it could lead to feel a little bit lower but I don't know it's going to be a big decline on being yelled\nOkay let's jumped further out into the month all the way to November twentieth I Believe it is G twenty meeting a President Trump and president G are going to be in the same place at the same time\nSo little unknown if they they're supposed to meet don't really know how it how important do you think it is\nFor the markets that those two leaders sit down and have a conversation\nIt is important that they set down no doubt about that\nI think both sides probably understand that at least it's important that the two of them sit down and talk and and frankly you know the one or two times to have met\nIt's important that the two of them sit down and talk and and frankly you know the one or two times to have met\nThey they've been able to have you know pretty good conversations you know so I think quicker clear a lot of the year about what's going on in the trade issues themselves but you know I don't know that that's a really resolve the problem because\nChina itself you know they're they're really\nNot wanting to give up on any of the economic barriers to keep people from doing business in China and you know they come along and say you know ... we really don't steal any intellectual property then they saw the story out of the u._s._a. today I think you know where we had\nSome Chinese officials and died at pursuing aircraft technology yeah you know until they give on some of that and and become you know a part of the world system I think this has got to be a long haul process to get resolved and\nThen I saw Greg dad he's the the leading egg negotiator and the U.S trade office that that was generally what he suggests that as well and he said you know you look at China\nThey have as far as they can tell a\nYou devised a hundred billion dollars those subsidies above and beyond what is allowed and the WTO since they came into the WTO\nYou know they've virtually this far as agriculture is concerned and virtually you know they they have bought none of the ... of quotas that were set in place on that a WTO\n... and I'm a agreement itself so you know China has has really abused the WTO and you really start to look at all that data\nYep no doubt about\nIt is not going to that's not going to be easy to change because they're going to be reluctant to give and you know on our side we're gonna have to keep pushing\nRight right Gail we don't have a whole lot just a couple of minutes left here but I got to ask you this can African swine fever be the thing that brings China back too serious negotiations with the U.S on trade\nIt could help a little bit I think the biggest thing I worry about whether they're African swine fever and it gets here well sure\nThat that that's a devastating thing as far as or potentially as far as the demand is concerned you know so I worry about that aspect more than I that I worry about you know the impact on China as far as pork and pork demand I think they'll tend to stay away from the world\nBut you know how this evolves that's a question but I look at the fact that if we get a U.S up here you know then we've got another whole thing on to play into right now where I'm at and by big prize cycles on grains I don't see that happening now\nOkay All right that's interesting and and the other thing I ... it it uh it is a risk I mean there's no question that it's a risk that we get a a step here but the probability seems to be fairly low don't you agree\nI think I think the probability is low at this point in time I Would agree with you there but you know then again you know we had an instance today or yesterday they found some sausages in Taiwan that had been brought in from China yeah\nYou know is ... innocent little things like that that the\nYou know just so hard to fight you know and that makes it a difficult thing but yeah so I think the probabilities are ...

these games do you never know\nThat's why we don't play games on paper replay on your radio that yeah that's why we do it\nThe thing that stands out ... and has a a a a quarterback or a bad thing is that what are just now senior I tell you what this guy this guy just about everything except ride the bus is leading Russia with over Fifteen hundred yards twenty five touchdowns the sheer also stolen the ball very well a little bit or fifty percent passer\nA for a thousand fifty yards and Twenty one touched down so he's a candidate for forty six touchdown for the tigers this year very quick and elusive I don't know I talked to coach shoved back switch from one field before the game and said that\nThere really are going to have to keep an eye on number twenty four 'cause he's a he's a guy that can do a lot of things are looking at a field side of the class\nThere really are gonna have to keep an eye on number twenty four 'cause he's a he's a guy that can do a lot of things are looking at a field site that you know\nThe classic thing about Bloomfield football is it that they always had big guys up front and they always ran the ball I mean they just ran right right up your up your nose in and out and you have to try to stop it this is not necessarily your your your dad's up won't feel the squad though there are a very\nUh very more balanced touching than than what they have shown in years past a ranch easily and is there a leading ground gators ran for seven hundred eighty nine yards and that she got\nOut of ... will barrier on the line up last year about three weeks ago in the rental ... it's a broken leg he was a a attract maybe they're leading Russia or this year I bet you have a great quarterback in Great Britain Eisenhower's ran for five hundred twenty five years something like that as a great passers that completely out of his past this year\nFor eight hundred seven yards and Thirteen touchdowns only one interception the entire year\nAnd has some good receivers obviously if you're going to be thrown ball as well as she has a trend ... says the top twenty seven all five twenty five yard touchdown and de de Scott working that's very seven yards at least a chapter book it really has a good balance on that that that makes them up you know probably a little more top\nA tougher to stop them in years past where you try that at all yet he was trying to stop their ground game in and do that you you'd be successful but a lot of things didn't have a lot of success stopping won't feel\nGround game over the years well they they they certainly didn't and you know when you look at the the the other thing that jumped out at me is the ah as a little research it's happening when you look at an asthma schedule they only played three teams counting brittian last week in the playoffs a with a better than\nSome five hundred records uh they they played a Laurel Concord who's more for the season or or lost a little Concord earlier in the year\nIt'd be two to twenty four and then ... ... well received branch has been beaten the brains out everybody they play a lot harder to Newcastle right now yeah fifty six to six earlier the season and uh but really some nice wins along the way so but you know what you just played a schedule you have\nYou you can't really uh affect the record of the other team except for the night you plan\nOn going on in

different scenario here but I have a\nHere's someone gets pitch on the right side breaks a couple of tackle it stopped short down at the er thirty five yard line about tough we are short of first out so good job of a decent funny I was in tires are on their first series do I get a free and out\nWe'll see how confident Bloomfield Hills here or there looking at about a fourth and five and be able to force him before and it looks like they're going to be dropping back into much more major ... when you get really really a when you get rolling sometimes you just want to go forward in these situations but there are still in their own territory in a good chance this\nStill feeling out here in the early going ... formation now they're going to a fake on this is from him and I was so sit out\nHe tried to run right side and they're about four hours the tigers there tend to agree to him and uh the tigers will get the ball in great field position actually lost yard on that play so the tires at the bottom of the home field thirty forty or lemonade afford to go here in the first quarter and an opportunity to ah turn this into into possible score\nIt just it looked like Bloomfield was just kind of second guessing themselves as watching their body language they just didn't look like a team that was convinced that they were going to on the ball [laughter] but ... who's ready for the sniffed it out so here they are basically back where they were before their Fifteen yard penalty the last time they hit the ball\nSo tigers are with the jury secrecy the rights groups in the backfield with Hyman I'm In gets the ball fixed right now he's looking for [noise] a receiver in a house coverage breaks down and as he get sacked for about a forty\nHour laws [noise] about freebies in there to a clip I heard on um [noise]\nIt's like living shots and one of the first ones to get there [noise] was like Dylan cop was also in there so the tigers lives about three hours on that place and there'll be a second down in about Thirteen from the boom feel thirty seven yard line\nLooks like a the quarterback tonight browse but he's going to have about two seconds to get rid of that ball and after that boy Bloomfield vista swarmed him like bees Mike\nYeah we'll be able to get a little bit besides advantage up front and here's a a\nLittle inside hand off and we got a flag on the players are [noise]\nIt was kind of goes with the curious about three hours but uh this looks like it's going to come back I think we've got probably illegal formation see what the call is\nYou know ... blocks okay so we're going to be a Fifteen or federally so I've got to hurt us and that's the second major penalty ... here in the first period\nWhere's this game is going to get Johnson rock in the uh in the route of eight and a quarter finals or next Tuesday [noise]\nIf you're in where Johnson rocket down south East Africa so whether they're still going to get another team from southeast Alaska this one is putting a hurt on al and right now out early in the third quarter\nA job to block is up Seventy to nothing good he had the six ... and the first court first half and drops and brought her and I\nThink all but one of them into touchdown Bloomfield are they going to look that up on it coming up boom deal with the wind they would travel if I'm going to order when they would host I Believe\nI was one of the second it along they have three receivers on the right side I'm and takes his nap now he's got to go left\nGets away from one tackling then brought down a number twenty three [noise] you didn't try out a whole [noise]\n\nAnd so he gets about seven yards on that one\nWill give him give him a third third in about twenty or the or awesome tigers at their own\nThirty six yard line\nWas six fifty to to go here in the offing quarter no score between the bees and the tigers\nAnd most of the skiing has been played between the two thirty are lines\nThat are there it's been right in the middle of field for both sides here in the early going trip receivers now to the right for us from one to the left\nAnd the backfield having going back to pass under pressure [noise]\nAnd he said [noise] two guys and the sad [noise]\n[noise] when it was useful in Britain president used them in and uh [noise] Logan Johnson also gay block with or excuse me the only counts as in there on the attack also another sack for the Bloomfield defense and another funding situation for the tigers\nYeah he basically lost the seven yards that he got in the previous play when he drops back to pass it just looks to me like he is going to have to roll out right or left to get away from that ah that that are on Russia or the the Bloomfield rush and it's just too heavy into fast\nPlant formation for the tigers\nNice kick this time going to the left side\nAnd his friends to give some and picking it up at the fourteen our lens spins away from one jak learned and brought down\nAt the Eighteenth don't return or about four yard and the what's like Josh Gansa bombers and on the tackle there as well as a kind of good for the entire sort of move he'll be taking over a at the age in your mind their own Eighteen or line by forty five do here in the opening period\nAnd are good for the entire sort of move he'll be taking over a at the age in your mind their own Eighteen airline five forty

[noise]\nLogan Johnson just carry their he gets a couple of yards so they were we face in about a\nThird and for thirty five from about twenty three yard line\nYou're in the opening period\nLogan in and the ball yeah tonight Mike you probably know all of that last thing he said man you you mean it's a bomb I heard you guys are moving the ball let's go work with the help me out yeah man you see if I Can't grind some out or read a million but man it's top both defensive lines are planned excellent so far the night\nSo here come the bees back it up to the line of scrimmage five guys up front our eye formation is play action pass scrambling to his right [noise]\nFrame as Eisenhower and he is right down in the backfield [noise]\nIt looks like that was that who all of that coming up with the tackled there on the sack I just nobody nobody available for uh for the for the quarter back east and do a thorough Juliet ... sack there are a ... hour excuse me\nYeah I was gonna say but boy you like a Mack truck bearing down on a poor little squirrel in the middle of the road man there was just nowhere to go\nSideline was comedy and to get rid of it or get sacked unfortunately got sack so now they're pointing the way\nHere's ... both teams have probably twice so far I I ... and it's picked up at the thirty yard line that as Britain's whether you go to the left side and is brought down by a swarm of me [noise]\nBut the ... have been a player's pushed the pile forward ... three yards so they're going to be set up at about ... thirty eight yard line\nThough the tigers in a home field
