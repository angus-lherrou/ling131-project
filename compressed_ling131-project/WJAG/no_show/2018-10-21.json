C.\nAlgebra ... pretty good team they're taking on Cincinnati who had fought their way into the top twenty five undefeated\nBut it played absolutely nobody and I thought they could have a tough time coming into Philly and playing and they did today a temple scores late to diet and send it over time and then when it in overtime twenty four seven teams so I had both temple minus three any on during that game which was forty eight so I hit on both ends and\nKind of double downing an on my temple play I took ... who is a one point favorite on the road today against Toledo and I just flat out been a better team and they won handily are the only problem with it was\nBoth to the games are played at noon\nSo my rooting interest by my picks were done by three thirty so now I'm just casually sitting back and observing and watching the rest of the college football weekend I Want to chime in on any that you can\nUpdate on debate ... mentioned Christian yell at Shaw Homer gives Milwaukee the early lead died just come up in the top of the second and say not so fast my friend uh get aid to spot back immediately to take the lead themselves\nA monster home run measured at four hundred and twenty five feet by Cody Ballenger off ... sheen drives in many\nMachado who had reached base just before ... yard on a button single and I've really been surprised by the reaction has come down this week on many Machado um Machado made to\nLet's just say questionable moves this week I'm On a bang bang play at first base in this series he stepped on the back fought back to the port of uh the brewers have just\nBank play at first base in this series he stepped on the back fought back of the foot of ah the brewers have who's Aguilar and everyone is chiding it as a dirty play\nI Will not\nSay I think it was a complete accident\n... Machado knew where he was planting is what when he planted his foot um if that makes it a dirty play in your mind I Can't deny that you think it's dirty I Can't say it's not dirty but I think it was\nA baseball player and sometimes baseball plays can be physical like sliding into second base\nIf you slide cleanly and go straight if the bag and you take out the legs of the second base when you can potentially injured the second base when\nBut it's within the rules now you can say that you believe that it's dirty but if it's not blatantly breaking a rule it can only be so dirty on a given play in question Aguilar had his foot all over the base\nThe first baseman job is to get to the edge of the base and stretch out and have only the top of his toes on\nThe base you're supposed to give the runner the entire bag if you don't then your voice is kind of open game and I thought\nThe fall or the fallout from this quote unquote dirty play that many Machado it made was over the top then many does an interview with a Kenny Rosenthal from clocks and a and B network or one of the best insiders\nThe athletic on the inside in all of baseball\nAnd Kenny gets many to say because there was a play here in the postseason easy ground ball the second base basically many jog down the first\nAh he's not the only one who does this I don't like it anytime anybody does it and I think the manager has every right to get in the player's face when he does something like that and say this is not the way we played baseball we run hard every single play even if it's a Ninety nine point nine percent chance we're going to be out\nA so he took some critique for that and then in talking with Kenny Rosenthal after the fact he said I'm never going to be one of those Johnny hospital guys that's just not the way that I play the game\nAnd I think again it was an honest answer but it was probably a very missed time to answer\nBecause ... it was just about the open market he's kind of make a a mega pay day as a free agent as young as he is as good as he is playing a key position like shortstop man he's going to get paid and he's going to get paid big\nHe probably cost himself\nTen thousand dollars twelve thousand up Fifteen thousand dollars if you're thinking about a five six seven or eight year deal and that's what man he's got a grand he's going to get five minimum I don't think he's getting ten he's probably going to get a seven or eight ... ... ... year deal\nAnd it's going to be an excess of twenty million per hour it's probably going to be an excess of twenty five million per it might stretch up to closer to thirty million per\nWell if there's a whole bunch of teams that don't get involved because they don't want a guy who randomly going to admit and be up front about not being a Johnny hustle player there might be a bunch of teams have come out and demanding Machado mix\nThere's a whole bunch of come out to begin with because they can't afford to pay anybody twenty five or twenty six or twenty seven million per let alone for five six or seven years or so many is chopping down the number of teams that are going to have interest in him he didn't help himself with that\nThat's on him bedtime math a port just a God awful timing to come out and decide you're going to be really honest and say something that you mean a self defeating is what it is more than anything else when it comes to purse strings and his ability to make money as a free agent during his off season\nBut here's the thing that annoys me I've heard several callers and a couple of media members make the statement yeah you know\nI don't want many Machado he's a bad guy on the team he's a bad guy in the clubhouse he's a bad teammate\nCould you do me a favor can you Google ad for many many moons channel bad teammates many Madonna Machado clubhouse problem\nThis all came together in the last seven days is that what you tell me\nHe's been in a big league for years and now he's the troubled teammate now he's a bad guy and your locker room because of what he's done in this one week which oh by the way he's been as productive without fence a player at the Dodgers have had\nHere in the postseason and if they go back to the world series of leave much because of Matty Machado as any other one individual Dodger but do I don't want 'em on my team 'cause he's a he's a bad guy in a locker room he's a bad teammate\nFunny it's never come out before nobody's ever said that before but because he stepped on a first basements void and because he put out a foolish statement that he's not a Johnny hot so kind of guy that makes them a bad club outside influence please stop\nIf I can get manning Machado on a good baseball deal and a good baseball deal for me would be\nFive years a hundred and thirty five million a hundred and forty ... he's gonna get twenty five twenty five is minimum ... say it's twenty six so it's a hundred and thirty five years hundred and thirty million

it's it's great stuff you're Jody it's been a while\nIt adds that and I don't mean to dismiss the Bruins but they are on the flow chart where they are they're the team in town because the red Sox not only have they moved past the Yankees and the Astros and are headed to the world series\nBut they did so with relative ease\nThat I didn't I think was going to happen taking the Yankees out in four and then he comes in five in a best of seven I thought they were being slighted as a hundred and eight when the when the ... season started but they made even me a guy who was the deciding pull it looked like I underrated them too\nWell it's funny 'cause I I sent out a tweet I think yesterday saying that ... you know I had the red Sox and\nA five against the Yankees either Red Sox insects

understood her a little bit more about foul because yeah he he only replicated what he had done the year before rather than improved on it and had been there for a while but I was actually surprised

postseason success\nWell it's funny the you know the the feral firing\nDidn't surprise me the dirty one did so I'm right there with you but what's really fascinating is these two guys come in and you know Aaron Boone now score and they both when a hundred games in their first years as major league manager so pretty incredible and it feels like\nYou know if not for being in Boston you almost feel badly that the Yankees when a hundred games and and had to go to a wild card playing a game I mean that's just the whole structure of that doesn't feel right but as far as your question core just\nIt's a totally different demeanor in the clubhouse I mean feral had lost the clubhouse some guys like them and respected him but most in that group did not and and that had been the case you know for a couple of years despite being you know they're kind of winning divisions in spite of him which is\nA sort of a wild things to say I guess but we know I mean how how much really in major league baseball and you're a baseball guy how much does does your manager really really make a difference you know I I think you could argue that\nManagers don't necessarily when you are a lot of games but they can certainly cost you and I don't know how much federal was costing them games because again they went out one divisions but they were tight you know they they didn't they weren't loose they weren't\nRelax they weren't comfortable it wasn't a jovial it was a very tense sort a clubhouse and you could hear it ... and top down especially from from feral who by the way was not saved them ... guy you know he inherited John Farrell when he was hired to replace bench Arrington and\nHe was able to go out and get his guy and he brings in core who's familiar with the city has won in the city as a player knows what it's like as has been around the game be it as a player in in the media and then obviously bench coach of of a champion team last year and just knows what it takes and\nIf you want to save the rafters are as good as talented as they have ever been I'll go with that uh but\nThey haven't been able to figure it out in the playoffs granted this is a new coach and why has not been there and\nMaybe he'll fit great with a with a cow Lowry and maybe Danny green will be incredible addition to that team I don't know but\nYou know I I I don't think this is a hometown bias or I'm looking at you know what we saw last year what Brad Stevens in this group was able to achieve what out or being in a word in that postseason falling only minute short of beating a LeBron James led Cavaliers team and reaching the NBA Finals or they would have got whacked by the warriors nobody's denying that\nBut that is a team that could have last year without too all stars come out of the east if this team is healthy Jody I I refuse to believe that the eastern conference is not there is to lose I just last night was great it was a great entertaining game that the raptors we're able to basically you know and I think they ended on a\nUh twelve to run to put it away when it was a to point game one on one Ninety nine with a few minutes left\nBut that was that was a ... for for a second game of the year that was a playoff intensity feel type of game and it was really entertaining and you know to bad one team had to lose it but this self esteem\nOnce it gets comfortable you know it's gonna take probably have where it half the year to come back from the fact that he just didn't play real basketball for a year or thing has been rusty it's going to take him a little while to be his top ten top Fifteen\nNBA player caliber self\nAnd Jason Tatum is going to keep developing jail and brown is going to keep developing out or for is going to be the\nThe ... that is the anchor the defence the defence runs through him in the depths with Marcus mores and Terry rosier Marcus Smart Aaron Bain's like they're you know you could make a case I'm not saying this is definitive you could make a case that their reserves their top five off the bench\nCould be an eastern conference playoff team a low team like seven or eight seed but a playoff team because the east is partially that week and their death Celtics that good\nThat up there's got to go that's why I pick them to win you used to but Toronto didn't impress me in there when it again tonight even given quite a night off\nSo we could have some fun between those teams and don't kept really out either uh east at the top is not as weak as it might be one to eight as far as postseason goes were on the same page that

she's in good shape\nNice so what's not in good shape as my football giants no\nI you know I'm under the a ... that I Believe in Eli\nI don't believe it's him you know if you don't have a car and the four tires and bad okay I'll go to the engine is it's not going anywhere\nOkay I blame the office of line\nI Know Mr marriage upset so all the fans are upset\nWe're tired of the losing I'm tired of the losing I Know Mr Rebecca ... is allergic to water or does like water [laughter] so I sent him a tweet and I said well how about you remember Jody back a few years ago the eagles drank pickle juice I said how 'bout drink from\nTehran we'll pickle juice there or BJ on I'll tell you where I'm at with the giants quarterback situation because I had been a defender like do\nA ... most fans fall under this category I'm I'm not pointing out anything that isn't the case in New York or St Louis or Los Angeles or Philadelphia ... fans are this way\nWhen the quarter back when he gets all the credit when the quarterback lose he takes all the grief\nAnd Ninety nine percent of the time it's over state it both ways supporter back to too much credit when you went and take too much ... a credit limit team loses too much greed and I truly believe that it's a case where the rice a bed if you put the reasons that the giants have been bad in in order\nBy how big the greed just misses been for me it's not even close the operative line is way out of your life\nBut I got to tell you the last couple of weeks even when he's had the chance to make plays in it as being near often enough he's always under siege ... if they ever\nTry and drop 'em back five steps are seven steps he's dead in the water 'cause they just can't hold the line um but he's had a couple of players wearing the actually as a diamond guys have\nBeen open and he hasn't been able to have him when he as needed to throw down fields again not often because they don't give them enough time he hasn't been able to make plays like he has before he lie is far from blameless he's not the number one reason why the giants ... things and they're one and five but he's also part of the problem with the states\nI and I can take that that I agree with you can but I was saying I think that offers of lie makes him as Jerry we said skittish\nAnd you've been around forever you shouldn't be skittish at this stage of his career\nI I I think he's he's in a pot guy is not a runny nose every time we hold the ball and he starts the mall he\nFumbled the ball I it makes me cringe we see that and I think the office of wind problem is they don't trust one another yet\nYeah and and I said just today on New York radio Sally always a pleasure um I'll give David gentlemen as much credit he came in you evaluated does advent of line and said it stinks we need to change and he did he went out and spend some money on off to wind when\nThe money has been missed poorly spent\nMahmoud that just bench today they're going with a new a right tackle and oh by the way soldier who they gave a lot of money to to play left tackle company for New England\nHas been just short of a turnstile a guy's going by them left and right on the left hand side so\nIt's good when you evaluate correctly that you need to make changes one of the changes don't fix it one credit do you actually dead end or deserve the guy got beds of line is still is than it was like last year that sit like again this year\nAnd those who disagreed with me when I put the blame on the ... yeah but local park please do and they must be doing a job if Barclays run\nBy going does it on his own he gets hit by a line of scrimmage more than maybe any back in the lead and he runs to tackle then he the guy but he's being president behind the line\nThe giant off into blind stinks period but manning is looking at every bit the thirty eight years old he is the\nGiants need to go a new direction and I think they will put their first round draft pick this upcoming year then from there builds up on CBS Sports radio Dana man\nJody Mac what's happening in how I by\nDoing really well back man I'm watching the baseball as well as I'm listening to your show and if I remember right you pick the socks and the brewers to be in the world series\nCorrect and I picked the Astros and the Dodgers so you have to have one of a I'm\nI'm half way all you've got an you're playing catch up their buddy\nThe Dodgers are going to be in and back man they got a two to one lead the brewers can't squat he writes your legal rights are scored based writers\nI and and the haters out of the game now they're ... that's the best pitchers hate or the Milwaukee Brewers it's gonna be the Dodgers it's going to be the Sox it can be bad has the baseball historical baseball back that\nI I I I'm not gonna complain\nIf the Dodgers get in I just I like both teams I don't love either team some of the Dodgers when I'm okay with it I kinda like day Robert so I think he's very good manager I think he's a good guy or so I Would I'd be happy for day Robert too because there again here's the problem though he got there last year\nAnd it doesn't matter who's coming out of the national league whoever makes it is going to lose to the red Sox in the world series\nCome on\nDone nationally will not win the world series this year and another American League season that\n... been the best team

Ninety percent at least he's he's the best ratings that we've had so far yeah been\nNinety percent like what are you going to do you have no flexibility after that\nWell hopefully your legs that have zero percent or zero zero development\nOr hope so if you're not then I ... maybe eighty five percent give yourself a little bit of wiggle room or we are alive until midnight eastern here on CBS Sports radio taking your questions and I are fantasy football eight five five\nTo one to four CBS eight five five to one to four to two seven um yeah so we got a lot of started to get through a lot of phone calls let's talk about these uh these moves first Carlos Hyde the trade to Jacksonville and what that means for yelled and what that means\nFor for net but also marsh on Lynch could go on and I are he's going to miss at least a month and don't Martin is barely own Jay them chard widely available Melvin Gordon will get into that but yeah what's your take on on Nick Chubb do you think it would be better than Carlos Hyde was\n[noise] I think it will be at least as good as Carlos Hyde so you know touchdown dependent probably in the beginning uh you know he's probably more explosive than Carlos I\nUh but let's take anything away from crowds that he was he was good you know and I think would have been better if they involve them in the past the game we saw that in San Francisco\nSo we'll see if the jaguars do that if they decide to give him or by default ends up getting you know a little bit more of a featured role a but we talk about the second I think in in terms of Chubb uh I I I mean he becomes a must start guy this we can ... out for the bucks\nSo it's a great spot for him to get his debut as a starter um but the underlying thing I think for all this is to Johnson becomes good too you know this is now an opportunity for him to get more work and\nYou know he's starting to come along a little bit lately so two jobs out there on your way everywhere pick him up also\nWhat about non PBR because I definitely NPR to junk from sixty four percent oh do you think he's got value and not people who are\nI think you know I mean we've seen it it it's a different NFL the last couple of years a James White this year has been great NPR but very\nGood in on the viewer to recall in the last two weeks has been great in any form it I think two jobs and could be great in any form of ... and last year it was a little bit touched down to ... seven touchdown last season um but he was started will ah especially now where we know we're we're in the thick of by weeks it's it's four teams on a by between now and we twelve\nAt least so you know you're talking about a lot of guys missing and the schedules great for the brown so I don't know if he's going to be better than ... let's let's be real here just as a rookie and we don't know if you're going to be able to handle heavier workload and if he struggles or gets hurt then do jobs that could be the guy so unique to pick them up where every the bill ... twenty seven percent on Doug\nMartin thirty three percent own how eager are you to pick up one of these two and then there's the Washington who could be a factor it's\nI I I did pick up the odds are washing my self and a dynasty league I think if he's available you want to take a speculative look on him but that's more deeper formats or because I still expected to be third at least going in to a two week nine when they cost you mean we get when they come up there by week\nUm I like ... slightly better because of just how I expect the games to go for the raiders a marsh on this was great\nAnd I think you know it doesn't matter it's going to get an opportunity to get those type of touches which is golden opportunities or work on first and second down but you've seen recently I think it's all but two games so far this season where he hasn't gotten double digits in PBR\nAdult is ... ... so I Would look at re start as the better of the two uh but I don't think he's all of a sudden you step into martial arts Israel I think that's the one\nGentleman shark has never had ten carry in a game so he's at nine a few times but he's not going to be aware of course no but ... yeah maybe um\nI I don't know maybe an foolish I'm starting Frank or in a league or this week so you know I any running back to the polls matters but I did not try to pick up Doug Martin in

J. G. [noise]\n\n\n\nHigh on foot ball\nOn CBS Sports radio\nThe way [noise]\nAt seventh or eighth grade for me is how I Do it man I'm feeling it right out of it yeah yeah All right good choice back there we'd go guys are backed by a fantasy football\nFor just grew veneer on a Saturday Night and we have a lot of news this week man we talked a lot about Nick Chubb we did not talk about the jaguars running back situation Carlos Hyde is on the jak people not play this week PJ yelled in one more week\nOf being relevant fantasy running back probably your phone calls a day five five to one to four to seven either ... or he is Jamie Eisenberg\nAnd that were alive until midnight eastern taking your phone call it's got a full board right now so I might want to be a little patient wait for somebody to clear up we'll get to some calls so Jayme letter for that Carlos IT jail then what do you think\nUh well they said you get one week of yelled than being great next week most likely we get the time share of yelled and\nAnd hide than ever buy and then\nExpectation is that if we're not return so\nDo we get the time share of yelled and and hide than ever buy and then the expectation is Leonard for net returns so Carlos I clearly becomes frustrating [laughter] I'm\n... and by the way next week is against the eagles of maybe the best run defense in football and a time share with yelled and perhaps so why don't you know side owners\nYeah it's uh I wouldn't drop them yet because we still have the potential of learned from that trying to come back pops hamstring and they place them and I are they didn't make this move because their confidence that clearly they make this move because they're concerned about when it so you have to hold high at least for the next week or so\nUm you have to hold yelled and just in case a you know again the same thing before that and I'm speaking you're playing yelled in this week um you're not getting anything for that and trade that's going to help you so you have to hold on to him for now and I think it's sad to see how this plays out my my estimation was still before and that's the guy\nI'm at the head of the times here so it's not going to be delivered for another ... drafted\nAnd it's probably not going to be the letter from that that you thought even coming back from the injury but I still think if you're looking at is probably sixty percent of the such is still filling in for Neal\nJamie people need to pick up Taylor Gabriel he's fifty seven percent owned agree or disagree\nTotally agree I mean he's got a all twelve is August last two weeks both\nOr two games use me that ... a over a hundred yards and both those games were such which was a thousand that game against Tampa Bay he's been the best bears wide receiver\nAnd Alan Robinson might not play with hoping he does tomorrow but a tailor Gabriel was under own and next week\nOr they've got the jets and boy the jets have had a terrible past events so beat the way of wire get yourself Taylor Gabriel now let's before we get to the call is getting a five five to one to four to seven Jamie let's talk about the charter situation right now what you're thinking Melvin Gordon questionable with a hamstring\nWell obviously it's not a good situation when the guy gets downgrade it right before they are about the play and they activate somebody off their practice squad so they uh they clearly are concerned I'm as a fantasy owners should be there are activated or sign a I mean one perhaps his first name the new some\nI'm off that practice why that would put him behind Austin that color and justice Jackson um\nSo my guess is they're going to test out Gordon pre game in London remember that's a nine thirty eastern start so you'd have to wake up early to check especially those of you on the west coast and make sure that he's playing a so that'll be about eight forty five fish right\nFor the famous for oh yeah ah yeah that's a good math a forty five four Ninety minutes before excuse me oh come on Jamie then it's eight o'clock it'll be eight o'clock am\nWhen we find out uh if he's active so\nHopefully uh you know we get the clearance phase going to play because always this scenario of ease active and we have the dog and cookies on his ... situation um but they do have their by coming up next week and they probably going to be cautious with it so you just have to make sure that you're covered\nAnd covered early in the morning so if ... going to be a potential monster so must start guy he's he's\nMost likely starting in a lot of leagues even in the ... so you know he goes from the minimal touches with the excellent execution to all the touches with all the same execution\nOr how would you rank these for ... ...

to one to four to seven if you listen to our podcast you might know how old Jamie is first person to tell us first car to tell us how well Jamie is when surprise you lied apparently\nI I have said you were much older than you actually are necessary a five five to one to four to seven but if you recall somewhat recently on a pockets within the last few years we said like we did something around one of your birthday is whatever I'm\nCBS is Super Bowl season continue Sunday with a truck had her\nFirst live from London the titans take on the chargers then Tom Brady in the patriots coming up with really went over that she was an amazing game collide with the bears\nAnd then we got a big NFC each showdown between the cowboys and the Redskins wake up with the NFL today at ... am eastern six am Pacific and start your full day of football on CBS going to be a real fun day\nAh RJ me I'm going to give you some R B choose\nThe way you have them ranked NPR I'm just going to go down the list the way you have them rank just give me a sentence or two about what you expect from them we're going to start at number eleven which is a recount I won't want when everybody should do now is just thinking about how funny it is that this is like eleven through twenty eight of these guys eleven through twenty\nIn week seven\nAnd there are so unlikely so let's start to recall it against the mainland real quick I feel about I'm\nLoving this week fourteen catches his last two games are the better of the two bears running backs right now and I think there is either going to be a shootout or the bears chasing points against the patriots who have struggled the last two weeks with Ninety mines and cream hunt catching pass\nHow 'bout TJ yelled against Houston\nA great situation for him again he's been very involved in the past the game was average over five years to carry the last two games and I think with uh the way that the Texans have struggled with past catching backs as well he will be a very good member to Gainesville against ISI was awesome catch them all\nYeah so from Cohen to yelled and to carry on Johnson at Miami\nKnow theoretically yeah dolphins a prior to last week\nWere six in the NFL align receptionist running backs I think they're right in that range again\nSo just given what his role will now be as a rush her I think it's such as go up without the over there so I'm very excited about carry on John was Haiti's Murray at the jets um as we saw last week you know when they committed to him and the office of wind look good\nOr just run defense has been suspect this year so heavy workload knowing that no double cook is there a I'm actually a dusting my ... going to be moved up a couple spots\nOkay yeah the jets have allowed or five years were carried will leave running back two weeks in a road map Brita against the rams\nOr didn't have any catches last week was a little bit surprising but the fourteen carries with the season for him seems like the ankle is okay we know the rams have been a\nNot the greatest against run they they're statistically all the better I think than what they're run defense actually is\nAnd so a given what his carries should be with a couple of catches on top of it especially if they're chasing points I I think he's a ... a very safe number two running backs Kevin Coleman against the giants are very disappointing so far but you also do look at who they played you know tough matchups against the St ... good Steelers run defense is actually pretty good\nUh bagels Randy fences is so so but uh he had I think ... in that game so I think this is his uh hey I'm the guy freelance arrest of season and we know that that's the robot is going to have but primetime game he's going into free agency and the giants as we know it's been up\nAnd down and get the right we've got two more Corey climate against Carolina\nI think he was the better of the two guys last week against the against um [noise] uh in their game last week giants yes or no or get forget about the touchdown take that away he looked better than windows ... what I think Patty knock the coming off an injury he would have had a lot more work than small wood so I'm just excited for his opportunity now that you should be healthy getting that heavy work with\nAnd I said eleven to twenty we're actually going to Twenty one mark Ingram apple more\nMakes a little bit nervous you know I Hope they get involved in the passing 'em like they did last year but the ravens ready fences great and he's going to share with ... so you're still starting in your but you've got to downgrade him and this is the spots but ...\nOkay names I didn't mention in eleventh through Twenty one Sony Michel Philip Lindsey who was great on Thursday Nick Chubb who we've talked a lot about it's amazing what running back looks like in week seven and it could be awesome color\nPotentially ahead of all of these guys if Melvin Gordon out yeah and let's get to the cause All right one question no greetings\nAnd how much you wanna get Jamie's age\nOr let's just gets it gets was many questions as we can hear a five five to one to four to seven let's see what Isaiah in Maryland go\nDetroit give up James wide Tony around and Mike evidence for over ...\nGot to go by [laughter] uh see I mean great players everywhere you know so you're giving up a lot you got to hold the back of his great uh and you got ... the guy that we saw in those first four games or at least they got to be so last year but uh I think you'll be okay um you know and and and it

ravens but I still think they're going to be able to score points against Baltimore through the air what don't you like about reverse I don't think that they're all very much now that changes the words out\nBut his past I've just been down yeah\nHas been a thirty or fewer in four or six games a five five to one to four to seven to say in Chicago what up goose [noise]\nHey what's up guys Jamie

they reminded me of the royals and joins teams that one world series you could see the teen chemistry\nYou could see the connection to the manager and the only thing missing is that they won't get a World Series ring like that royals and giants organization got or organizations plural\nGreat playoff run man and now you get the Dodgers and the red Sox or do a lot of people out there was that all the good spirits do that it was the host rose and the brewers Dodgers earned that Red Sox earned that\nYes major league baseball umpires or some of the worst in pro sports just get up hill

Knoxville, Tennessee in Steve here on CBS Sports radio\nBut it gives you an hour the on your show and here we are ... are talking about the same college playoffs and in my opinion and you can respond to that\nWe will have five offers you can't\nHave possibly and I'm late in order to maintain you could have Michigan Michigan when\nUh they can or you know and you can ... I got the mock central Florida or another dog but they're not making record that's about Eighteen throughout their weight age they are arguing for an Eighteen playoff back\nI almost think that this Knight Bob our coffers get\nAnybody on late life for the national ... thank you\nThank you Steve and in Knoxville, Tennessee where the ball's fans witnessed the greatest softens in college football and ... maybe one of the best you've ever seen in Alabama earlier this afternoon I said at last year that you know there's not a lot of arguments after a there is\nI mean if they if you looked at everything right now and you went okay Alabama ... and ... if we just looked at the rank and so we have right now Alabama Clemson\nLSU Michigan\nGeorgia Oklahoma Texas\nAnd I I don't know if I put central Florida there I I get the the story and what they've done and it's kind of Boise State issue and I don't want to demean the blue turf in the great program for our listeners in Boise but\nWhen you look at the power five I I just don't know\nIf you can side central Florida and because of the obese yes well there are undefeated like Notre Dame is undefeated they bite Alabama but they weren't any good I so if you did an Eighteen play off off the top twenty five\nFrom what I project will be this week which will be Alabama one climbs into and the three LSU for Michigan five Texas six Georgia's seven Oklahoma aids\nYou have UCF than\nKnocking on the door with a one last Ohio State team in Florida at eleven see that the the argument goes away\nWhat you're going to get now and then that's what I said earlier my opening huge opinion\nThat there's going to be that one last debate and I'm getting people tweeting me had Saturday huge while there's no way the SEC gets two teams in I just told you how if Alabama is undefeated planning the SEC title game and Georgia would beat them\nIn Georgia that hasn't lost another game and the real one last team those to one last teams will be in the college football playoff\nGuarantee so the question is if you're in that one laws cheering category well issue controls her destiny because if they went out there in I I don't think Michigan has that control now that Ohio State was upset by Purdue\nIn Penn State was beaten last week by Michigan State taxes\nNow I don't think they control their destiny into college football playoff neither does Oklahoma Georgia does because if they would win the rest of their games and you know number low in Florida and their annual robbery game they would have Kentucky they've whatever Alabama they they have they have their past as the one last team\nUCF does no great story\nBut it's not worthy of being in the final four now if we had an Eighteen playoff they would be in that conversation\nThen the power five could be taken care of your conference championship winners they are in regardless so now you put a lot of value in the regular season and even more value into conference championship games because the guarantees of birth not weighed in on a committee\nNot wondering about strength of schedule you rewarded power five\nThen there's three other spots where Notre Dame will come into

[noise]\nLet me just clarify something that you don't show right here on CBS Sports radio\nI may have to put on something glossed over my nose\nWhen talking about Alex chorus I did say a few moments ago that he would be the first Latin born manager to win the world series that's\nNot accurate but it's set in the article from CBS Sports is\nIf he wins the world series he's the first Latin born Latin born skipper to reach the world series in his rookie year\nSo that's what it says a rookie or as a manager that's what the the fact that alec score was so I just wanted to clarify that did not want to overlook without the ... and did with the Chicago White Sox All right let's go out to the phones we talked to Daryl in Las Vegas next up CBS Sports radio what's up now\nI got a couple of things to say in the first place does it matter what country or around\nNo matter what no one cares what you are where you're from I was just reading some stuff before the show and I thought it was an ...\nOkay I dig it number two oh Dale ... is like a cancer he's like Carrillo and\nA bit down I'm going to we're talking baseball right now though if you want to talk of so called back later where do you want to talk baseball though\nI guess what they're going to blow it\nIn a Dodger fan since way before you were born and and now I'm Talking back in the ... Sandy Koufax date\nSo ... ... at this point and yeah the seventies were great for me growing up but guess what it's two thousand ... ... Eighteen and the dogs if you're going to blow it and they'll they'll get high up in their late ah your other guy said a fix game not lose\nJust because a curse a catfish and their pets you got them here but guess what they they can't\nYou're not are you actually Dodger saying\nI'm a dodger's fan all my life\nAnd just wide no positivity here just whatsoever because the richer hard after so many years\nYeah I I guess yeah since Seventy eight Seventy seven you know ... it's like they they just can't\nHurt during when it gets to this uh this point you know ... the Los Angeles Dodgers are in a great market they should've ever won a lot as much as the Yankees have which is\nWhere the what the Yankees have done is is the most of the baseball so it's it's it's tough yeah they should be able to go when Tony something championships that's that's tough to do\nBut no I I Know it is but the Dodgers and as long you know what fifty eight from Brooklyn you know they they they they go to a Los Angeles and and they ... they want and what a ... a a a world championship says the ... that's\nAbout it last night didn't get you excited whatsoever down you're not pumped up about your team go in the world series\nI'm totally ... I'm also like you don't mind well [laughter] no\nYou can't at least have like a twenty four hour period where you enjoy this one and not worry about the the matchup of thinking that you're gonna lose right away\nAnd I listen to the game tonight and I would still like last night when they last\nFor a while and then did you watch it no I Can't I'm at work so I got to listen to the radio it's a little different\nOkay so by down we appreciate the phone call I I just think that's interesting we finally get to talk to a Dodgers that\nRemember one met got to the world series up against the royals a few years ago\nWhen the Mets swept the ap the tunnel and we do the opponent but when the Mets sweat the come\nAt the time and the first twenty four hours even before knowing the opponent I said that when you look at the pitching what the problem with Harvey was sent the guard with not set that is why I'm well Murphy hitting a cover up the baseball now wants me to not\nI'm not just a natural reaction when your team gets to be big game or the big series whether you are expected to win it or you're expected to get sweat\n... or the big series whether you are expected to win it or you're expected to get sweat\nOr you're expected to be Seventeen point under dog you talk to yourself into a way where your team is going to win does not mean that they're going to win\nAnd if you want to be objective that's fine and I think the red Sox are winning six games ... the red Sox and five McCain thinks the red Sox\nAre winning in six games but I'm just surprised in the aftermath in the immediate aftermath of right after there was a situation where your team gets back to the world series two years in a row\nThat right away it's oh yeah no chance they suck the horrible\nEither terrible that they're not going to win the Dodgers have a chance in the series\nFor me personally it's just nearly impossible\nNow to pick against Boston when I make it opinion behind a microphone and I picked against Boston last rumble for this round and it's tough to pick against Boston because of the way that they dominate the Yankees at the Bronx and the way they dominated Houston\nAnd used it and we know what the Yankees were before the year and we know what the Houston Astros were going into this postseason\nAnd when you have a team that won a hundred games one oh three and you take care of them and beat them around like a rag doll on their home field that's why I'm picking them to win the world series\nBut if you're a Dodgers than listening to us in LA or if you're listening to us wherever you are and you're a Dodgers then\nIt'll give us a call tell us why you think your team to win 'cause the first Dodger fan that we hear from is doom and gloom I'm excited but I'm not going to sound excited I'm going to be telling you that they got zero zero chance whatsoever\nWhenever someone says the team is no chance going into a series and I and the championship game I just laugh at that notion\nNow you may look it's a match up where you think that team is a heavy favorite but it's a hundred percent lock it's just not\nThe Dodgers are good baseball team did they not get to the world series last year in our back in the world series this year they're really good baseball team I just have a hard time\nIn seeing not saying it's impossible but I just have a hard time in my heart picket against the red Sox right now with\nWhat I've seen so far in the post season and the Dodgers have had a really good postseason Milwaukee is a really good team\nAnd then went to a seven game and the Dodgers had to come back in the series and they eventually ... and then I got tied back up and then a game seven the Dodgers prove they were the better team over up against Milwaukee\nLet's go to Carl in Illinois and next up on CBS Sports radio what's up Carl\nHey thanks for having me no problem go ahead\nI'm I just wanted to comment real quick on the the scuffle about\nOr you know what

taking down the Milwaukee Brewers in seven games by a final five to one he also has covered the Dodgers the entire season for NBC LA\nAnd that's Michael dwarf they counted up to join us once again on CBS Sports radio Michael break to talk to you thanks for the time how are you\nThank you too I'm a\nI'm finally in a moment of silence\nMadness uh but you know we finally got the whole entire year but we finally got the rematch in the world series were all wrong wanting right just a hundred and two years and they make\nAnd this was just absolutely crazy the Dodgers ... this year 'cause I remember talking to you a few months ago and people were wondering well what's up with the Dodgers are the Dodgers got to make the post season and\nNow by by now we know they made the postage and they're going back to the world series is how about the ride it's been for the Dodgers this year where it took a again sixty three to win the west and then eventually we know what happened to the post ...\nYeah you know day Robert set it up to the game a lot of the players commented on it as well uh in the clubhouse earlier tonight or or last night depending on what time it is more you're listening to this but\nThat roller coaster ride the up and down\nIt wasn't as easy as it was last year and we all know how last year ended so it's possible maybe that having to fight through inverse having to fight your injuries having to have your back against the wall a all season long and then have your back against the wall here in a game seven\nUh on the road in Milwaukee the first team to win on the road in a game seven in the championship series since two thousand sick when the cardinals then it\n... I think they were able to exercise some demons um that they got in that game seven last year or so that might carry them on a as actually go in as the under dog with a dark horse in the world series against the red Sox\nHow was the locker room other than Roberts after the game because obviously on the minds of the Dodgers players as they thought to win for more games knowing how close they got last year\nI Will say this I mean every I've been through oh man won six now before that one two three so I guess this is the fourth or fifth locker room celebration in the last month a because there was a postseason clenching celebration in San Francisco we're a part of an end the division clenching at one sixty three\nThe shit suits by the way yeah it's a lot I got a lot of air to wash out but\nI Will say this that every single one\nThere's a couple of guys that get rowdy and rock but for the most part the veterans in the room they ... I went through all of them last year as well\nAnd I will say now that I've been through however many it's been ten twenty over the last five seasons I've been covering this team\nI'm nothing still has been bigger than that one year ago in Chicago at Wrigley Field when they went to that first world series\nAnd twenty nine years and you can steal the activist sense of relief in the room and the cool thing was the visiting clubhouse in Chicago at Wrigley Field is too small so they held the celebration in the workout room which is much bigger and they're drinking out of the cops and kicking it hit that three home run game\nA it was a lot that was the biggest the most amazing what I've been a part of tonight was was big it was probably second or third on the list\nBut there was this sense an unfinished business we still have four more to go we still have not reached our goal or in this one that I Would say in years past and celebration fast\nDo aren't there for them be CLA joined us right now is that guilt show CBS Sports radio we knew going into that game last night that hater was going\nAnd just right now and is that guilt chose to be a sports radio we knew going into that game last night that hater was going to get into the ball game and stay in the ball game for quite some time\nHe ended up going three innings by it ends up working in the Dodgers advantage somehow because they were up to one you got an out of the way early\nAnd also you had that change where they bringing Kiki hockey game or into the game and then also uh you move Taylor to left field and tailor make the biggest catch of the game or later on a few innings after that\nYeah and I heard that in this lead up to this segment that that you claim he sounded that Chris Taylor catch that definitely was a game changer in this game\nA so we'll go back to the first year of your first comment about hater entering into this game seven and just the way the theory and has been and I didn't want to stay or one run lead per se but any team that I I felt built up at least the two to three run lead\nOr at least by the third or fourth inning was going to go on to win this game\nI felt like whoever had that kind of base to then go to the bullpen would be able to take care of it now it's the growers had built you know two three run leave like they add add in game three of this series or or kind of like last night uh you would've seen hate or maybe a little bit later to shut it down with him trailing two to one\nSo we'll see how that goes when the series shifts to LA I doubt it's going to be a hundred degrees here in LA like the world series was um you know last season so I don't think the ball will carry as far as you saw there was no home runs in the three games of the ... the Dodgers stadium\nOr between the Dodgers and brewers so\nThat could take a couple of guys out of the game I heard Alex Cora\nAnd that's a great story line two out of all these storylines in the world series former Dodger teammates Alex Cora in Dave Roberts who went to the red Sox won a World Series now will be in opposing dug out as managers as there are two teams fight off I'm looking forward to seeing that as well\nBut I heard Alex course say that I think he's going to start a JD Martinez so we can get him in the game when they play those three games and the national league a and then\nThem out in second possibly\nEggs and maybe put ... second which I thought was interesting so that is going to be interesting as you saw in this and healthy yes it was a chess match between the Dodgers and breweries especially with that that\nSacrificing of the pond in game five were weighed Miley starts and then comes out after one batter it was the biggest chess match as far as the baseball game is concerned that I've ever seen covering a team as a journalist\nOr as far as the seven game series and all the move they made before I'd never seen anything like it and that only ... only see that in the national league\nBecause of of the pitcher spot having to bat and I wonder now that gave robbers has been through that kind of mental battle through seven games I've out corals he hadn't played it before or in those three games that will be in the NFL or is up to to compete with him and that kind of chess moves gained\nMichael Jordan be sailing Michael great job get some sleep thank you my

CBS Sports radio Calvin ... thanks for the time and how are you\nKnow world thanks for having me\nBut we appreciate your coming on Calvin the last two weeks I've been very impressive you start off the year one in three you beat the lines and then lose three in a row to the dolphins brown didn't jaguars but the last two weeks you started off with the victory up again then bring them back it up with the Indianapolis Colts so how did this team turning around with two victories last two weeks\nAgo just really you know work together and just say let's get back to fundamental\nLet's get back to what we know well you know I don't want to see what it's about her\nAnd not worry about your opponent doesn't worry about taking care of what we've got to pick her come to practice every day could in the war but they are welcome execution they practice and they ... they were gonna have to do the past two weeks and have a great accounting for the public within this week\nGoing into that cult game you talked about what the media about growing up and other team has to start winning games in a row instead of losing a few games in a row last week what did you learn about the team and what do you think they proved with what you had to say prior to the game\nYou know from from that that particular Carlin ... growing up I think basically strap you know I'm going to do that after the game you know last year we were lost that game where you are a couple of points and you know they started to rally at half a little bit of it we found a way to play down the stretch out a way to win the game\nThe ... up a couple of points and you know they started to rally at and half a little bit of it we found a way to a place down the stretch and found a way to what the gate and then you have to take take pride and just find a way to win a game for the national football league is not an easy feat but uh you\nKnow of course both also came into the next day and and showed us a lot of plays at best out this data so you know there's still some room for improvement even after when I get\nWhat do you tell the rookies in the youngsters on this team because you have experience you point in the leagues in two thousand twelve how do you get them to try to buy in and tried to get the most out of this team this year\nYou know just keep growing up and actually you know you can't check your foot off the gas you gotta keep coming in putting the working every single day um you know your body's starting to feel some of the rigors of the season that easy to come into the room or every ... do\nYou know a more cold or hot cup and you know a whole body work you know secretary your body is better than what you thought you were doing you know you've got to ... extra credit for your to your routine in the animal actually see a corporation\nUm if you do that continually every single week of we put ourselves in a position where you know a world where we feel that we've done some things and they put ourself a playoff contention but you know right now our focus is this week uh like I said we got a great opponent coming in this week uh cut the system and then this week\nYou know the young guys understand with estate but you know the veterans understand what's at stake and we have a great opportunity in front of you know coastal talked about going into you know this the homes that and find a way to win three of them went in it for fans and went in for us you know at least that's what makes the proof so now we got it right up until then coming up this week and we'll see we'll do it\nIt's not going to Calvin beach in junior right now on CBS Sports radio it's Zach yelled show so much of this year is obviously about the quarterback and Sam Darnell when you take a quarterback that young in New York at CERN overall and you start him right away just one of your impressions been so far I've even see quarterback\nIs handled every every step of the way uh with with grace with boys with resilience a got a lot of respect for the kids and how he's\nApproaching the game of focus preparation and then go out and execute it they'll set they so we're in excited for him I'm excited for his career of credit for his growth this year are you know by God as an attack all is to keep them clean as possible to make her job as possible so excited for for what he's going to lead the state right now\nAnd you know it and I know whenever rookie plays in the league any player that plays in this league there's going to be some mistakes in famous had some mistakes but something that impresses me it's a short term memory how was able to put those mistakes behind him and then go make a play on the next rise\nOr that's why I mentioned resilient you know because that's exactly what he is right now and I really enjoy that about all of his ability to to to come into the huddle a good players that play\nSo caught up play uh with the same type of confidence that it costs with earlier um and I like I said ... ah that about him a lot um you know he's just going to say to gorillas as a player it as a ... so excited to be a be hit with them you know start a journey\nLet's see like in the huddle\nHe's confident man you know to be honest with you he's confident enough to be you know sometimes I look at how old are you is that because we his agents would come into auto where he has his peers who are much older than he is a play the game for you know in a more years and he has to come in to the huddle within have confidence in\nAnd be able to to to ask a more of his teammates\nOr that's great to have that at the age of ... though he's going to continue to get better and better or as he gets more reps\nWhen you were going into camp and there was a chance that he could win the job and I said hey if he goes earns the job they should start in week one did you sense that confidence right away and like when did you get a feeling this guy was going to be a special place\nI mean he's been that way since he's walked in you know he's been quiet who's been poised um you know he had the quiet confidence since he wants yeah so you know ... you solve that or did they walked in the door so you know that wasn't it wasn't like he just turned ... since you've gotten a job so he's been the same guy says he wants to the door can really appreciate that about ...\nHow long does it take to build chemistry 'cause you're always do the chemistry with us some new names and clearly a new quarterback in the offing salon trying to improve each and every week just wears the chemistry out of this all sense of you know right now\n[noise] you know I mean this this is the national football league may you don't have time to like try to think about how you could do chemistry he's got to do it like you'd have spent time each other\nYou got to go places with one another you got to go with one another you got to get to know each other's families um and that stuff happens organically and hatch happens naturally a but it's one of those things that just has to happen for for a team supplies and for for the chemistry among the the us to continue to get better\nTalking Calvin beach a junior right now jets play the Vikings this Sunday at one PM eastern or ... show on CBS Sports radio we look at that all friends of mine\nAnd we talk about protecting Sam and how that's the most important first four games ear off ... tense act in the last two only three how was this off into line got better as of late\nStarting to trust each other more you know a more than anything just starting to trust each other trucks can wear what we see what our eyes trusting each other practice which translates into the game I mean there's been around each other more you know a kind of started a little rocky but\nYou know kind of federal uh settle down a little bit and then starting to catch a groove of again we've got a great difference coming in this week they'll have had you know or some great defense was the past couple of weeks and it's now just putting a planet execution on display or this Sunday at at Sunday to ...\nDo you think this is going to be something that you could maybe continue into the future what this group because that was a group that going into this year there was a lot of question marks especially when you started rookie quarterback\nSo if you've got to talk to to to Mike and it goes about honestly I'm you know my my job is to play on Sundays and make sure that the quarterback is clean make sure that was also a lot of everything that we can and the game or to put ourselves in a position where we can learn about effectively and efficiently\nOf and then let the chips fall where they fall we're right now in my focus is making sure that we as a unit are doing everything we can to produce one\nWhat's it like to play for coach balls simple\nHe he makes it very plain you know I'm a no pun intended\nAh but it it it's one of those things you get you know

happened last night and one team was looking to punch their ticket\nAnd when the money's going to punch their tickets to the world series where they have a date with the Boston Red Sox Tuesday night at Fenway Park\nAnd Boston well the way this one turned out it most\nRed Sox Tuesday night at Fenway Park and Boston well the way this one turned out\nIt wasn't as exciting as you would have thought it would have been going in and I thought it was going to be closer game like three one three to where you had the dominant bullpen of the brewers may be prevailing late\nWell the Dodgers had different plans of that now Christian yell at you will be the MVP of the NFL hit a home run in the bottom of the first thing to make it well nothing but that was the last mistake Walker ... made the entire night when foreign two thirds with seven strike out\nAnd the top of the second the Dodgers get the momentum back they quiet the building down in Milwaukee Machado lays down a bond\nWas the last time you saw baseball player bond\nAnd Machado who is not Mr hostile if you ask him\nWell and it was fake news because he ended up hustling down the first baseline he gets on base than the next batter later is ah Mr Ballenger and balance your head said to run blast to make it to one and from there on out you're wondering why and where you're going to see hate or in the ball game\nAnd Josh later comes in the ball game earlier than you would have expected we told you yesterday when we were on the air that he was going to go through your innings he does go three innings big comes into the game earlier than you are expecting and it ends up being a win for the Dodgers\nBecause when the Dodgers are facing hater Dave Roberts makes a smart decision by putting ... in the game for Peterson to get the match up and then you ... seconds and you move Chris Taylor to left field\nAnd yes I get ... when\nThe third the fourth and fifth\nOnly allowed one ... he was spectacular he's the best reliever in baseball but then he was out of the game by the bottom of the fit because his ... was due up in the line up\nThe pinch hitter strikes that makes it to al ... gets a double and then yellow is up but yellow which gets robbed by Chris Taylor\nAs Chris Taylor makes a spectacular defense apply to keep the game\nAt two on but Taylor probably would not a bit in left field if it wasn't for the fact that John Tanner was put into the game so when you look back at the hater situation hater situation the Dodgers\nThey benefited from it because you only got one ... when John from something amount but they were up to one so hater was in the game and\nThe brewers couldn't get anything going for him they couldn't get off fence for his brilliant performance on the ... there were three innings they had a chance to the fourth of the lead on double but nothing could not get the guy across the plate and after that first sitting home run by al urge the\nMilwaukee Brewers couldn't get it wrong for the rest of the game\nAnd Taylor and left ended up being huge defensively and then also meant them from the Taylor catch up comes the Dodgers in the top part of the sex and put it gets a three one shot\nSo we get the three Ron shot Dodgers go up by one\nYou got later into the game company Jansen gets four out cleaning cars shot comes out in the pen for three hours to close it out and then I and the Dodgers back to back years\nAre now going to a World Series and they won the pennant that was the bond series Milwaukee one game on the Dodgers with the ... home run when gave to Milwaukee\nWins game three in LA Dodgers when four and five Ballenger walk off the endgame for curse Shaw with the dominance in game five that goes back to Milwaukee for game six Milwaukee prevails but then in seven the more it's variance team\nDid win and the Dodgers too\nEven though I thought the birds you know when the series going in and the Dodgers probably the better team of the better team won the series from top to bottom the Dodgers are probably a better team and they ended up winning the series and now you have a date Dodgers in red\nSox and I think this is going to be a fun series you have the two big markets

eventually ministry our mission is to help Christians by sharing God's principles subscription and also to encourage others to know the saving grace of Jesus Christ join us for the next half hour as we teach\nAnd welcome to our broadcast thanks for making us a part\nOf your day today before we begin we'd like to offer you our free booklet based on today's program called\nBlinded by emotions you can request a booklet on our website absolutely free principles for living dot org or call us at eight eight eight eight eight one thirty four eleven that's eight eight eight eight eight one thirty four eleven\nDo you struggled to keep your emotions in check your mood at the mercy of the things that happened to you day to day where are you living in the peace and joy if the gospel we don't have to be controlled by our own emotions in fact we must learn to control them in debt let's listen\nYou think of emotions what do you think of is there something positive or negative\nWhen I think of emotions I think of the word motion and I think of something moving one I think of the word emotion I tend to think of what is that moves me so what is it that moves you what is it that gets you going\nSometimes emotions can cause us to not move at all such as when we freeze because we're afraid to act we often think of how emotions make us feel more times than not they are what motivates us that can be in a good way or a bad way\nSince the emotions have such tremendous power over people\nI Want to discuss some of the ways in which our emotions set us up and some of the ways in which our emotions put blinders on our eyes\nAnd cause us to react in ways that we would not have acted if we were prepared to face the emotional blitz is that we didn't see coming\nIn proverbs twenty nine eleven it says fools give full vent to their rage but\nThe Y. bring calm in the end we are often motivated by motions when time is wheezing us\nOur ability to keep ourselves in check will always be more difficult to do when we were running short on time\nThat's why when it comes to sports there are so many emotions tied to the game if there was a time clock involved in Philip in for six that says do not be anxious about anything but in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving\nPresent your requests to God\nIf the Bible tells us not to be anxious for anything why do we put ourselves in situations that causes that very thing to exist in our lives\nJust think about the whole gaming industry we love emotions so much that we artificially create situations in which we can have anxiety just for the sake of entertainment they actually run ads encouraging people to gamble by showing them the winters\nYet all excited when they when they don't even discuss the downside of gambling gamblers wouldn't get addicted to gambling if there weren't any motions tied to revamp\nTheir gambling in but there are emotions that caused great anxiety in us if Jesus said be anxious for nothing do we think maybe he was against gambling just for the sake of gambling\nThere's a big difference between a gamble such as farming where you plan a crop in order to make a living and gambling on an event that we know are stacked against us\nIn the long run gamblers that gamble and events that favor the house we'll lose our emotions can blame this to the truth I\nJust think of the gamble that sets up the slot machine like some kind of a zombie instead they're pulling the him over\nThe truth just think of the gamble that sets up the slot machine like some kind of a zombie and sit there pulling the handle over and over in hope of the big win\nThe coin just fun they throw their lives the way in hope of an easy dollar\nGamblers that are blinded by motions are thinking in the money that they're interested in in reality\nIt has the anxiety that comes with the risk that they're taking that makes them continue to play the game\nEnrollments twelve to it says do not conform to the pattern of this world\nBut be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to test and the true what God's well is is good pleasing\nIt's very obvious that the pattern of this world it's the seek out ways to have fun\nWe shouldn't have to discuss right from wrong we should already know that\nThe problem is that the people that church have become very involved with what they call good clean fun\nHow do you think God would define clean fun what do you think God wants your mind to be occupied on today God says the fields are ready for harvest I Wonder what he thinks of Christians sitting in some game room wasting their time and their money\nBut you Ryan slept up the door of the king's house with all the servants that his lord and did not go down to his house David Was desperately searching for a way to get your Ryan to go to his wife and lay with her\nSo he could say her pregnancy was from your writer\nDavid Was letting the fear in his flash motivating emotionally in second Samuel eleven ten David ask your Ryan did you not come from a journey why did you not go down to your house we have an amazing in an emotional statement made by your RIAA\nIf we didn't know any better\nWe would have thought you're right there was the main God had chosen to be the leader of Israel in seconds ... eleven eleven you're riots that did they let the art in Israel in judo or dwelling intense and my lord Joanne\nAnd the service of my lord aren't camp in the open fields should I didn't go to my house to eat and drink and they live with my wife\nAs you live in as your soul lives I Will not do this thing\nAfter more failed attempts to get your right to sleep with his wife David came up with another plan David sent a letter to Joanne in second Samuel eleven fourteen it tells us what the letter said\nSet you Ryan in the front of the hottest battle and retreat from him that he may be struck down and die\nIt was in that battle that you're rye or was killed\nAnd I'm sure David Was feeling pretty clever when he heard that your Ryan was dead but David now have the spoils\nHe had an opportunity that he may or may not have considered beforehand in second Samuel eleven twenty six twenty seven and it says when the wife of ... heard that you Ryan her husband was dead she mourned for her husband\nIn what her morning was over David sent\nAnd brought her to his house and should we can't his wife and bought him a son but the thing that David had done displeased the lord boy that's an understatement if there ever was one\nDavid Was horrendous example during all of this but God can even overcome art turbo emotionally blinded mistakes if we will just get a grip on ourselves emotionally and get into gone\nAt this time all God wanted from David Was for him to be honest and not to pretend to be someone he wasn't\nOur emotions can get us the huge trouble it is so vitally important that we walk in the spirit when we do we safeguard ourselves from all kinds of havoc\nIn second Samuel twelve one through three the other shoe eventually dropped David Was about to be shown that nothing escapes God the lord sent Nathan today that and he came to him and he said there were two men in one city\nRich and the other poor the rich man had exceedingly many Fox\nIt came to him and he said there were two men in one city one\nRich and the other poor the rich man had exceedingly many Fox and hurt but the poor man had nothing except one little you land\nWhich Arab Barre emerged in a grew up together with him and his children it eight of his own food and drink from his own cop and lay in his booze them\nAnd it was like a daughter to him now David Was being set up emotionally bygone Nathan spoke of a great difference of one that had it all in someone that had a one lane them\nThen Nathan tells David that the lamb was a friend of his children there was like a child of the family they lend to give a verdict that would come back and hold him David ... mostly blind\nBut now he was about to be emotionally blind sided in second Samuel twelve foreign Nathan said and the driver came to the Richmond refused to take for his own flock\nFrom his own heard to prepare one of the way from men would come to him but he took the poor man's lion and prepared for the man who had come to him\nIf we're mood buyer of flesh there's no end were bad that it can do David had lost his focus and God was about to bring everything back into twenty twenty vision\nIn seconds Daniel twelve five through six that says\nSo David anger was greatly aroused against the man and he said the Nathan as the lord lives the man who has done this show surely by\nAnd he showed restore four fold for the line because he did this thing and because he had no pity\nThis picture was designed to bring the active David indoor very bright light in second Samuel twelve a seven through Nineteen and goes on to say that Nathan said to David you are Batman\nLot said the lord God with Israel I pointed you king over Israel and I delivered you from the hand of soul\nI gave you your master's house and your masters wives into you're keeping in gave you the house of Israel in judo\nAnd if that had been too low I Would have given you much more why have you despise the commandment of the lord to do evil in his site so what caused David to turn to his flash\nIt all started with runaway desires and then fearful emotions set in Davis eyes had turned to himself and that's what caused him to have this spiritual breakdown everything that self centered in us can bring against someone\nWas brought to David he was God's servant and he finally repented and second Samuel twelve Thirteen and says so David said the Nathan sin against the lord in genesis we see the fall of Adam in last fall what God had to put in place for men's benefit was stripped from Maine\nAnd this happened because of one man's disobedience but thanks be to God that Jesus came and made her way for men to get back to guard\nOur emotions are driven by the things that happen around us we can either let them get to us and cause us to react to them or we can let God teach us how to walk in the spirit so we can remain\nIn control of ourselves regardless\nIn closing I Would like to remind everyone the Bible allows us to see God's Plan redemption\nAnd see that he is working on our behalf\nGot understands as very well [noise]\nHe's made it possible for us to live in peace and our emotions can be controlled\nMade God be going fine today tomorrow and forever [noise]\nYou've been listening to author and

really didn't have that and would be good especially when you have such fragmented families today right um you know my story is not unique in today's culture of the norm not having a mom and dad\nAnd you know you could really benefit from talking to wise or older people about what's next I didn't have that that I could call and say hey\nWhat's going on her dad what should I Do say it's a lonely place to be it is and if you don't have somebody got a call and say help me\nAnd and because of what you're describing a lot of men and women too who who ought to be mentors and ought to be passing on their wisdom they're afraid of the process\nBill let me ask you this though I'm sure there are some couples listening um individuals who have had a pretty good go of it they really haven't experienced dips per se and they might have been married quite a while\nWe get mail like that especially when we talk about difficulties and say we just haven't experienced that that probably is like the eighty twenty ... you might have a twenty percent of couples who are sailing along pretty well um\nBut it's the eighty percent we want to talk about\nRace and and my guess is that those couples winning pretty well prepared\nRight they knew what was coming I that's why it was great to have wonderful training you know building went to seminary and Bible college and in part of that was learning about the seasons I have a couple of life and you know you jumped into God's word Andy ... says there's a time and the season for everything so God where it prepares you for CNN\nAnd so when you have mentors and we have some good training like listening to focus on his family\nThen you're not surprised and so some of the natural transitions I don't have to become storms or obstacles because you know what you're dealing with and you know what to do because you have to senior tool box\nWhich are helpful or you talk about a woman's midlife re evaluation somewhere around twenty eight to thirty eight I was shocked by that because in today's culture a lot of twenty eight to thirty some things aren't even married yet way right that it has\nTo keep the Justine I'm but the stage of life will happen no matter what age you are and the stage will happen and how it hits is if this is one that we don't talk about a lot\nAnd it typically heads and after you've been married for a few years some people ... like the seven year itch and so it hits us after a few years and it usually you're you're kind of in a mommy mode she kind of have the new motherhood thing down a little bit\nAnd maybe he was in like one of those kids into kindergarten\nOr so she had just enough time to think huh why am I on the face at this club is it just isn't laundry\nIs that why I'm here you know or how do I balance it all career family married oh I feel like I'm just spinning plates like what is the meaning of life that is the big\nQuestion but it happens where it was shocking as it happens earlier for a woman than it does a man a man is the forty forty five fifty midlife crisis and for us it's easy it's the gold medallion\n[laughter] I've never once did you ever where one of the night yet yeah [laughter] ... but I'm\nIn pain will have to confirmed this but it it seems to me that it did the woman sink kicks off this morning for one of two reasons either I Know I'm done having kids so now what's next in my life war I put off having kids and how I get adjusted\n... am I going to hurry up and have children or am I just let it go and be show\nHow often times it is connected to our biology\nAnd speak to the woman who is choosing career right now I'm you know her and her husband and made that decision you know gene and gene did biochemistry she loved learning and she was teaching labs at a local university and really enjoyed that\nAnd that was in her mid thirties and then you know it was like wow we've got to have children the biological clock is going in and boom you know thankfully the lord blessed us with two boys rather quickly\nAnd uh but a lot of women are struggling with that that's a phenomena that is today and it's not just should I be at home it's work it's home it's balancing all of it does that put pressure on for that midwifery or the\nWay it does put pressure on is what a woman is really asking she you know you might\nThis myth that transition going on if you like walk into the living in like a cup at a place and you say I\nAm either on that sees this mess I mean more spiritual than that so you don't yeah you know you go to the to the kitchen in these loudly put away the dishes and\nIs it on the one that sees this mass more spiritual\nThan that so you don't you know you go and take the ... to the kitchen in these loudly put away the dishes and some raid soul says or would you like some help don't want to put anybody out or anything yeah so like overstated emotions and that's a little bit of assigned that's overstated\n[laughter] no [laughter] do you like [laughter] [laughter] yeah you find yourself\nBeing more emotional than you normally whatever your norm is you find yourself to a little bit more edgy\nAnd the reason why you have this question your heart and that is why am I on the face of this club and what am I supposed to do here now next that will make the best impact it's important because this is the number one time I'm In a woman's life when she's statistically most vulnerable to an affair\nAnd we were like what and the fair like how am I supposed to work another sport person into my life I'm already busy enough\nBut women don't mean to the reason they don't mean to spend much time with a co worker you know using him as a sounding board that don't mean to spend much time with their boss late hour centrist into an affair they don't mean to get a you know Facebook and drift into an effect you know the Internet when the number one ways now\nFor people to reconnect 'em and blow their life apart in a second and then I don't mean to\n'em but the dissent guarding their heart and the reason why they're so longing for this connection with their spouse\nUm is that they had that question you know what is my value right now and why am I here and what's my unique contribution that's what's on the heartbeat of that woman in that midlife evaluation time\nWise woman instead of drifting off and making emotional connection that will undermine her whole life wise woman grabbed her busy has been by the house and say I love us too much to drift apart\nHey let's set some date nights I Need you for sounding board she'll grab a mentor and she'll say have you ever felt this way at mental can help walkers through finding her unique nets and\nShe'll get some girlfriends around like let's do Bible study together and figure out what's going on in the season of life and ... that we all means\nAnd the big challenge during this time is most people on earth their desires are bigger than their abilities\nSo you mentioned your wife she was affected in her career but then she also wants to have a family and so she has these desires that all take up time and all take a focus and all require energy and it it comes down to I just don't have enough hours in the day of energy and my soul to do everything that's on my heart to do\nAnd will upset yeah and I said for women particularly the the the need to be two people yes it is a stressful thing it's impossible to cheat but the demand for being to people or three people is always there let me ask you to respond to a listener who wrote into focus\nAnd I think as a very specific question that puts this into context\nOr she wrote to us and said I feel like I made a mistake by marrying the man I did were not the same people we were when we got married we want different things have different morals and values\nAnd disagree on how to raise our kids are we ever do any more if I Am I supposed to continue in this miserable relationship\nUm what would you say to her what is her hope\nWell first of all I Would say to her\nEvery relationship is one breakthrough away from being a great relationship ... and when things get out of kilter things get us out of sync\nPeople start to think ah to tragedy it's never going to turn we disagree on everything and it starts this downward spiral begin starts to feed on itself ... and so now everything is evidence that this is a bad relationship\nAnd in reality all it takes in marriages one decision can turn everything because obviously this couple used to be in sync and they they loved each other and they had to agreements that they were moving forward on and now probably my guess is the stress of life has pushed them to a different place\nThis focus on the family broadcast will continue in just a moment\nIn the back of my mind I didn't believe it could happen\nHurting husbands and wives and share their stories of renewed hope from attending focus on the family's home

critic and author who explores the past present and future of video games in his book bit by bit\nOn video games transformed by world\nAndy's right last year's televised championship of the game league of legends drew a staggering thirty six million viewers about Fifteen million more than watch the cubs beat the Indians in game seven of the world series and five million more than tuned into the designs game seven of the NBA Finals\nUrban says whether we all know does it or not video games have become as major and entertain been medium is anything else\nThere is an perhaps too easy parallel to draw with the history of cinema that's a useful analogy and it takes us pretty far but not all the way\nWhere the early days of cinema it was merely a technical achievement that cinema was great because all of a sudden they're moving pictures and all of a sudden they're sound with them and then she there's color and all these different technical advances\nHelped people who are thinking in terms of artistry and self expression they started to use these tools to their advantage Orson Welles certainly didn't invent cinema but\nHe revolutionized he demonstrated that it is a valid artistic platform or art form\nWe saw the same sort of development with video games were beginning in Nineteen fifty eight at a government lab on Long Island we had a game called tennis for to that by any definition today's is crude and frankly boring but every generation added to the technical prowess at our fingertips\nOf course we're growing popularity video games have very famously been scored the game doom has been blamed for embolden ing the Columbine shooters in the months leading up to the massacre\nMore recently parenting groups have come out against games like call of duty and mortal combat for exposing children to increasingly realistic violence\nUrban says this isn't so much of a problem with video games as it is something the entire culture needs directed with\nPeople don't understand that video games are just another form of expression there still seen as\nSomething other than what we're accustomed to from our storytelling media and a large part of that I think has to do with the perception of video games as violent most people when we think of video games we think of\nGuns and militaristic shoot 'em ups first person shooter games and it's true that those are often the most popular and best selling games every year just as the most popular and best selling films tend to be you know quite violent but at the same time just as though there's a lot of violence at the cineplex there\nAre also the local art house theaters showing great thoughtful quiet contemplate of films video games work the same way there are an enormous number of really beautiful smaller games are independent games made by individuals who are just trying to get some idea across\nUrban says it's important for people to see video games as more than just boil it uses there's so much more to the vast library of games than just first person shooters\nVideo games can teach empathy they can teach social skills video games can teach high level problem solving they can be as maddening in some regards is the most difficult crossword puzzles they can teach us motor control in some regards\nThere are frivolous video games they're our video games that are as junkie and has brain candy like as the worst Hollywood spectacles\nBut there are also video games that are\nAre working at a deep intellectual level and making us rethink the world and our own assumptions about it\n... it was a child in the Nineteen seventies the light bulb that video games could be more than just disposable entertainment window off in his mind when he was just a kid\nIt's one of those experiences that right now we take it so for granted it's so mundane that we no longer think about it there was a game called adventure on the Atari twenty six hundred\nAnd this was the first game where there was an avatar on the screen that represented us as players\nAnd of course this is how the U.S now we have avatars and every game we play where all these characters and all these games\nBut the first time that we saw that I saw that was this little innocuous square on an Atari twenty six hundred that all the sudden that was me somehow on the screen and I'm also sitting on the floor the living room with the controller the joystick in my hand\nThat represents a fundamental shift in what it means to be human and that sounds like a grand statement but I I think it's true that Walt Whitman famously said I Am a large I contain multitudes and he was speaking about how each of us as an individual\nHas all these different voices and personality is an attitude than we are complex\nDifficult creatures\nWith that little square and adventure for the first time it wasn't that I contain multitudes it's that I Am multitudes I Am more than one thing at one time\nAnd as time has gone on bourbon says that experiences become even more engaging is the video game industry has grown more and more vast\nThe greatest strength of the video game medium is that diversity of games and kind of games and that goes along with the diversity of the players themselves everybody plays games now every demographic every age group it's a very exciting thing\nAnd I think that speaks to what makes this medium slightly different from books which I Love obviously I've written a book there's an inter activity to reading there's an interactivity to watching a movie I don't think we're merely passive viewers\nBut when we play a video game there can be a social aspect\nThat is enormously rewarding and I think that communal experience of telling and sharing and experiencing stories together is very exciting\nUrban says that ultimately like films before them video games that transcended their status as a technical achievement and become something more powerful\nThe general idea that I started with is\nKevin video game be a work of art has the definition of what we consider art broadened enough or had video games progressed enough as a medium that they've become artful and what I've discovered is that the ladder is certainly true\nThat there are video games right now that are doing all of the things that great movies do in great books do great TV does we're seeing that more and video games now across any platform you might have at your disposal their artistic games that you can find that are going to make you think about the world differently and think about yourself differently\nSo that you know

even a sore throat might be blamed on a person's weight rule says many people seem to think fat shaming has value perhaps especially with the doctors doing\nThere seems to be this ongoing public perception that maybe wait bias or stigma is not such a bad thing maybe it will motivate or incentivize people to leave right\nWhen you look at the research on that we actually see that exactly the opposite is true that being a target of weight stigma or bowling or discrimination leads to a range of negative emotional and physical health consequences till we see that this increases the risk of\nThings like depression and anxiety\nA suicidal thinking but we also see that it leads to a range of maladaptive or unhealthy behaviors like increasing calorie intake disordered eating binge eating bought into physical activity\nThere are now longitudinal studies showing that over time people who are discriminated against because of their weight actually have an increased the likelihood of obesity weight gain over time and we also see that this leads to heightened physiological stressed\nSome people actually kind of believe that shaming someone and I don't think that doctors intentionally mean to shame someone but that is the end result\nThat's simply not an effective motivator and in fact it leads people to feel like well why should I take care of myself I'm really not a very good person anyway and my doctor already assumes that I'm not doing what I should be doing\nStudies show that there are medical consequences as well\nPatients to proceed that they have been stigmatized about their weight by a doctor\nHave less trust and that Dr they tend to have really impaired treatment outcome for that for example they might not lose as much weight if they're trying to lose weight they're more likely to avoid future health care services like preventative health care services they're more likely to avoid future medical appointments\nAnd we also have the kind of from that providers find evidence that doctors and they actually spend less time in appointments with a patient capital BC compared to us in our patients that they provide less health education they don't tend to build as much emotional rapport\nAnd they report having less desire to help these patients compared to the interpretation\nKatz says millions of patients simply quit going to the doctor rather

that she went to back in those days wag that admonishing finger Everytime and everything that was ever bothering her better health all she ever heard was lose weight which obviously she couldn't do if she could have lost the weight and kept it off she would have done that she just stopped going to the doctor and tragically in her case\nShe developed breast cancer but wasn't being screened when she first presented with it it was very far advanced\nAnd she died very young a vet a static breast cancer that could have been caught early and treated if she'd been going to doctors routinely and specifically because of the harsh treatment for weight she didn't go\nSo what can medicine due to break the cycle cats in pools say it has to start in medical school my teaching would be doctors to be more aware of personal attitudes and biases and the causes of obesity are a lot more complex than mere personal responsibility gator says doctors also need to learn to focus less on weight alone\nFocus on the behaviors that enhanced health regardless of a person size and shape so it's really a model that\nTurns attention away from the number on this scale or your BMI and instead says

the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... on the king has absolve them and in fact has put NBS as he's known in charge of the overhaul of Saudi intelligence\nI think it stretches credulity to believe that the crown prince wasn't involved in this and I think that's the way they're going to write this off\nAnd people in Saudi Arabia ought to be aware of when you're told what to do you go into it and then they'll execute you and and put all the blame on someone else there is no way Fifteen people were sent from Saudi Arabia turkey\nTo kill a dissident without the approval of the crown prince and

NBS sideways for a while and putting a an adult\nIn charge of Saudi Arabia such as well how did they not have the intelligence chief who was widely admired but now he's under house arrest because the NBA or even the Adel al Jabari that foreign minister and used to be the ambassador here again highly regarded and very Hispanic and I\nMean you have a much better sense of this when I Do do you think that the president were to go to the king and say that or to the ruling family as I say that that we have a boat weed out we can apply pressure\nI don't think we have a vote that yes I think we can apply pressure\nAnd it is also true obviously it there are a major financial transactions pending not just with aerospace firms\nBut also with high tech firms I think the modernization program and I actually think that's how would you agree with that was going in the right direction that was the excesses that are derailing it and I think Saudi Arabia wants me to a modern future so they they better do a course correction here\nMark what struck about the realities in Congress that used to be your job but uh until very recently as the legislative affairs director for President Trump\nAs we were discussing with Rand Paul he can within four votes last year of blocking an arms sale to the ... what do you think are the prospects for any future arms sales in the foreseeable future and and how tough do you think\nCongress because a lot of Republicans are talking top on those two how tough for you than they are prepared to get with a ...\nI think the prospects for any future sales are quite them but I actually think the prospects are greater than perhaps in her paws indicating that Congress would actually take proactive steps to unwind the most recent uh arms deal\nI think very little that transactions gone through I think you could see move by Congress to move forward\nParticularly if there's a vacuum from the administration responding quickly in responding to sort of early so I think that actually the risk there is actually much more significant than our policy and it's what Congress can do in the near term and what about other sanctions I think that's an ... that\nThey go together Chris because of the administration steps forward it takes sanctions that will lower the pressure on Congress to act but ... doesn't do that that I think you'll see of a vacuum in which Congress steps forward\nAnd looks to move more quickly perhaps even as soon as the as the lame duck session\nChuck this is personal for you because ... was a colleague of yours at the Washington Post your reaction to the Saudi account and to President Trump's seeming acceptance of that Saudi account so far\nWell let's take the Saudis account first it reminds me of that famous phrase from Watergate to modify limited hang\nA this is what you do when you've been caught your covers been blown and there's really no denying it any more she was a little bit of the truth out where you try to reshape a more plausible cover story remember they had been saying that you're ... left that consulate alive that had been their\nPrevious view of the matter so the um the story is because the speaker and everyone else here said is is not a credible story it's they're desperate attempt to preserve the the crown prince and his position and by the way they are even willing to sacrifice apparently some fairly senior officials that leads to the\nExtent of scapegoating them and and firing them\nUm but uh the trouble with President Trump's reaction to this so far from my point of view has been um but it's taken him a long time to declare that this was evil in stupid as first reaction was something like well you know it's not an American citizen and it's not on our soil\nThat was probably lead consistent with some things he said in the campaign about how you know we Americans we kill a lot of people and so on she's got a lot he's dug himself a de Paul I'm afraid on that point and I don't think he's all the way out of it yet mark\nI agree with what the caution was saying before that there's there's a lot here they are trying to balance I think the president tried to give them a little bit of the day the president came out in the Washington Post and said he does not believe they count as to what they've said\nA was a result of a fistfight or he's acknowledge the incredulous that but I Do think as well that there's a lot that they're trying to balance here the the the Iran funding and Hamas and Hezbollah is killing westerners continually throughout\nThe middle east and Saudi Arabia is our ally that is a challenge that we need to navigate the administration needs to step forward they need to be more aggressive or else Congress will act I do\nBelieve that I I Want to bring the congresswoman in Iran that because I thought what what Senator Paul so it was very interesting which is that we've over\nEstimate the importance of Saudi Arabia an underestimate our leverage over them that if they if we buy oil from them they sell the oil to us and as he pointed out are their air force has completely uh uh the based on American planes if we held up a weapon and spare parts they be grounded than a month\nWell effect with war in Yemen which is the largest humanitarian catastrophe on a planet right now\nUh shows there in capacity as a fighting force a despite our weapons which they have paid off for and so I Do think we have leverage I wanted to say though that can cause challenging however his name is pronounced\nWas about to be a journalist a scholar at the Wilson Center highly regarded in town and the irony of all of this is that he was writing about the modernization program in a positive way he was critical of\nNBS screen extreme behavior but positive about the program and they need people like him or to apply the direction they're going in and they need the United states final thought\nThe Russians tried to kill to people in Great Britain we joined with Britain we put in selected sanctions were pretty severe\nHuh I think just challenging the principle that people can't go around the world killing people is a good thing the president's going to have to find a way to have a big enough hammer the selective and read all\nThe people can relax and say we're going we're getting the right signal through to them for the Congress will react with even bigger and more and in a way it could really damaged relationship\nAlright panel thank you will uh will see a little bit later in the program up next we're going to take a look at one of the closest

J. N. G.\n[noise] I Know a lot [noise] of Kavanaugh\nLaw and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nPresident Trump now and there was final mid term election blitz tried to fire up his base up or what he thinks are the hot button issues and we're back now with a paddle alright Speaker Gingrich what do you think of the president's strategy in these final weeks\nBefore the election the issues that he's setting and the effort is made up there but you know he's been on the campaign trail saying when you go to the voting booth\nPretend act as if I'm On the ballot\nWell normally I Would say that's not a good idea but I think in this environment with this president it's the only was the only way you can campaign\nA means is that big a force has a bigger presence\nAnd the truth is he's mobilizing his base and he's giving them orange with him and when they say look this is jobs versus mobs they're forty million people who pick that up a coffee than It's MORNING user when he says this is about traveling on the campaign and and the caravans are forty million people picking up the next\nSo what you're saying it's just going to be in this election\nWhen he says this is about Kevin on the campaign and and and the caravans forty million people picking up the next ...\nSo what you're saying it's just going to be in this election is going to be nationalized because of Donald Trump whether he says it\nOr not yeah I mean if he's if he had tried to hide the truth is from a lecture in two thousand sixteen on this country has been in a national fight over who's going to run the country and I think that the Kavanaugh event was really historically important because both galvanized the right but also\nIt reminded everyone this is a team sport you know you can test is not a modern touchy gonna vote for humor and you are right down the list of every registered Democrat and then get up and say I'm really different the only question of desk was ...\nA new Fox poll this week I asked voters water their top issue is one of the most concerned about here are the top results health care at fifty eight percent\nThen the economy with fifty for President Trump with fifty one and then immigration and Supreme Court nomination is tied at forty six percent these are the top was extremely important to your belt truck\nLooking at that issue set which party do you think benefits most\nAh I'm In a cop out and so they both but I have an explanation it'd be very interesting if you differentiated within each issue how the parties view them so Republican voters would put immigration where the top democratic voters were put health care where the top\nTo see a lot of messaging all over the country on this issue of pre existing conditions you had that discussion with Martha McSally Democrats will understand eighty percent even Republicans favor protection or preexisting conditions\nThey've got uh some elements to work with on that so they're pushing very hard to get out their base this caravan I almost think that Trump's campaign paid for their care of him\nAway where we let us not to say that because they suggested the Democrats did and I I I'm just kidding but it's been a windfall getting two weeks before the ... it's a windfall\nFor him he's now incorporated into his campaign bottom line here is that both parties have settled on the strategy of base mobilization\nAnd they're using these issues that are hottest with their bases [noise] she's up for all right well\nLet's talk about the camera ban which is headed from Honduras and Guatemala now a lot of them thousands of them on a bridge literally on a river between Guatemala and Mexico when President Trump is trying to use\nThat issue to fire up the base bought a according to the latest Fox poll immigration not a clear winner for Republicans when asked slightly different issue what should happen to illegal immigrants now working\nIn the U.S twenty two percent said deport as many as possible Seventy percent say set up a system for them to become legal so mark writ large how does the immigration issue play in loose in this campaign\nI think it's a huge a winning issue for the president and the Americans want border security even to that last question the president offered a pathway to citizenship for the DACA participants always asking for Democrats to come to the table and border security issues\nAnd so I think this in the ... for the ... what about family separation which was an explosion when it happened\nSure it's an explosion but it's also policy this play Democrat administrations as well because Congress has not passed laws that enabled administration\nTo actually have the tools to handle that situation your hands are tied because either you separate families and you'll out in or you allow them to go free in the United states because the law says within Twenty one days the families have to be adjudicated and the court you're not able to adjudicate that quickly Congress one\nYeah well first Abigail Adams said remember the women on your list of priorities women are out there and force and women are on the ballot in almost fifty percent of the house races and Seventeen percent of the Senate races\nAnd in Arizona two women aren't are a a a competing for senator and I think that this cabinet thing may ask he will base but it also will generate huge numbers of women I was elected in Nineteen Ninety two tier the woman\nRepublican women voted for me in a lean Republican district became Republicans for harm and and that's how I Survived in Nineteen Ninety four when it became the speaker uh and now we're friends go figure but my point is that\nI don't know you said that he said that yet I think\nOn on the caravan ah my parents and John Kelly when he was at the department of homeland security\nSecretary had a better idea they had a summit in Miami in June of twenty Seventeen and the point of it was to provide help to our governments in Central America to combat corruption and to provide for business investment Mexico was part of that conference\nBy my side of the politics of this caravan coming but I Want to and the president saying I'm going to send us troops to the border and shut down the block\nIt's red meat to his base but I think thoughtful people much for for George W Bush's approach to comprehensive immigration reform I support it yeah I Know it failed and I we that's what we need to get back to is\nThat gives way that people we will we will be there you know anybody that I Will get better they

might think so [laughter]\nAnd truth be told both gluten and I'm left in our a protein found naturally in um in plants in ... as far as ... go and do I think there is something people need to avoid I don't I'm I'm unless someone truly thinks they have a sensitivity\nTo certain foods like any I you know we want to respect that and we would want to be kind of systematic about our approach to removing foods from one's diet\nDo you know what a sensitivity to left in is like\nI truly haven't had many people come to me and say that they have elected and sensitivity and I think it it would present probably like most other GI symptoms or there might be some um discomfort floating and maybe some bowel issues with them you know along with it um\nThat said I think um it's a\nIt's maybe not as much of a concern as it's made out to be because ... most foods that are higher and let them like\nBeans um I generally cooked and when they're cooked that leptin is broken down and so it's really not in an issue um and truly than the benefits to eating beans as is\nIs known and in quite good for us so I Would I Would recommend people to eat\nThere are a lot of people do who think that electrons are a problem\nAnd there is a or a best selling book on uh I saw it on Amazon I looked it up when you started talking about when I knew we were going to talk about lessons 'cause I'd never heard of him and it's called the plant paradox the hidden dangers in health\nYou saw it on Amazon I looked it up when you started talking about when I knew we were going to talk about lessons 'cause I'd never heard of him [laughter] that it's called the plant paradox the hidden dangers in healthy foods is cause disease in a way to get some\nKind of virus a cardio vascular surgeon okay um and he says you got to avoid these like to read [laughter]\nIt is doing this or sell a book and the river river already says it's a simple and daunting factor is electrons are everywhere thankfully Dr ... offers simple\nHacks we easily could employed to avoid them including peculiar ... oh ...\n... I Would recommend not doing it if you don't have to\nPower I shop for fruit in season I guess that makes sense because he says that a fruit when it's not a completely ripe can that can change a more electrons and you want to avoid those and swap you're brown rice for your white rice so I guess that's probably okay\nSo well and if I Would say if someone truly doesn't think they have an issue or sensitivity to mountains again which I don't know that we can quantify if anyone would um in fact having brown rice having a whole grain\nWould actually be preferred unless you have a reason um and hopefully medical reason not to\nTo have that so we were in unless indicated otherwise I Would say people should have their whole grains\nI'm so I Would prefer that people would eat their brown rice over their white rice most of the time\nYou can buy this book to know I didn't but there's all sorts of cookbooks to or the will avoid like where is your diet ... actually like it's impossible but they're out there [laughter] and those Kelly Clarkson says I read this show up your doors [laughter]\nThere's issues singer so [laughter] she said my auto immune disease is gone and I am thirty seven pounds lighter because if she's been on the lower left in\nThe it's a ... another fad type of fat diets that if you limit some foods that you we are going to lose weight\nRight and I I think if if you are to look at the if you were to look this up and looking at it like many fad diets it is restrictive in nature and so there are many foods that are eliminated and so when you start eliminating many foods\nThe likelihood of someone losing weight is you know ... is probable and likely to happen and oftentimes when people lose weight and their their body responds differently they do feel better or so\nThat said a lot of the foods that are suggested that eliminated in this leptin free diet are very healthy nutritious food and actually our foods that\nAre thought to be anti inflammatory and and that it's kind of a counter argument that that they some will say they're inflammatory but there's other substances in that food that are actually known to be anti inflammatory quickly it's of that I I Would say it's a fat\nThan you do think there's any good evidence to suggest that\nYou ought to be on a low locked and Lola and I\nKnow I don't think anyone should be on a a low ... diet absolutely because I don't I don't think it's possible\nTo eliminate license because they're in all plants and we want people to eat plants now within the plant family there are certain types of plants that people may have sensitivities to and I think if that's the case again we'd probably want to take a systematic approach to looking at one's diet and and trying to eliminate foods\nI'm In a way that doesn't eliminate all and so and there would be a re introduction of it's because we don't want people to be an overly restricted diet\nUm because that's not um\nAn easy way to live life and in terms of the long term healthy diet and so we want people eat as as many healthy foods as they can and to avoid the ones that truly give them problems and it to for some people that you know just in terms of food sensitivities it might just be\nHow it it might be how it's cooked it might be the dos and the amount that you eat in any one time so often times there's there's ways around to include foods but maybe just within a reasonable way of doing it\nAll right so now we have to talk about probiotics that her last few minutes because as long as we're just rolling yeah what do you have a rounded afraid that she's going to die because of all the robotics for what she heard on the news this morning and so again when you talk about fads but\nCircling back around that probiotics are bad or is that what the message messages\nWell and I think that the messages that it's an emerging science and I think as as more and more research is done in this area where we're seeing maybe a study that is showing benefits and then we may see a study that shows the opposite end and and does not show those benefits and so I think\nThere's much to be learned um about ah the guts micro biome that's the the bacteria that naturally live within us and and its role um in our health and disease states and so I think more to come\nUm that said when we talk about probiotics as being a dietitian I Would bring the conversation back to food and and your yogurt and there's I suppose that made me naturally have some ... and then there's foods that are considered pre by addicts that may or how the set up the environment within your got\n'em to be healthier place to maybe promote a gut Flora that may be health healthier beneficial\nSo the story that your friend her this morning and um that were referring to there's taking the capsules pills that are labeled as probiotics that's one thing and then there's eating a serving of ... or sauerkraut and isn't that line getting blurred\nRight and I think when we step into that arena of taking a ... a probiotic or even having a drink recognizing that this is an unregulated industry and so you can say that you have\nThis strain of of bacteria or this much of this bacteria but quite honestly\nWe don't know that that's absolutely true and we can't say with certainty that that's the best thing or that's going to be an benefit you and I again we've just I don't think we have that science yet and so I think it comes back to\nBuyer beware um and there are some people that report that they feel very well when they take a probiotic capsule or that they may have a drink that contains a pro via out\nNow whether that's a true affect our sets a placebo effect we don't know um I think if it if they're an otherwise healthy person they can they could they can probably practice that safely but that's not to say that that's the case for everyone\nAll right well let me tell our listeners what we're referring to hundreds to report that came out recently in the journal cell which is a peer reviewed journal by the way\nAnd it says quote a cast further doubt on the benefits of the highly commercialized pro biotech products because they are marketed as dietary supplements not drugs brought a buyout extra not need to be approved by the FDA for claims that they ...\nBy other products because they are marketed as dietary supplements nut drugs protests by addicts do not need to be approved by the FDA for claims that they prevent or treat any health conditions and basically these two studies said they did nothing\nMost of the patients who took them they all went they went in one end and came out the other than the other was a concern that your friend referred to was the fact that if you have taken an antibiotic it may actually take your got longer recovery if you take ... robotics\nA versus loving Mother Nature ever away and do it that way\nAnd it'll bring this back to food yeah I think that's exactly right and and eating nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables and whole grains\nAllow your body to have their ... the proper environment and you can play with the ph or how the foods you know the fibers and and how things are digested there to set up an environment that is going to promote maybe a health care Flora are juicing as good movies are\nSo talk about that as the first uh treatments for this disease\nUh so usually the best is to start the patients and these are on this medication early on so when they're kidney function is to normal but ... are still making these fish so if we started early on they have to be on it for several years for decades\nProbably twenty twenty Thirty years and they would gain hopefully several years back and usually we say if someone is progressing fast usually every four years of treatment or what do they the the need for ... by one year\nOr so if you're on it for Twenty years it's probably an extra four or five years or there's not a big a long long studies because it's a chronic disease that means many years to study but so far this is kind of the expectation that's how it's gonna it's gonna need that\nThis loud fantastic [laughter] so how do most patients find out that they have this disease and have you ever seen a case where there wasn't a family history\nOr so mostly the majority of the patients will have someone in the family the type of disease and they've been so familiar with that usually we diagnose by screening with an ultrasound\nOr so you actually look at the kidneys and see this is exactly so we look at the ... we see that this and we have kind of criteria is on how many ... and depending on the age 'cause the ... the older you are the more ... you'd have\nA so to diagnose first we do the screening by ultrasound and then we can do SATs can order him or not to look more at a kind of the the kidney since and how big is the kidney and then we can ... um\nGive the prognosis or how the patient would do depending on how big is this are and if the patient wasn't aware that they had a family history of poly cystic disease what might be their first symptoms what might lead them to come in and see yeah there's about five to ten percent of the patients that\nDon't have a family history so that could be either a new patient so new defect in the gene that just happened in these patients and usually the first sign of either high blood pressure or they get a some kind of leading from the ... so they see blood and urine and they get pain and the ... and they're back\nOr or sometimes and infection in these tests and they get a fever and then the pain and then uh they get this imaging and that you are probably and then they got to got scan or some kind of image and they see the ... and they were diagnosed with\nDo high blood pressure or blood in the yard for people who have poly cystic kidney disease or there's a whole family history and um what is the take away one of those patients need to know\nSo it's really an exciting news for all these stations for example yesterday I offered the treatment for one of the patients who ... who kind of told me this story that even in the Eighteen hundreds\nThey know that they had some kind of ... or some kind of kidney disease and actually when she knew that there's an FDA approved drug she started crying actually for several minutes it was very exciting so for these patients first they need to make sure that they're getting good health care so\nUh in terms of blood pressure and then see if they are eligible for this medication\nOr so not all the patients would need to be treated in fact so some are slow progress or so there are some small enough and small number that they don't need to be on any treatment except just being healthy and high a treat the blood pressure but some patients with progressed very fast and they would need\nA ... in their forties fifties and these fishing would benefit most from the treatment\nSo it's important for these patients to be checked to know where they kind of are are they slower fast progressing and then uh probably screen their kids as well now that there's a treatment we're recommending that be checked for for this disease because there's something to do about it and the drug widely available\nUh probably scream their kids as well now that there's a treatment we're demanding that restricts were for this disease because there's something to do about it in a drug widely available\nIs very unusual just got approved in may there's many logistics around us medication it's regulated by the FDA and we need a lot of luck testing every month for the first year and a half that is available it's kind of expensive drugs will probably have some new and how the insurance would cover and so forth but we're working with all the patients were\nAsking about it and we're kind of a during summer we're in is to kind of for these patients come\nTo their uh can you doctors be checked and those will check their kids and what's next and the research\nA lot of things are exciting actually a meal so we have well great new kidney center and we do a lot of translation of research in a way that we do research in the lab and try to translate that to the patience to to get new treatments so we have a new targets actually move very excited about\nAnd a couple of drugs of medications that could be effective so hopefully that would be the next the good treatment for it became the uh to help not only slow down the tofu cure the disease and not have any ...\nWell that would be fabulous winners are the new drug is called ... and

Redskins and cowboys underway second quarter almost midway through as a matter of fact let's go to Aaron roaster in Washington Aaron\nHey yeah we just got to the end of the first quarter with the red skins leading seven nothing that could prevent such as a than a exchanging punter than\nDJ threats are forcing a fumble around midfield in the middle of the quarter however there are some big developments here at the end of the quarter jak Prescott scrambled on third Downey tried to stretch out dive to get to the first down as he was driving along the ... and came up\nAn athlete but laugh at him right around the head kept them from getting that first down ... press that was slow to get out they took out the blue medical pen and he's in there presumably to be checked out what look what would seem to be\nConcussion so we'll keep you updated on that but that's the big story right now as we start the second quarter the Redskins wait seven nothing\nOh thank you very much Aaron so a duck Prescott decided to go against the slide and he paid the price and right now is out of the game let's go to Ryan Leon in Santa Clara with the rams are on top of the niners are the ball Brian\nYeah they did rights and they turned it over again to turn out of four hundred that result in ten ran point a girly\nThe recipient of a seven year drought scoring run after that turnover where a basically I'm not ready to have the ball ripped out of out of his hand by air and Donald then that right yeah well that will strip the ball before he hit the ground so it results in a short a score for the rams earlier\nThey got seven quite twenty seven year our drive and that culminated in thirty five yard field goal from ... we are a fourteen quite ready to go and the second quarter and attend nothing about the angel is\nNot so big start here for the rams were the only on beating team remaining at seven or no and Todd girlie with Twenty one year orange rushing right now and the touchdown to extend that lead to ten points early on let's go to Craig heist saints and ravens a defensive battle through one quarter in Chile Baltimore today\nWell right now accept so far to go in the second quarter and we've got a three nothing lead for the ravens just a moment ago Justin talker\nMaking good on a a thirty one yard field goal so uh that kept off the Seventeen play sixty three hour drive but at the beginning of this game uh Drew Brees drove the same sixty nine yards and twenty plays he was three for three on Fort down conversions actually one of them was a fake punt on fourth in three ah but\nAh it came down to one another for down decision that they decided to go forward on the bottom for an opponent played turned back over to the ravens when Michael peers picking up the loose fall on the sidelines ah couldn't do anything with it at that point but they do have the long drive in their own right now\nAnd they get on the board on the soccer field also was sick so for the play here and the second quarter breezes six to ten for thirty six yards to Flaco six to twelve for two to three nothing ravens lead\nAll right so the ravens strike first in Baltimore today and you\nKnow for as much as I like watching the sanction for as good as they've been outside of the superdome mayor or a different team\nYou know you want to call them human you want to call them vulnerable to any time that you might like\nUh but they are clearly not as dominant as they are indoors at home and on the road today dealing with some wind in the Baltimore area or not much else but I I I think that could you know certainly play into their game plan today and it obviously did on the first Dr when they went to the pitch\nOn the fourth down a play deep and ravens territory and it came up short has come era bumble\nThe ball in the ravens recovered so right now ravens in front by a score of three nothing rams heavy ten nothing lead over the forty niners and Redskins with a seven to nothing start over the

carry three yards meanwhile yet ran ... twenty three yards washing including seven yards scoring Ron Jerry ... for seven seven yards\nAnd Robert ... ... ... ... ... great again all LA right maybe not forty to go back in\n... all one sided affair and Santa Clara meanwhile the scenes in ravens a trading punches just a second ago let's get more on this one from ...\nDrew Brees throw one yard touchdown pass off ... watching his five hundreds perimeter touchdown pass and then uh Joe Flaco striking quickly coming right back as he hit\nA John Brown four fifty six yards across the middle he took it all the way down to the to yard line so nothing doing on first down act or by the second in three now at the\nThree so second in gold and Flaco right now on the day night at Fifteen hundred twenty five yards Drew Brees ten of fourteen for eighty seven and a touchdown pass but the ravens trying to get on the board here before halftime and see if they can we take the lead right now they ... on the same\nUh seven to three and I'll let you know here are very quickly Ackerman mister rich that fractals passes incomplete\nThank you very much that'll bring up a third and goal after the big fifty six yard play the John Brown a second ago so before a the ravens contempt another play let's go to Aaron poster inland over right now with the Redskins in front of the cowboys here's Erin\n[noise] hey last time I was on I told you about that Prescott going back to the blue medical pet he came back out he seemed fine though he did actually up to them smelling salts before coming back on the field of broadcast caught that came out looked OK including scrambling for a first down on thirty three however the cowboys couldn't get anything going\nEnded up hunting and that just continue some good defense by the Redskins they've held at Eliot to just eight yards on eight carries in Prescott aid for eleven Seventy one yard meanwhile Alex Smith five for seven four sixty one yard and they touched down the Redskins at\nTheir own forty seven yard line right now they waited seven nothing with for twenty eight aftermath\nFine thank you very much Aaron ... in the land over where the Redskins in front of the cowboys a very quiet first have\nSo far for those two teams in both so right now or the winner would take control of the NFC East is with the cowboys are three and three of the Redskins are three and two in the\nEagles are three and four after that lost to the Panthers in which they Luke Twenty one or gave up Twenty one points in the fourth quarter still at a

stalling out late\nWhen you're on the field again my dad was shot up on your ending and you know when it's Russia\nWasn't as productive in the second half\nYou know it's hard to say a combination of things you got to go back and wants to pay but um\nYeah I mean that's just not a way for us to finish the game you know I thought we were\nMoving ball well you know early I'm kinda kinda did some things well that and we know are capable of and then um it's just seemed like we went off the gas has often and\nHow do you go from like this I mean the other similar along with the a couple of weeks ago and now this one I mean how do you guys keep it from ...\n... you just isolate this game and this week in the next you know you learn from it um I sound like a broken record every time we lose up here but it's onto the next you know there's no time to feel sorry for yourself there's no time to be be pissed about it um you know you you learn from it quick and bounce back next week\nYou'll find ways [noise]\nYeah I mean I use them for down south Sean open a cross middle aged and as I said I've tried to try to make throw 'em\nGot in the wall came out on the plane for I Try and force on there that I probably shouldn't have\nCarson wince on the loss and again admitting that he picked up the receiver late and trying to force one in and did not work out and the eagles losing the man who cover that game for today's Michael long ago and read read joined us Michael welcome back how are you\nGood kind of shocked a little bit but I don't get a little while\nYou know it was such a wild game for three quarters of the Panthers I couldn't do anything and in the fourth and I remember saying\nThey're going to need some kind of come back here they're down by Seventeen and they have yet to score today and sure enough that's what they do you know it was almost like a domino effect they got that first one and started feeling a little confidence and you could see that momentum shifting a little ... and the eagles just had nothing in that fourth quarter\nThe sweat the sewage that happened in the fourth quarter to begin with a fourteen yard run by Curtis Samuel that\nAre falling dry that a candidate kept live with a couple of scrambles as well and they found a a ... a bunch of touchdown pass in the two point conversion and then last drive or again another ... what's that conversion

Redskins that compact fell short in the show where they had a chance today this week and they made sure it was not going to fall short again and made the most of their opportunities than a turn to the game around them may be quite possibly threaten their season around as well\nYou know this is the interesting thing is obviously hard to repeat but this team is talented enough to do so and maybe things you know exactly haven't broken right for them but the most disappointing thing as a as a defending champ to to lose two games in the fourth quarter as they have so far this year that's got to

A. and yard my outlook that LA we want you to nothing\nNo thank you very much Ryan Lee Young so it is a one sided affair in that one the other two games that are close right now have the cowboys and Redskins even at seven leap first happened the ravens in front of the saints by a score of tend to seven as they are under way\nIn the third quarter in that one earlier today one of the great games today was the patriots holding off the bears thirty thirty one and joining us right now from Chicago is less grubs even less welcome back how are you\nI'm doing really good here the sons about to set and um people have left here for the most part to probably Ninety eight percent of the fans were bears fans not happy with the result they showed they could play with these guys but they still have quite a ways to go special teams rich or what costs the bears this game they\nGave up a a kickoff return to a quarter rail up Paterson\nOf Ninety five yards for school and that came right after the bears had just score to go ahead by ten at completely turn the momentum around\nLater on in the game with the score tied pile than noise when twenty nine yards untouched\nWhere the puck that had been blocked by down to Hightower picked up by ... and he just said thank you very much and he scored Superbowl heroes James White that from two years ago he caught eight passes and scored twice for New England including what proved to be the game when I got a little crazy at the end\nAs Michel ... through three hundred thirty three yards worth of a a passes today and scored a TV and sell you also through for two touchdowns\nA through a Hail Mary pass on the last play the game which James White\nCaught and he almost broke free got down inside the one yard line and kind of remind us of the Nineteen Ninety nine two thousand Super Bowl which the titans were less than a yard away from time the rams enforcing a field goal at that point but St Louis was able to hang on for that when this case\nNew England was able to hang on as well a little bit less at stake of course in this one final was New England thirty eight Chicago thirty one\nYou know unless we talked about this is a being somewhat of a litmus test for this team to see where they they had become a so far this season and although they they were very competitive today and nearly could've tied to the final play coming just yards short how how did they hold their heads after this one how how what was the reaction in the locker room because\nYou know you think about what the chief stood against the patriots\nBut you know and they were disappointed by the laws but certainly knew like you know and we can play with them and we'll probably see them again how was that was the barest a day\nOr the bears no they're not going to see them again and left they play on the super bowl and I don't think too many people around even though a bear fans were happy that they show they can play with his team the last time they face New England four years ago in ... they gave up better than fifty points in fact in two straight games they also gave over fifty\nTo Green Bay ... two games in a row so they've come a long long way since\nMarch ... men and certainly since John Fox if he were still coaching this team they wouldn't have been in this game and everybody knows that\nSo the bottom line is um yeah they're happy they were in the game they know they can play with this team but they still have a ways to go if anybody wants to be honest with themselves\n... and ... was that the wild played that was running out of the page with a friend talking to play book earlier today you know while he may not have six the success of a Jared golfer Carson when he still does at least that has to be encouraging just seemed to still take steps forward\nExcept the only thing is people uh they hold their breath\nBecause they know this isn't going to get protection from the officials the way the Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers or ah people like that get um you know you breed on those guys are going to drop the flag funny thing is in this game the patriots didn't get them\nA you know the bears didn't pick up nearly as many penalties you might have thought in a battle like this they are they stayed in at a competitively that way but uh again to special teams touchdowns\nWhich by the way had nothing to do with Tom Brady is what did the bears have\nDone on no question about it and uh you know that really hurt more than anything else uh the way and the specialties bears made you could also argue kind of kept it going for them or at least in and kept them in position or you know I I didn't get to see it but when you were watching from the press box at last play did you think that it was going to work\nUm I thought that they might\nYou know I I didn't get to see it but when you were watching from the press box at last play to just think that it was going to work\nUm I thought that they might get them into a deeper into New England territory but they had a zillion people back there to protect against something that uh actually almost happened but bottom line is they could have been tackled fifty yards from the goal line or one inch from the goal line they didn't get in gay men to\nLearn a lesson any injurious report on either way do we have an update on Sony Michel\nOh that's the most important things sending Michelle ah went out of the game and um you know the the patriots like a lot of um NFL teams really like a lot of NHL teams uh they don't\nLike to tell you that much in the patriots have given some a bogus injury reports over the years so anything that they say I was going to be taken with a grain of salt until they make an announcement later this week\nNine so I guess a MRI's are forthcoming forum and we'll see what happens but less great jobs and I thank you so much and we will speak with you sue\nThanks a lot of rich on ... and soldier field today where the bears come up

and the jaguars ball and home to the Texas twenty seven and have we seen the last of lake portals Jody good afternoon good evening\nThat's where I might be ... evening morning afternoon depending on where people are listening to us and its mortgage confidently I didn't know if you want to be the ... where are you there [laughter] on the ground in laws who do you are but but what we finished but started to top\nThe titans head coach Mike ... a a\nA questionable decision maker a bloody idiots or I got the guy who can coach my team every day of the week where does jak meant all see the is absolutely\nRight and they took alive today but I don't care I Love it the fact that in the middle of the season having confidence the march sit down and feels guy the guy to within one point to win the next no time left on a clock\nLet's decide this thing right here we think we can get two yards damning I'm putting paid them ...\nAnd he had to ... as a matter of fact what the penalty in between to give it another crack and they couldn't get it right on either one but I have I'm a tightened fan I'm Sorry Mike rabble you're my guy I I agree\nWith you and I I liked the decision um for for a couple of reasons maybe the play call was not the best I might have given something a little more than\nA maybe a run pass option the Marcus Mario that could have worked with ... you know I mean look that that's all you know second guessing Monday morning quarterbacking a I like the decision because I said this before you know you're out fences struggle they start to come alive maybe this list them\nAnd also the fact that you know you're\nIn London it's a long trip it was probably you know your your your time zones you're probably your time clocks are off a little it was probably a grueling game physically and you know you give them credit for saying you know what we're deciding this one win or lose right here\nAnd I think it's probably a big lifted the team um even if it's even if it did not work out I think they were probably charge by it uh and I think you take your chances at that point\nYou know you how far do you want to go on overtime and risk you know whether it's player safety or your your team is tired I I've seen a lot of coaches do that and I applaud that decision it just didn't work out\nAnd I'm not the kind of guy who says go for it go for corporate corporate every single time because there are ... search certain certain situations in circumstances where describes him as the better part of valor and you play on and you take your diet and move on from it or not they are today\nOn the road teams at ... having an okay you're not great not over achieving not bottoming out there right there in the middle there just kind of like moving along to the season\nYou gotta do something that you got to be aggressive you got to try and make a statement we're able did alright it didn't work warm but\nI I just I Can't do anything but applaud the thought process the aggressiveness and the fact that he put his faith in his players\nI'm with you I didn't play calling so that's on M. T. V. you'll be thinking about that on the plane ride home but most of the guys there'll be okay but we tried to give it a shot the coach backed us we didn't get the job done\nAnd before we go to the stringers I'll I'll end on on this thought did you if you're might very well do you want to see Phillip Rivers come back on the field again in probably the answer is no at that\nPoint right because if you take it to go to overtime he's not probably not going to win and last thirty five seconds whatever was let go down to feel he might probably not but now you're up to give up and\nAnd yet they're up to that point had been better than yours I Would have attempted to dodge that both that's why I like to play near no question I think we're both in agreement with that than ah however\nThe titans those still three and four after that last today in London right now in Washington the cowboys trying to avoid going at three and four Redskins have pulled in front let's see how they did it ears Arnold stir\nThe Redskins took the opening drive of the second half of all the way down and feel couldn't quite convert in the end zone and it looked like Alex Smith had Germany sprinkle wide open except sprinkle tripped in the back of the end zone and just missed them by ... that they had to settle for a field goal\nAlex Smith now nine for Eighteen hundred twenty two yards and they touch downed Prescott on the other side twelve or Fifteen hundred and forty nine yards and they touch down for like nine ten left the third quarter the Redskins lead ...\nOn air and thank you very much

week seven Sunday the first portion which some interesting ones in right now we've got a couple of close ones the forty niners have just kick the feel good but that's the only one that is not close right now but in the meantime we of\nCowboys and the Redskins with Washington extending its lead let's check in with ...\n[noise] yeah even though it might not show up on this corner of a pretty dominant third quarter for the red skins cowboys only got six playing or\nYelling out six plays off for ... yards and the third quarter meanwhile Washington marched down field in the beginning of the fourth quarter had a chance to put even more points on the board Alex Smith is the third down past to the end zone and they had to settle for a field goal however the cowboys now Dr Allen her and just made a big catch\nDown into Redskins territory it run down inside the thirty yard line with twelve\nO two left in the fourth quarter the Redskins leader Thirteen seven\nMind so they may be dominating on that previous quarter but it's only a six point games are still very tight the one game that isn't we just mentioned the ... and forty niners is run long standing by in Santa Clara\nPressures and regain bricks and put it mildly as the rams lead at thirty two to ten late third quarter to thirty seven to go directly\nAnd a boy it said the forty niners with their turnovers four turnovers on the day or women scored on three of them so they have a counter for Seventeen points on turnovers alone\nJared Goff is a fourteen of Nineteen hundred and fifty four yard touchdown hog earlier as that to score and ... and ... guards watching 'em off or nine or ... ... ... hundred and forty seven yards\nOne touch down there probably got two interceptions he made some terrible that there are some of the throws a great kid all the item for the forty niners but one started in San Francisco five catches for Ninety eight yard included and yard scored a reception uh but that's been pretty much in that region is playing in the game but he's been ineffective only five or\nOr cherish for Fifteen yards rushing and again it's all LA thirty two and ...\nAre the rams on their way to keeping near perfect season going and not much of a test today from the forty niners meanwhile the most interesting game has been the same thing the ravens in Baltimore with more on that airstrike high\nUp in ah Drew Brees when the second touchdown pass the afternoon moments ago and it was five yours Michael Thompson Thomas rather and that has given the saints now Twenty one Seventeen lead\nAs a top dollar for twelve play sixty one yard drive the ravens had to start their next possession and about the Thirteen but they were bailed out moments ago\nA on a pass interference call so er against Michael ... and that comes on the ball now out at the thirty yarn line a little bit of breathing room for Joe ... who trail this game now Twenty one Seventeen we've got four forty four to play here in the fourth quarter\nAlright so certainly a not a lot of time left but it has been a fun one to watch so far today\nAs the ravens down by four with the ball right now trying to get past the saints both with four wins on the season the cowboys would just stick to feel good at making eight three point game coming up tonight the final game of the Sunday affairs are the Bengals\nAnd chiefs and joining us right now is Jeff hops in the Bengals dot com Jeffrey jak majority McDonald how are you\nSorry thank you for having\nMe on absolutely any time a obviously the one thing that you take into tonight is the way last week ended how much are or what was the reaction this week was there still is a defense with it a little bit of an edge walking around after the way that went into\nThe I mean I think they know they have to play a hell of a lot that it's a night and uh you know they I think they have to probably get their lives on the fact that they're still in first place\nAnd uh that they're in foreign to and that they've won a they've had to fourth quarter comeback send the road so uh where the defense play well\nSo you know I think it's been a fire more mental a game than anything plus uh you know the fact that a bang up the festival you know they're not going to have this spot corner and backwards than I Do not going to have one of the best kind of line backers and the vigil\nSo uh you know there are a spotlight is going to be on\nBeing around the team Newsweek did it feel like you were around the first place team\nCap slowly I mean they could have before you know adult in green of what a lot of games I Know they get a lot of heat for not winning a playoff game but uh you know they've been in the playoffs or they went to the playoffs the first five years there and we and they know what it smells like they knows what it feels like him and I think they feel like this office\nAlthough they get paid it and I think this was another uh it was you know that would have been a third straight fourth quarter comeback\nSo off that's the way they believe like a no matter what the scores they feel like they can uh they can make in a way even though that was the last ... against Pittsburgh it was a tough one but I think it just uh being forced the fact that uh\nYou know his audience can they can do some pretty good thanks\nTalking with chip hops in the Bengals dot com bangles take non the Kansas City chiefs tonight in Sunday Night Football I said this throughout the season it there seems to be a different feel about this team than in years past is more mature is it something else what do you find if anything that's different about this team\nWas younger I mean you get guys who are not you know ... by the playoffs thing you know you got guys that are ah you get guys that are ah you get guys that has been a new ... new blood\nYou know ... by the playoffs thing you know you guys that are ah\nYou get guys that are ah you got guys that have been or do you do blood Sam Harvard Jesse face\nThe guys who were picked the best shares a draft show mixing John Ross you know\nAre guys who were picked at the top of last year's draft William Jackson who's you know a one one of the discovery corners around he comes from the ... all those guys weren't there when Jeremy Hill form of a ball in the Fifteen wild card game and I think that means that\nYou know I think it's got a little bit of a different feel [noise]\nOne of the guys who stepped up pretty good for the bangles off in so far this year has been titled Boyd we know AJ green is going to make the big plays in dorms go look for him in the biggest spots but boy there's been a nice alternative on the outside for Cincinnati so far this year\nThat boys get more catches and age age get a you know he's got more yards and a a guy like I'm Keane an hour you know he's covering it was all these but ah it's taken the next step to being a you know a a hell of a player in this week he's played well enough they're starting to double team so are they need something from John Ross right or\nThey don't have time for it that's that's huge and Boyd leaving boy he's been terrific guy he looks at the monitor and they convert it for a sound so uh\nUh but they got to get a they got to get more out of that crew a boy has given them what they lost with Jones\nMargaret Jones had any something from John Ross to give them what they kind of loss was so new a she's a different plan and ... you know they're hoping he can give them some of the elements that high retail gifts for the chiefs you know I can score from anywhere in the field he just got to get more consistent catching a ball he's obviously nowhere near I reveal\nWho's a ... maybe the most dynamic burning the league that they think Ross given that same type of diet is it that that same type a\nDynamic action and they said they hope to see it and I\nMean obviously that's why they they used that he's picking the draft on um a guy was a a tremendous burner in Washington you know his speed is off the charts but he hasn't been able to stay healthy you see just one of those guys that that that's always going to be an issue for\nWell I Hope not they hope he's over a they hope he's right now I mean ironically he when he scored the thirty nine yeah especially I mean it's an Landry get hurt\nThat's the way to get hurt on so you know they're hoping that he'll over you know that's a he's not going to be one of those guys are certainly on in his career you know that are you really can't put a label on 'em yet but uh you know\nHe's got a you know he's got a shot to come back and I and uh take it from there but I Need to think about John is not only you know he he makes the effects of the council you know he has that kind of speed so even if he doesn't have you\nKnow six catches ... yards\nThey still have to they still have to account for him you know ... green scored ha green scored four of us by session out of this year in the swat with John Ross next somebody outside is the fact that\nYes we know ah thirty one other teams in the national football league do not like ... perfect\nAre you looking to senior care for

hey it's the Bengals and chiefs and the sun is not a fair giants and falcons meet tomorrow night we'll preview that just a moment but right now we got a good one going on in Baltimore under a minute left with the ravens with the ball down seven here's Craig heist\n... day thirty nine yard field goal to give me a sense of twenty four Seventeen land but Joe placards come right back\nDown the field micro cramped weight twice in the room for Eighteen and ten then went to ... gallon on the sideline for Seventeen and right now the ravens have a second in line at the same sport team\nThey trail for twenty four and a Seventeen they do have one time out left Franco's now Twenty one I'm thirty seven for to a sixty four and who had thrown a touchdown pass and that one right there goes to John Brown the wide out who also has a\nReception of over fifty Arjun this game but that has a chance to have the ravens tie this game up at twenty four twenty three twenty four seconds to play here and the fourth quarter\nOn here's the big question you go with Mr automatic injustice Tucker or do you go for two\nAt home the point play for overtime your house your field your crowd you take your Jay you just went down and scored the game tying touchdown unlike what might break a break will did today in London yes you play for the tie year and yet they will go kicker is Mr automatic\nOh by the way that we defense by the saints\nNot only did they let the ravens march it right down the field but this coverage John Brown they pass them off to the safety there weren't a fourteen year old like you can't afford them paying for the guy off\nTo his safety in coverage when the Indian sitting right on top of the goal line brown made the easiest to be the catch is black and make the easiest to beat the pros and we're a P. H. D. away from\nIt yeah it was a very quick that Dr took less than a minute and a Half Men right now Justin Tucker on for the point after and\nIt is no good cook home\nMan he missed it Mr automatic missing their automatic you and I both just jinx ... extra point miss and and now he's never missed one before no holy mackerel and I don't know\nThat we got hold of that because that looked like he was going to write down the middle\nIt was moving that I got to believe there's wind and that Baltimore stadium now Tucker and or I don't know that they would use their ... it's a guaranteed inside cat 'cause he got twenty some odd seconds left\nYeah that that that show the Mac off the tea slice of I've ever seen one it was added right down the middle it took a left turn and the ... and it has to\nBe the way the ... I don't know that when because one of the flags was moving on the one goal post and one was dead still on the other and Tucker is also incredulous about how he might have missed that\nI don't know how that thing I didn't move how it didn't get through the ...\nThe looks on their faces so we apologize as radio we can't do justice to the video they just showed Justin Tucker Tucker the look on his face is completely incredulous then they go into a shot of black and white on the bench\nAnd he's lost the kid bully just didn't duck or just missed the extra point and the ravens travel by one with the twenty four seconds ago\nThat's incredible my next question to you was with two time outs left in twenty four seconds they leave\nTime and I Drew Brees could be able to get in a range or a six yard field goal attempt here yeah uh and\nThan twenty four seconds they leave too much time\n[laughter] I Drew Brees could be able to get in a range for a ... yard field goal attempt a and for those who like to look at these things I'm the saint ... and the dog in this game uh so uh the the the point spread was headed to overtime so would you have to be determined either way\nBut the over under on this game\nWas forty nine\nAnd the maid extra point would have made it twenty four twenty four someone's going to go over and over time I guess not that we we I've not seen games where there's been notes going over time but it would be almost a given\nThat the game was going to go over if you had the under in this game someone in a studio is raising their hands on me or that would be make a yes you right now are quite happy with his middle going by Mr darker\nAnd it did look is is one of the flags on the goalposts was moving the way pushing the ball the way it went\nA wide to the right so ah\nAnd the onsite kick is delivered and the owner was tough the Alvin ... trouble feeling he finally comes up with the cleanly so now Drew Brees will just taken the in the meantime let's go another close when right now and the two and a half minutes left the cowboys need a big rally down ten years Aaron owes her inland over\nThey got the first place Redskins coming to town on Sunday if they can get the three and five before the by you're going to have people in that building selling you're saying you know what why not us so I think it's very difficult to envision than creating a scenario where they will trade Eli Manning or she will agree to a trade\nA regardless of where he's going to let alone to go to Tom ... and I don't know if I Want after after some of the reports after that game today in the locker room with some of the infighting I don't know if I'm Eli Manning if that's where I Want to put my legacy in the middle of a team of seems ready to implode\nYou know how much is the line in your opinion have ... in the tank though is it is it on him is it all the options of line is it a combination of both is salvageable at least for next year\nThey you know I I don't think I I don't think I'm\nI don't think he has as much left as the team thought he did at the beginning of the season or at least a team team brass to but I don't think he was the only problem\nThat the problem becomes if you commit to Eli for next season you're you're committed to a quarterback that's you know twenty three million dollar cap head on a team that strapped for cash space and\nYou don't have the line that's fixed in front of them now I Do believe that it's time at the end of the season I Do believe that the giants to sit down with Eli Manning\nAnd hope that they can convince him that it's time to walk away and give him a parade out the wind out the door and and you know we love you and everything's going great and you're\nYou're a franchise legend I'm only four players in the history of the New York giants have played fifteenth seasons with the New York giants he's one of them are but the reality is\nUh I just think the way everything's shape shapes up\nThey can't go through another season like this one last year you just kept looking at going well if he has a line or if Eli has all the pieces or give him a running back\nAnd yet they're still plays in the game he's not making and the frustrating part of it for for people who are watching this game that he can still make plays but he just doesn't make enough of them to make the difference in this office right now and I think that is\nConsistently um something that they cannot overcome and other spots\nGoing with art stable didn't are before we let you go through six games so far the patch ... tenure a you know how much different how much you know what ... what do you use your what are your thoughts of the the giants a coach or did they make the right call\nYeah I mean I think I obviously I a\nPatch or um or as some some growing within this job to do uh but I don't think there's any question he he's exactly what the giants won it in the situation now they obviously did not want one in five or but throughout any of\nLittle controversy silly things about water that pop up and we create you know mountains out of all hills the reality is patch rumor has really said pretty genuine with the team um and you know he joked they called it a BS narrative it was actually a question I asked\nEarlier this year the idea that\nIn January with the team um and you know a joke and called it a BF narrative it was actually a question I asked\nEarlier this I mean the idea that you know the behind the scenes you feel like you know you have to go I didn't put it this way but that's what I meant do you have to go all her books and miracle when they're tied to to its Sweden and flip the tables over in the locker room and then walk out and do you think they got the message\nLike that kind of what I was getting at\nBut in Charlotte it's mind it that's what I already and like he he believed that his have already have a stern leader in front of the room who is doing his best to get this right\nBut he will not be crossed by any players in the room and I do believe that that is the ... that he fan and that is a completely different situation than what the previous head coach was because I think there are a lot of people in this locker room last year\nWho didn't know what they were getting from their head coach there were a lot of questions I don't think there are any questions about ... now that may be disagreements but I don't think you you look at ... Sharma and say he's lying or he's not telling me the whole truth\nI think ... has been pretty upfront with everybody a you know almost like a Dave Gettleman brutally honest situation here's what I feel if you don't like it still would I feel on the head coach and I I don't think we see that publicly but I Do believe we're seeing that privately with the giants and that's why they believe this kind of turn at some point\nI just don't know when I just don't know one guy how perhaps\nWill be tomorrow night the art we could do hours with here unfortunately we have to run but thanks so much for a couple of minutes again always ready to have any on\nAbsolutely gotta thank you very much thanks art art Stapleton of the record as the giants getting ready to take on the falcons than I\nKnow we

to last week everyone was referring to the NFC East as the NFC least and man what happened to this division a army good teams the eagles are the defending champ they don't look anything like it eagles beat up on the giants\nThe Redskins get a nice win against the uh the Carolina Panthers and the cowboys just blow out the gags so oh the NFC isn't dead yet it eagles blow a Seventeen\nPoint fourth quarter lead cowboys lose the Redskins and the giants may or may not be the falcons tomorrow night but they're not going anywhere anyway so you go from the NFC\nEast today and if he leaves back that he had in the east it back to the NFC leads to get\nWell there's just no way of knowing one week to the next what you got the interesting thing though to me has been aside from all the scoring the amount of games that have come down to the final seconds and overtime so far I Can't remember this many overtime games\nI'm very interested to say yeah when act wraps up here and the next Fifteen minutes or yours truly hangs around for another two hours gives the football fans champs chime in talk on the phone I really do want to hear from some browns fans to to get a gay John what that team is it's exciting\nIt's certainly better than what it has been the last couple years but\nThey've now lost a couple of games in overtime very winnable games it over time I I don't know the pulse of the browns fan Jed are they in fact because they're going in the right direction on a frustrating because it is that lining up into many losses but for over ... every week they play overtime act that's nuts\nMhm no absolutely and at some point that takes a toll on you but\nLook they're better than they were last year uh I guess this is another baby step in terms of growth that they need to but\nAh look there there are things they have to shore up and obviously I think one of the things they have to do is they got to be able to establish a consistent running and they just started Carlo side uh Nick Chubb today you look at the final numbers are not so bad but he had a very slow first three quarters\nAnd they've got to find a way you write to ah they they they basically are turning the running game over them and you know I'm a big Knicks fan shoot I picked him to an item in a couple of years ago\nOr so I thought that was a smart move a rather than have debate in the locker room you know ... the guy he and hide and been sharing ... short end of it because hides the guy to aggressively pursued\nWho are rather than have debate in the locker room you know jump to the guy he and hide and been sharing ... short end of it because I was a guy to aggressively pursued got as a free agent cut the ties make a statement turn it over the job or he'll be their running back going forward and I think there'll be better for\nOne game left after tonight and that'll be the one in five giants and the two and four falcons and joining us right now from the ... or from the Atlanta Journal constitution is the Orlando led better rich Ackerman journeyman Donald with their thank you for joining us so much appreciate how are you\nOh I'm doing great reckon Jodie thanks for having me on the show tonight\nAbsolutely uh you know as more of Albert would say and one in five and two and four not with the league had in mind [laughter]\nNo not not at all one tell us to close the can care for the super bowl and another thing we're supposed to be on the comeback trail and uh neither of those two things have happened\nFalcons defense says it's been a mess the sheer now are you certainly can explain part of it with the injuries that they've had and they've been plenty\nBut still you're supposed to happen next may end up mentality and guys is supposed to be able to come up your ... and at least keep the team's somewhat under wraps the falcons and getting gashed weekend in week out\nAre they getting healthy or her I said that any returning players what about good events if not this week in the next couple of weeks is there anything can fan can look forward to defensively\nYeah they're they're more on a Grady Garrett done to make it back after a missed two guys would a high springs they're merging\nA pro bowler defensive tackle that that happens on Monday Night and then down the road uh deion Jones the pro bowl middle linebacker can come back after eight games so uh you know if they can do something here get to the five week then they go to a Washington and Cleveland\nAnd then the Arctic be back for the uh the Dallas game so ah you know but by then they can be too and you know seven I thought you know uh they got to win now uh they they need to stop missing tackle they've missed sixty four capitals which is the third most in the league\nAnd um the plants are really bad shot football right now\nIs just a result like losing breathes losing because when you when you talk about ... tackling and and the head coach is a former defensive coordinator uh you know and you looked at what this team did a couple of years ago they tried to make a trade market at being tough and and not backing down but when you see miss tackles you know where does the fault line there\nAre either that or I think that that got him and put this into the scans are fine it lies with the players inability to carry that brand physical brand new football coach wants to see and we're starting to see some players lose their jobs over that Duke Riley I'm\nHeaded minutes cut in half last week or place naps cut and hats and they're going to just try to put some people on the field that want to hit and play physical football coach or Dan liked to play but when you got it up to ... what your deep their top tackle your middle linebacker and your three safety\nAnd you're thrown safety all gone now you know they're going to be some problems and we've certainly seen those problems\nDefense has been a problem across the board for the falcons\nConfidence not Matt Ryan who's an MVP level player previously\nIs having as good a statistical years he's ever had before the quarterback ranking over a hundred and ten a course he's got his main guy Julio Jones but Calvin Ridley has hit the ground running and uh it seems like every time the ball is thrown to him he seems to be making a big play\nYeah no question about it the rip he's doing a great job he's got six touched down a little Leo's pulling a lot of coverage to his side of the field\nAnd that leave in Ridley and I'm Single a man a man situations and he's the worrying and a majority of battles over there are so yeah they couldn't be happier with the player the rookie out Alabama Calvin Ridley and what he brought to the Austrian some big play making ability\nAnd a home run it inability also\nDog would deal and the lead better or the Atlanta Journal constitution before the giants in ... tomorrow night on Monday Night football ... Freeman out again and how big his that last being biggest I think one of part of this\nUh you know the last couple of seasons and you know when you see he's out of the line of\nThe fact that they have not been able to establish a ground game was as good as Matt Ryan to Julio Jones and and whoever has been whether it's Bahamas new or anybody else the fact that they just haven't and I go back to the super bowl they have an established to run as well as they they could have been and maybe that leads to some of these health or ... the games that get involved and\nYeah no question I mean there have been able to pick up a you know short yard isn't that goes back to the Superbowl or you know they've got a third and to get the uh the books they pick it up the game's over but then they they don't get it so they got a kick a fifty seven yard or", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Norfolk", "day": "21"}
