D Sri a is a a wedding ring out like I'm\nHere are the odds for this year's MVP I'll give you the top ten hairs and his top ten but they have\nLeBron James is the favorite three to one\nSo have you back ten bucks you win a thirty bucks you get your ten back for ... bucks back you get forty bucks if you pick what brought it to be the envy pay a the second choice is Anthony Davis of the pelicans I'm at seven to two slightly higher odds than LeBron James\nThird choice at Fort Irwin is on his on ...\n... to a poor choice of five to one is life is MVP James Harden\nSecond choice at six to one is ... Leonard\nSalmon choice at nine and a half to one not quite tend to one nine and a half to one is Kevin ... of the Golden State warriors former MBP Russell Westbrook also at nine and a half the one the big man in Philadelphia joellen bead\nForward team to one that's actually some pretty good value\nA step in ... knows a little bit about winning MVPs one back to back them you can get um a Fifteen to one this year that's also some pretty good value and need ten choice and a big jump up and the odds at twenty five to one\nIs Kyrie Irving of the Boston Celtics\nThere's only a couple of guys that I Would just eliminate\nI don't see how ... Leonard can win it because Toronto one now remember it's a regular season award\nWhat you're doing a playoff means nothing they collect the votes on the MVP when the season ends wore a playoff game is even started so what you do in the postseason is basically irrelevant and MVP conversation\nToronto had the most wins in the east last year ... what does collide going to list list lift them the Seventy and twelve\n... they made me a different team they may look different they may play different but how much better canal one last record be they can't finish higher they finished with\nThe top the knees so he can surpass the addition of why can't put Toronto in a better positioned heading into the postseason he can't\nThey would attempt seed in east so I couldn't\nBuy quiet six to one I think he's going to be a nice fit I think he's going to be a great story I think it'd be a great story during the off season 'cause I don't think he's resigning with the right to do and where's he going to go into like but all I ... I just don't see how he can win the ...\nWhile I Love Anthony Davis and he's the best big in the NBA by far and ah he does things that no one else is sizes have been able to do before\nI I Can't make New Orleans again I'd ... are they going to win fifty eight games in the west\nAs tough as the west is that when you're going to have to do they're going to have improved by six seven eight games they're gonna have to be a two or three seed and the west at worst I Can't make the pelicans that go to the team so I can bet Anthony Davis\nYou can make an argument for anyone else on this list\nWhat Brian at three ... said for harden it five\nDuran nine and a half Westbrook at nine and a half and beaded fourteen value attached Korean Fifteen value attached Kyrie twenty five I Would probably say Kyrie is the next one\nI have the toughest time making the argument for because I think Boston is going to win is a team next year I think they've got a dynamite line up\nTo make the big shot on any given night I didn't dare to favorite nice over Toronto where the most wins last year but I make in Boston the favorite going in a Kyrie will be the man he'll be there and go to guy who get most of their big shots he's not averaging twenty six again not with that line up\nMixed precipitation likely tomorrow thirty seven one to two inches of snow tonight through tomorrow I mean you're all ... for news talk W.

ninth team draft but the number one pick on the twenty twenty draft\nWill be a to a tiger by law he's doing it again tonight folks in case you're not keeping an eye on some of the night action attack about law here in the first half against Missouri Missouri is different isn't great\nBut they're not God awful either and this was supposed to be a showdown between a two top quarterbacks tiger my lower and lock the kid from Missouri it's been a no low contender I so far in the first half we've still got too much going to ... that go by lower two hundred and sixty five yards\nThree touchdowns in a burst at that point is that going to have\nYou gone to a football the play oh by the way jail it hurts will be coming into this game I Will protect the gab no the hot take this one will be opened up enough but ah they will not be a need for it took about ... to play the entire second half yes the or Alabama Crimson Tide will be able to get their backup quote unquote backup quarterback\nAs college football championship winning quarterback coming off the bat and\nJay Leno he's going to get a chance to play in the second half but today because uh Alabama's already running up a dirty spot in the first tap\nAgainst Missouri what else is there are\nCollege football NFL you want to talk of the baseball stop whatever you want to get into and I threw out the odds for the MVP of the NBA\nI'd like to know who you would if you add a dollar to put down if you had dead or a hundred thousand or ... whatever you are as far as expendable income goes and you thought you had a real good take on who was going to be the envy paid\nWho do you think's going to be the MVP the NBA this year what Brian Anthony Davis Yon his onto the gumbo James Harden glide Leonard Kevin Duran Russell Westbrook joellen bead\nA curry Kyrie if you want to go further deeper the now have you got somebody else you can call them out there for me I I Know you're going to be getting twenty five to one or better\nWho you got his MVP of the NBA this year hit me up on the telephone lines eight five five to one to four to seven damned damned builds up on CBS Sports radio ...\nYou are doing really well back then I think he did it baseball show yesterday if I'm correct I did yes\nAnd I obviously it's a series that I don't have that so I Want to do my real quick I got the Dodgers and the Astros going there were serious wrong country to last year and I got the Dodgers wedding\nAnd it's good that you waited till now to make it because if the Dodgers had gone down to zip it might have been a ... to make but since they got today's game with a come from behind Justin Turner ... you're still in pretty good shape or the Dodgers select I took the breweries and the red Sox\nSo I'm going are completely against your brother I'm saying the two teams that didn't make the ... that made the world series last year will come up get you what do\nYou have a you know what I'm not impressed with the brewers are bullpen effort a lot of ... particularly on your show and that to bleachers Jeffries and that other kid they gag up at three ... late they did and so ah are they go to the book and it's too early\n[noise] they ... and if you're getting your you didn't catch yesterday show I said the guy that I had least faith and going deep into games\nFor the brewers and oh by the way to broach just don't go do people you knew they were going to be going through a book on early by some guy who is most likely to be done or earlier than anybody else's weighed Miley\nAnd damned but finally didn't pitch really well today and maybe they didn't pull them out a little bit early maybe they should have gone further with them yeah it's a deal ... goes all to weddings\nAnd they start the procession of bullpen already now Boudreau come in and paid great oh by the way hit home run the first ever pitcher left handed hitting picture\nTo add a home run off or left handed pitcher in postseason story\nSo he got his ah ... end of the bargain done uh but you write Jeffries let him back into the game yesterday they were kind of lucky to hold on a ... almost let him back in as well and Jeffers again today didn't get the job done so how'd the Milwaukee bullpen has not been as good as advertised in the first two games in his ears you are correct\nAnd then the Dodgers throw a pitcher's today including the starting pitcher review\nCorrect now even asked the same question about them or have they gone to the bullpen maybe not as early but deep in to the bullpen are they going to have ... if this series goes six or seven which I surely bingo sex and\nIt might very well go seven are they going to have four guys pitch six or seven games in over the course of the theories that a lot to ask them their bullpen so their bullpen by the time we get to the end of this could be on fumes too\nAnd one more thing real quick back man please can you make a comment about ... was at the ... that he's not the second comment of Sandy Koufax we all know that and he is\nNot very good in the post well eight eight ... was that it was better last year he had his best policies ... until the final game of the world series where he was only okay um but he had had a really nice run until then last night again not good enough now\nIt'd be behind them was awful\nA he has money ... really tough day by the blade and that's not all on Clinton great joys his team didn't help 'em out my jazz today\nBut he also didn't get punch out when he needed it uh one of the questions that was thrown out of ... essay on the show was if ... has a huge post season this year and oh by the way he pitched well eight shutout innings in his first game in the post season this year in round number one\nI could he put all of his postseason shortcomings behind him\nAnd my answer was basically no\nBecause he sets the bar\nYou don't compare co cutting short a all other postseason pictures you compare him to Clinton courage shot in the regular season where he's won Cy Young I have to say young enough to science so the bar he had set by themselves for himself so high I didn't think you could possibly overcome all that one postseason issue\nAnd back man with other things are you doing early morning baseball ... early ... forty five AM on the west\nWould be five AM for you so you got to get up or you could just stay on the plight no better chance than stays up all the way through you don't have any deliveries to make an idea\n[noise] Baghdad for taking my call them\nSay a Budweiser deliver so you'd be delivered and

baseball and football you can't put too much into it but he got at least watch it so you know what's going on and there are some guys who make a name for themselves in the pre season the thing that stood out to me in this pre season as I almost feel like I'm watching a football game\nBecause they're calling holding\nIt seems like the NBA is trying to crack down on players being held the way from the ball and the inability to cut to the basket and the like it was called differently than the NBA when called these last several years and my overstating it\nAnd if not is this just trying to set of mine said before the season starts and then it won't be as big a factor once we do get go with the ...\nIn game will judge you're not overstating it this is what they call points or one of their points of emphasis for the season\nUm it's you know there are certain rules that we all know or on the books and sometimes things or drift a little bit uh things you know ...\nYou know players and coaches find ways to exploit um whether it's loopholes were things that get overlooked just you know just it it's it's hard for officials to officiate everything all at once a lot is going on and so guys are always going to take advantage in and do whatever you're not\nA officiating or or being attentive to so point of emphasis for the officials and us for the players this season among them is\nYes holding a away from the ball just grabbing guys impeding their progress grabbing them um you know when they're off the side trying to to you know get position wherever they are on the court perimeter in the post anything\nSo yes you're seeing a lot of that cold right now because that's the way you set the tone for how it's supposed to be in the season now we know how this goes sometimes at a point of emphasis to crack down on in the\nPre season in the early parts of the regular season and then things sometimes just get away from them and by the end of the seasons back to where it was I don't think that's going to be the case with this one this was a really big emphasis for the league right now to uh to get this\nOut of the game and uh so yeah you're you're going to be called a lot\nUntil guys adjust and just stopped doing it\nAnd it was probably the way it's going to go yeah ... ... the players will decide if it continues to be called by their continuing to do it or not doing so you got to watch the first couple of weeks the seeds and then continue to monitor something like that as well is it a good initiative in your mind\n[noise] ah yeah of course um look we want to free flowing game you want ... game you won a game where you know your especially now fallen player movement are so\nCritical to the ... in today's game for most teams so yeah look I mean it puts even says ... at a disadvantage\nYou know it's going to sometimes costs them griping especially from coaches and players who make their marks a as a defensive specialist but for you and I for the for fans I'm sure you know look everybody loves scoring I think I think everybody would be fine if all kinds of players have more freedom of movement and it leads to a you know more ah\nAh aesthetically pleasing play and more points\nThat would ... report MBA insider I guess you're on CBS Sports radio um the other big story in the NBA this week was Jimmy Butler and his actions in practice says ... is a ready in a uh ability to talk about it after practices were over to several media outlets in the like\nHow badly did Jimmy Butler hurt his trade value with his antics this week\n[noise] that's a really interesting question Jody it's a good question I don't know if it's an answerable question\nUm there's a little bit of eye of the beholder thing here right like you know I think most people felt like when this happened a few days back that if you're a pat Riley who likes his players to be you know tough guys any way to challenge guys to to just be you know kind of bad asked as as as Jimmy Butler as\nUnderstood I who's going to be the MBTA the MBA this year\n[noise] really really tough question I mean not that it's ever easy to see the future when we're ... you know we're talking in October\nUm this was really tough to project because look Boston can be the best team in the look you're immediately of course I think about the best teams because historically\nAnd the Russell Westbrook year as a as a massive outlier and I did not vote for him but historically\nYou have if he's going to come from a team that's top two or three in the conference at least fifty wins so you're looking at the top teams Boston is tricky with Kyrie because it's it's an ensemble they've got a lot of different you know a lot of tough to your talents so it's gonna be hard for Kyrie to stand out\nUm similar with the warriors where Cory ... it's hard for people to separate out is it one or the other now somebody gets hurt and it's one guy carrying the most of the year okay you you kind of lean that direction it could be co why if he's back to being himself because he will he will certainly be the alpha dog\nOn that team in Toronto you know when you know fifty five fifty eight games or something and ... is putting a big numbers then you know that's the direction it could go a lot of people than taking the brawn um you know if the Lakers go from you know lottery team which they were too\nI don't know I don't know how high they have to get in the west to justify it um again historically Westport not withstanding\nFor thirty five years or whatever it was it you know fifty when teams in the top two or three in a conference so I don't know the Lakers get high enough to justify that but you know there there's gonna be a lot of benefit of the doubt for the brawn because they'll put up we know he'll put a monster numbers and he'll improve that team by you know Fifteen twenty minutes\nIt's way a lot of people um so I mean they're the breakdown I don't have a pick like it okay I I it\nIt there's there's there's too many too many things in play my temptation my best guess would be the ... the guy who will be able to build the best case\nRight now give you one scenario to go with it and then we got to wrap this up I'm running late that cause you're that good um\nMilwaukee wins fifty two games it only gets them into fourth place in the east and you're honest has got the best steps in the NBA does he want to\nYeah I think that's a good possibility I mean ... and he gave us have been or dark horse candidates for a few years running the reason I didn't mention neither one is because they expect that New Orleans is going to be somewhere between six and eight in the west\nAnd Milwaukee is going to be probably you know fifth maybe fourth in the east that's the thing that box with with my ... the head coach now\nOr the bucks to have the potential to make a leap year I don't know if they're gonna get to three because it gets a fourth and their fifty plus wins and ... got the monster numbers and maybe it's three point shot starts to fall in yeah he's he's a good a good proceed in a guest\nHoward good stuff you know we're going to tap any plenty during the season enjoy opening week but\nAlways was Jodie thanks my pleasure that is Howard back from a bleach report one of the best MBA insiders in the game you automatically hang on your on CBS Sports radio

it's it was considered in it may just be a daddy Mack tweeted today will say you got to speak to\n[laughter] uh yeah so we're like a man a good by the late great interview with our back he he's a he's a bad guy when it comes to NBA that's all he knows it's a correct ... interview with him and then I didn't want to talk about the Dallas Cowboys are correct I'm a big game tomorrow I think this game designers either I I mean\nEven though it's too early I mean going down to hunt for after tomorrow is going to be horrible because the eagles won I feel like the eagles added that big when I think they're going to uh run run over the debate and again but am I paying for the cowboys you need to in order to be real smart we need to uh\nI'm concerned about their run defense and the\nUm even does he get around it I feel like he's not going to get that much uh opening because it's that the diverge even just amazing so I feel like that that needs to come up with a store packaged and\nTake the shot and then ... that can go to eat like the on the top of the ... and ... we had those kind of receivers to him and often I think they've ... have an awesome for us you can have a big game\nBut ah hopefully we can win the game but what I just wanna get your take on it\nI think the cowboys are up against it I think you read about the fact that this is not going to be as he go early in the yard you just don't do that against Jacksonville and he's not going to do it either I Lived in I got bad news way I don't have faith in Dallas is passing it I just don't\nI don't think they're going to beat the oh by the way Jacksonville is\nUh they might be the best defense in the entire NFL against Iran they're very good it's not like they're chopped liver against the past\nAnd oh by the way the cowboys don't have threats on the outside of me ... ... often get behind the defense wants to make one big played ... yeah\nHe could touch the sixty yard touchdown pass you might be right but if he does it'll only be one I don't think it's going to happen twice um I I think the cowboys are actually up against it tomorrow sorry but Andrew from Maryland's up on CBS portray yo yo drew\nHi thanks for taking my call I just wanted to say I'm I dark horse for them the envy piece John Wall simply because uh each marching ... from a backup center I'm blind boy our it into a\nYou know a very capable starting center or is that that's where John Wall putting up fourteen and and that will double almost every season or John Wall now John ... getting into daddy backed up by an hour I feel like ... hours then there'd be what John eat it because\nWork that I mean let's be honest she not exactly a great player but with Dwight Howard you know if you use the plane was shooters or order led the MBA and report percentage for for a while during last season and deal that you know healthy three points shooting is also pretty good\nEverybody in the national John ... getting on the ball and John was that I could have good numbers as well and he would be my dark horse and I think the whether they're going to do something now the bronze Don\nIf you are wizard fan which I didn't have to listen to your entire John Walsh sales pitch to know that you're a wizard fan and it was pretty obvious I then yeah he's the guy you're going to pick\nIf you are back in the wizards if you're a squad of you'd think they can improve last year and climb the standing somewhat knees didn't finish in the top two or three then yeah you make a case for John Wall\nI just don't see it and I think you are banking on Dwight Howard rekindling up past which has been gone now not for a year but a couple of years played out what hasn't been Dwight Howard for three years\nSo animals are whining warring or John Wall lift his game back to that level you'd think so I bet against that\nAre here yet but boy our did average sixteen Fifteen lashed eating\nMm yeah for a bad team\nAnd actually with a ... point guard a well not a terrible point guard a but not not a great team I saw what a real good team I'm\nI he'll be motivated I think he realizes his NBA ... legacy is kind of on the line here so I don't think it'll be from lack of effort um but I I just don't see wall lifting is game too high heights and that's what's going to take from watching to want to win fifty plus\nBecause Toronto Philadelphia and Boston\nAll looked like fifty plus when teams are the soft underbelly the east is going to allow them to get up into the fifties in Washington is going to need to get there to finish in the uh top three and I I just don't see it there'll be a play on the middle east\nI like Milwaukee better the Washington coming into the year uh and I think the honest is a much more legitimate MVP guy then John ... but that's the reason why John boy you're probably getting thirty one and you're honest you're only getting four or five\nOr so that sort of got away value against how actually you believe they can win how much you believe they can win E. M. B. pay and I think John ... is a long shot you better get paid big God's gonna take a shot what John ... good luck\nTo you wisdom in this upcoming I'd I'd give you my quick three picks for the ... all by the way and a red red truth in advertising might take six years think\nI've been bad in college I had been no I've been ... treated in college I've only been slightly better in the NFL a couple of weeks in a row now I've been terrible I got back to ... now and we'll buried below five hundred after the last couple of weeks to know in college to pay\nThe taxes ... minus two he won by three and I took the under in that game and it was fifty two and a final score was\nTwenty four twenty three I think it ended up with a ... twenty seven twenty four it ended up under as well so and I got Colorado tonight plus seven against us see I didn't go I was going to go into LA and walk out with the wind\nYes they haven't played it tough schedule yet I haven't played a killer team a road spot in the ... twelve not\nEasy but you see is a seven point favorite\nColorado's the undefeated team\nI'll take the seven points and well by the way I think Colorado can actually win the game outright if not if they went up by a field goal or for us he does you still get yourself a when a with Colorado so uh that's my other college picked my three pro picks tomatoes are\nThe ... and it's an anti cult picked as much as it is a pro jet pick\n'em jets could actually be on the spot of trouble tomorrow as far as health goes eyes aircrew well rush for two hundred yards against Denver last week it's

really been so into having Coleman this week against Tampa Bay\nI've spent a lot of time in the last twenty four hours watching his film from the last three weeks and the one thing I notice is that he's not quite as explosive as I remember last week a against Pittsburgh has very first carry look great everything after that did not look good and he was splitting with two other running backs that he's\nHad thirty six carries over the last three weeks how many of those through six cares have gone for even for yards four or more you are\nAnd I will say to eleven\nOh well that's not so bad\nI Know but it's not like he's ripping off a bunch of ten and Fifteen year old runs only one went for\nActually it's like I say to like you said where's the gas ever yeah I was not really paying ... I Know I don't know I just wasn't thinking now embarrassed\nAnd you know what I'm worried that some people just might not think about having Coleman and they'll say oh well he's certainly going to be the every dollar back for the falcons now they're divided nerves known in the Gulf\nWar he's going to get a tunnel where\nHe's going to get a decent amount of work Fifteen Kerry seems about right and I think he's OK is a low and number two fantasy running back I have a hard time believing that he's going to suddenly breakout he's averaged below three hours for carry over his last three games already nervous about him\nI think that's fair eight five five to one to four to seven get to a phone call and just one second I have one more question for Dave how do you feel about delve and cook this week\nI was I mean I wasn't great I wasn't like excited about him I figured it'd be like a good flex or number three running back\nAnd I thought you know what maybe you can do a lot more passing or catching passes out of the backfield\nAnd then the report comes out late tonight from the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he's going to be held the twenty to twenty five snaps and I wanted to ... and the closest ... book that I could find because I wanted to see dabba ... play a lot and we're not going to see it so I moved down in my ... and now I've got to think about ...

right we'll we'll get to this and a cup and just will do it for a couple of minutes them well here's some phone calls to have to start the quarterback\nI like jerk off I Know that he's been red hot that people are still asking questions about whether or not they should start in the answer is yes playing it's Denver yes unless it's a blizzard the no but he's got his healthy receiving corps and that Denver past defense really has been playing poorly\nI expect that to continue and I also love James ... and yeah I Love this matchup forum against that land I don't have as a top five quarterback\nLittle bit worried about consistency little bit worried about some turnovers along the way but he should come down with good numbers everybody's going to use them in daily fantasy at running back I think Jordan Howard is somebody you can bounce back to I think the bears are going to lean on their ground game against the dolphins Miami very good against the past\nOr you saw Andy Dalton struggled against them last week really only Tom Brady has throttle the the dolphins defense this year I think you're going to see much too busy hand off a lot so I like him and I like to Rico into so I've got a tip on the safety of a double dip I think that they are both going to be\nGood fantasy running back options and I could almost at the same thing about the sea hawks and they're running game love Chris Carson like Mike Davis moving on to a wide receiver there's been asleep or that I've been talking up all week at um you know who it is it's Chester Rogers of the Indianapolis Colts\nEleven targets in it catches each was less you gave he is a must and ... and he's still out there in a ton of CBS Sports leagues you could literally pick him up off waivers\nPlug them in your lab use them over a mark Cooper and have yourself a great wide receiver that can help you out I also like Chris Godwin looking better than to Sean Jackson believe it or not\nIn that game against the Atlanta Falcons and then it tight and let's go with cameras break catching those passage from James wants and again it's a ... this is key for Jamieson his first start the season I think you're a Sea Bright score this week and in that same game Austin Hooper who high then for the Atlanta Falcons nine catches last week\nSeventy seven yards a lot of targets I think the falcons leaned on him again\nAgainst ah against their opponent this week the Tampa Bay buccaneers which can't stop anybody through\nThe air and you know the the browns are so banged up that\nI Wonder if David the joke was about to start being good\nOr he's got a tough match up this week the charges have been good against tied ends but I I think the arrows pointing up with Mayfield into joking may feel it seems like to throw them at least the PR you're getting some catches that him you haven't gotten a touchdown but\nUm you know I I'm not saying you should start him over brain or anything like that but take a look navies available I think is about eighty percent on so maybe the joke is available and just with the state of their wide receiver ... unit\nI Wonder if it more targets more catches are coming and for Davis a lot of protest Rogers check this out the jets have allowed Seventy or more yards to seven wide receivers already this year five of those seven had seven or more catches like chest Rogers\nAnd many of them came in the slot and they they had a bad slack corner to begin with now they're starting a sixth around rookie at slot cornerback chess or it's going to be Andrew Luck that destroys this quarterback not Chester Rogers Rogers is gonna be the guy catch in the past\nAll right we've got some phone calls to get to see the sports radio toll free line aid five five to one to four to two seven is brought to you by Geico great news there was a quick way you could save money switch the guy go go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car

go go\nCome our way how do you go David Johnson and look at look at what's happening so you know hey yet I I got to give them\nCredit for that but um but hey guys I'm I just want it to a set to ask you guys are quick question um I Need out two running backs 'em and then I Need a one receiver [noise] um it's a it's a tough one I got this is a half a point PBR\nI got Austin heckler nine Heinz\nRonald Jones in Dallas and cook I Need to there and then I Need a receiver here guys I'm already starting Calvin a Ridley and a\nHalf in I've got God when I got Baldwin uh Chester Rogers and mark ... good when those are my options um I Need one of those receivers and two of those running backs after you share the guys love you guys you guys are the best\nWe love you guys are the running backs are going to be at clerk who's just been red hot fantasy purposes and not ... I Know Marilyn Mackes going to be back but he's just the best that you've got from the remainder of you're running back and I'm going to go sky went over Rogers I notes half point the PR and I'm I'm loving what I've seen professor Rogers but\nI think God when I was just a little bit more upsides scored a touchdown so I'll take him over Rogers and the ... BP our\nPhone number is eight five five to one to four to two seven Ernest in Texas what's up Ernest\n... reading good you've have Ernest cousin Ernest\nThanks for taking my call guys\nI just need to uh out of four is the standard week or so I could start a fever running back or titan great ah so I needed a choice of a ... I Am\nProud of boy Stefan dig\nOr mangoes Congress just the best out of those two guys on by the way out of you and that one day\n[laughter] it didn't work I did it away or Dave ... with that giants Lindsey well sorry about that maybe next time you cut off the tags maybe and then I did cut off the tags I didn't see how to have it yeah All right so ... Diggs is typically must start wide receiver and I'm going to tell you the stardom\nBut I'm a little worried about the match me as Patrick Peterson I think Peterson will try and followed digs ... big enough to even like just start dig okay but I Will say this Ernest us have a couple of other good options boy does good Emanuel sand gives you want\nBut a hundred times out of a hundred years starting dig so who else or\nA digs in many Sanders\nSaid I mean that's the thing like a a lot of times and fantasy it makes sense you gotta feeling things might not have that good of a game but he had earned it like he's he is starting for you I'm so digs in Sanders and yet he brown and boy are very very appealing\nThat you just can't you just cannot over those receivers you know because they've got upside they've got potential to get you a hundred and twenty yards into touched on something crazy like that that will guarantee you will win and you don't well\nNothing guaranteed you in with the way we score points now are All right Dave I'm at the point of the show where I feel like we haven't gotten to enough costs were going to go a little faster here Paul in Brooklyn Paul Go\nI Want to thank the president and I want to thank the people of turkey\nAnd I think we'll probably now really establish\nA terrific relationship with turkey we appreciate\nPresident Trump in Kentucky on campaign for reelection of GOP congressman Andy Barr this is Fox News [noise]\n\nNo huge age sky watching whether the whether our weather center\nScattered rain showers likely tonight otherwise cloudy blows around thirty two north wins ten to Fifteen miles an hour\nMixed precipitation likely tomorrow thirty seven one to two inches of snow tonight through tomorrow we're all just airtight for news talk W. J. A. G. A. M. seven eighty and one oh five point nine eh than currently it's forty five degrees you know\nCBS Sports radio we Saturdays or Sundays at one\n\n[noise]\nThe bullies back on CBS board radio\nOn and that's what I'm Talking about welcome back they\nThis is my favorite band they of Richard you know this one I don't know the song but I think I Know the band it's very much them yeah go ahead [noise] red hot chili added the red eyed and I know fleas based romantic way\nTo tell me baby ... baby what is your fantasy question a five\nFive to one to four to seven eight by by the ones who for CBS there's design fantasy football we are alive until midnight eastern apparently\nThe previous break out when we came back we were listening to three eleven which is a good bet I just did not know the song but no yeah now I now I'm a little embarrassed um so anyway give us a call you got till midnight eastern gonna take a ton of your phone calls here before we get into that though they've just it let's talk about some stashed 'cause we're\nTrying to help people when here and we ... we want to help them win fantasy championships are there any player that might be available on waivers are guys you want to buy low on right now that you think are going to really help down the stretch\nWell let's start with a running back in Houston who hasn't even played in a game yet this season but people are excited about it because the running backs that are currently in Houston stink and that's the ... available it about three quarters of CBS Sports leagues\nOr if you've got a guy on your bed so you just know that you're never going to use\nYou can cut 'em and pick up the foreman if he's right coming back from a ... century serious injury running backs typically are not the same after this injury but if he's okay\nHe could be in line for a big workload for the Texans despite their office of line being what it is a ... you could almost take a chance on Mitchell Trybulski now you're not going to start on this week it's Miami that's a tough matchup\nBut moving forward he's got some good games where I think he can get some production and that could start week seven against the patriots at home I think the bears whether they want or not they're going to have to throw the football gets the patriots and Michel ... who's available in about half of CBS Sports leagues could come through there we've talked about\nOwnership percentage I think he does have some staying power and then two ds T that aren't even playing this week\nHave amazing match ups in week seven Detroit is at Miami and New Orleans is at Baltimore I think those are good match for ds tease that have really started to come on lately so Detroit would be first and then I Would go after New Orleans but if you want a pack of ds T to use and we Seventy for streaming or what not you can go with them\nOkay and a few other players ... if you have the ability to carry two ... she'll be back next week you or desire I Do I Do I Want to get the number one kicker it on my team and he's worth it\nI Hope he's healthy All right well you're not healthy whatever we kind of no big deal day let's just for goodness sake just ask ... everybody fight the on that you're going to thank me when you get those extra point not like literal extra points like extra fantasy points every week from your kicker you're better than everyone there\nUm I don't know how I feel about Baker may feel but I Do know the match ups are amazing coming up at Tampa Bay ... that's a great one of his next for match up before the by our against\nFour of the five worst teams that gets quarterbacks\nBaker Mayfield so that means if somebody's panicking about drivers Landry tonight tomorrow morning go out and get yourself to acquire Jarvis Landry he could have huge production coming that's why I also really like David the joke you I think the joke is next three matchups after this week are against three three worst teams Adam against that and you're\nMissing the boat what about Antonio Calloway that fast rookie that they have\nI yes\nI it it does make sense but he gets a ton of targets doesn't do anything with them but yeah he's not a bad stash also Dave I Would look for Marlon Mac and all my leagues\nAgain this is these guys that might not do anything but you want the opportunity to get them before everybody else wants them more than ... zone in sixty percent of CBS leaks ah it's got an opportunity probably not this week but going forward you know we've seven and on to be\nThe guy who leads all colds running backs and touches hopefully by a solid amount All right well\nThe patriots rams game will be on CBS that would be the super bowl um and there's a CBS the super bowl season continues with a fantastic double header we've got an intense AFC North battle Pittsburgh glass but Cincinnati than the NFL stop defense the Jacksonville Jaguars had to Dallas to take on the cowboys\nGoing to be probably different over ... and those two games of the day kicks off with the NFL today powered by ram trucks at twelve eastern on CBS and start any dolphin this week they doesn't thirteenth still\nWear so like um yeah I always have twelve doesn't mean you're not good rapid fire for the next eight minutes let's get at least Fifteen calls David in Massachusetts started off David go\nI think taking my call you and I know there's no going tonight they want to say go gators\nUh you wanna get hung up on cannot act on\nI ... a standard like click it I Can't really decide on a glove long ... cut law ... Cole or play button\nA I'm going to go with that color I think he's been the safest of the bunch double digit fancy points at all but one game this season All right thanks a lot I don't know if we said Ronald Jones is another guy you might want to stash right now but yeah if you can find them stash them and then if he doesn't do anything on Sunday you can cut them the following Tuesday\nDavid in Boston I think last year I asked him if he knew David Boston was and he did hello David in Boston\nOr what the guy's a quick question I mean so much for the PR Aaron Jones Terry Coleman or you could eat and one quick one would you say pick up on the farm and drop where do you think it's about time thanks a lot of listeners thanks\nI'm not ready to drop or a stream and for him I think somebody else in your lead would pick a voice for him in a heartbeat if\nThey saw him out there so I'd hang on to him if you need one guy and that the purely I couldn't hear you David it would be going if you need to I Would go in and cutie\nYeah do you like you would see better than before this week\nNo I like well full or better okay a he and he played a lot last week so that matters but cutie is fitting in is that slot receiver good volume for ... for sure\nEight five five to one to four to two seven Paul in Louisiana Paul you're on a fantasy football\n[laughter] hey guys I have a lecture question cues the tight and sweat Sanders cute T ... to be ... or ... and tied in Olsen kettle Burton and who and got to go by\nOut of five or so I'm\nGoing to give you the short answer is because you have to go so fast Emanuel Sanders James Winston and Austin Hooper\nWinston overconfidence Winston over cousins OK by it I don't why would you do Jamie's got to go by thing and not go who've uh for me by my feelings as you've already said Hooper All right we'll buy hay a critical and come back this week they've started that\nI I wouldn't be surprised to be a good game I'm nervous to trust him I'm surprised it's coming back to soon after fracturing his foot or my last time he came back from the injury you only had one good game so I I Would I Would wait a week and see what we've got an\nFive five to one to four to two seven AJ in Florida AJ what's up\nHey how's it going guys ... high it's had a\nQuick question about a quarter back so I got off then waiver wire and I need a quarterback for I buy we currently have ... the butter on my way we're wired got Alex Smith DJ ... third do Flaco and our case keen them\nYuck jak yeah that is that is a is a ugly groove yeah you're picking from I like the matchup best for K. skiing them in the situation best if the weather's really bad I Would pick it from him and go to CJ battered who's actually give me a twenty finished pointed to the last two weeks\n... re in Pennsylvania I'm Sorry I just as bad options reign of any re\nHey how're you guys doing the same thing what is that right now\nA thanks for taking my call enjoy the show I got a standard scoring leg or too quick ones I Need to wander wide receiver out of junior Smith Schuster Calvin Ridley or brand and cooks and I need two running backs are Joe ...

I noticed I noticed that you made since I did yeah which is just a couple of kicker moves yeah nothing big ... big nothing I've run into some some players that I find it very interesting\nAnd I want to get your your quick thought of fire players that you're\nGoing to tell me how you feel about 'em right okay that sounds\nA person who gave the number eight five five to one to four to seven eight five five to one to four to seven\nHow do you feel about the luckiest man in the world in terms of fantasy production oh I thought you meant me 'cause I was married to a lovely lady about me actually that's also true about a ... color\nIs pretty lucky he's averaging more fancy points per game than touches per game I like that that it's ridiculous it's pretty preposterous but you know what if he's going to continue to be in this position for the chargers or I'm going to continue to start him as a lower number two running back\n...\nA great game last week he actually doubled his season totaling carries last week I don't think it's going to happen again this week I think he's in life or about fourteen or Fifteen carries that gets a pretty good Texans run defense I don't want to start um\nWell one sort or for me this week uh I have a feeling that the Redskins are going to give them a little bit of a fight I don't know scams going to be good for thirty to thirty five fantasy points Aaron Jones\nI Am optimistic I Am certain that he's the best running back in Green Bay I Am waiting for coach Mike mccarthy to get on board with what I Know\nIt's weird that I Know that and he doesn't know that because he's not giving Joan Cindy on Russian again I don't know [laughter] Aaron Jones is worth having all those terrorists still\nI I think the Packers are gonna have a lead on the niners and I think that could give Aaron Jones some extra opportunities in the second half so I like him as the number two running back the bar Miller\nI Am kinda done with Miller I Would be surprised if he had a game with like Fifteen fantasy points again the season\nAll right I'm looking at the schedule what's the what's interesting game deal you know like a good interesting cause Tampa Bay and land is going to be super fun or fantasy we hope Kansas city New England I just absolutely cannot wait for that does it have to be a fantasy relevant game elite isn't every game is in Israel as\nWell I guess technically every game is but there might be there's two games one that can be sneaky high scoring and one that will almost certainly be low scoring okay what are you got\nThe short almost certain low scoring game is going to be between Baltimore and Tennessee I'm really intrigued by both defenses especially the titans defense they do have some weaknesses there of I'd like to see of Joe Flaco can take advantage of them but they're both certainly interesting but I don't expect it to be ...\nI think we could see a sneaky high scoring game between the chargers and the browns\nI think those two yes could come here for about fifty points could be a lot of fun I definitely like Philip Rivers and fancy this week Baker may feel this is a is a dip as sleeper\nI Want to hear from the callers I promise we'll get you in a second but they're just a lot of news that I feel like we have to talk about\nAnd I think maybe one of the most interesting games for me is coal suggests I don't really know how this plays out I think it's a close game I think it's a good game maybe not a good game to watch but it was a close game fourth quarter should be fun and what about the ... situation if he plays the star cruel well if he doesn't play do love ... Powell what do you think\nHe's a dance on the answer those questions are is both yes the answer is yes I think that if ... you will like him better than blowout Powell I think he's the red zone\nA running back of choice for the jets I think they prefer him to Powell but if he's out than blowout Powell they don't have a choice I got to go with them and I think he would be on the brink of having a lot of work and I agree with you I think that's going to be a game where the jets hang in there for a while and they looked great last week against Denver\nIndianapolis is that a lot of time to get ready for the game so I'd be surprised if they laid an egg here but their defense is just so banged up right now that I think that the jets have a chance to have a winning streak Adam\nAbsolutely and last thing if you're desperate for aside in CJ ... is twenty six percent on\nHow you got to say it right I didn't\nLose its who's who's I'm\nAll right it was um a twenty six percent alone and Tyler cross is out\nSo that means one or two whole extra targets for CJ ... but the Steelers are the second worst team that examines next three matchup Steelers chief Tampa Bay the teams that are currently three worst against titans and the NFL that's amazing he's twenty six percent of\nAll right eight five five to one to four to seven let's do it drew in Boston too don't you have a baseball game to watch it right now\n[laughter] I can call the ... okay good that we're very happy that you're multitasking [laughter]\nYeah okay you know fantasy football kind of takes precedence over most thing\nThey asked him [laughter] real quick\n'cause I'm over thank goodness I thanks I'm hoping for some advice I can do it all in running back in the non the PR James light tactical empty or Alford more\nInteresting white is the one that I think you absolutely must START I think there's no over thinking on that at all and I've got more ... back to back in my rankings it's on the assumption that map read it does not play I Will take Alford Morse\nShow afraid of play start when\nYou have all of them is that we won't know for sure what Rita status his until Monday\nAnd you're gonna have to make that decision obviously before them because you've got ... who plays on Sunday\nIf you're if you're at all worried about Brita and and I don't think Brita will get any more than maybe a dozen carries in the game which means offer more should get more than a dozen carry off and you know that are more social work the golden worried about them getting blown out they have little ... that would hurt out for more ... he\nYour business and file criminal charges take control of your tax problem now by calling the experts at us actually field and take advantage of the fresh start program and new laws that may allow us to negotiate a settlement for the lowest\nA possible our team of tax attorneys and enrolled agents can stop collections and get you protected so you can take control of your financial future us tax shield offers a price protection guarantee quote that gets you protected today us ...\nPlus rated with a better Business Bureau so called now eight hundred Seventy five eighty three sixty that's eight hundred seven three five eighty three sixty us tax shield eight hundred seven three five eighty three sixty\nAre you looking to senior care for your mom or dad that don't know where to start Hi I'm Joan London with the place for mom nobody knows your parents or a loved one better than you and nobody knows senior living better than the experts at a place for a mom\nHave helped thousands of families find the right place for their mom or dad I was so glad that I called the place for mom\nMade by her really listen and was truly my partner and finding senior care for my dad he went out of her way to get to know him as a person was always there whenever I had a question is senior living advisors at a place for mom partner with thousands of families every month listening and offering local knowledge and advice to help find the best\nThing you live in communities across the country and it's a free service chairs the number\nTo call a place for mom at one eight hundred for six seven seven by three zero\nThere's a place for answers lanes for mom called today\nCall a place for a mom at one eight hundred for six seven seven five three zero that's one eight hundred for six seven seven by three ...\nGet the latest elements and health and medicine with Mayo Clinic radio Sunday at eleven AM on W.

frozen that's not related to weather well that's what came up when I Googled weather related movie that's where we were we had twister was just ...\nOh okay it's raining off topic either football\nVolcano which isn't really weather related what about Joe versus the volcano never seen it let me I don't want to let me give you some questions are you telling me start or sit Andrew Luck at the jet\nI'm going to start Andrew Luck I really liked him at the beginning of the week and I called my jets on them I Do think he's the top twelve quarterback a three hundred yards to touch us James Winston\nA that might be three hundred and fifty yards and two touchdowns but he could have some turnovers along the way I should say you should feel good starting them based on the matchup against the south and how do you feel about Philip Lindsey this week I think he's the best Broncos running back and I don't think it's going to be close because I expect the rams to build a nice big lead\nThink Lindsey is going to be the running back of choice for Denver in the second half of that game\nLet's talk about a running back who has had twenty or more fantasy points to non ... twice and fiber fewer and these other two games Adrian Peterson if he plays but she's expected to do are starting to see that\nThere is something very interesting I Would expect the Panthers to be a favor in this game but when Vegas set the line Washington was a one point favorites interest yes Washington keep seeing close\nIf not wins the game outright and if that's the case in Adrian Peterson should get a lot of work it is not an easy match for him but I Do think there'll be good enough to go with this number two\nAll right how about the Marius Thomas\nI'm okay with him this week for the same reason why I'm okay with Emanuel Sanders and Philip Lindsay and\nEven case Cain them if you have to start ... them I think the Broncos are going to be chasing the scoreboard a little bit and Thomas should be able to get his five catches do something better with it than what he did two weeks ago what about Randall caught on Monday Night if he plays I wouldn't want to trust them and as a matter of fact let's just say all the Packers wide receivers are active\nFor the game here's how it ... device Adam central there's number one that's a no brainer\nI'm going to go ... miles and number two\nThen Valdez scaling then ramble cop Cobb is at the bottom of the totem pole\nAbout charity cook I feel like ah he's been really up and down and nobody seems to acknowledge that Jared Cook\nI think he could be in line for a lot of targets this week against Seattle they've got some question marks its safety and it linebacker in terms of covering the tight end and because their cars getting rid of that ball quickly it wouldn't surprise me if cook at eight plus targets\nTrey Burton is facing a team that has face Rob Gronkowski Delaney Walker end Jared Cook and held all three of them to five or fewer fantasy points to non PBR started ...\nWell you just made the case for why you shouldn't start Trey Burton but if you're stuck I think you should go with them just on the off chance he catches a touch though would you start Cameron brain over yes Austin hoopla as well CJ ...\nUh that one's a little closer for me I'll play it safe with Burton but I don't know if I can actually defend that maybe I changed that when you were to take off on Sunday I'll give it a little more thought\nI got to get to some phone calls here CBS Sports radio toll free line eight five five to one to force you to seven

put the ball deep so I Am going to put one egg in the ... basket\nAnd tell you to start him and it's not going to matter Zach because your other wide receivers are awesome and you're probably going to win by forty points\nYeah I mean I I I think ... percent yet five targets last week he caught three balls to them the balls and hundred twenty three are two touchdowns I ... I think you make good points I think Jackson's a safer play should be a lot more scoring and that game but you make good points should probably look to sell high in the ... by the way\nA gene in Baltimore and eight five five to one to four to seven gene what's up\nHey what's up all of that too quick question as a bill or felt rivers are Russell Wilson or and the other question is are the mayor's dollars are dug ball and above a PPO right league\nThanks Jean let's sit though Seahawks you know Seattle is really proud of themselves on being a running team and I think they're going to be able to do exactly that against Oakland in jolly old London\nSo I Would go with rivers over Wilson and I would go to ... and frankly I'm nervous to start a Baldwin until I see something from them certainly something more than one cat do you have the weather for that game because I Believe I I if you'd like you know we are near that time were the weatherman uh has to give his latest update [laughter]\nOh yeah that that might that might be the weather the\nNo huge AG sky watching whether the whether our weather center\nScattered rain showers likely tonight otherwise cloudy blows round thirty to North wins ten to Fifteen miles an hour\nMixed precipitation likely tomorrow thirty seven one to two inches of snow tonight through tomorrow I mean you're all ... for news talk W.

team they could bump up ... with an export that's a that's a tough one\nTo Texas move up by default so there will be six also yellow she will bump up to seven\n...

is gone and we had the vision and I'm going to make this quick point if this is the quarterback them I think over sixteen games a\nAaron Rodgers math and staff and Curt clauses are all going to give

all of your ...\nThank Jimmi appreciate the call in Silver Spring Maryland a couple of points baggage you both are not Baltimore Baltimore had a beer with Dover right when\nThey won the super bowl and then Denver where the defence when manning wasn't that good often simply so a great defense still can when you were Super Bowl and the modern era and von Miller in that defense or did it against Carolina who had in a camera and all the things that was going\nSo I think their defense couldn't carry them they're that good with the bears they really are in their schedule that that's another thing that I'm looking at when you when you're coming off a\nBad year and you get some mo Jo in your schedule sets up that it's almost impossible in my book for the the the bears let's say to lose five more games so I'll say eleven is the magic number to win the NFC North\nNot necessarily get your home field advantage in the play offs but I'm just saying eleven so the bears come back from there by at Miami\nThey win that they get New England and the jets at home at buffalo Detroit Minnesota at home and Detroit that the giants and then they get the rams on December ... on the shores of Lake Michigan\nFinishing the Green Bay at home at San Francisco at Minnesota\nSo I I think that magic number to assure yourself winning man is the north is eleven wins or their defense is fantastic it was good last year and now with Mac and I just love the Kansas City often I loved the Mr X and the movement\nAnd ... look how much better he is in the bears often than he was a year ago and I don't think Green Bay and Minnesota are as good as I thought and Detroit will say they have to win the first two games out of the break\nAt Miami when they got to buy this week in Seattle at home\nYou can join in

Radio Free line a five five two on two forty two twenty seven is brought you buy guy go great news there's a quick way you could save some money switch the guy go go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance going into yesterday\nAlabama won Georgia to Ohio State three confidence for and then to rap out the rest of the top ten it went Notre Dame West Virginia Washington Penn State taxes and you see at\nPenn State will be out of the top ten Washington will be out of the top ten and West Virginia will be out of the top that\nWhen the next top twenty five comes out Georgia will fall out of the top for I don't know where they're going\nTo fall into I Would imagine somewhere in the five to eight range I don't think there'll be nine or ten but probably if I had to take my best guess probably summer and the five to eight range probably more like a six or seven\nIf I had to get the made it but you're going to have three new teams going into the top ten\nNow I Wonder how much movement will be with taxes and UCF taxes take down Baylor UCF takes down Memphis how much more movement will go on for the nine and ten going into this week but when you look at\nThe potential three teams that will move into the top ten\nAnd it's actually for a part into consideration\nOklahoma who was eleven last week Michigan who was twelve last week and they beat Wisconsin LSU clearly being a top ten and they felt that Thirteen after last to Florida but Alice you has a victory over ... ...\nThey had a victory\nUp again was what they were able to do today against Georgia so this is Alice you'd seem that they have three really good performance is as they beat Miami to start the year now Miami\nAnd also all burn not as good when they play them because Miami was terribly essay up against Virginia and all burned has fallen off but when they played Miami at all burn those early on the season I think it was like one in three\nThose were good teams at the time and then the other team you got to consider to potentially moved up into the top ten is Oregon as Oregon\nI Know they lost to Stanford and again they should have won and now you're looking back at that what I find them on and you're probably saying what could have been\nBecause they could have been six said oh man the ranking would have even been better and better going into this week but after that lost the Stanford they bounce back\nWith a forty two twenty four victory up against Cal Cal and then yesterday thirty twenty seven over Washington so is the four teams that I'll consider moving into the top ten and I don't think Oregon gets there\nThere'll be really close nobody knocking on doors sit down like eleven or twelve and and maybe they get into the top ten but probably not\nIt calls nobody knocking on doors sit down like eleven or twelve\nAnd and maybe they get into the top ten ... probably not I'm going to say it's Oklahoma as that one loss\nAs to Texas and now that attacked a theme that is just completely done one eighty from after losing week one to Maryland and what they've been able to do take it down TCU taken down us see\nAnd then obviously Oklahoma was a big statement when last week so go home and we'll get into the top ten they won't pass taxes because they lost the text of Texas probably will move up\nAnd then the placement of Michigan in LA she will be very interesting\nSo your new top ten and no order the teams will be Alabama Georgia\nOhio State clients and Notre Dame you arrived Texas UCF Oklahoma Michigan and Alice ya and trying to figure out an order on that one [laughter] won't be easy to do but your top four deathly Alabama\nOhio State will move up to two Clemson will be at three and Notre Dame will be at four and if you complain about Notre Dame all you want but Notre Dame up against good teams this year a top twenty five teams has taken damaged again\nTaking down Sanford has taken down Virginia Tech was not pretty up against ... yesterday that wasn't a football game Nineteen fourteen and that's all Notre Dame asked to do the rest of the way it Brian Kelly wants to get into the college football playoff has to be navy\nThree northwestern Florida State Syracuse and usa five\nGames on your windows five games are going to go into the college football playoff let's start things off with a going to Fort Worth Texas will talk to Greg first stop was at Yale what's happening Greg\nHey are they so yeah go ahead\nI'm two quick questions or next week old is going to have a Alabama Ohio State Columbus Day to day was the top four teams\nAssuming they run a table you think that there's a possibility that a one last Texas couldn't get maybe somewhere else in the playoffs and uh just what you want to know your thoughts do you support possible a team playoff\nI've I've always been foreign aid team playoff and when we talked about that before on the show drag it and I do appreciate the call and the way I've talked about it before is you have to give one of the non power five schools to see that the big boy table so if you want it to do when a team playoff which I'm all in favor for\nYou would do the power five conference winters they'd be seated you also would have a non power five\nConference winter so that six teams right there and then the two best remaining teams in the country that's how I Would do it in my feeding actually\nI Would put the non power five conference where did that you take\nOn the same seeding level\nAs the other five power five conference when it's so for example let's say those power five\nConference when they get to because they win the conference you place an emphasis on that so there'll be seated one through five ... and most years than the non power five conferences or be put in at number ... then you have seven and eight\nOther remaining team so you put a value on one of your conference you give a little benefit and you give a seat to the big boy table to non power five conference team and you also give them a little bit of a boost as a\nAs a succeed in that non power five the G. five as they call it\nTeam that has been selected last year they fared very well in the bowl games that now a little bit different when you're paying for college football steaks and some things man I Want to get up for a bowl game but yes I'm all in favor expand the college football playoff not that Ford dumped it work before does work and for has worked and the team that\nHas one should be the team that wins I don't think they've got it wrong yet and make it a top for over the last few years but I Would love to see a now to your question at Alabama Ohio State consider Notre Dame all without no I don't think Texas gets him but for taxes for Oklahoma\nFor that big twelve if they want to get into the top four which is a possibility because Alabama's having a playoff\nWe know that\nYou're ... and there's going to be a big tent spot in the playoffs or maybe they see the spot if you want to get in your rooting for Notre Dame to go down that's what you're rooting for ... and that big twelve team whether it's ... Oklahoma has to win out they have the one now because if you have to losses\nCloudy overnight with scattered rain showers likely lows around thirty two north wins ten to twenty miles an hour mixed precipitation likely tomorrow thirty seven one to two inches of snow overnight through tomorrow\nI'm a year old just stare a kite for news talk W. J. A. G. A. M. seven eighty and one oh five point nine eh than currently it's thirty four degrees exactly\nThe ... we have from nine\n\n[laughter]\n\n\nSo bleak to hang with you ... [noise]\nThat killed show right here CBS Sports radio [noise]\nFollow me on Twitter at ... gel where John chimes then he says that I think ... she was in good position with some signature win\nOver Miami Auburn and now Georgia Michigan in taxes move up with when he gives me the top ten is well his top ten John ... Ohio State Columbus and\nNotre Dame LSU Texas Michigan UCF moves up to eight wow\nOregon and in Florida yeah I don't think Florida gets into the top ten so he excludes Oklahoma\nFrom his top to so he has a Florida in I've Oklahoma and the top ten and they also put Oregon and the top ten as well so how 'bout that\nSo very very interesting to see that top ten and the way that ah he does develop that but he doesn't have George and his top that George has not fallen out of the top ten so\nI I I Can't agree with that one now John\nHutchinson on Twitter says J hot seven oh two it's an interesting question and I think our listeners Ninety two point through the ... of Cleveland will appreciate this one\nAnd that's something to do with the topic but I just saw it and sometimes that's on my mind works I just see something that I really like and I want to bring it out to the table and I'll even incorporate Harwood thin ... into this conversation so Jay how seven oh two on Twitter says\nWho wins the next Cleveland championship\nBut Brown's the cab\nOr the Indian I'm totally take the cabs off the table without a brown there and that's not going to be pretty basketball they won't be even though that I still have Kevin Love and everything and some\nCats and they'll say oh a little better than what we think regardless they're not going to be a championship contenders team but that will projects\nAnd don't be silly don't forget what life was like without\nJames came back was very good you went to the finals every year you did win a championship after being down three want the life without LeBron\nAnd the short term is going to be ugly and we'll see how long that does linger that crazy NBA season starts soon too and like I I'm not that pumped up for the starting December ... he said just not the season's been crazy\nBut buggy going through the Golden State warriors you also have um the brawn going to the Lakers the whole Jimmy Butler stuff ... Leonard\nOr the regular season starts them I just thought that pumped up for it I'm just not because\nI anticipate golden state's gonna win again in the east there's some form of Boston and Philadelphia and the raptors so some intriguing the east but even going into last year those are similar beliefs and the regular season ended up being a really good product and I thought was a fun product and then you get into the postseason where you're trying to hope that one of the\nBig teams in each conference goes down but down the east you'll have some new anticipation but with all the football going on I'm just not the good basketball right now I watch law hockey yesterday too\nUh but I'm not really thinking in the in the hockey moves yet either and I love basketball I Love hockey but just when you have college football in the NFL driving the train right now those are the the you know those seats they get you don't put in the back they do eat but those sports a little bit on the back burner and you have the\nUh NFL in the driver's seat in college football in the passenger seat let me get back to the question though\nWhen it comes down to next Cleveland team to win a championship round cabs are Indians after the cabs out and it comes down to the browns or the Indian power with all started off with you whose acts Cleveland's team to win a championship is it is it the er Brown's the cabs are the Indians in your mind\nI say the Indians okay there's the most parity in major league baseball\nYou'd like to think that there is not because you know you look at these big market teams is being dominant but the truth is when you go down recent World Series you know royals winners\nSmall market teams have a chance to win and I'm not saying that Cleveland is a small market team but there clearly contenders not New York now although I'm three years are poised to be contenders again next year why not\nAt all so weak division too and I know it could change for about a year like yourself right but but\nIt's much tougher right now in the in the landscape of the NFL and especially in the landscape of you know the state it to break through\nStock has been surging there's no doubt about it ... well I Want somebody asks right yes you can use the term surging\nNow you have a ... defensive and that you pick number one overall you have a quarterback from the looks right now it looks like to be your franchise quarterback and you also have Denzel Ward who looks like a shutdown corner\nYeah there are some pieces but again there are five hundred team right now when I wouldn't say surging I guess when you compare it to one winning two years yes that surging but but doing back foot in the streets of Cleveland right and they should or so for the first time there's a reason to be excited\nBut again I I don't think I think that the browns are still a few pieces away but they finally I think got in on the\nTrack look like they're on the right track the train is moving in the right\nDirection the train is on the track and slowly starting to move in the right track before it wasn't even on the tracks the train was kinda like tilted on its side\nWas up by down basically that's what it was ... where do you go\nBack to the very interesting question because I might be dead by the time we find out the answer [laughter] oh are you I so I really think though I mean you have to go where the town is the town is with the baseball team is not I mean\nYou have to end VP candidates on the team is position players in ... and you have maybe I Know they don't want to hear it right now because you know they got they got they got into them\nLatinas position players in her ... her and you have maybe I Know they don't want to hear it right now because you know they got a they got they got him to them by ... but you do have a very good rotation with ... hour and ... and frankly didn't seem like he's going anywhere and Franklin has won his share of championships in the past\nOr no question was what he was able to do with the ah Boston Red Sox are breaking the cars yeah\nHave to go Cleveland here with the Cleveland Indians that's what I have to go with you guys thought I had\nTo say anything else going on here [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah the ... you just say the Indians I gotta go Cleveland Indians that's how I say yeah\nObviously the let me go I Know is this question his answer all gonna be in the ground though right aren't really no I don't think so\nNo I might be because of all the and that's what I was gonna say and in fairness to James is point based on his diet and drinking habits there was a good chance he's in the ground you know tomorrow or Tuesday so he might be right\nYou know are delusional a Cleveland fan is listening right now you know the one I'm Talking about which one you're talking yeah right away here's a tweet that he tells me you're telling me that\nDan Gilbert team of Kevin Love trust in Thompson won't be the best in the sex than in the ... court\n[laughter] I don't want to add along I Apologize for even giving this guy Eddie airtime yet don't and here's the thing that definition of\nThe ... the dumbest person on why we are literally found the dominant power summer last winter and Switzerland accurate\nRight like they do some things that aren't even mentioned because there are so an accurate but repeated it before but you know what I\nPut my toe into water that I shouldn't even have ... and ... ... ... given but I'm not respond to our national radios and you're going to give this a responding\nYou know the credence of responding on Twitter no not at all so I won't even say a sweater name\nBut I just find it funny how this guy only does this complain about the show\nAnd he'll just you know more about the show freaked out about the show and any time we mentioned Cleveland it's like a trigger goes off or a signal goes off to his house and he has to go to Twitter and has to turn it on the radio he's all anytime I say Cleveland he's there\nSo I just find that funny they're passionate city yeah their passion but yeah\nI Would go with a Cleveland as in the Indian wherever they were game away two years ago oh yeah with that Rashid Davis home run game away the\nBrowns are still a long ways away from that no reason to be excited now my one way now my predictions by the way\nAre usually pretty bad I Will say when it comes to picking games that Rashid Davis homerun I sort of\nPredicted it when I was doing radio at the time sort of know here's the thing I was doing radio at the time of the I'm driving in Trenton\nWhere you could hear the station maybe\nPut a string up to a\nSeat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get again eight hundred

confidently\nAnd about thirty thirty five minutes or so for among quest as good a joined it sees a book coming out next week play by play calling me while this games in sports from FCC\nFootball to college basketball the masters and more and it's going to be a real thrill and a treat to talk to burn as so many memories over the year listening to FCC football games watching them on CBS you remember that kicked sex between Auburn in Alabama a obviously have\nCat was a big college basketball games\nI remember being in the ... tournament in Buffalo actually a burden was doing the call basketball actually had them in the face [laughter] sideline\nAh during a game and uh it was cool to be around burn though are there for that and see double A. tournament a few years ago masters obviously remember the old by the tiger chip\nObviously be a little bit older you'll remember a Jack of course on the Yes sir call and then obviously also the late in her shot so this man is a walking history book and his eyes is seen so many history\nWhen it comes to sports and now he's put it all a pen to paper or\nI guess now a ... type it up a with a book called play by play and it documents solve it so I'm very much excited to have burned on and when you hear burns voice you know it's a big game no doubt about it like an ice Fifteen Years you hear the voices of Kevin Arlene big game Jim Nance big game\nJoe Buck big game al Michaels big game Chris Fowler big game\nI even I eagle who I think is good eventually be a number one ah for CBS whenever ... likes to step aside and dances has the right to do it as long as he wants and these tremendous exceptional and always love but I Do get to chat with him but burned was one of those big names in those big boy says\nThat when you watch a football game and it actually see game on a Saturday\nAnd you had a little ... of Auburn, Alabama another big FCC matchup Vernon was there and burn always had an exceptional call him someone that wasn't afraid to step away from the microphone and just let the natural downs really tell the story too sometimes build descriptive\nSometimes you're short and sweet and it does or even much more and make more of an impact it a point\nOn the actual call and what is actually happening captured the scene or sometimes even better so a very very a good book have it right in front of me\nOr read a little bit of it and obviously we'll try to finish this entire thing or by next week but we will talk to burn and find out more about the book we have to transitional but do into baseball before we get to burn\nA I have to look at both the match ups from yesterday so and the NFL we're coming off the game on that look like the brewers were cruising Dodgers get back into the game Justin Turner strikes out a sports strike out\nIn game one and gain too is going to be very talent because if the brewers went up to nothing and then went up to do with the way that they've been winning which was twelve and a row entering yesterday well\nYou don't feel great if you're a Dodgers and even though you have three straight home game\nAnd in this match up at once again look like Milwaukee was going to win the game they were up three nothing and Milwaukee's bullpen has been so dominant and it wasn't as dominant\nIn game one but they were able to survive and gave number two it started to get shaky as well and the seven\nAnd also the eighth inning so it's three oh entering the seven Dodgers get to back the pole within one and then Justin Turner who is such a professional headed by the way and I'm so annoyed that the Mets got rid of it\nMakes my cell second makes ... that now Justin Turner dominant with the Dodgers and dominant in the ...\nOh no the Mets got rid of him and make myself sick and makes ... that now Justin Turner dominant with the Dodgers and dominant in the postseason to while the Mets year after year minus the world series year and also the wild card year\nAre sitting on their caucuses or playing golf\nAnd you have to watch it as a former met dominated the postseason but Turner who had for a strike out the day before it bounces back in game two\nAnd his team was down a run hit the to run blacks\nAnd the Dodgers go on to win the game for three so give credit to Los Angeles this tells me this is going to be a dog fight hopefully down to the wire now you may have also would have thought that after the Yankees got game too in Boston that did end up being the case but you'd have to think in a seven game series\nThat now we're going to have a real good fight between the brewers and the Dodgers I pick the brewers going him I Will stick with the brewers but at the Dodgers go take\nTwo out of three\nAnd they come back to Milwaukee\nSerious for throwing his self reliant if I thought two on two forty two twenty seven is brought to you by Geico hey everyone has a quick way you could save money which the guy go didn't homeowners renters motorcycle insurance to\nGet it all at Geico dot com Burton long quest will join us coming up in the next segment talking baseball right now David Price\nWill take the mound tonight and Boston and they must swing game for the Boston Red Sox as they're down ... after last night's defeat to they used an ashes the defending World Series champions and they go to David Price\nDavid Price by the way who has a career you are in the postseason of five twenty eight\nAnd if you're a member from ESPN stats and info is was the last time David Price went to the mound at a postseason game it's when they Yankees beat the red Sox six to we all know the red socks went on to win that series in four but after the back gate and they gave this nugget David prices teams\nAre now zero in ten ten career post season starts of the Seventy pictures and am over history with ten plus post season starts prices the only one who's team\nHas not one game even though he's getting paid two hundred and Seventeen million dollars and his contract\nEven though he's been a jerk\nWith the whole Dennis Eckersley situation and then you had the whole disaster with the Fortnite situation and trust me a lot of people would want to be in David prices spot\nOf getting paid a over a contract to two hundred and Seventy million dollars you're ... if I were to you and offered you a contract to two hundred and Seventy million dollars even if you were terrible at your job you'd still be pretty happy right\nI'm terrible my job already so yeah and you don't get two hundred and Seventy million dollar likes them straight cash only know how 'bout that oh Randy Moss preference but yeah\nSo when you say under dog people are saying well look I make so much money but\nIf you look at a situation of people that you're expecting nothing out of tonight it's David Price how could you go into this game if you're a Red Sox fan and any confidence that David Price is going to do well but that's what makes sports great\nBecause maybe this is the one time that he actually puts as well because of chili\nIs going to ask the pitch baseball game in the postseason as a starter and avid team win\nBut a lot of it it seems like with David prices mental\nBecause he's so sensitive as he could just tell with the way that he interacts with the media or I Know fun talking about Dennis Eckersley but the way interacted with Dennis Eckersley that was just sensitivity stupid that is even paying attention to that stuff about what that is that 'cause they were saying on a team broadcasts about\nAnother team may just silly ... behavior so David Price you'll know with David Price you're getting in the first two weddings tonight that's what you'll know if he's in the game packed the second inning things will of positive for Boston\nDoesn't mean it's going to do great threats away but if he could get through the first two I think that those big for him as a pitcher and the Yankees series is to the same thing you will know what David Price or getting in the first two innings and he didn't even get through sticks out so price could just get through\nYou will know what David Price or getting in the first two innings and he didn't even get through six out so price could just get through six out\nMaybe it opens up\nFor positivity for many continues to pitch well and he finds a way to get past the struggles or maybe just to struggle to the latest thing or two or three or four and then eventually or his shortcomings in the postseason become evident but David Price\nHe must must must not perform well tonight because if he does it the Boston Red Sox will quickly be out of the post season and the entire offseason people will be healing David Price\nThey will be chastising David Price the criticism for David Price in Boston will be on a constant loop it will just be\nOn a merry go round going around and around and around and around because that would be to post season starts with that lucrative contract and it would be to starts couldn't get the job done if anyone needed\nTo get a good start in the postseason it's David Price coming up later tonight and we shall see let's go out to a South Beach hippie always calls the show what's up tippy how are you\nThere yeah remember that's how I\nAppreciate and my friend a lot of ongoing on the sports world with\nThem yeah yeah and then try to hack hit first of all it didn't take it out there that day\n[laughter] so you're saying that game is over before it's even started hippie\nDriving with me when he got out made that nobody out okay\nLet's say you want ... you were caught some shackles on the Houston Astros\nTonight everything I have everything how much do you have but I don't know [laughter]\nYour pet theory you got that\nWas told me\nThey call me\nAnd they try to

big guy came up in and who is\nJust in Berlin through last year\nSkip out on the parade\nBecause he was either getting married or was it is honeymoon\nI forget which one it was either got married or he was going on his honeymoon um but just in Berlin their memory serves me correctly they skip out on the ashes parade last year I if I was married to Kate often and she wanted me to skip the parade I Would say hey\nHundred percent\nI'm all in for skipping the parade even though it was the first time winner of the world series championship\nSome guys just having the big moment some guys just don't David Price he does it\nUsually have it in the big moment but tonight he never ran to the big moment when you start to game but tonight he must happen and if he doesn't have it once again it's good to be one long offseason\nAnd if he's probably right it probably go to some island\nEnjoy that two hundred and Seventeen million dollars enjoy all the food enjoy all the women and enjoy all the ... night\nMaybe get a little burner account on sweater and have all that fun stuff and try to get back at some of the leaders but he'd better bring it tonight or those birds are going to be out of a five

I was just show for for the night\nAnd a three nine crew headed by David Hsu major uh CBS or a reporter came in to Austin a head of sound man and the film man we hopped in the car and we went west and and David interviewed they had a list of people who had known President Johnson so I Would say we got there at eight o'clock\nAnd we he interviewed people till three three thirty in the morning [noise]\nThen we gathered everything up and I drove them to the Austin airport or they boarded a plane to Dallas transferred New York\nAnd the purpose of all of his interviews or was for backup

whole lot of a fun game with the forty niners and the Packers if it was\nWhat the quarterback match Bush supposed to be before the year where Jimmy G and our Rogers yeah that'd be great and the Packers did lose last weekend to the lions [noise] so it would have been a whole lot of fun with Jimmy gene Rogers but that's not the case a Packers should win that one and they should would it go away but\nA wide receiver stand for the Packers right now Rogers banged up even though we give up the injury report last week\nA clearly a hundred percent and that was an ugly won an ugly one solution

for the ... if you go to one in five you're season's over even out one form or are you currently set the odds are stacked against you to make a comeback\nThe falcons often has been clicking\nNow I understand people say well that the red zone problems in week one in Philly what about ... Jones not getting\nIn the end zone so far this season the falcons are scoring points if you look at the total at the end of the game but they're not closing out and they're not finishing now last week up against the Pittsburgh Steelers it was an all around just an abysmal team performance this was at school\nClosing out and they're now finishing now last week up against the Pittsburgh Steelers it was an all around just in a baseball team performance ... thirty seven in the same same score forty three this is a team that score thirty six point in the bangles who reform on single scored thirty seven\nSo this is a situation where the falcons that they're scoring but they're not finished shooting at the end the games now that's a buck steam that James Winston back at quarterback but there's no excuse just here for the falcon team that Superbowl expectations going into the year\nIf you want to turn around and you're a season starts today at ... pm eastern up against the buck\nBecause after that happened to John\nAnthony ESPN gave Monday Night you shouldn't be able to beat the giants of you beat the bucks and beat the giants you don't do a momentum going into your body\nWhere you can put three wins on the resume beat three and four and then we'll see how you respond coming out of the by but this week and next week you have to win if you are the Atlanta Falcons and we'll see what statement they do deliver coming up later today chargers that the brown\nTeams can make a statement here at the browns when they'll be above five hundred ... and the first time and will probably would be a very long time I can't even remember the last time the browns or above five hundred I'm sure someone has the information out there but they're currently at two to one\nThey could advance the three to one by the end of today and it's a brown seemed defense has been great Baker Mayfield has brought an extra\nExcitement level to this brown the minutes I like the way Jake\nThe Lomax you said it when he joined us yesterday people think of the word of you know being cocky as a negative connotation not a Baker may feel they the brown need a quarterback that has confidence bigger Mayfield things you could win and he's done so so far and his young career and the national football league a whole lot more than other brands quarterbacks have done in the past so\nBrowsing charge or is this a big one is the browns when you're sending more of a statement you stand okay we're above five hundred of the first time in forever\nWe are legit where the real deal where the Cleveland Browns and we're going to be a team that keep a surprise people this year for for the chargers to\nHey this is the chargers team I don't care how well the browns are applying right now chargers have to find a way to win this game this game actually means more to the chargers to me that does the brown\nBecause the charges or another to that several expectations going into the air and for years they've been off to a slow start if you get it off to a slow start who's the chief\nGo to good Clearwater dot com\nThat's good Clearwater dot com\nAmerican Morning weekday mornings at five on news talk W.

I mean we could easily be undefeated\nBut yeah you only lost one game on the year round and ...\nAnd ... three touchdowns in the fourth\nQuarter yeah you've got choked away you choke the way the game and Rogers was magnificent and it's a bears team they've been a pleasant surprise this year you should be the dolphins today it's the Miami Miami uh I don't know what Miami team shows up you know each and every week it's it's like the Redskins too\nBut if you look at the bears schedule and I don't know what to make it a ... but you hit the nail right on the head it's effect the fence the fence and ... but I did this process\nAnd Matt Aggies first year for the Chicago Bears\nBut you look at the schedule from now until\nBasically December you don't have too many tough games that the dolphins then you have the patch which is tough\nBut then after that you play the jets you're in Buffalo the lions Vikings tough game lines again and then the giants you got some wonderful games on the schedule dolphins when the boot jets winnable bills when a bull lions winnable\nOr you know the giants by repeating I'm Sorry but they're wonderful too\nSo you got caught up with games is a team that yes there are plowed threat but there's a lot of an experience\nAnd some big spots and the coach and a quarter back and we have to see how they respond\nAnd he was with a Thatcher's flailing liked to have the past couple of weeks yell at the origins though I Know I I think it's there for the taking and\nI think this will be a good price list is for the next three three or four games and we were playing on a schedule for ... the AFC ah east in ... you know let's just but I think we can win if we can take to those games I'd be happy\nYeah you know if if I were you I'd be hoping for three I built the dolphins the jets and the bills and you know the patches it it's a daunting task but yeah if you if you go to and to and you keep on moving his training the right direction and get to nine ten wins\nOr probably more time than yeah you're putting yourself in a a wildcard spot or maybe the division 'cause that division lines or two and three\nVikings two to one I think the Vikings are vastly improving high like Kirk Cousins a whole lot with that the ... especially with the eggs and deal and you got the Packers\nAnd I never count on Rogers but right now the bears are leaving that division at three morning I'll tell you that out of all the teams right now that are leading divisions the teams that impressed me the most\nAnd the team that surprised me was the bangles support one didn't see that one coming titans at three and two didn't see that one coming\nAnd the bears the three and one and I'm intrigued to see how they go the rest of the way those three teams because they're leaving their divisions right now and you're wondering if they're going to be leading their divisions at the end of the year before we get to my Mac let's go to Cleveland, Ohio we talked to keep next on CBS Sports radio what's up these\nHey how you doing I'm baked alright I'm clean for [laughter] okay All right here's here's what I tell you see if you can make an intelligent point [laughter] a bright are deep\nAnd as much as everybody been touting are torn each other we got a lot of takeovers and that's what's been working for us okay with the charge is coming to town now\nThey're up and says one of the top if they stay away from the turnovers I'm afraid of what's going to happen today okay now my ... Lewis got them on top of the division but I don't think they're going to stay there they haven't traditionally\nWhat Margaret Lewis\nAfter they've been able to get to the playoffs they just don't win in the postseason right aren't bright\nBright so I'm I'm thinking today's or is it okay for Cleveland if we could climb above that five hundred mark\nOur division I think the Steelers are going to be there\nOkay I think Cincinnati they're playing over their head and the rape and start going out\nAll say ... ... and ... and it will be fun if you're going to make a playoff run it will be fun um I don't think they are going to make a playoff run yet but I think there ahead of the curve than what we thought they were going into this year\nWith this football team but here's the thing with the brown when you look at a total numbers and you say oh they're they're they're twenty seven total deep but it's about point to loud\nAnd they've only allowed a hundred and Thirteen points this year that's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven that's talked in football\nTalked a few points allowed the U.S has been the Chicago Bears it's sixty five and you got back during a by weeks and all that to cause some things have had ...\nBut yeah I like this brown defense they have some play makers miles Garrett started we know that tend toward has been one of the better rookies in football this year and then often you change the culture when you bring it back or Mayfield and he's the winner\nBut\nBefore you start thinking playoffs you got to the teacher you schedule because the browns have been done a lot of winning in the last few years doesn't mean they can't do it this year but this is an opportunity where you have a situation to be the chargers team today this charge you seen that people don't go to the super bowl before the year\nBoth to me the match ups up against the in my opinion the end of the apes the north is what's going to determine the success of the browns this year\nIn the in my opinion the and if the if the north is what they'll begin to determine is except though of the browns this year and I don't know how this division could apply out because the Steelers got the\nBangles ... and the ravens as well it's been a tight division I will take a timeout when we come back we talk to Mike ... is that your job right here on CBS Sports radio purses

and by that I mean it's ... tight in its element slot games white the running back that good a half receiver of the reason the lake coming out of the fact field so it's all inside out\nAnd if God Gordon can start making some place on the outside and it was fun watching the tape last week because there still is not\nA real ... factor or they're not in sync Tom Brady and\nGordon the first two throws were were disconnect between quarterback and white out but that thirty five yard touchdown pass\nRadio then play scramble they throw it up and you could see the difference for an athlete with length I be going and getting a football can change things for them so if they continue to develop a relationship with a report that often is going to get better about\nYou look at the concerns for Kansas City moving forward the coach and what he's going to do in a big spot was Super Bowl expectations now with the chiefs and then also their defense they played better the last two weeks but so some concerns there\nYeah I think some of their numbers are misleading they're worse than the leg last in the league at in total defense at over four hundred and sixty or the game but that's what happens\nWhen you league game girly and you sit back and an umbrella ... and the second half of let people throw the ball underneath so I think some of the numbers are misleading however what what kind of bothers me is watching the film last week\nA what a great game they had obviously against Jacksonville but they gave up nine plays at Twenty one yard plug\nThose chunk flavor killer and and that can't happen this week it makes it more difficult your safety her banged up and you probably don't have one or two about cast Russia's but the big picture for the season\nYou know you're often go score or point and what they did last week they fight back by turnover that let's say they're deep and there are there in the top ten in the league and generating turnover\nAnd if you're going to give up junk plays and yard you got to be able to pick the football away as far as their head coach I've always been an Andy Reid fan I I grew up in Philadelphia I Know in a very well\nYou know the knock on him is that he had won the super bowl yet he took one Philadelphia team there\nFrom my perspective he gets the most that he possibly can and the talent he has on hand and Zach you're a hundred percent right\nIf if their quarterback my home continue to play at a high level then\nWhether or not they get to the super bowl when the super bowl a lot of that's going to come down on the beef up\nTalking to my ... from the NFL Network in Westwood One might also know you called the pre season games for the eagles on television in Philadelphia Eagles got off to a little bit of a slow start they had a big win last week up against the New York giants on Thursday night\nJust what you look at the eagles now when the NFC East in my opinion but how do you think they stack up with\nThe rest of the NFC ... I think you have to see where we are right now I think you have to look the same the Panthers and the rams as the three best teams in the NFC now that doesn't mean we're going to end up that way in Philadelphia now three and three and\nI'm a ... fan and have been in North Dakota state\nI think he's got a chance to be the best player in the national football league over the next ten years so when you have a guy like that you've always got a chance he's going to be Aaron Rodgers or ... or ...\nAll the over the next ten years so when you have a guy like that you've always got a chance he's going to be Aaron Rodgers or Ben Roethlisberger or ... or Tom Brady or to pick a name he's going to be one of the top guy I Apologize hold on one second\nZach [noise] sorry about that with a couple of dogs in the neighborhoods that\nOh good my chance to be I got dogs are always barking as well for him\n[laughter] anyway we're where we were talking about when and and to me that makes them dangerous ... and they gave away a couple of games on their feet off at certain positions or beat up and running back or beat up in the in the secondary but\nTheir front seven good as anybody in the league I Believe ... and I think they're going to get a little bit of a run before for that and done my belief is they win the NFC East whether or not to get back or super boy that's a different conversation\nAnd I love boy and says well being able to cover him in Philadelphia and that's your franchise quarterback for the eagles for years and years to come and you can plant such\nA highly successful level the giants had a franchise quarterback for so many years now it looks like the end is coming sooner rather than later for Ely your bread and butter is the draft you do a great job board on the NFL Network\nWe look ahead to the quarterbacks in the draft\nAnd I know we don't know all of them that are coming out and Herbert Greer and lock\nOur son that jump off the pages how 'bout this quarterback classes a hole for this upcoming draft\nYeah we have no idea who's going to come out or not come out you know the Herbert kid from Oregon is six sex with a big arm he's the prototypical NFL style quarterback he can push the ball down the field he's young he's a third year in junior\nOr you can see on film I watched over two thousand seventeenth date he struggled against Boise in the ball game or a struggle with crashed pressuring pocket awareness but\nYou love the size to love the physical traits that he had\nHe just had made all play here who play a lot of college football yet\nSo he's highly intriguing I think drew lock up from Missouri I think he's in he's got all the physical traits can make all the throws 'em my frustration with him it's just a little bit inconsistency makes one good throw makes another good row and then he makes a decision and throw you why why did you go there\nAnd why did you miss it so badly so I'm Still in the very early\nStages I've seen probably the top quarterbacks you know probably three games a piece in before it's all said and done all the all of them\nA book right now you know Greer from West Virginia is an interesting kid he's got some athletic ability a little bit of a gunslinger a bit I'm from ... got some ah physical traits arm strength but at this point\nI think it's way too early to say whether it's a good or bad quarterback class 'cause we don't even know who's coming out\nWell judging off the early returns from this past\nYear quarterback class it looks like well I'm a very successful one with some of the rookies that we've been seeing planning the national football league but you look at the browns a lotta people scratch their heads when they went Baker Mayfield that warning Denzel lord asked for and John Dorsey did a great job early on with those two selection\nI I agree I mean you can pay and then by the way I really like to Iraq Taylor I thought he was a nice acquisition because defensively they're going to compete and I thought ... Taylor who doesn't turn into football over would keep them in game now\nAll of a sudden they feel gets inserted into the game and there's a different energy level with that entire often nay fields gets the ball out quickly he extends play\nYou know his quarterback rating is not outstanding he's made some bad decisions but that all rookies do uh I I think it's exciting to watch him play\nI think he's got tremendous outside and I think their game with the chargers this week\nIs kind of an intriguing game that nobody saw coming\nTalking to my Mac you look around the rest of the league with some of the rookies in the national football league German James dairy is Leonard or with the Indianapolis Colts then you've got sick when in Darnah with the two New York teams will be fun to track for years and years to come who've been some other rookies to impress you so far early on\nI think quite melt in the left or the cult fad of Notre Dame who who I had just behind Barkley is number two player in the draft and uh he's going to be out there and he's going to be a perennial pro bowler um I think mark established port who who New Orleans traded up to take\n'em is incredibly raw but has an ability to make plays and I think he's come along and I think you're seeing Calvin ...\nIn the Atlanta Falcons late first round pick come in and really make some plays and and I think we started talking about that Ryan in oil Jones and Ridley and realize the Bahamas and news you're three that's pretty impressive\nYeah released been done for the falcons and this question was on the show last night\nAnd we talked about the best wide receiver does in the national football league we obviously had the conversation with a Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley or a B and Jews you definitely came out and then my selection was actually dealing and dig so who's the best wide receiver do on the national football league clearly on them splitting hairs\nBoy and I mean that that's pretty good question um\nI I I get a huge kick out of the than the yelling because you're talking about a fifth round picking a free agent which I think he's awesome um when you look at age ... and you do in Pittsburgh I think that's really difficult to be\nFair enough wrapping up with my Mac right now on CBS Sports radio we look at two teams that surprised me so far in the national football league the bangles they play the Steelers later today and the bears also have the dolphins two teams that have had to strong starts to this year how do you think there are seasons will play out the rest of the way\nYeah you get mentioned two of the more intriguing teams along with uh the chargers I think in in what will happen with Cleveland and I'm\nWith Chicago I think they got a real job when they traded for ... and I think he's done wander to help them defensively he's he's brought a different level and get into the quarterback and a different level of energy for that old deep that helps them compete because\nOr you or someone you love one of the nearly one million Americans living with Parkinson's disease there is no known cure\nThat you have the power to help the change that participating in a clinical trial the Michael J. thought foundation will help you get started\nThey didn't Michael J.

J. G. used up his room and your farmers brought studio good morning I'm Doug Scott\nOf a loaded concrete truck last year tipped onto a car near Omaha killing two people has been found not guilty of two misdemeanor motor vehicle homicide counts\nSo a woman needs to know that she's affirmed by God every day that she matters not because her husband propose to her but because God adopted her\nThat she's beautiful and God's eyes not because her husband is still attracted to her but according to classes through twelve God chose er and loves her dearly that she's secure not because her husband still wants to be with her and is helping to contribute to the family income the gods that I Will meet all of your needs\nYou need that platform of security\nTo reach out and influence someone because guys are influenced by people they respect\nIf I'm playing golf and get another guy can barely break a hundred he tells me I'm gripping my club too tightly I'm like ... cheers you\nAnd I just I really hitting me where it hurts [laughter] but I got a great opportunity\nTo play golf one time with two professional golfers Jonathan burdens that Johnson ... Gary you're holding your club ... I'm listening I mean that knows what he's\nTalking about and so to be an agent of influence has to be someone who is receiving from God on a daily basis because you won't take the risk\nIf your happiness your sense of security your sense of wellbeing depends on what your husband thinks about you at any given moment your husband's a falling man and he might be angry with you when you shouldn't be angry with you you might be impatient with you when you didn't do anything wrong and so I I Would say\nHis desire is for the the woman to become God centered first\nSo that she could really be an agent of his love torture has when they get it sounds easy\nStraight forward this is the right thing to do this is what we talked about in terms of the Christian to be rooted in Christ and have a foundation of him for our identity you've said that very clearly but it's really tough to put into practical or you know everyday life\nAnd how do we prevent ourselves both husbands and wives for making marriage an idle particularly women I think emotionally they're expecting a lot out of this relationship at times more than husbands can deliver I'm not letting husband's off the hook I'm just saying this is reality yeah\nIt it's a great point Jim and here's how I've avoided the idol well ... how it pushed back against the making marriage an idol I Try to love my wife out of worship to her heavenly father\nOne of my goals I fall so far short of this every day but it's a goal on aiming toward it is it I Want God to say was angels I Wish other husbands would love their wives away my son Gary loves my daughter Lisa\nI Want to please God with how I treat lease and so the way I keep for making it an idle the way I keep from trying to turn Lisa into a love Gary like he wants to be loved machine\nIs to please first my heavenly father got to you happy with how I handled my wife in that situation if she's having a bad day did I give her grace sometimes you just gotta let somebody have a bad day it's a great word I mean ... or ... does she need encouragement because maybe she's being taken for granted by her kids are her friends\nMaybe I really see a way that God can use her\nAnd she's letting fear hold her back and she just needs loads of affirmation maybe she's going through a sickness and I want her to know it's not a burden to care for you is my greatest joy I Am here I Want you to focus on just getting well you've spent your whole life serving others let us serve you at this point\nBut it really is at the end of the day lord are you happy\nWith how I loved your daughter and and I think that's the adage I don't know how it could ever be an idle because you're serving the one true God by loving your spouse ...\nGary in your book loving them well you have a a observation of Napoleon Bonaparte which when you think about it I think a lot of military academies probably lean on him for military strategy ingenious not so much for marriage advice or how did his relationship with his wife catcher notice\nWell you know Jim having read through it the bowling Bonaparte can teach us what not to do as much as what he was a ... of the highest order and he was vicious at times to his wife when she showed weakness he said I Need you to be strong to the emperor rush needs to show her strength\nBut what we can learn from that is that the husbands need really is for the strongest wife possible\nThat that's the best way to bless your husband becomes strong in the lord become strong in your character the only thing you can absolutely changing your marriage we talked earlier about influence the\nOne person you can change is yourself and if you change yourself\nYou bring blessings into your marriage and you can learn you know what how do I learn to respond to an impatient has been\nIn a holy way how do I learned to dissipate my husband's anger you're not excusing his impatience you're not excusing as anger but you're learning how do I become stronger myself so that I can handle it would amazed\nUsing his impatience you're not excusing as anger but you're learning how do I become stronger myself so that I can handle it would amaze me\nThat no one's ever been as wholly is Jesus and yet no one was ever let down or taken for granted or assaulted or attacked or maligned more than Jesus was and yet he never had this poor me attitude he never said to his disciples it ... what\nAre you going to do for me you know I'm an old you are right here I I and\nIt's just amazing how because he was self centered and who got is that um he was on and so again the platform for influence is strength and that's what I I think husbands look at I don't\n... I hate to talk and stereotypes 'cause every marriage is its own story but since I get together with guys a lot they love to brag about their what they look they look up to that and and it might be different things you might be a great athlete you might be great with money she might be a\nGreat ... lawyer she might newer Bible backwards and forwards you just might be so social you know and if the husband particularly as a big into ... that that can be a big thing but ultimately I think that's what you're looking at\nAs you seek to influence your husband say what am I bring into the equation here because it's never you don't want to get to the point of our marriage will be better when you get your act together it's always got to be above than all improve my marriage when I approve me\nBut let's highlight that because that's an easy way for our flushed to take us and when you get your act together then will be a better couple 'cause my act has already together what about for that woman and I'm I'm sensitive to this for the woman who is trying hard she's the wife that has been doing some of these fundamentals that we've talked about in the first part of the program here\nBut there is that feeling like I'm the only one putting effort into this so to speak to that woman who says okay you're I hear what you're saying you know I got to be the best me I can be in Christ\nBut man I've been doing that and it's still in their excuse the grammar\nLet me make a distinction here gym because I think it's important I Do believe as painful as it is for me to say this\nThat they're rather than trying to save some marriages or some marriages that women need to be safe from in the case of real abuse or dangerous situations of I don't want a woman to hear this and say okay I just need to focus on myself so let acknowledging that good I ... yeah I interviewed a number of women\nOne of them was a woman that I think a similar type of woman you're describing\nHer husband was so uninvolved at home it was so frustrated he was always fishing\nAnd then she kept talking I says well fishing season is almost over\nForgetting to tell her that hunting season comes right after fishing season and then he was so involved in war and she was so disappointed she said I I'm ashamed to admit this but I found myself praying lord I Hope you'll have an affair or die so there's a biblical way out she saw a way for her marriage\nTo be improved or Satan and she was just miserable but as a committed believers she felt like well I don't have a reason to leave his not abusing me he hasn't been unfaithful and she prayed through it\nAnd this will seem severe to some so I just wanted knowledge that as we go in she came up with what she called the magic question and it was a shock she went he came home when she said what do you want me to do for you that I'm not doing\n... she hated asking that question she pushed back with the lord saying he should be asking me that question there are other things he should be doing that he's not\nAnd his answer made or even angrier he said I Want you to be in a better mood when you get home\n[laughter] and she's asking me to do more laundry asked me to paint the house asked me to replace the route don't ask me to be in a better mood if you had in my life you wouldn't be in a better mood either but she realized you know what I make him pay for my frustration every time he comes home I let them know how unhappy I Am how frustrated\nI Am with everybody and so she said okay I just got put this in my mind I'm just going to try to do it and she did it and then she asked them again in any gave her something else that had to do with the kids and at first again she was you're the absent father and you're telling me how to be a better mother\nBut what he said was true and renewed her relationship with one of her daughters in particular she had a blind spot and that's just what we always have to remember just because their spouse is wrong doesn't make us right you can be wrong in a hundred different direction you can miss a target north south east or west\nBut that doesn't mean because somebody sitting at north you're not missing itself and then what happens\nWhen she began to make those changes her husband came along and he began to change as well I actually just heard from her

Penn it's easy to lose your place in situations like this it's simply\nYou rely on your old vocal filler standbys\nHum a or maybe you're just hesitate and stop talking altogether these\nAre what Michael er regard called verbal blunders and just fluency or art was intrigued by this phenomenon and how it infiltrate our everyday lives showy investigated\nLenders and just fluency or art was intrigued by this phenomenon and how it infiltrate our everyday lives so we investigated then laid out his findings in his book hum slips stumbles and verbal blunders and bought the mean\nOne thing he found out is that we all stumble though some of us are better able to finance it than others\nThere are certainly people who you know when they say these things some of them do it well they make a ton natural and they use to fill the pause as a kind of punctuation I've heard announcers on television do this quite a bit\nAnd there are other people of course who said between every single word and that really annoys me but I quit admire the first instance I don't know that I\nAm quite good enough [laughter]\nAs a speaker to be able to do it I don't know if it's deliberately maybe that's just a matter of style but it is true that everyone does have their own baseline level of this fluency\nDoes fluency is a name for hesitations like I'm at a to get an understanding of why they creep into our speech there aren't soon as you have to know how we talk what's going on when our brain and our mouth work together it might surprise you to learn good we don't speak in sentences\nSentences are something that will be more familiar and writing rather than speaking what we're doing when we're talking is that were assembling groups of words and sometimes those words group as smaller or larger units\nAnd there's a basic architecture to those phrases and to those clauses that we sat in our minds first\nAnd then we go and we select the words to fit in that architecture and then we associate the sounds with those words so it's kind of a linear process you know one thing that happened that another thing happened and everything happened\nSo we plan what we want to say the phrase isn't clauses than we say they're simple enough but ... says it sometimes things get a little jammed up on the assembly line of our spontaneous conversations\nNow in the process of planning what to say we can't speak at the same time we're most of us find it very difficult to do both of those things simultaneously and so we plan and then we think and then we plan and then we think in very fast cycles fractions of seconds\nBut still they're cycle and we're kind of moving back and forth between planning what to say and then actually saying it\nAnd so the other phenomena are these moments where we are alternating between planning and speaking or maybe where we get stuck in a planning phase and so we fall silent maybe or we decide to fill the silence\nWith a little sound sometimes it's an a or um sometimes it's a word like you know or well\nThe problems will buy some time and they'll work sooner that we are done talking so please don't interrupt it also gives our audience a little insight into our mind is working speaking of insight there's another verbal mistake that's been touted as an unconscious look into the deepest recesses of our mind until friday and slip\nYou could describe what the slip as and say well\nThese two sounds swaps with each other or you selected the wrong word and you asked for say a condom instead of a condiment the Freudian part of it is where you come in and you say why did the person make that flip\nWith that word when that seem to produce some kind of meaning that we can interpret as having some sexual innuendo behind it or having something slightly salacious or obscene or having something slightly hostile\nDown there is the ... in his book or ride offer some examples\nEquivocal when you meant to say equivalent or Tim Marines instead of trampolines when we hear people make verbal ... or use a lot of ... and ... there's a tendency to think they're not very smart or that they're hiding something from us around and says the evidence points to something else\nSeems pretty natural to want to come to a pretty broad sweeping conclusions about somebody based on the way that they're speaking are they lying can I trust them or they smart enough to do the job that I've asked them to do and things like that\nAnd all of the reading that I did which involved a pretty massive search\nThrough the literature in which there is an attempt to try to link this fluency and slipping behavior with certain kinds of personality traits\nWith high cues with education level with all the things there's no reliable link between them so what I conclude is\nThat this fluency particularly is a pretty good indicator of state so someone state of mind someone's emotional state they're not very reliable\nIndicators of traits intelligence character leadership a tendency to lie for instance\nAnd to use the fluency in that way really starts to border on a kind of linguistic discrimination where you come to conclusions about who someone is essentially based on the way that they speak\nIn our segments on viewpoints we usually square about all the homes are long pauses and six of the tongue our guests made for the sake of time and to keep their answers flowing\n... suggested that we try an experimental that our listeners decide for themselves if editing has any effect on what they think of his speech so theory is continuing his thoughts on the perception of truthfulness and verbal slips and fluency first the edited version\nThe notion of what is considered truthful is now I think becoming a little more like just natural talking which so we'll have hesitation going to have an arms and that as well now you're just as there's a stereotype that people who are speaking\nFluently aren't telling the truth or maybe who are educated\nNo I'm not a political scientist and I'm not a policy expert\nBut I Do know that the regulation of private industry has basically over the course of my lifetime I was born in Nineteen eighty has led to a country where okay perhaps we have smaller government but in its place we have bigger business that can be just as potent of a force in people's lives and when it's geared toward\nRather than the public good you have situations like today a moment of historic wealth inequality when\nThe c._e._o. of some corporation and make like three thousand times the salary of the workers on the floor and so on and so that's one piece of the puzzle I think it's sort of these impenetrable systems that an individual doesn't stand a chance against in many ways\nThe second main issues marsh pointed out was how our health care system off in places poor people in positions of disadvantage\nDental care in this country is incredibly difficult to access for people in poverty and actually the Affordable CARE Act that was passed in twenty fourteen as a kind of compromise to the other side of the aisle removed dental policies from that coverage as those somehow\nThe health of one's teeth is separate from the rest of one's body and so\nThere are a lot of hard working people to labor sixty hours a week then end up with a cavity that goes on treated and my dad and in this group he ended up with an infection up into the route that turned into ... so essentially he had blood poisoning from what could have been treated originally as a cavity\nAnd so for somebody like my dad who needs don't look like the famous shiny pearly white straight teeth to the same and celebrity that we idolize in this country\nLet's say that he did everything right according to the American dream he worked as an honest man and let's say he gets laid off and then he needs to go find another job\nHe goes into a job interview and because of the person interviewing him holding classes use essentially or ideas about my dad's teeth looking like something that they associate with\nDirty people he doesn't get the job and then says he doesn't get the job he can't afford to get his teeth fixed\nWhile her book explores these issues and more it's also written with a defiant pride in her childhood ... society expects a poor girl from Kansas to feel shame that's why she reasons terms like red neck and white trash or thrown around ...\nBut ... says those so called red neck tendencies led to some of her fondest memories for instance the time her grandfather rigged to canoe to a pickup truck and drove the family through the snow for some thrills in a flat area of Kansas\nThat's a story that you know I had such a special place in my heart and yet it is something that someone would look at that\nLet's say that the portrayal within a movie it would be like oh there's some redneck what a white trash thing do I write against those words and those sentiments in the book because really what's going on when people want to\nGet high on the horse about their socioeconomic status as superior to someone else is really just\nThat comes from the same place as any other sort of derogatory term we as a society has a gun at least I think to contend with\nRacial slurs and at that that's about when and so we haven't really examine how frequently we use words and language which are very powerful that unfairly cut down people just for their poverty\nSarah marshes book heartland is available now for links and more information on all of our guests visit our site did viewpoints on line dot net ...

show moves the quicker will lose the characters to the madness that is Breaking Bad\nMost shows have no interest in slowing down and for good reason audiences generally want to see the big moments and don't care much for the small mundane wants\nBetter call soul has found a way to flip that dynamic on its head and still keep audiences totally engaged it's a daring experiment gone completely

numbers are up five points from late August but they're still\nDeeply underwater and on the generic ballot question who do you support and your house district Democrats laid by eleven points among ... a registered voters Thirteen points among likely voters Carl how do you see the midterms twenty three days at\nA Republicans look a little uh go to the Senate or because of the map but we have so many of Republican oriented states and so few Democrat or a Sophie Republican senators up for election houses a different question there\nUh take Charlie cookie as a hundred and Ninety six solid to lean replace you could say he writes the cook Political Report it a lot of the Bible on yeah it's ... and look there are several others but they're all sort of in the same place so he's got two hundred and eight solid ... ah to lean Democrat said so\nI'm thirty one toss ups to Democrats seats twenty nine Republican seats are ripping Democrats to take control we need ten if they hold all those solid Ilene that's about a third of what what what other tossup states Republicans would need to take about Seventy one\nBut um it's going to be close and it's going to be a long night I Would suspect we're going to have a large number of races settled by a relatively small handful of votes\nGovernorships a lot of those up this year thirty six several Republicans are likely to Lucy simply because they have so many and unfortunately there'll be a couple of big state governors in\nChile what do you hear from folks at the White House do they feel politically with a capital a confirmation battle that they have blended stopped\nThe so called blue wave of democratic advances and to the degree that they still worry about especially losing the house how worried are they about that that if they lose the house had been Speaker Pelosi and Adam ship in terms of intelligence with the impact that is going to have in terms of investigations and hearings and also on their agenda\nI think they see on your first question them on the way if I think they feel like they've been able to perform on the Senate side there was this at this point coming out of the summer coming out of Labor Day weren't actually get looked like some of the Senate right that\nThat should be a pretty comfortable for Republicans weren't getting closer and that seemed to have shifted it we now do seem to be in a place where there than it is definitely leaning more strongly toward Republican but the question about what happens if Democrats take back the house is really a big cloud over the White House because\nDemocrats will have the power in the house they will be launching it they have already said a whole raft of investigation that not that investigation into things that we know Bob Mueller has been looking at\nTheir open to going after Trump taxes to go in after a financial dealings with other people and the administration in the cabinet he said something that I think would really at the different dominate\nAt twenty Nineteen for the president in ... because he hasn't done a particularly good job at laying out what his legislative agenda would be in a divided government\nHe's got the idea that infrastructure criminal justice reform but there's nothing really proactive that he that he is pushing and and the White House because they are under staffed and has been for quite some time they do not have the infrastructure in place right now to deal with a lot of democratic and I think\nMade while especially after the Kavanaugh's confirmation fight there seems to be a push among Democrats to take on Donald Trump on his own terms to be more aggressive and it's coming from some unlikely sources take a look\nAnd you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about\nFamily says if you don't when they go low\nLow rent we should make it clear that later in that same speech Eric Holder made it clear that he's not advocating violence but this move to the lab on issues on tactics do you think it it's good politics for ... well I think I say\nWithin the Democratic party you see a couple of political figures they're trying to catch up there a couple of weeks behind the music ah the core base of the Democratic party is in a rage\nAnd they want to seem to be in a rage to\nThey want to be make sure everybody knows they're part of the resistance to\nUh so that's where I think this is I don't think it's good politics I don't think the spectacle at the Capitol hearing and no demonstrations that surrounded it\nUm which got pretty ugly in pretty far outside you know bans are helpful to Democrats at all and you know this this Kavanaugh business was a very very big deal because it went on so long it was so conspicuous\nLet's remember in the middle of it to the New York times came out with a story a very long piece about Trump's a pledge cheating on his taxes through the years\nIt sank without a without a without a sound practically so much so that a few days later the time to read it again and it still seems to have gotten no traction so that's how big a deal at ... at ... that's how much that the capital controls the ground things out and I think\nRepublicans will benefit from this into the midterms whether they can match the Democrats enthusiasm is entirely another matter I doubt that but there and ... the Republicans in better shape because of it\n... you can see the Republicans and the president certainly pushing this idea they're dangerous don't given a match to an arsonist their logo crazy a do forget the Republican talking points in your view do Republicans do Democrats\nTake a risk of being seen as too extreme the mob could conceivably hurt them in the ...\nWell I say a couple of things first\n... sitting here as a Democrat I'm confused because prior to a few weeks ago I was the snowflake of the party of snowflakes and suddenly we're an angry mob terrorists so but to the point you're asking um it doesn't really matter at this point whether we are as Rachel as build because we've been billed as Rachel\nAnd I would say the notion of when we go high stay high\nThat should have died on November eight twenty sixteen I'm definitely in the Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder\nCamp the anger among the Democratic party is genuine so I think in a very simple way is good to stay with that genuine emotion whether it is the most effective tactic next month or in next two years I don't know but it's genuine and I don't think it should be ignored and I don't think it should try to be falsely mitigated\nAnd we're going to have we're gonna see unfortunately people trying to modulate are trying to out Trump Trump\nAnd I think in twenty Nineteen that's going to be a real problem for the Democratic ... real quickly Carl\nAbout you isn't it about the Clintons in\nQuestion how\nIs Mrs Trump regarded in the Trump White house I mean we know Hillary with regard as we know how other parts like Nancy Reagan how would you regard it as she seen people scared of her and she's seen as an important advisor to the president where is she saying in terms of weighing in on policy in style\nShe really interesting thing where she is an innocent indices well she is a important advisor to this president but she does that in her own way she is not a first lady who spend a lot of time in the west wing\nShe is not somebody who at like Michelle Obama who developed strong relationships with certain people in the west of Lincoln had people there who are sort of her voice\nThere isn't more her to the president at in their private time but she does this effort to kind of put her in a box than an defined her and I think what we have seen over these last couple of years is that that's really impossible to do because on the one hand she is a strong supporter of her husband as anyone\nYet she find moments where she is willing to speak out against him in a really public way some of his policy decisions some of the things that he says on Twitter and I think that\nThat's what we're going to see from her and the next couple of somebody who kind of have to look moment to moment to figure out where she's going to be but but in the theater play she is in line with us with this president\nI kept panels and next Sunday up next the U.S takes more confrontational approach

five and twelve [noise]\nTalk about the mayor political radio on doctors homes are and I'm Tracy McCray October is breast cancer awareness month and our guest is a Mayo Clinic expert on ... to go\nAll right with a matter of fact decker goes being overweight increases your risk of developing breast cancer is that a myth or a fact\nThat is indeed a fact a ... a weight is one off our breast cancer risk factors and so\nThe more we can do to keep a weight down the better it is so actual management off that is eating healthy with regular and regular exercise when we say eating healthy it's actually a cutting down on fat intake I Would definitely be a risk factor reduction and regular exercise\nUm the other things that will help but as a watching the alcohol intake um because access to alcohol intake is a risk factor for breast cancer also\nWe have the obesity family history obviously ages you get older you're more likely to get\nBirth scared for alcohol sedentary lifestyle and Mrs it\nSounds like what a lot of our expert guess tell us if you are a lot of and yes I did I say All right let's talk about the different types of breast cancer 'cause I Know there are several different ones can you outlined for\nSure the breast cancer marker is kind of help us identify what kind of cancers these are so um we have what is based on the location of the abnormality we can call it breast cancer can be ... or ... cancers [noise]\nAh but in general what we're finding is that the biology matters and that tumors that are estrogen receptor positive\nEstrogen approaches receptive positive or hurt too positive or negative for each of these markets\nKind of identified what type of tumor this is so an estrogen positive project on positive hurt too negative breast cancer differ from her too positive breast cancer and has different also from what it's called the triple negative breast cancer\nAnd the treatment for those is different than having really loves words important\nThat's exactly right because now biology is what drives cancer treatments so it's very individualized to the type of cancer the person hats so if a woman has an extradition positive cancer there are medications that go after the estrogen receptor\nAs a patient has hurt too positive breast cancer we have targeted therapy for the hurt too positive to see\nWhat ... what are ways that has come I mean I'm not a breast cancer survivor but I Will meet women who are thirty or forty or cancer survivors and back then there was like one treatment and that was it is that right\nThat is exactly right I mean initially it was women with breast cancer had the option of mastectomy removal of all lymph nodes\nAnd when chemo came into being everybody got that chemotherapy but now thanks to again the breast cancer researchers um who have really advanced to understand number one is that what is the biology of these cancers and then based on the biology try to find targeted treatments that work well\nAnd so even conditions such as triple negative breast cancer at one point these were diseases which were hard to treat\nAnd now we're coming up with new or therapies um managed by our our special oncologist who come and\nCreate a treatment that is very specific for the patient\nYou know what I forgot one of the ... what is a little bit per hour radio show which includes you because you had lymphoma when you were a kid\nVery much so yeah that's why I bypass all those other things that goes straight to the MRI\nThat's where I Am in these kind of exposure to radiation therapy to the breast region ducked increase one's future risk of breast cancer usually we say about eight years out from the radiation the woman should be you're having yearly screening mammography and MRIs alright\nGenetic testing confusing subject what tests are available and who are to be genetically tested so when we talk about\nWomen with a family history of breast cancer and you're always trying to understand anybody who has a family history we're trying to understand based on the family history is there evidence to suggest that this family maybe a family of carrying a gene genetic abnormality that puts them at increased risk\nWhat we used to know really it was the are the one NBRC it to a two genes associated with very high risk of breast and ovarian cancer\nAs information has evolved as gene testing has become more available and knowledge has increased we have found that there are other genes also that may be associated with breast cancer\nSo what does the woman do typically what we say is that if you have a family history discuss with your physician let a clinician let them know that this is what my family history is and it's not only breast cancer if you have a family history of breast ovarian colon cancer males with prostate cancer melanoma\nI'm an even pancreatic cancer these me all Billington really any cancer and seek help from your commission so that then we can say does this patient qualify to be sent for gene testing now usually what we prefer is that when there is a family history like that which they meet with a genetic counselor\nSeek the expert opinion and then they can guide you as to what is your likelihood of carrying a gene mutation and that\nGuides what kind of testing to be done\nAnd depending on how you test than you can give a woman advice about what you ought to do whatever frequently she ought to be done to the theater\nThat's exactly right there are very clear guidelines that a woman who carries a beer or see one or two gene mutation would benefit from MRI in addition to mammography and the timing of initiating the treatment generally we start MRI at age twenty five foot bracket carriers and then at age thirty we add them all graffiti for these racket carriers\nAnd at some point when they're finished child bearing at or near that is some around thirty five to forty years usually close to forty we start talking about risk producing surgery so again I'm a very important for these patients to be in touch with experts to read it as breast cancer awareness month with the most important thing you want to know [noise]\nPossibly take some ibuprofen or Tylenol and you can use ice or heat there's no science to tell us which works better\nYeah that was a question we all we all want to ask what do I use I sure hate and there's no right answer huh\nNo we we uh we depend on extrapolating from a joint problems are joint injuries such as sprained ankles where we theoretically believe that we not theoretically I'll say we believe that\nThat uh if we put ice on it or reduce inflammation from an injury well that's not necessarily going to help the low back because the the cold from the ice doesn't get deep enough to affect the physiology\nDown around this fine and the same way with heat the heat doesn't get down there far enough and so it's probably affecting the nerves and the muscles that it can penetrate more than anything else and affecting\nThe pain that way certainly ice or heat can reduce or some pain and it can help with muscle spasm of you're having spasm\nBut I Can't tell you that there's a write in a wrong application of ice and heat in that situation if it's a cute I Would go with the ice first\nI didn't I at first and when you say ... what do you mean by ... laid out her bed no arrest\nHas relative rest and we know that if you lay in bed for three days it's going to be more damaging than helpful\nOr when we lay down we lose muscle mass will leave lose bone density and it doesn't take very long and not being active before those things can become measurable\nShow arrest is reducing your activities to the point that you're not making yourself miserable as the way I explained it to my patients it's not likely you're going to do additional damage unless you have like pain numbness in tingling down your leg where you probably have a pinched nerve if it's back pain\nI Would do whatever I can reasonably do without making myself miserable and I would expect things to get better over a course of a week or maybe two weeks sometimes\nIt's in treatment night me my favorite massage but what else\nThere is evidence for many types of treatment for back pain\nNone of the evidence is strong ...\nWhether it be a the anti inflammatory medicines or spinal manipulation such as a chiropractor physical therapist might provide her massage or acupuncture or tai chi or yoga there's some evidence for most of these things but the evidence is not strong for any of it\nAnd that's why we have so many different treatments that people get to choose from\nOf one of my my friends Scott hauled him in a wrote an article a few years ago and they described it like going through the back pain supermarket you can just pick things off the shelves that you wanted to try\nAnd that's because none of them worked wonderfully show as far as what is best in your case I Would say what's worked in the past ... what do you tolerate what are you willing to do but not only can you do those past things you have to do smacked things you have to keep moving it with relative ...\nHow about prevention a few hints about that and then we don't have to worry about all those options\nNow that would be wonderful if we could prevent all this from ... from occurring to begin with a again we don't have good studies that tell us that we can prevent back pain we know that we can prevent episodes of back pain at times and the only thing it has strong evidence there is exercise none of the rest of the treatments are we to\nCan really prevent pain\nAnd ah there are certain factors do risk factors are that we can alter if you smoke stop smoking because smoking nicotine effects the blood supply to the desk that outside of the desk\nAnd uh the small pores that go in and out of the disc from the the bone and it can increase just a generation if you're overweight if you lose weight it's probably going to help [noise]\nOr if you don't exercise that's a risk factor being sedentary is a risk factor in were more sedentary now in our society than we've probably ever been in the past and that's probably one of the run of the reasons that there's so many people who suffer from back then\nObesity problem\nYeah but those are thirty pounds overweight so curious thirty pound backpack around and see what the difference it makes it a little bit of course was slow we don't think of it over time but if it occurs quickly then you become very aware that this is a stress in my back

Mario to has already been sacked\nFive times in this game the titans have been unable to get any meaningful off its going\nThat's far today five minutes left to go into the second quarter and we have the ravens fourteen the titans nothing\nNo thank you very much Brent Douglas so the ravens out too quick start de ... with a solid start as well let's set the Cincinnati where it was a wild one between the bangles and the Steelers just uh your usual rivalry may have seen or Jason Earhart checking in from Cincinnati Jason welcome back how are you\nYou're it's good to be with\nAbsolutely and this one was that so many twists and turns to it\nEspecially the way the end I mean how big of a sock it to the ... was that for the for the Bengals\nAre funny and the media elevator going down and we just kind of looked at each other and that that we've seen this movie before it seems like this is they'll have all these Pittsburgh and hear your new in the bangles quarter with a method Eighteen and left Ross burger that much time and three time out that the\nThere was a good that he was going to pull it off and the obviously they made one more play than the Bengals there at the end\nYou know if they could have just held him on that final play though that is a long feel do make maybe but but still long but just to see that game come to an end the way it did have the incredibly discouraging\nYeah and you know obviously a lot of Bengal fans are going to look back at that last play and you know what that illegal illegal I think the rural states yards down the field or less legal yard down the field of illegal\nEither way the bagel eleven guys to line of scrimmage event coordinator assume that we're going to run the ball there and give credit to the Steelers there was a a well designed playing in the block but then a yard\nOr certainly legal and the you know the heartbreak or for backup plans\nAnd to the Bengals have partially only themselves to blame just seven second half points that did not help matters\nYou didn't do much at all other than that final drive in which they were able to finally get stay on their backs them but the they were not able to do much off as the way most of the game I think they were out gain by about two hundred yards throughout the course of the game and quite frankly not able to get any pressure on Ben Roethlisberger he did not get touched today let alone sac though and that was\nOne of the the big he's that we talked about the game couldn't get anywhere near Roberts burger and it showed are\nFor our news talk WG a\n[noise]\nHigh on all these\nYears you will host rich Ackerman [noise]\nThree games going on right now we will take you out in just a moment to get the updates on all of them are one is it the half to inside the two minute warning of the first half earlier today the Seahawks went across the pond\nYou want to call that a little more than a pond but crushed the writers by score twenty seven to three or is it a long trip the two teams took different travel plans I don't know if that factored\nInto much of it today but the Seahawks came out on top convincingly and Pete Carroll discussed the long long trip to England\nI think everybody saw great today which is the whole point so our guys who set up in this whole thing back or pro German and a Air Canada and those guys that organized the whole thing I did the science now Sam rams into the science behind how he did this\nI think it was impeccably done and are really the place we still and I don't mean to be selling all this stuff but it was just great the growth was awesome the food was great it took care of us across the board facilities were were beautiful and\nSo it was just this was just amazing week and so it was really like a big town bowl game I've been to a few of those and this was like what that that is like in a really good part about that\nLike fever has [noise]\nWhat stood out to me it was um in the variety of ways we made yards throwing the ball ... wrote that are really nice job hunt a couple of guys from David and found a Tyler I'm moving out of the pocket he had really good time in the pocket and then had a second shot at making a play is dangerous when you get\nA couple of guys from David in sound uh Tyler I'm moving out of the pocket he had really good time in the pocket and then have the second shot at making a play he's dangerous when given a chance\nTo do you have a fantastic second half of me he had a couple of mostly almost hit him on the bomb just missed them on the one down field but only play the great football game he really looks like he's back in ... go and that's a big deal to us\nEverything tastes better feels better when you win and they won convincingly by a score of twenty seven to three today over the raiders in London and when the\nThree coming midway through the fourth quarter for Oakland is was never closed Russell Wilson two hundred twenty three orange and three touchdowns Doug ... caught six of those passes for Ninety One yards\nAnd the route was on early in this one is the Seahawks or get their third we ended up the season and go to the five hundred marks let's go on to Denver right now Bruce Martin standing by at the half than the rams in front of the Broncos\n[noise] yes they are they're up Thirteen to three LA has the second quarter ton girlie touchdown run a ten yards to go with a pair of first quarter field goals by Cairo's Santos Denver points came on a field goal by Brendan McManus the Broncos\nWhat did that first and goal and the rams won but autonomy penalty or the manual Sanders made it first and go to sixteen and the field goal at the end of the first day of Denver fans were chanting for backup quarterback Chad Kelly and they got their wish Kelly came out took a knee and a half was over turns that started case Kim was being evaluated under concussion protocol\nAnd cleared by the way it the half Canaan Thirteen of Twenty one\nJared ... from the rams nine of Fifteen both for one hundred thirty seven yards at the break rams late at Thirteen to three\nFine thank you very much Bruce Martin and Denver right now is the rams looking to remain on beating on the season at five and old Cooper cup last and this one had to be cornered off with a leg injury after a horse collar tackle so a company been questionable due to a a a concussion or\nCouldn't wasn't concussion protocol so it was not sure if he'd be able to play but did get the start and then of course I'd be cornered off food that leg injury so hopefully he is okay cowboys right now mowing the jaguars what a shock\nSo foreign today in Arlington still a couple of seconds left in the first half let's go to Bob Stevens\nMade forty one sex is to go in the first half\nIt's unbelievable the cowboys are leading chat do\nTwenty four to nothing ah it's been a ... show here in the first half though he's been the big difference in the office and sees Thirteen for Eighteen a hundred and fifty one your snooty air a couple of touchdown passes Jacoby easily have nine yards and Seventeen yards in a ... a big first half\nHe's already caught six Seventy nine yards but the interesting thing about brushed God is that\nHe's already a run the ball\nAnd the number of times here in the first half he's run the ball nine times for fifty three yard so not only is this is a drawing but it is a warning as well gee jelly it as a rush for forty five yards on now eleven carries\nThe jaguars have been held to just fifty two yards of off and you're in the first half of ... is a five or seven for thirty two yards\nBut uh so far it's been a dance class Scott Korb easily that has a really hooked up to give the cowboys is twenty four nothing we later in the first out\nFine and the ravens and titans right now in the rain in Nashville inside a minute left in the first half here's Brent Douglas\nAnd the rain and may have affected the ravens often ... as the first mistake they made the entire half a Joe Flaco with trying to go along down the middle of the ball was tipped up and to enter into the hands of heightened safety Kevin Byard\nHow the titans since the naval to putting out a first down but the titans now that the third intend on their own thirty six and only forty seconds left to go in the first half and it's just a passing rainstorm is not even as hard as it was whenever I talk a bit last couple of minutes\nBut it's still kind of ... some effects and it's supposed to continue having off and on showers throughout the rest of the afternoon which works in the ravens favors they're fourteen to nothing forty seconds left in the first half\nThank you very much Brent Douglas in Nashville earlier today we had another overtime thriller and it came down to the final seconds with the dolphins after back to back losses escaping with the wind and what was a wild one and Jack ... back to recapture jak welcome back how are you\nI'm doing well where it's just quite the traffic\nDown here you know they reviewed ever since they re did hard rock stadium every week it's something to do it\nAnd I had I learned not to get a certain traffic lane because now I have to go South Miami to go north back Palm Beach [laughter] so you know it just gives me more\nTime to talk to you but yeah what a gang today especially in light of the fact that rank and play\nAnd I got to tell you brought that swallow showed a lot of people today stepped in and out up and I I Want to say five hundred sixty are often and you know he didn't miss a beat I think he actually executed Adam ... better than right now\nWhat was the feeling that backed Kenyan drink afterwards you know yeah that's ... all one yard line he was very dejected on the bench don't like he had letters team down and then of course Jason Sanders saves them late\nYou know tend to a great guy was talking to in the locker afterwards he wasn't doing any media stuff and he did a stand up like a couple of people wanted him to do their radio stuff and Kenya and I\nTalk about him he said he was a a part of the foster child program I fully grown up and my wife our foster parents so we always talk about stuff like that and he just said\nHe just self esteem pick 'em up I mean he was devastating it was on the side like crying when Chicago which was driving because you know Chicago's kicker Cody party a former top and he left the free agency last year\n... you know he's automatic and when you when he put you know you don't want to see a kicker mess\nBut when he put that fall up you know everybody you know and that's often thought I was saying hey you know you know wind or something moving out of the way and he ... he just pushed it a little right and then you know ... took it to perfection the final two and a half minutes\nIt got you got 'em where they needed to be spike it with three seconds to go and then you can just go out there and kick his third field goal you know the second half\nAn hour on slowing down those barriers often that was coming off ... ... I mean and the historic day almost a you\nKnow Michel ... touchdown passes two weeks ago last time they were they were an action that came in today and it was very very quiet\n[laughter] you know the first half the dolphins were up seven nothing rich by that sect that third quarter the bears I think within the first seven and a half minutes they put three scores on the board\nOkay and we saw how quick they could strike I mean they had several plays and and you know truth be told we talked about this a little bit earlier I think it was the bears second yeah it was their second offenses theory\nHad a or a third and after twelve dark like fifty overthrew a I don't have my Russia in front of me it was never twenty nine for them I Believe it was twenty nine the overthrow him ... down in the middle\nAnd he goes on touch the entire ... guards there were a couple of drop passes there were some ... both by both sides I mean Chicago had the opportunity but you know the dolphins after after given up twenty seven\nIf there were some ... both by both sides I mean Chicago had the opportunity but you know the dolphins after you know after given up twenty seven strict party platform\nAnd being embarrassed that gets annoying like you know they take it without camp point three other defense to start or you know these kids face for another week because the choice in town\nYou know as I said before I think we said before the game you know this one did not look good going in on paper for the dolphins in this is why Herman Edwards always say you play to win the game the dolphins did just that I mean this is one of their better efforts of the season\nYou know to to blow the lean comeback and a guy who's also stood out so far at least some to me this season\n... every time you know the dolphins get a big play Albert Wilson seems to be in the middle of it\nYou know what I'm forty I Want to see the forty one or forty six shorter and the fourth quarter and the next drives Seventy five yards but you know you know what everybody's got to talk about in the morning and later on tonight Frank core the veteran Frank or first\nGo to good Clearwater dot com\nThat's good Clearwater dot com\nAre you looking to senior care for your mom or dad that don't know where to start high I'm On the line with a place for mom nobody knows your parent or a loved one better than you and nobody knows senior living better than the experts at a place for a mom it's a free service and we've helped thousands of families find the right place that their mom or dad\nPlace for answers place for mom called today\nCalled a place for a mom at one eight hundred three seven nine eleven Seventy four that's one eight hundred three seven nine eleven Seventy four [noise]\nCBS Sports radio we saw in northeast Nebraska on AM seven eighty one oh five ...

Cooper cup was talking about coming back has he been back on the field I Know he's been on the sidelines but as he actually played\nHaven't seen him on the field his status rains questionable\nDecay or because he was caught it off after that horse color tackled thereby daring Stewart and the first step but came back a and so far knock back on the field but is on the sidelines but that's certainly encouraging right now let's go to Bob Stevens in Dallas or this one's a surprise joining the Dallas Cowboys just mowing the jaguars so far here's Bob\nTwelve fifty five to go on the third it's all cowboys they're shutting out Jacksonville twenty four nothing was ten nothing after a while and the cowboys were fourteen more points in that second quarter but it's been a deck Prescott show two hundred and twelve total yards as far for Prescott fourteenth for twenty four hundred and fifty down your store the air\nA couple of touchdowns or to to\nGo because of nine and Seventeen yours jak also and a Seventeen you are to another score\nAnd that that has already wash for fifty three yards are nine carries in that first half the busily a big game he's caught seven for eighty seven yards see Kelly is wash for forty six yards on twelve carries\nAnd the cowboy deep as has done in the west is they've limited uh\nJacksonville to just sixty nine yards of often the deepest meditation for uh\nJacksonville today has been the Dallas forty yard line then they had to taught Blake portals is six or ten thirty five yards so the Jacksonville off as just haven't been able to do anything

Joni time the rams looking strong again today in Denver and let's check in with Bruce Martin\nAll right we've got three oh to to go in the third and the rams are income and a twenty three minutes ago they expanded their late on tried girlie second touchdown of the day a low stress one yard roll into the end zone this to go along with this ten yard run\nIn the second quarter on the day now sixteen carries one hundred thirty three yards for tied girlie who appears to be getting along with cold weather\nJust fine is today's game is being played with temperatures in the twenties meantime things got better for the rams moments ago they just got to pick out a tipped ball from John Johnson the third\nAnd they have the ball on their six we should point out there are those not in rams uniforms who are still wearing a smile hair\nThose would be the bronco cheerleaders\nBut then I'll [laughter] you know Bruce what has happened to those defense or is it just to pass Russian nothing else now because there's now two weeks in a row in which the run defense has been shredded\nThere on defense has been shredded and um of course last Sunday in the middle and uh the past the fence was destroyed attempt Arnold connected for two or three a very long range\nPlaced in a place of fifty sixty Seventy or something like that something like three of them against the bronco secondary what used to go by the name no fly zone as a matter of fact when a a fair appearing before reporters last week a quarterback Chris Harris was where he has no fly zone T shirt but maybe somebody should bleach out they know\nOn the no fly zone a T shirt it's really it's just everything on the line backers\nUm uh the the rookie Bradley Chuck today they've got a couple of facts today those were his first two of the year ... down um it's it's across the board with this and this defense it's just it's not what it was\nOkay Bruce born and you know Jodi everybody loved brother trouble on the draft night well\nIt's across the board with this and this defense it's just it's not what it was\nOkay Bruce born and you know Jodi everybody loved Bradley jump on the draft night\nWell ah everybody I did I I like them all I didn't necessarily think that he was a\nMust take for Denver when he when he was going to be in the top ten but he went right about where he was supposed to and you know he's off to a little bit of a slow start but the one always affects the other to run defenses always affected by the past events and vice versa\nOr I don't letting a team to lead walk was a mistake by the burn most during this off season I understood a contract was getting pricey than some other considerations they had to deal with\nUm he is a guy who from time to time can go off the reservation a little bit but he can flat out covering a flat out play\nSo I thought that was a chance they're secondary was going to take a step backwards they would just banking on the past Russia being so good that the corners weren't going to have to cover long well in the past rice hasn't been as good as a string of just noted a middle section down and ... and come in and rewritten the\nRecord book for sex by rookie or so those corners of being left out there on an island a little bit too often and getting burned a lot so uh if you don't have you do that and then you try and keep you safe days back and deep and ready to help now of a sudden you're getting gassed ...\nJaguars or on the board cowboys trying to answer a little more than midway through the third quarter here's Bob Stevens in Arlington\nMidway through the third or the cowboys lead Jacksonville out twenty four to seven it was twenty four nothing at half time for the jobs out on the board here in the third ... thirty four yard pass the ... chapter nine play eighty two yard drive\nAnd on the other side ... Scott is that a big day with his arm and his legs fourteen for Twenty one a hundred and fifty nine yards and two touchdowns both decode Beasley Seventeen yards and nine yards Beasley as costs seven or eighty seven yards\nAnd it didn't date for Prescott a with wanting the ball he's just carry the ball ten times in this game for eighty one large he's got more yard is on the ground than ... a wash for fifty two yards on fourteen carries\nBut a a a six minutes to go here and the third quarter the cowboys on the move there after the Jacksonville forty two yard line trying to answer that touched down in Jacksonville just scored leading the jags twenty four seven\nNine bombing in Tennessee it has been a quiet day for the titans while the a of a Raymond have scored again sorry when playing for a second they're bred Douglas can help me out brand how are you\n... out here um the ravens often has just control this game from the outset on the first half there was a Seventeen play nine minute drive and they seven in the play drive and open the second half the ravens go twelve place Seventy eight yards\nSeven minutes and twenty seconds before it's capped off Alex Collins looked left and solve basically about five hundred acres to the right he rented it untouched were to yard touchdown and the titans are\nJust not being able to get anything going on often under a well under a hundred\nYards of office and that and in fact now for markets Mario it up on and the second half and the ... was about I'd say probably about two thirds full when the game began and there's plenty of blew the showing up here already in Nashville or the ravens have the ball back distance item in\nThe open it's even been one of those days the kiss cam there was a proposal and the ring was dropped so it's\nBeen one of those days all kinds of all over the place to be here in Tennessee\nAnd it hadn't been raining for the last thirty minutes that doubles everywhere at right now it's all the ravens Twenty one nothing five away in the third hope the guy gets bring back\nOh yes absolutely and I hope you didn't drop it into a puddle out the way the rain has been coming down there so a a tough day all around in Tennessee but\nUh the ravens have made it look easy today\nYou meant we were talking about the uh\nDefensive issues and the like a specifically for the Denver Broncos\nSure enough no sooner do we say I was I saying that they're defensive secondaries I think was having ill effects on their run deep ... because they were getting burned against them pass much did they did they come up with a big interception wasn't a great play and came right off the kid rental shoulder pads got fed 'em right eat away and write well you don't want to get them right in the shoulder pads\nPopped up in the air and the rams were able to come up with the\nBroncos wherever and come up with a pack so they got the ball deep in ah the rams territory so maybe they can make this one of the contest just yet\nAnd jailing Ramsey who took some some heat from you just a ... a little while ago making potentially very big play with Dallas now up twenty four seven and seemingly ready to answer a all turnovers are going to be reviewed and that's apparently I thought it was an interception but I guess a ruled incomplete sorry\nHere come the cowboys right back to answer and we will get to that one in a second but right now the Broncos have answered the rams has to be checking with Bruce Martin\nRichards at twelve thirty one left in the fourth and the rams laid twenty to ten\nOn a blustery day in which quarterback Jared golf is not as best running back ... Gurley has stepped up with a ten yard TD run and a one yard run for a touch on the ... Gurley Nineteen carries one hundred fifty seven yards Denver\nReduce the deficit to ten late in the third quarter when case Keenan through twenty yards door wide open Emanuel Sanders the cost of all the one and\nAnd score and his way into the end zone this after the interception of a tip to ... pass by dairy and Stewart however the rams are responding Goff converted a third and seven when he ran Thirteen yards down to the twenty six yard line\nOf Denver and when action resumes the rams will be putting the ball into play from the twenty six yard line of the Broncos twelve thirty one to go in the fourth quarter\nRams trying to stay on beaten they lead the Broncos twenty to ten\nAnd I listened to Nashville where it's been a quiet day for the titans that does not seem as if it's getting any better here's Brent Douglas\nFifteen minutes left to go the titan had a very um I the ... they first down on a Twenty one yard run by Marcus Mario to and then they did have the first pass completion to Corey Davis who was the hero from a couple of weeks ago so the titans finally did get above one hundred yards and total often for the day\nBut then they had to put it away and now Joe Flaco has the ball and in um history has given any indication in this game he's going to lead the ravens on potentially another long drive here if they start at the fourth quarter big statistic in this game\nIs that Marquez Mario to a career height eight that twenty three now on the season for the ravens which leads the NFL\nOn the other thing to stick is for the titans loser should the jaguars who should get a three way tie with the two of those and the Texans atop the AFC South so that race is very much tightening up anytime titans is still have a chance here at fourteen fifty three left to go but the rape and dominating Twenty one up\nBy thank you very much Brent Douglas now that said the Dallas and the cowboys at the final seconds and the third quarter pulling away and here's Bob\nWe're at the end of the third quarter now and the cowboys Lee Jacksonville thirty seven it was twenty four nothing at half time\nBut the jags it cut the lead down to twenty four seven on a Blake Bartels thirty four yard touchdown pass the DVD Westbrook\nWas kept in eighty two yard dry but the cowboys have responded with a pair of ... bomber field goals here in the third of fifty yard or and then at thirty two yard or the latest was set up by about thirty five yard interception return by say ... down in Jacksonville eight yard line at came awfully a pass\nBy Blake borders on at the ... election\nBought her now three for three and field goals today now has ... fourteen consecutive feel rules for the cowboys after missing is first one on that cross got a big day to day sixteen for twenty five a hundred and Seventy seven yards and a couple of top shelf happen to Kobe easily of nine in Seventeen\nBeasley has caught aid for Ninety five yards here in the game\nAnd he's also washed a press guys also wash for eighty one yards on ten carries that's far so again it's a thirty seven Dallas at the end up three quarters and the cowboys knocking on the door at the Jacksonville Fifteen yard line and they just recovered Jacksonville bumble\nFine thank you very much Bob and a reminder CBS Sports radio stole free line at eight five five to one to four to seven\nRoger my guy too great news there was a quick way you could save money switched guy cocoa tobacco dot com and Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance the Sunday night one is a good one tonight between the chiefs and the patriots and joining us right now is she's writer for the Associated Press they've scored a day for jak majority McDonald's how are you\nI'm great how are you guys are doing just great this has been a brilliant start did you ever think that this could be the the start imagined when they made the move to Patrick homes that are we'd go swimmingly so parts of the first five weeks\nNow I don't think anybody really saw this coming I don't think are you an anti we saw this coming or I mean not not just the fact that he's played so well but the you know the entire team as a as off to five and I started against a a really tough schedule I think a lot of people looked at the schedule and said if they can make it through the first six games at three in a they'd be in good shape and uh\nAnd I got a chance to be six and if they can take care of business and I\nWas there any resistance from any of the off into teammates I'm Alex Smith during the off season when the kids you made the decision to move Smith and hand the job to practice Rome's certainly the results are in but I'm turning back the clock a little bit to six months ago\nWithin any that have their doubts that we're willing to verbalize those questions about trading a veteran quarterbacks and turning this team over to youngster\nYeah I mean I I think there were some guys that had some questions about it uh I Know Travis Kelsey is is the one guy can think of that actually\nYou know went on the record and said hey what are we doing trading Alex Smith that I mean you're talking about a guy who had the best season in his career last year he was in the pro ball he uh\nLet the chiefs to the playoffs back to back division titles so are you are trading away a guy who's proven himself and and turn it over to a guy who started one game so um yeah I mean there was a there is if you guys have probably had some questions but you're talking about a bunch of guys that\nSolid Patrick moms could do a you know last season in pre season in the weeks a game and he got his start in an office every day in practice\nOr a you know I think they also saw that the army strengthen the maturity and the intelligence were all there for him to be a success right out of the gate and uh and ultimately it was a decision that I think a Spanish dip it in\nYou know you mentioned just a moment ago as we talk with the spread of the Associated Press who covers the chiefs are all the intangibles that Holmes has so they make this move and pretty much from that\nSecond on it was only a matter of time before Patrick bones became their franchise quarterback what was it about him the most that that really they said this is the guy we have to have\nA I think it was in a kind of what I read it to the intelligence or you know I talked to Andy Reid and the and the pre season one on one just for a little bit and and he told me a story about how they had Patrick homes in a you know last last spring before the draft and\nAnd they were they were a lot of quarterbacks and and basically throwing everything at them or in a in a classroom setting and then having you know the the guys are thinking about drafting go up to a white board and background entire playing\nAnd Patrick with you on the guy that now that every single play and in an aunt who is often this is pretty complex it to be able to do that and and have that quick recall\nRight out of the gate I think a speaks volumes for how how smart he is um and then the one thing that I think they've learned here over the last year or two is what a an incredible workers or you know he could be out on the town and and trust me he won't have to buy a new drinks anywhere but\nThey've learned here over the last year or two is what a an incredible workers or you know he could be out on the town and and trust me he won't have to buy a new drinks anywhere but uh he's he's he's always in the practice facility Andy jokes by having to kick him out to make it go home and\nOn his birthday he was watching film of the forty niners are caught up the next week or instead of going out to celebrate so ah he's he's definitely a guy who was all in and and I think his teammate see that and appreciate that and and that's why they sort of rallied around him maybe that could have been grumbling about ...\nTo say he's achieving would be a mess of understatement right now a villa Bremmer is the only way to be in the NFC would have better pass rating than him or to do this quickly in his career is he has pretty damn impressive but I was just checking some stats maybe the most impressive to me is he's fourteen touchdown passes\nTo nine different receivers so it is it like he's picked out his favorite guy and they worked up this great relates Jim ... easy rosy anonymous sharing the ball with all the other guys which is also got to make them pretty popular guy in a locker room\nYeah absolutely he he he certainly is going to find a guy that's open and that doesn't matter if it's a shame and the fall back kind of touched on passing week one or a cat is Cal the obviously he's got a a really good reporting out with Travis I think this has like three or four straight one hundred yard or see the games\nI'm a big question I think in in training camp as it went on was it how Patrick ... is going to do everybody started having it was\nHow he going to distribute the ball and keep everybody happy because you look at the top and just got creamed Hi Travis Celtic diary Kelly got\nDown the block and throwing in the back this year how are you going to keep all those guys happy and\nSo far he's done an amazing job of it I mean everybody's getting the patches and and maybe a week ago by entirely kill 'em and catches two dogs that you can bet next week he's gonna come back with six seven eight catches up um he's yeah he's done a really good job of keeping everybody involved and they often\nDon't ... to the Associated Press who covers the chiefs the chief taking on the patriots right not to be the guy that throws cold water on everything but the chiefs of and had some big place so far they've scored at least\nA thirty points in each of their games and a lot of them have come on big place can this team grind it out too because eventually it's going to come to that\nYeah I think so uh I I think to be honest there they're felt to do that you've you gotta remember they have a running back though that let the leaking rushing last year whose\nAre capable of hound in Iraq and\nAnd the reality is they spent so far ahead and all of these games all except the Denver game where they had come from behind that are\nBasically in the fourth quarter they've just been given its current behind that he's been picking up every ... down that that they need to keep the clock move in and and kind of put away the game so they've shown a little bit of that ability to grind it out or certainly not necessarily when they need it but um\nYeah I mean I think they're capable of doing that as well but the thing is the anti has this this creative kind of\nOr you or someone you love one of the nearly one million Americans lending with Parkinson's

always like to point out I didn't expect the snow in October and we had snow in Minnesota today too bad they play indoors now you could add to snow games the middle of October\nRight at the end it's been a warm fall so far it's been much more summer liked and fall like yeah and this weekend turned up more winter like didn't fall life do we actually even half of all I'm not sure I think we went straight from summer into when we went from eighty degrees in New York earlier in the week to fifty\n[laughter] and ah it's actually kind of welcome to be honest I I'm I'm a summer guy but it was so disgusting like hot this summer and humid every single day it just wasn't nice like the cool off has been it's kind of refreshing almost ... understood but I like a slow progress so yes I Am I like moderation sixties\nTo Seventy five to seven and then make your way down to the forties rather than going directly from the eighties the ... don't pass go don't collect two hundred\nA I'm a I I'm In agreement with you on that one but uh hey you know you get what we get and ah it is fall but boy that to see one thing to see like snow you know because the ... temperature can fluctuates so much in Denver\nThat you could kind of you know go one day it's eighty another day it's forty but but to see from I think it was I think Bruce said it was like in the sixties the other day or maybe even Seventeen to twenty today\nIn depth quickly uh let me ask you about a couple of teams that I watch their games specifically and uh I\nI Want to make excuses for both of these two teams because they had question marks even though both of them ended up on the winning side of the slate the jets and the rams which I'm not saying the jets are on the rams level they generally are not they got the three and three would win today but the jets gave up a whole bunch of yards\nAnd a good bunch of points now they could because they were moving it up and down the failed themselves and score and a whole bunch of points the rams got out two twenty three lead in the third quarter and then they kind of let the Broncos are sneak their way back\nInto it and cut it to three points late with the late touchdown and needed to knock on side kick out of bounds otherwise it could have got real dicey I\nI always think that you need to be careful of teams\nThat allow teams back into games I agree but they didn't hold on and when both of the game so I don't know why should be overly critical of an effort that the jets in ... put forward\nBecause they like the team back in the game hey if you measure it out and you'd think you know what you need to do and what you could afford to do in players ... that takes the teen time to go down to be able to score well then so be it and the style points and the amount of ah when you win by\nShouldn't really mean anything in that way I thought the rams and the jets quite similar to that\nI I I'd be more critical of the jets because I think the jets gave up a lot of points throughout the day or they kept letting the Indianapolis Colts back and again this is not a great Indianapolis Colts team\nA lot of guys still out the moral iMac was back today a you know the rams didn't score a lot they didn't give up a lot of either and then obviously when you when it's a low scoring game and and you get that one the score them\nThen then it becomes a little the the complexity of it looks a little different but uh the jets I I don't want to write on their parade because they did score forty two points they did look good but I didn't think they gave up a lot uh to to the calls today\nLeo prevent defense sometimes the only thing it does it prevent you from winning they did let the cult to move it up and down the field but they had a significant enough lead that they uh were able to hold on and walk away with a ...\nThing of the jets 'cause I Know that you watched that game closely today I had it on here and didn't have a chance to really just let it soak in ... or send Arnold look pretty good today look pretty good the last couple of weeks and and so much is going to be made especially in the New York area because of\nThe giants passing on I'm In favor of sake one Barclay and whether or not that was the right move should they have gone for a franchise quarterback\nTo me and I you know me and I've said this a couch this all the time I loved Sam darnel or I didn't get at USC I did not get all the pre draft\nA I don't either I don't know what your word you want to use but the the pre drafts scouting reports that that\nPeople were not high on them they didn't like his release they didn't like uh they did they took too long but he turned the ball over a lot I thought those things were were very correct double\nOwn food on CBS Sports radio here again or your ... and ...\nAnd just reminded of the CBS Sports radio soul free line it on to fight five five to one to four to seven is brought to my guy goes straight news there is a quick way you can save money switch to a guy go because it got good cabinet Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen\nPercent or more on car insurance or two more games to go we both like some points tonight in the southern United affair between the patriots and the chiefs and to bar the forty niners who can't seem to get out of their own way unfortunately this year of course the big injury to Jimmy ... below in the Packers who\nHave really been hard to get a gauge on a two two and one in limbo tomorrow night\nPackers to me have been under achieving team to this point I I haven't Rogers pretty much held up his ended a bargain and they've got some issues going into tomorrow's game injury issues specifically at the White House position um but the real let down it's been a Packer defense so I thought tobacco defense would be\nSolid this year not spectacular by any stretch and imagination but solid or so that I'm registered new score thirty plus every single week Packer defense have been pretty damn course\nI agree it's been that way for quite a while right now and uh you know there's no ... they they went out they they made some draft picks over the last couple of years but nothing seems to work\nThey used a lot of ... that a whole bunch of draft picks last year and uh spend them heavily on the backs on the lake so they thought they have a lot of depth coming into the season and lay out a lot of names and a lot of potential but it hasn't turned into\nProduction on the field and right now I I said this earlier I use this uh this analogy is you know the bears were an Aaron Rodgers come back away from being for knows so far this year what are their and Rogers hadn't had that come back on on the opening night land ball field or you know this this could this season could begin looking ugly right now\nAnd oh by the way a the Viking game which Ah yes they had the lead there was one hideous call in the game I think maybe the worst call we saw in the national ... a year or that allowed Kirk Cousins to march the ball down the field and tied the game up\nA couple of missed field goals in overtime they lose the biking game as well you can do this every single year with every single deemed the would have\nA display that play pick up a hand picked play Adam two or three games and you can go from having a a pretty good season to a mediocre season or a mediocre season\nTo ban seizing but you can usually flip side that and say yeah but if they hadn't called them robbing the parents are friendly they win that game instead of getting a tight against Minnesota or so you have to judge the overall picture now we've got this many games in our book I think we get an overall picture the Packers which is\nThey're good they're salad they're going to be in the mix they're going to be a number on ... probably for that division of title all the wait till December and then it's going to be up to them in December if they come away with a\nChampionship or not mild December ... always been fun it's cold snowy at times the weather is not good and of course when you have a couple of teams playing indoors in that division and always makes for an interesting time but right now as we get ready for tomorrow night we bring in bill humor of the pack a report you can follow him on Twitter at\nPacker report bill rich Ackerman enjoy McDonald how are you\nI'm great how about you guys are doing just great thank you for a couple of minutes greatly appreciated at two children one on ... on the season heading into tomorrow night a winnable game against the San Francisco forty niners or one for a you know it's the old the old question is the glass half glass half full or half empty here\nAll why would say half or half full only because this week Aaron Rodgers talked\nAbout how we feel that their quote a drop out this close to getting things figure it out and you know it it's not quite as cheap as\nTwenty fourteen when he told fans to R. E. L. A. ask than a thousand sixteen and they got ... that Washington they said they were going around the table and they did so instead of catching those things but when the quarterback is feeling confident about things um probably worth listening to him that well the the classes helpful\nAnd that should help to raise some of his teammates one of his teammates and commercial makes its claim Matthews and no one has been more snake bitten by the reflecting the pastor or penalties that the NFL has cracked down on this year I think a couple of more just flat out bad cause but that's just me I I was ... attitude at this time\nOn it you know he's a little frustrated with things not not so much for the penalty that's kind of ancient history now he's gone two weeks they're\nOld and I go clay yeah right but you know here's a guy who was you know\nThe all time waiting sicker and sicker even at work anyways I'm using the all time leader in fact he's going to have that here in in the Packers patch Bush well typically it is good really reality it's not good as not a good all your\nUm you know they just have not done much against cul de sac them are ... impact them as far as for the bad throat so they got to get going um other than whether it's Nick Perry somehow they've got to get some sort of pass rush but not a big issue about that on Monday but you know but the thing that I had any\nYou know except the season as far as a playoff kind of success they they've got to get that passed first somehow cranked up\nAbout that on Monday but you know for the statement that they had any you know success to see them as far as you know playoff kind of success they they've got to get that passed farce somehow cranked up\nYou know we were talking about this before you came on not even a minute or two before but uh this ... defense struggled last year it struggled last couple of years they went out and they they use some high draft picks on defensive players they they've tried just about everything\nBut it still hasn't really been up to where it's at least you would hope a championship defense is how come it hasn't worked out so far\nI think they're getting there and you know you look at some of the stats are they're pretty good I Know the NFL official status is based on your age\nI'm at in their number for now the new defense according or is it like petting an even he will tell you\nIs a bad way to touch the fences um he doesn't put a whole lot of stock and yards or but you know they're they're getting their elastic against Detroit pick up a lot of points but now you've got you've got um a botched punt so Detroit took over one you've got riders bumbling inside his own thirty\nBut if he thought it was putting some bad spots so I think I think they're getting better of the past which was going to be a problem I think for the rest of the year\nBut those two corners they drafted on ... on the first round Josh Jackson the second those guys looked like he presented\nBecause everybody knows if you've got corners you got a chance of a pretty good defense I think it's finally got corners\nAnd once those guys get some more experience than he does a whole it's more experience playing by the fact I think they're gonna be fine\nIs there anything specific that the forty niners bring to the table and uh they're not agreed on science to begin with a and they also got some injury issues are above and beyond Jim ... has been out for a couple of weeks now\nIs there anything the forty niners can do or do do that the Packers have to stay on top of and try and keep from happening\nYeah man they tried to injury that day entering the thing is unbelievable and then just up and down the line up but I Will say\nBig place you know you go back to the Detroit game last week in Minnesota I fear in a week to\nIn ... at Washington Week three they they had problems getting upbeat passes and they they can deport enters can do that but we can throw it\nI'm ... and George kills a really good big play threat and receiver I'm Mark ... good when all the stats aren't there I mean he's a former Olympic somebody knows he can run\nSo I I I think that ability to stretch the field and take advantage of of a second or is that ... that's showing a they have some issues in that regard I think I think that's the forty niners plan I mean they got they got cut off the turnovers\nAnd try to make a big player free down the field\nDog with Bill humor or the back or a boy you can follow him on Twitter at Packer report last week you got to go back to it because it was such a a a glaring a stat and and so out of character what happened to me seemed Crosby\nThat's a great question I'm ... he's got\nHe's got a rookie snapper and it's got a rookie holder um but he says those guys are not the problem and they haven't been a problem so it's not that I just you know one of those one of those bad days at the opposite everybody has to be\nFunny at dinner with Jack Nicklaus here in time for the buffalo Kammen knows it and you know Jack Nicholson had bad days to when he's putting on the you know the greatest golfer and in the history of the world so\nHe said he's confident the army has had a good week but\nI think will be a Seventy eight thousand fans here on Monday holding their breath the first time he goes on and you'll be a little Russian why me his track record it's really good and get a one horrendous here\nHe'd back up what five really good years it's going to be interesting to see what happens here on Monday Night if he comes out and things are back to normal orbits and puts one bad kicking it snowballs it'll be interesting to see what happens\nYou know as regards Nicholas or I have to tell you this story begin to see just passed away last week David Anderson the fuel is a prize winning columnist\nFrom the New York times once said the story and I thought it was brilliant and he asked he asked the three golf or something was Watson guarantee player and the third was Nicholas with whom you had a great relationship\nHe was just looking for a different angle for a column and he said tell me one of the toughest shots on Sunday at the masters and of course player and Watson a given the answer is no problem and he figured okay two thirds of the column done here is Nicholas again he was extremely close with Nicholas loved jak and everything\nAnd jak wouldn't answer the question in and day was ... he said why\nWhy won't you answer the question he says because I Know I'm going to be standing over that shot and it's going to be in my hands saying I told him this is this is going to be one of the ... I Can't have negativity going to my final round and you know maybe it's just a you know power of positive thinking the basic Crosby needs right now\nI Wish I had to end up doing I talked to a Crosby on Saturday That's that's that's brilliant at an impasse that you're only about that [laughter] you know what I mean between\nAnd golfers and in special teams are guys that they are they're the same guy right they got all the tail in the world in so much of its is what's between the IRS had said that the ...\nAnd they're out there on the island by themselves there's nobody else out there when they are performing a it's all kind of by men which I see the parallels between golfers and a real go papers in that way as well a", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Norfolk", "day": "14"}
