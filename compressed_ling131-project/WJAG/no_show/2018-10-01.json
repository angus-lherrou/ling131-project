you have ... you also got\n'em tight retail healthy you got a very dominant off that but the two questions with the Kansas City chiefs which will linger the rest of the way unless they make

outcome I've not seen a better team and the AFC\nThen the Kansas City chiefs and the ... the\nSame goes for the rams the\nRams are gonna be a tough out it just comes down to\nTen they get over the hump because we saw them be very good last year in your number one in this new regime and now you're number two they acquired even more talent and they looked so dominant tend to stay in that for the

I and I just the youngster whose underrated I get it into the mix and playing well along with Alan and pain and also a Caribbean so\nBe happy about the Redskins\nOh yeah is that data didn't didn't show me much either today so a Redskins last year did everything but be a ...\nNew Orleans so we were going to say that Monday Night and hopes they will eat them or we don't have that greater record on Monday Night football\nWill say well we'll see what happens in Alex Smith is a quarterback that or does it nicer fishing job and he has won the big one yet but\nEach and every year he wins games he controls the football\nI Want to see more out of the red skins I still think the eagles are the classes that division but if you're a Redskins fan I think you are better right now\nThan the cowboys and the giants not saying a lot because going into the year yes the idiot over here pencil the men as the fourth a team in that division let's go to Capitol wrap it up with Kevin in Austin, Texas what's happening Kevin\nIdiot over here pencil the men as the fourth team in that division let's go to Capitol wrap it up with Kevin in Austin, Texas what's happening Kevin\nUh hey how's it going for doing great go ahead my friend a great\nSo you know I was thinking about all of this young blood and the NFL I'm and I'm a baseball game a Red Sox fan and you remember that story about price and playing Fortnite and as you know ... you know\nYeah earlier in the air though yeah I don't feel that you know to some extent call it permeates the NFL\nOh yeah appreciate it make sure we dump that are a great job as a way to end it off with a a classy color there\n[laughter] to his question though\nHow much does and I guess we'll give them some time to answer his question goes and you're calling in to the show and using that language you gotta find better things to do a in life but hey it is what it is the question though the ballot Shaq will transition to because he and O'Connor is going to join us\nWith a ballot Shaq and his old school ... does it affect the football team\nI I'm not ready to go there are there some obstacles to maybe getting away because of that when you have guys don't want to be social media and has the bonds sure but the guy when people go to New England to either set themselves up for a future contract with culture has done a lot\nAnd also to win games with the patriots have done a lot or in their career and that's what Bill Belichick jak has done\nAnd he went football game so I'm not going to doubt him at this stage of his career and look back against the wall with them basically the music what they did yesterday was a very impressive eight five five two on two for CBS say five five to one to forty two twenty seven\nIn O'Connor during this week comeback perfect way to\nTransition will not perfect but almost part for quite a transition into the book a ballot checked the making of the greatest football coach of all the time when we learn\nThat hit the and South Florida he loves you know he's running for ah he's a great off the well\nWe'll talk to in O'Connor when we come back right here on CBS Sports radio about his latest\nBook but first here's the man who's microphone is always working with the latest CBS Sports fan Kevin Dexter\nForge flash back it was an AFC North of rivalry and match up in the Sunday night game and the ravens made a statement and proving to three and one on the young season where they twenty six to fourteen went over the Steelers in Pittsburgh Joe Flaco is three hundred and sixty three yards\nDid ask some people not to talk to me and you know their friend his who want him to be here but I and they understand that he doesn't want to be here tonight publicly ... it's a strange thing I'm most celebrities are public figures show their best side in public and hide their worst side of private go does the reverse\nAnd it's it's a pretty weird dynamic but um it some summer his guys would say if you want that Carter gentler humane hide them out there and the public arena you have to be willing to tell some of those stories and share some reality that expressed that are real is right that\nAnd I think ultimately some did and\nI wanted this book as many of those stories and I go to as possible with the common decency and and and kindness and generosity and all those things away from the facility and and I think I have war that in this book than anyone ever written about that with chicken ...\nYou know it's funny because you describe it as podium bill versus non podium bill and other times we see a bill bell check on the podium and mumbling like we're on to Cincinnati right or you do not even shaking hands with\nKids when he goes onto the field and Detroit last weekend but then when you talk to his former pliers they always tell you how funny is behind the scenes\nRight and those two little kids in Detroit they shouldn't feel too terrible about\nThe way that went out and walk right by because that's Robert\n... right that's bill that's work bill but Robert Craft has walked by his head coach over the years in the hallway and and gotten a similar across the reaction where about what you would say not a single word to the man is paying billions and billions of dollars every year\nSo those two little kids shouldn't feel like they were singled out there because they weren't that that is workplace bill to do with the now uh the the human bill uh he he's very capable of being charming\nThat is workplace bill to to AT T now uh the the human bill\nUh he he's very capable of being charming and ... and witty and engaging and self deprecating and those players actually I talked to a number of them and behind the scenes one on one in his office\nHe does he does expressed to them that he cares about them as people that can feel that and I can tell you this act in Cleveland when it coats there the brown never felt that they never saw that person and that's one of the reason\nWhy they didn't win for him he had for losing seasons out of five and and obviously after the Ninety five so you got fired\nAnd obviously one of the adjustments he's made his career and that's what makes spell check great as he can adjust\nAnd we've seen that throughout his career is talking to you know Connor the monkey spell check the making of the greatest football coach of all time you mentioned the interactions or the lack of acknowledgement with Robert Craft sometimes when he's walking in the hallways or by July stadium also in the book it talks about how Robert Craft is sad that\nMaybe he almost came close to possibly thinking about moving on from ... chicken your number two now we know they ended up winning the super bowl and your number two\nBut that would have been you know something crazy how close was that actually maybe ... to coming to fruition\nWell first of all a Robert ... and the only one who was felt that in in the hallways of Gillette Stadium end up so that bill does that with a lot of people in the organization where if he's in gross who thought about a game plan or a scheme he's not going to wait three seconds small talk with you the matter who you are including Robert Craft but ear to when\nThey're always too and I was on the field that day was the first Sunday of NFL football after nine eleven or the patriots have gone five and eleven adults first year now they're going to they just lost to jazz\nAt home and it looks it looks\nBrutal I mean bill is five and Thirteen his first Eighteen games the hundred million dollar quarterback and franchise player drew Bledsoe it's just been knocked out by mobile Lewis says the jets\nAnd he's going to be out for a while and they try to six round pick nobody really knew much about and contrary it turns out to be the greatest football player of all time\nBut Robert Craft told associates he was worried he didn't want to fire go after a year or two but he was worried that he would have to and I know that that will check was worried about getting fired I Know people in his organization on his staff or worry that that things were heading now one thing I Will say that 'cause\nThey knew that breed and he was a developing good products like they like him a lot that they had no idea what he would become but they want it to get him under center and without offending craft to just give it a hundred billion dollars\nTo put so while they did they weren't rooting for an injury they didn't want obviously this was almost a fatal injury as it turned out with my little is\nThat correct or but they were not unhappy that they got the opportunity to put Brady under center and it turned out the way it right the rest is history five championships and I think anyway or just given the significance of the quarterback position you have to consider Brady the greatest football player of all time\nAnd you look at that relationship and there's obviously going to be ups and downs when they've been together a it from a starting standpoint since two thousand and one and we're in the bucket says if he could he would divorce spell check by now but there's really just no way out of it because they got rid of Jimmy gee just what do you think that relationship currently stands at\nI think it's functioning now and they've got half maybe the one belt down there has to survive and they barely survived that I Know Brady was really upset his off season and\nUh the the proof is in the pudding right thirty to start in court acts in the NFL thirty one showed up for TAs only one did not Tom Brady and Tom Brady the ultimate as you know in the gym for out of the gym laugh athlete and so he spoke loudly and clearly by not showing up\nFor voluntary work out he was really upset about prevention of Malcolm Butler Superbowl about the way our score arrow his business partner and fitness coach was treated during the season and really just\nEighteen years of being posted an unrelenting way caught up to Brady\nAnd I think he would have actually asked for his release or retired\nThe way he fell but he couldn't beat down he just knew after he compiled the franchise\nTrade Jimmy grapple his successor and after talking so so much about playing into his forties if he walked away the fan base that adores him would have turned on him and I think he knew that so the only way he could express his feeling was that do what he did which is that not show up for\nThe voluntary part of the off season program\nAnd the belief is that Brady demanded to craft to train Jimmy Jay and that's the first time really you've seen Robert Craft\nYou sir bill balance jak and not let bill balance jak release\nA player that's very popular and we've seen it over the years he got rid of urgency more a few years too early rather than a few years too late or got rid of ... which is very controversial at the time for the people you talked to had a ballot check react to that to being told no maybe when he wanted to get ready to breeding and go to Jimmy Jay\n... well first off it's not really the first time he's ever intervened and personnel that says you know got a the Bledsoe contract is not one bill was ever in love with but\nThat will take was just trying to get established when it was so clearly wasn't the figure he is\nA now or not by a long shot but if we if you if you don't even count that one and two thousand seven short brown looked at the end of his career and that what you want it to move on and then be brought in Wilker and Randy Moss Dante stalwart then\nCraft really ... insisted on one more year because Troy Brown had been such a wonderful patriot and representative of the franchise\nSo ... and ballot chick ended up not playing them that you're really buried him on the roster\nAnd so crafted intervene there to some extent and with Brady I Do not believe in my reporting that craft ever set the words to ...\nYou have to trade Jimmy jeep or whatever I Do my\nSources tell me that he made it clear Tom Brady is going nowhere he's going to retire patriot no matter what age that is\nAnd that that will check walked away believing he had no choice but to but to move ... the question of course then becomes why did you want to get a second round pick for them and why did he ... he didn't shop apply to the end of the one team\nAnd if you wanted to get him out of the sea open up the bidding to every team in the NFC and if he did that I think he would have gotten a first round ...\nLet me ask you this do cause something that was alarming to me when I was reading through the boiling point says in New England assistant and let me just be clear I think ... I think ... ... check but I Believe that they're back when they put the differences aside and he's the coach of the patriots and Brady is the quarterback\nBut I read something that in New England I said that they could take top Fifteen quarterbacks in the league and you know when a Super Bowl or get to a Super Bowl with them\nAnd I thought that was a little disrespectful to Bernie not saying it isn't true but I think it just disregard the little bit about the Brady Bunch gene when I read it because of the way that they've won some of these Super Bowls in some tricky sponsor Brady has been so much\nWell I I think maybe\nSome contacts the quote comes out of a period of time where Brady wasn't Brady radio today I had one free rein to this is talk two thousand twelve to Thirteen his performance is starting to slit his arm strength is diminishing the organization is getting concerned that this\nHe had one free rein to this is talk two thousand twelve or Thirteen his performance is starting to slip his arm strength is diminishing the organization is getting concerned that this is the sure sign of an aging Claire beginning his decline right 'cause\nThat's why they drafted ... do you remember after a traffic jam that would take that night said or you cited Tom H. and its contracts that because he said I'd rather be early late at this position so they were very concerned or at least concerned about where Brady was trending and so that assistant was talking about that period of time\nAnd comment one brings hadn't one to two thousand and four so it had been a while at least by their standards and so it was and I have with Iran that quote by other people that was a a legitimate opinion at the time and that is why they drafted\nA garage below and one other thing on that I had a long conversation on the phone with Brady in the spring of two thousand Seventeen where he basically said the same thing that I\nPromised quick and they delivered on that just don't want to\nBe

month of the year bar none I mean April is a pretty close second but October is the one it's the one where you see you know the the craziest stuff at the circus like the man who ways nine hundred and fifty pounds or the lady who has the beard\nOr the pig who has two heads yeah all of that happens\nIn the October circus in sports and this particular weekend this precursor this final September weekend happened to be an even spicy or hors d'oeuvres and then what we normally get for a couple of reasons number one the Ryder Cup was taking place this weekend and number two\nApparently a hundred and sixty two games ward enough for four of the teams in major league baseball they decided they need to play a little bit longer which just adds to our trauma my brain is so full if I don't start talking and keep talking and talk fast\nNo just kidding I Try not to talk too fast my grandmother tells me I talk really fast but she's Ninety six so she has an excuse you guys need to just keep up [laughter] there's so much in my brain right now but even with my notes in front of me I fear that I'm going to forget things which is where you come in now\nThanks so much for tuning in is the start of another workweek\nFor three of the time zones in the United states it is officially October\nFor the other three time zones in the United states it's still September but it's okay we love the stragglers too We're inside the Quicken Loans studios\nNational mortgage lender Quicken Loans apply simply understand fully mortgage confidently we are going to get to football and I mean momentarily we're going to start with the big match up in the AFC North\nFrom Sunday Night Football and everything that happened on Sunday or as much as I can possibly cram in because there were so many\nNice unbelievable finishes\nJaw dropping finishes three games going into overtime\nThank God we had no more ties because I wasn't prepared to set that kind of record uh the first month of the NFL season but in addition to that we had what the cowboys the sea hawks and the bangles all when on their last possessions so three games in overtime and three games that literally were settled in the final seconds\nOf regulation that the half dozen games right there and that doesn't even cover all the drama those are just the ones that went to the last play or the last the last possessions\nSo we're going to get into all of the football craziness but before we do that as I mentioned major league baseball\nWe've got the postseason staring at us but first we're going to play games one sixty three in both the central any at all with what really a hundred and sixty two games the regular season wasn't enough\nFor you All right so you can find me on Twitter a law radio what's that story that game

college football storylines and the next couple of days however certainly the Clinton quarterback situation\nFascinating midlife comes out you fast and he finished to the Ohio State Penn State game also really incredible to I didn't actually realize this until I was watching the game on Saturday Night\nMy nieces went to high school well one of the one that's in college I went to high school with Tracy ... so he graduates from high school\nAnd from their high school and I remember she used to say to me all the time our quarterbacks really good and he's really cute\nBut as you know identified if she ever told me his name I don't even know if my niece knows that treatment sorely is the starting quarterback and Heisman Trophy candidate for Penn State's um but I did text or on Saturday just to ask her if she knew him she's like she was my high school quarterback\nOkay deanna anyway so that was kinda funny a little bit of college football will hit a little bit of the Ryder Cup a now it

Ninety two yards on the ground I mean they put up thirty six points at home again\nAnd they still can't protect that lead but they also looks really good they're red zone issues are a thing of the past so they go up thirty three twenty eight on Ridley second touchdown but they miss on the tube one conversion the bangles then\nThey consume clock like nobody's business like they're the ravens or something I don't let him play drive for a field goal there is still trailing though 'cause they give up a field goal to the south and so now they're still down five thirty six thirty one\nAnd then comes the mammoths drives the turning point Seventy five yards sixteen plays and\nI Swear to you I thought that Dr was dead and the water more than\nOnce they had six first towns I think one of them came on the penalty but they had to convert them to force down\nAnd it ends up with this incredible sliding catching the right corner of the end zone by AJ green was seven seconds to go\nSo between the six first towns the bunch of no huddle there were a couple of time out you know like different team calling time outdoors with a to point or the I'm Sorry the two minute warning in the middle there so very disjointed but at what sixteen plays\nSeventy five yards and it felt like they use all of their nine lives I was pretty amazing to watch them put it together\nBut also you could feel the spirit and just\nSlipping away from the Atlanta Falcons fans inside what will be the home of Super Bowl fifty three because they could not stop Cincinnati\nNow I don't know if you want to call

when I'm Out there showing for ...\nLike today was one of the toughest Pittsburgh Steeler game I played really really tough football games he's going to buy one fifty\nLeash he's after hours with Amy Lawrence shell Flaco says it's not like this was one of the tougher games I've ever played against our rivals in Pittsburgh now he had three hundred and sixty three yards to touch down\nThe ravens were eight of Seventeen on third down and they came out with a victory moved to three and one next\nJerry Sandusky with the calls from the two touchdowns in the first half which were the only two ravens touchdowns a it was all field goals after that I think you just in Tucker and he's automatic and so now they\nHave put the Steelers and the whole one two and one hole\nWhere does Pittsburgh go from here it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio were pleased to welcome from the Pittsburgh Tribune review and Heinz Field Chris a damn ski who covers the Steelers as well as other local Pittsburgh sports a main currents that second half or the Steelers was rough\nNot only did they get shut out I they only managed three first towns and they had to punch four times what the difference between the first time when they were tied and the second half or the Steelers fans\nYou know I don't know the second half last week last Monday Night against Tampa Bay was also bad joke rancor talking for the six quarters that were pretty bad for the Steelers off and\nI I don't know how much of a difference if there's almost an aberration where a true second quarter drive\nA things put a little better ... was one and really Ben Roethlisberger abrupt struggle entire game there was one really good throw their Antonio Brown for that touched off other than that the first quarter was pretty bad too so um I you know I don't want to say the first time it's not going to have all the work that much different than the work to do some drive that we could put together at all\nAnd that game against Tampa sort of their excuse was the ball very much into the ... very much this game either the second half by ... whatsoever or the buccaneers ... how are the ball that was the reason why this time it was just because the viewers didn't do it they want to add about their ... pretty quickly are turning it over pretty quickly on every time I got ...\n... ... interesting because\nThere there's a lot of talk about how there is no lady on bell right and so the run game is is definitely taking ... what did the same time it seems like even when the Steelers aren't trained laying they still prefer to pass the ball so maybe to chicken and egg type of thing credits\nBut which came first is that the patch happy or is it that we don't have a lady on bell so therefore we are passing the Baltimore\nYeah well I thought it was real interesting this game from the Steelers from the run game perspective I I thought James Carter if I had a great kept from our perspective he looked a lot better than last season in terms of his body and sort of as quick as in terms of his past block in terms of its catching on the back built it\nAnd I think really the thought of amongst ... around the gym a lot\nThat uh you know I don't think it's related at all to levy on bell or with everybody assume everybody inside and outside as soon as you would be there by one uh but but that that Congress reject the next step\nAnd you saw that one week one against Cleveland he was very productive I Know you look at the top people are allowed to Cleveland with the when the ... the overall and but ... and this guy really telling me that they run the ball much with Carter and you can say they fell behind her early but\nIt took her off the field or a lot or a lot more than than usual certainly a lot more than ever talk with you on TALK field and it took a lot of appeal for Ryan switch or a you know who their slot receiver and a guy they picked up a week before the season started and trade for very little round pick from a you know a swap a little round pick sweet with Oakland\nOr so that that kind of shows that to me any way\nOr the Steelers even I don't think I don't have the confidence and Carter\nBut I think it shows that the fact that people are willing to go to a different personnel package ... one of them on the field for every dollar they originally have living on bell or do we won ... with James Carter is sort of a spy and to me that that even to them\nThey were having trouble right now in the ball but when you write them when they're Twenty one nothing in week two hundred and fourteen nothing in in in this past game here uh it's kinda hard ever running game when you're chasing almost the way I'm all\nRight Kristen ... is with the uh Pittsburgh Tribune review covers the Steelers were there for Sunday Night Football against the ravens it's after hours when Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio\nSo now the ... the Steelers have fallen into a hole and they're one two and one of course the tie with the browns and the season opener what what's the reaction in the locker room I after this one against the rival ravens at home\n[noise] yeah you know it's it's funny that they've been so good at home over the years the first time the second time so they've been over to a home season and I feel whatever they're Eighteen seasons they played at this place\nI'm only the second time so they've been over into a beginner home season I feel whatever they're Eighteen seasons they played at this place\nA it so you know you go from our perspective again where I used to going into a ... a former worn walking Rome and this is the third home getting the washed over all of the fourth\nMeaningful from either lost in a row now you got back from New haven game last season the Jesse James catch game or that they did the Cleveland a leak Seventeen last year but it but that was a meaningless gambling interests or their starters and they lost the playoff game the Jacksonville and that they lost and\nCan we do it again so you know this game so it's becoming more and more of a pattern [noise] um I I I was the biggest that got me into the frustration or or or were you know what you're looking for is\nKevin ... was in the locker he he was he was about upset as I see them after a game but there was a partner the second they're older he was in their sort of look in a kind of frustrated uh I I think there are a you know that there is\nSo far you know I'm a big believer that the NFL is about more about December the September\n... teams are almost unrecognizable I mean you guys don't calculus course that you can sabotage or season right a ... but I think that the the the the the team there there's always an evolution of the good team now aren't necessarily unnecessarily the good the December but\nThat being said I think there's a lot of flaws right now at this team when this roster and it's gonna be ... it's kinda hard to envision and being a really good team in December right now\nWe talk about the science and of course with the stars on the ball and generally attracts more attention but the deep sense as you point out has given up a lot of of real estate a lot of point to specifically at home so what is my time and had to say about the defensive side of the ball\n[noise] yeah you know what my comment is going to say if it was right or wrong usually isn't going to a a you know the marsh or ... or anything like that you know that that's kind of things a lot of coaches thing\nOr you know the defense has been you know the Kansas City came to the chief have been tearing up everybody\nThat's the one where they look really bad and and the Tampa game uh you know it it wasn't as well you know if it's if it's magic sort of ended there they were getting turnovers for a little bit\nAh but you still in that game that gave up seven eight points in the second half a listen this is the patch was at its best at its peak at Yale optimism of the biggest optimists from Steelers fan or for within the ceiling wasn't going to be a great ... begin with\nI'm a I think it's probably again the Kansas City game they look really bad than that I think it's been kind of you know the bars and then he Greenland they all are we thought they were it's you know but this team was going to win or go to bill deep or they want to go in the playoffs\nYou're the office to carry him I think that's much more of a concern to them in the steel as what they want to be ...\nFrom the Pittsburgh Tribune review after the game and Heinz Field

talked about and we'll get to the titans and the Texans in their overtime games coming up\nI Will do that about Fifteen minutes or so but I thought it would be interesting to look at the teams on top of or at the top of the AFC and I know we're only a month in so we're we're not talking about clenching playoff spots what Bill Belichick after week three\nUh I don't believe that anyone is clinch to play out\nI don't think anyone's been eliminated from the playoff yet either and this is how quickly things can change so the patriots in one of the games that you told us you were most looking forward to week four in the NFL were hosting the three you know Miami Dolphins the dolphins one of three teams\nWho hadn't yet to lose going into week number for\nJust as a side note rams moved to

Indianapolis shoes Timothy ... I don't know who the hell are common theater was\nBut he was going on and on and on about how in the sugar on the wall you know wait for the pie while blah blah I couldn't use for everyone everyone to tie in the NFL is the same as the law\nThere is virtually not any difference between the one in three and one drew in more except for you to see\nLike how are you with that\nIt's not the when it comes to standings uh you're half game up on the people who have moral often\nOkay let me ask you this how many of these fires in your life so I don't ever remember seeing it or somebody made the playoffs because they were pretty ... five and one and the other tumors financier never\nI ever seen a tie get someone in the playoffs as opposed to having a law never met\nA lot of time and the other though is that actually the same for watch I mean if you've ever seen it have you ever seen somebody make the playoffs river got out of high sort of a a you know being from five and one of the seventh or\nYou're going to have to give me a second but I Would bet you it's happened\nOkay or put one out of a good record all over you know what you come up with I Will Michael but I Can't do it right this second part sometimes that are no I Will go sometimes the research takes more than ... ... what are your\nKids ... percent of the time anyway if ever cook the of reader and we'll talk to some other jai\nThanks Michael eight five five to one to forward to to seven I'm certainly anti can work both for you and against you know I hate ties let let me just get that straight up I Can't stand having ties in any sport and that includes soccer I don't think there should be a tie same thing with hockey can't stand it\nI ... you know these guys play for money this is a business there there should not be a tie there is not little kids who get a trophy for participation\nUm and so I I don't like the way the NFL handles its ties and I was hatched tagging away no more ties no more dies no more dies on Sunday afternoon I because I don't want to see them either but it just depends on your division if\nYour tie put you ahead of enough teams by June well then that tie keeps you from falling back into the same record let's say you're competing for a wildcard or the division title if you have one last last\nIf that loss is not a loss but it's a tie well then that makes you ahead of them now it could also work against you because if you\nI have a tie instead of another victory well yes then it can keep you for a playoff spot but what it does is put you in the middle so almost reading between the lines of puts you in the middle there where it can work for you but it could also work against you and it's a fluid situation because it depends on everything else that's happening around you and obviously it depends on what else to do\nThe rest of your regular season but I mean there's no\nThere's no concrete black and white way to say that a tie is the same as a lost cause that's not the case it's almost like a half\nAnd you could be a half above ... or you can be have behind depending on the other is like I said the rest of the playoff picture Tim is listening in Ohio Tim welcome to after our CBS Sports radio\nYeah Hi uh I I\nI was new sometimes a good show but I just\nWanted to see what you say you know you say it doesn't come down to one that she plays but essentially that's exactly what the browse game came down to is to plays a ... I mean they took away the first album Carlos Hyde which I mean everybody clearly saw as a first down let alone even if it wasn't you can't reverse it\nYou know once the calls already called the way it is\nUm it really should have been reversed and then to you have the uh quarterbacks arm going backwards you know while ... and they don't call that either I mean those are two planes that significantly made this game what it was and why we\nLost that line I literally held out by the lake mixed Tim ... everybody did it was a really good game how about the sex that actually put seven points on the board so that one doesn't have the same impact as the calls that you're talking about\nA early on a day but it's actually at the end you\nCannot ah I don't see I Would argue that how about the miss point after intent or I'm Sorry to\nMiss two point conversion that Hugh Jackson decided to go forward instead of instead of the extra kick that would've been a another point on the board I mean to me I can go on and on and on how the four turnovers two of which led to fourteen raiders points\nI mean how about the fact that the browns had a double figure lead in the second half like we can go back and forth on that said I can tell you a dozen more things that impact or that game just as much as the two calls that you are pointing out to me and it it\nI'm not going to change my opinion and maybe you're not going to change yours but do those other mistakes the browns made also had a huge impact not to mention they got the bone overtime and what they do with it they went through\nAnd you can do that on line but the thing is is that those two calls were crucial and they absolutely\nAre you seeing it on every single play is crucial man you can say whatever you want and that's fine I understand you're upset about it but those plays don't carry any more weight than any other play and there were four turnovers and the ... the raiders I'm forty points on turnovers and the browns went three in out in overtime when they got the ball I mean all those things matter too\nStop worrying about student loan payments this free information could change your life goal what eight hundred three seven four oh three one one eight hundred three seven four three one one\nWipe out your federal student loan debt find out how gold eight hundred three seven four oh three one one eight hundred three seven four oh three one one\nCBS Sports radio was on in northeast Nebraska on a um Seventy ...

d'oeuvres\nFor what's to come in October\nNow I Know the Ryder Cup adds a little something different into the mix we don't have that every year um but to have that on the final three days of September plus the end of the major league baseball season coinciding and\nWe still don't have to division winners in the national league so we've got games one sixty three in the central and in the adult west it's the first time that's\nWe've never had a baseball season require two extra games to settle the full and complete playoff picture but that's what we've got on Monday at you hadn't heard the national league central between the brewers and the cubs at Wrigley Field will start at noon utterly new ... central time\nOne o'clock eastern time\nAnd it's followed by the double header the second half of the double header between the Rockies and the Dodgers in Los Angeles Dodgers stadium\nAnd there are two reasons why the games or early in case you're wondering I saw people complaining about it on social media that said nobody's going to be watching la la la la uh two reasons number one the games are contractually obligated to be on ESPN\nWhich already has Monday Night football so that's one reason I like it or not the gains have to be on TV and to others already commitment major league baseball's not bumping Monday Night football uh and then in addition to that the losers\nOf these two games on Monday how to turn around and play in a wild card game on Tuesday so better not to have it\nAnd especially when there's always the potential for extra innings of course no clock on\nA baseball game as much as the commissioner would like that to be the case of you know you need to give these teams\nWherever they're going oh what a and one of them could end up being at home of course um but if they have to travel of two of them have to travel you want to give them the opportunity to get where they're going to the losers of Monday's games in the end all central and the Old West will turn around and meet in the wild card game on Tuesday night\nThat's then followed by the American league wild card game on Wednesday night which is\nThe opening days at the New York Yankees so that one's already set\nThat we move onto the division series and we really only know one of those at this point we certainly know the winner of the AOL wild card will take on the red Sox who finished with a franchise record one hundred eight victories\nAnd we do know that the Indians will be battling the world series champion Astros so so that's what we know in the American league in the national league\nIt's still very much in the air the\nWinner of the central so either the brewers are the cubs whoever wins today's game at Wrigley Field will host than the winner of the wild card and we don't even know who the teams are that are going to be in the wild card game we also know that the division winner in the west\nWhether it be the Dodgers are the Rockies who actually never wanted division title in their history that division winner in the west will host the brace so we know the west will have a home field advantage otherwise we're going to have to wait and see so that's coming up on

hour after hour after hour icy panels rather than reporting\nExchanging opinions the overwhelming majority which on this network I regard as quite critical or hospital for ... now that may be justified it made me that these folks have included but on the basis of how Trump is behaved and the Republicans that they deserve this kind of push for\nCNN in effect or most of its people have taken a stand up on this president\nAnd about this nomination\nJeff Greenfield being critical to Brian's filter about what we saw I I laugh out loud and to me I cannot believe that as Janelle if they actually want it to get a bigger audience\nTo talk about ten people on panels all hating Trump in different ways all acting emotionally when if you will get Fox on the worst our boy in the most part is that you can find we always have a balance it out\nAnd it's not the hatred the hatred that they get pointed out by Jeff Greenfield he's been on the show before right\nHe we let you we got permission to interview him when he was still the CNN because he had a book out and he seems to be fair and in an honest critic doesn't mean he doesn't have Trump we might might love Trump but the fact is he felt an obligation to give them a fair shot what I've loved about this last few weeks\nWith Kavanaugh Trump is almost out of it\nAnd I think he's got to be little reflective and say it's kinda good to be the the storm overall Kavanaugh's Kennedy and the controversy is going to help Republicans if he gets through they'll say my goodness they fought and we have to fight for them if he doesn't\nMy goodness we have to make sure we get another shot and get the Senate held for them for Democrats they were already motivated I think overall America benefits we might have get get over sixty percent of the people for a mid term to actually vote Zacharias online in Arizona Zacharias\nHey Brian Brian thanks for taking my call listen I Want to say that if Kavanaugh gets tossed overboard as a result of Jeff Flake actually I\nI Believe that Jeff Flake is potentially potentially giving his Senate seat to cure still cinema remember Jeff Flake is now running for his seat yup yet because he was calling about Seventeen Eighteen percent so hence Martha ... the Republican is running I can tell you\nAll the way back when Herman Cain first started and uh the cabinet thing it's a travesty to this country is or\nAnd well a gay get away with this any person that that will you know like where they live their life he's been a justice and and things have been major and they're they're trying to destroy them if they get away with this you know what else to roam your next you know they may be wasted\n... drove what two years of an investigation if there is no there there was Russia Russia and look at their progress describes it has made if people don't realize and understand this is a slap in the race into the face of the American voter if Hillary had been elected us or none of this would have come to light ...\nWho is in a couple of things well and you know America First Republican or Democrat\nDo you know that the president amped up his attack on ISIS in a way that it's not going to be public maybe for ten years he basically took the gloves off and let our special ops go to work led by the the courage on the ground and what other things we did in terms of intelligence to get Iraq back and to battle him out of Syria\nYou know the president's adjusted and now left our troops he says when a stay in Syria as long as it runs in Syria\nAnd Afghanistan rules of engagement were still up in the air seven hundred billion more dollars into the defense department to build us up to where we were\nThe growth rate is a four point two percent he's got re done a deal with South Korea he's just re done NAFTA he's got a new framework for the European Union he has gotten rid of unnecessary regulation there was a boxing everybody down\nEven Jamie diamond a Democrat who was thinking about running for president says he give the president and a minus so far and what he's done for the economy so around the world he's telling NATO you got to pay more he's actually done everything that he said\nExcept forget the wall built and have Mexico pay for ... not going to pay for it yet there might be fees to come up there but he's not able to pull it off a Republicans are not stood by him on that because they're the party split\nBut we'll here we are trying to move forward with a nominee that happens to be conservative that's what he's guilty of\nYou cannot tell me the doctor forwards account is enough to destroy the life of will in Orlando or Brian in New York all my other callers\nYou can't come out with the allegation don't say how you got there how you went home who invited you Brett Kavanaugh has never met you his best friends says it never happened your best friend says you don't recall your therapist who left a note out and you never mention his name to the therapist\nYou mentioned it to people your beach friends\nWho told you to go to a congresswoman who went to a senator who ended up having a staff or somebody else lead your name out and now and next thing you know you're supposed to destroy somebody who's been thirty five years in the public eye and as an impeccable records\nOr it is a scenario I don't think anybody's life can withstand John also a news Ninety six five and a land of John\n[noise] hey Brian thanks for taking my call 'em you're saying all the right things and you know I I I'm after hearing\nUh listening to um the hearings on on Thursday um I agree I I I agree with and I appreciate what um [noise] uh the senator a gram had to say and I think it's clear to the American people or what the full intent of the Democrats are I think a ...\nSomebody could have 'em\nBecause they were always questioning or wondering why not to have this delay a and they some London a Senator Grassley or someone could go back and look how long of a delay we know what they would have responded and in fact they probably wouldn't have responded to that question because we know they're full into\nA job that we already know how they're voting there's this whole issue right we already know as I Know\nBut ... but how many people were watching those shootings I think it came out to millions and millions of people watching that proceedings and so this by asking that question would have put the Democrats\nAre in a position that they didn't want to be put in that would have been may make clear to all the viewers what their full intent was because they they weren't going to come come out with a date or how law and in fact if they did it would have probably been like eight weeks ten weeks three months from now after the election\nUntil you try and then John I Know what you're saying and it's out of bed thought but you know the way there is playing out if we all want the same goal and that's the truth your scenario works but their goal is to lay and we're seeing it what kind of investigation what's the scope of the investigation I Want to see it in writing\nReally now all of a sudden you have just as we thought a friend came out and says I Can't believe Brett Kavanaugh said they never drank too a blackout\nHe used to drink a lot and to me he got really so you know he was ... when he was drunk what does that have to do with anything we're talking about sexual assault or exposure in a situation where the accuser admitted we said she was so drunk she doesn't remember\nAnd it was thirty five years ago so do you see out of the accuser come somebody else who said why ... then he has a room mate\nDrew mayor wow there's room mate that sounds bad he used to drink a lot well it turns out it was a roommate he was stuck with the other three to he had no problem with that fourth won all three of them at a problem with so he's got a chance to stick it to break cabinet oh let me see Yale doesn't endorse him well yeah had protest to keep 'em out of there\nThere are so ridiculous 'cause he's a conservative they ride the protest to keep a yellow alumnus off the Supreme Court\nThat's unsinkable but that's the mindset that what you're dealing with you're not dealing with a group of people that want to get to the bottom of it and Chris Coons is the biggest disappointment listen to a little of\nHis interview with Jeff Flake a and a and Scott Kelly cut three\nHe had exchanges with Senator Feinstein was center at Columbia shower with others that I thought it went over line [noise] um he was clearly ... um\nAggressive angry\nMajor wonder about is sort of building in my case yes Senator Flake you identified with or do you want to sing partisan ... to ... for I have to put myself in that spot down to [noise]\nYou can you can understand why he was angry and ah [noise] you know I can give a little leeway there\nYeah and uh you know Chris Coons ah basically and the company never even gave them a fair shot they never were open to voting for him and he was willing to put up with that uh but now when you start talking about his integrity you want to challenge his decisions roe v Wade and you might be a emotional about that go ahead\nIf he if he snapped a three hundred nine\nDecisions that he had to defend but when you go after and basically says he's not there was an editorial out today says he should not coach girls basketball think about that and then you're not somebody who's gotten out of prison that wants a second shot you son was someone that finished newborn is class in in jail\nAnd it was an exemplary life on and off the court to school on it and who should yeah literally on and off the court in sports and beyond and now has

this is a it's a promise kept for Trump it's delivering he's talking to his base or you know right onto the stump absolutely and and look the one thing that Republicans are here's a problem for Republicans the economy's\nGreat right it's better than it's been in the mid term since Nineteen Ninety eight we haven't seen this kind of an economy sixty nine percent of people say they're very or somewhat satisfied with where things stand\nUm the problem is is that voters don't vote out of gratitude they bowed out of anger and frustration right and fear and so you've seen Republicans change their messaging from Haiti economies grateful for us to\nThe economy is great but if you vote for Democrats it all goes away right and they're trying to really instill that fearing the base to get them out to vote because um it's it's\nThe economy is fantastic but Republicans are realizing the benefits of it I\nWould you say a plane to that time that's why when you say hey if you lose the house the president going to be a nonstop a investigations that fear such right if you lose the sand that you don't get another judge that fear that if you don't have a gender that's right we\nHave a problem with the economy too is when the economy is good voters tend to feel comfortable and where they are and start to pay attention to other issues and so you've seen healthcare rise you've seen education rise in the mix um economy is still the number one issue but not as much as as a it has been necessarily in the path and that's because things are things are pretty darn good right now\nHere's congressman or leader Kevin McCarthy cut dirty one\nAnd what I'm finding is prior to the cabinet aisle hearing intensity level was really on the Democratic side that more Democrats were wanting to go vote that Republicans Republicans thought there was a lot of need but in the last week there's been a fundamental shift that people are now becoming upset not just\nJustice Kavanaugh was treated but Dr Ford that the Democrats knowingly had this letter held it and then put her through this\nSo I Know that's what he wants is he right Tom\n[noise] well that's that's the big question we were trying to figure out right we are trying to get some polling data in here to see what's going on Democrats have have clearly been there outrage meter has been eleven we've seen this gender gap it's been at or near historic highs right in the last four polls taken in September a took a reason average and and women were voting in the congressional about number\nFor for Democrats by Eighteen points Republicans were voting for men were voting for Republicans by two points we got twenty point gender gap\nUm that could and probably will go higher and the question is how much more can can Democrats squeezed out among women and whether men actually respond and get angry and upset and and move toward Republicans I think we will have the highest gender gap that we've ever seen this election uh because of this because of this hearing\nYou played a clip from John Heilemann earlier about if if Kavanaugh goes down this'll benefit Trump and Republicans I completely disagree with that I think that's a hundred percent wrong I think if Kavanaugh goes down as nominations withdrawing gets torpedoed whatever\nThe Republican base is going to be so disgusted into spirited what happened they will stay home and there'll be a bloodbath\nHuge white I think there's a chance you might be wrong in that would repeal and replace you clearly could see the Republicans blew it they never had a plan ready to go in the skinny repeal is that even a play and it was empty ... empty paper and they couldn't get their numbers together\nThey're going to look at this and say we got to give Trump some weapons we gave him three moderates he this is exactly what to do he took it from a list there was handed to him screened by the federal is screen by his own people screened six times by the FBI\nGuy you gave me fifty gave me fifty one you got to get you heat legitimately as an argument both repeal and replace Republicans all we're staying how do you feel about that theory\nI mean it's a potluck anything's possible I think anybody is going to go with your theory that was my ...\n... ... anybody who who who tells you they they know what's going to happen five which now is lying I mean we can see and here's what's interesting about this and if you look at a real clear politics you look at our know tossed up Senate map which allocate to the states based on where the polls are right now Democrats are picking up one seat it goes fifty fifty\nIs not spending money on Trump people it's telling us people you know don't don't mention Trump's name it's still in shock and ... really what we're waiting for is a Republican Party in Congress will mirror Trump's appeal to ordinary Americans\nYeah and by the way he uses ordinary Americans here's the west cut that you have up there on auto workers and they matter to him\nYou know they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars at new purchases\nOf us made automobiles once approve this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker they will say they understand\nThey voted for us in large numbers even though their leadership\nAlways goes Democrat\nA couple of them said to me I don't know how I can do it again many of them\nThe leaders went back Democrats and would tell me\nYou're going to get most of the votes\nFrom union workers\nMost of the votes from workers period but\nThe American auto worker\nWho is very much behind what we were doing as one primary aspect it will transform North America back into a manufacturing powerhouse I Love that\nAre totally yeah North America you know something more trade passes over the ambassador bridge between Windsor, Ontario in Detroit in our entire trade with Japan so you know the border is so porous was just one time delivery systems this is great for everybody\nYeah I'm very curious to see him in ... Trudeau we remember the G six seven rather a they had that left the communique after president was irate he let them have it but here's what he just said you know about you do you think he has the highest regards from your friend election do\nIt yeah uh and uh you know look\nJust and I think it's been a complete embarrassment for Canadian so I mean you want less well\nYou know he had this totally embarrassing trip to India where he dressed up his entire family in Bollywood costumes and even the onion said this is totally ridiculous right and you know he's been tossed arenas the moral conscience of the world and you know and the world has been saying enough already you know you know hey it's just you're just\nCanada right yeah well\nHe is very flexible you know he's very good a yoga and as ... says he's endlessly handsome\n[laughter] I'm only kidding the um but\nThe president's talking right now and he's going to be speaking about this but the other thing is with the Kavanaugh situation the president has been remarkable\nI've been amazed yeah you've seen this before when he had to pull it back together after the convention they will seem to be going off to reconstitute the burning Kelly in and bad and can you bring us back to that moment and the discipline that got the campaign back on track well\nIt was a moment where it looked like the whole world was against them I mean I'm ... I'm thinking about the the point a couple of weeks before the election where the the video surfaced and and everybody wanted him out I mean I was just\nYou know it was sheer guts and determination that kept things together and that's you know but that's the guy I mean we liked him because he was tough I mean we looked at those other sixteen candidates and we thought you know\nNice people well bread you know great families but they can't take on the Democrats\nRight and when the and the price and want to do is it a billionaire resonated with blue collar workers and they'd always wore ties didn't wear blue jeans shared pretend to be somebody who wasn't\nYeah absolutely and you know something on the campaign we decided really early on we are not going after blue collar workers who we are not going after private sector unions public sector is ... ... and that's the only gay but you know regular people on the assembly plant these are our people had something else\nYou know I debated a bunch of left these about my book the Republican workers' party and and they just got furious right they said workers we own that word right I mean we're the workers' party and I said you know nice try but you know something that's ancient history or not the workers' party anymore you're the party of transgender bathrooms\nDo you believe that the president needs another four years to drill that through Republicans heads 'cause you don't feel like you're there yet\nThat we're not there yet uh I was shopping twenty Eighteen would do it we're not there yet I mean at this point people I Know tell me we're going to lose but you know as many as ... seats in the house\nA in which case will have an impeachment Congress at that point you know the impeachment Congress will play on Trump's favor I mean if Americans liked divided government we're talking Trump in twenty twenty I think we are talking trumpet twenty twenty whatever right but yeah it's it's gonna take approached us\nIt's going to have to see and hopefully you have to understand too is that the president did they did in after Mitt Romney got hammered they did an autopsy yeah but you believe the autopsy many ways was wrong\nThe autopsy was absolutely crazy it was like you know let's be nicer right uh and and you know let's let a lot more people cross the border from Mexico it was just\nYou know ... the Hispanic\nYeah it was just a a classic example of a party so down on ideas that they did they didn't all the way up so Trump said you know this is just totally wrong you know and the great thing was that report said we really need a mild\nMannered guy yeah right and then we got so ah you got into the Trump campaign now I\nUm [noise] read programs for judges and I send a list of possible judicial appointees when I heard they were looking for them and I offended the speech and you know what afterwards I found myself a you know two or three messages a day with Jared and Stephen Miller and read it in a bunch of

FBI is investigating\nI saw that President Trump says that there will be no restrictions on this investigation but what should the FBI focus on here senator\nWell they're they're ... according to what Senator Flake said in our committee meeting\nA have a the FBI investigate allegations as of his saying that so as of last friday whatever allegations are out there\nThat the FBI has been investigated even though our community has investigated them or that the FBI needs to follow up and see if there's anything different\nThat they can come up with that my are investigating staff didn't come up with show then uh that could happen today tomorrow or Wednesday Thursday but no later than friday\nAfter it and come up with so then uh that could happen today tomorrow or Wednesday Thursday but no later than friday\nAnd whenever the FBI reports let's say it's on Wednesday a than ah the leader of the Senate files a a a motion to stop the bait ah that day and then there's two days before you can vote on it\nSo if it would happen on Wednesday we could possibly vote on friday but let's say the FBI report doesn't come out until friday then and it's got to be out friday because that's a deadline or then we would ah we would file a motion there and do it over the weekend or daughter or a week from today\nOkay so what's going to be the process with the information that the FBI gathers will it a go directly to the White House or is it going to be going to come to your committee first\nI I think it'll come to my community first but let's say under normal process the White House wants to nominate a jumble a ... they say the FBI or doing an investigation and Joel bowl\nThen that are at that point it would go to the White House and if the president was satisfied and he sends a nominee up\nThe papers would come up with uh the nominee but since the nominees already before the Senate I Would expect the FBI to give their report directly with us now that FBI report\nAh is secured members of the committee\nAnd a top staff or can read it a and other members of the Senate can read it but it's not going to be made public a nothing and what we call the ... guy background investigation which is another way of saying the FBI report\nA is made public because people\nAre people are very candid was what they tell the FBI and if you want the FBI to get all the information they can for background then people that want to want to give their opinion but not let the world know what their opinion is a that's why it's kept secret\nOkay senator you yeah I understand that it's supposed to be kept secret but there will be those on your committee um that that will want that information may public correct\nNo they can be made public as far as I Know a because look at how that would destroy the FBI doing their work\nOr in other words we've had six FBI reports on Kavanaugh already since he started working in public service going back to two thousand and one uh and that was updated when the president decided to appoint him to the Supreme Court\nSo six FBI background checks none of it's been made public so the same thing would apply to this most recent ... investigation by the way by the FBI this was a seven to one Ani\nRight exactly so how is this\nHow is this going to proceed\nIt'll proceed this way the FBI won't make their reports some time between now and friday as late as friday though but\nI never dated whatever day comes in the leader will then\nStart a debate a and brings us to finality ah two or three days after the debate starts\nOkay senator in in ... when this is done and Kevin on you're sitting on the Supreme Court\nWhich I just said is there going to be an investigation into this whole process because Senator Feinstein sitting on that\nOn the allegations from lazy for that just seems completely out of bounds to me\nYeah well that is a Senator Graham has suggested that a staff on the Democratic side of the of the committee which uh because Republicans didn't know anything about the the letter when I was late so it had to be somebody\nOn the Democratic side he's suggesting in an investigation into that if that's\nYour question uh all uh I'm I'm not going to make a judgment on it I suppose I'd have to give an okay do it\nBut I Want to know more about about it before I'd make such a decision now there's some speculation that Graham May become succeed me as chairman in January he could still do it at that point if you want to do okay\nInteresting All right let's move on had a couple of midnight deadline last night and there's some good news us and Canada found enough agreement to form the U.S Mexico Canada agreement or now that we've got a trained lateral agreement will the U.S Congress ratify this agreement\n[noise] well if we can get it done\nBefore a well a lot of it's going to depend on how the election goal was November the sex if Republicans can continue to control both houses of Congress I think it would be approved a sense a lot of it has met with the satisfaction of labor unions you'd expect maybe labor unions would\nGet Democrats to the back at it as well and so if the if the\nIf the Democrats took over the Congress you'd think that would help get it through ah so ah but the ... nothing's going to be done before the election as far as the ... the Congress of ... concert\nOK well it doesn't look like they're going to be any vote on a on a new farm bill until after the the elections no either we miss that deadline last night what your thoughts they're\nWell my my thought the areas that don't forget that mandatory farm current commodity programs\nWill begin reverting to what we call permanent law a beginning a with a twenty Nineteen crop here\nA dairy would be the first to be impacted starting January twenty nine dean a crop insurance uh R. P. L. C. and the existing C. R. P. contracts will all continue for right now because the payments made for the twenty Eighteen a farm bill\nOr for the twenty Eighteen crop\nWoods carry over at least still not being made until September of twenty Nineteen so for this year's crop that it would still be in effect I think that\nThe a farm service agency would be not making new C R B contracts until Congress passes either an extension of the of the existing farm bill or until a new farm bill\nA is a it provides a five year certainly and then you want to remember ... see the twenty Eighteen crop year was covered even though those payments are delayed by one year which gets us back to what our previous as said September\nOf uh uh of twenty Nineteen shark and B L A\nP. O. C. for next year's crop are safe and of course a bat or one final thing to say the best for Congress to do is to pass a new farm bill ... certainly\nYes absolutely I've only got about twenty seconds the odds of getting that done before the end of the year\nAnd do is to pass a new farm bill armor as I have is almost certainly\nYes absolutely I've only got about twenty seconds the odds of getting that done before the end of the year pretty good\nAh by the end of the air probably a possibility but not before the election for sure\nBut not before the election for sure Senator Grassley thank you so much for taking time to be with us today really appreciate the efforts [noise]\nYeah good to be with you will be back with you anytime you want\nSounds great that is Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley okay coming up next we are going to be talking use machinery markets with Greg Peterson machinery Pete right here on TALK\nInforming getting things done early has a way of setting you up for success like using corpus for an early season wind over weeds tourist keeps even the toughest weeds from gaining a foothold\nThat we've talked about a few times that's the silver um I think the guy had like a Seventy one John you're forty twenty\nYup a diesel sing grow two thousand dollars on a broad thirty seven five yup ... von ... and came up and we chatted that day and they should be we work with our local FFA club but um I think it's north say at Valley High school right you know unless you know\nAnd they said we love if you could come down and talk to the kids and any time I get a chance to visit with young folks it's like hey I'll be there\nAnd so we want worked it out last Saturday I came down and on the Druze farm amazing beautiful farm\nAnd they have a a facility there kind of a meeting place and as I say kids who are their parents and folks from the community and [noise] yeah me talk to the kids and until a few machine repeat stories from the trail but then the kids brought their tractors up that they've done the restoration projects on I tell you what\nWe did a walk through video chip ... where I just went through in each kid by the tractor and they told me about the tractor the project\nAnd the story behind the tractor\nAnd it was amazing and you know the news last week you get feeling down about the troubles were him\nYeah all you really gotta do is spend some time with young people\nAnd I tell you what they they are on it they were car bright eyes and our futures in good hands so I'm going to be posting like an hour long Youtube video tonight\nFrom Saturday in West union with all of a a little worries\nEvery wonderful [laughter] it was a ...

advisory dot com and he's got a two week for each hour waiting for you so All right All right lots of news today a lot of it ... revolves around trade issues so let's get right\nTo let's go well this month the U.S dollar index again tested resistance at Ninety five even was trading near session high is as the grain trade was wrapping up\nLast week's quick recovery from supportive of Ninety three fifty back to Ninety five even put some traders on the defensive about what speculative traders already shortened grain futures they had a tough time working up the nerve to sell more in today's strayed\nUp two hundred and Thirteen points six two points bonds are down twenty points looks to me like today it was a big big financial they not only here in the United states but across the planet as the news filtered in over the weekend of change it that is taking place\nYeah you know the U.S Mexico Canada agreement is that almost has to be like like hitting the relief valve ... on on some of the trade tensions around the world isn't it\nWell this new agreements still needs to be secured by legislative approval and all three countries so that's something that is not guaranteed and well won't happen until two thousand Nineteen so we've got to pay attention to the news I mean it's it's as you indicated it's a major step forward\nAnd something that we really really need an agriculture but there's still some glitches that could arise\nI thought I Would talk to a little bit about some of the things I've learned over all these years about terror of excellent\nAcquires cars I was trained by one of the rough as tough as mean as you've picked writers ever in Chicago\nAnd he knew what he was doing in any any knew how to do at the ... the right way up over the long period of time\nBut you know he was a tough guy but the thing that he taught me I never well forget it as long as I live and this is if I Would say one thing to the public to remember about this business is that the function of the market is to discipline government\nThe function of the market is the ... is to discipline government and that applies to our government all governments worldwide sooner or later the government if it gets too far one way or the other it as a swing back I think that's part of like well we're starting to see now if this tariff situation and it's something that's not going to go away overnight\nSecondly I did back in the Nineteen thirties the secretary of transportation was Elaine Chao and there she had a quote it said that ... and ... and up the tariff act of Nineteen thirty to get America back to work out of the stock market crash of Nineteen twenty nine\nInstead and destroyed trade so effectively by Nineteen thirty two American exports to Europe or just a third of what they had been Nineteen twenty nine just three years World Trade felt two thirds as other nations is to have is in jobs evaporated\nAnd filing the one that I Would never well forget as long as I live\nAs one from Jimmy Carter said we must adjust to change it dies instilled in changing principles and of course we all remember the garage and granted the grand bargain what happened there it was a it was it was a disaster the tickets ten years to recover from\nYeah yeah and and really using using up food\nCommodities tool in these trade issues is just dangerous work from the get go isn't it\nWell I'm not saying Mr Trump is wrong by I think again I think functioned the market is the does the government and I think that the situation with the trade imbalance got so completely and I mean completely out of whack\nParticularly with our number one trading partner that somebody had to step up to the plate and say something now how you get the final answer and how it treats you did until you get to the final answer\nThat's the unknown 'cause this is a different time now that the world a different place than it was a Nineteen thirty two hour after this Nineteen twenty nine crash for what I'm saying is now at the time for caution I think things have lots of potential if things were handled correctly but there's already talk\nIn the banking industry that uh some of the major economists and strategies have changed their U.S China assumption and now modeling at twenty five percent tariff to impose an odd all Chinese imports starting in that twenty Nineteen so\nDallas situation is not over with yeah it's a rather pay attention to it on a daily basis because it's not solved yet\nYou're right right so break that down to what it means for the green markets forests gym\nWell short term it represents a lot of question marks where we're going to go with this year's crop is you know it it's going to be a tough one because the Yale than in most cases not all it's so high\nSo as far as overflowing replaced and we're using some ideas to go out and to\nNinety are going to go out next year two thousand idea in two thousand twenty and see if we can semi divert away from this negative impact on the terror that takes them doing it at that as he worked out individual customer on a one to one basis because you've got to match the risk with a potential\nBut short term I'm afraid we've got some problems still ahead of us although longer term with a demand basis as good as it is and as big as it is as powerful as it is\nThere's still lots of opportunity in agriculture and commodities and ranching but you got to be patient might say you got to get around the speed bump first so what we're doing here is and we can be wrong on death\nRow trying to find strategies where we diverted away from the tariffs impact of negatives them and move out to the night the art move out of the Nineteen and twenty a crop years to see if we can replace some of it too strategy that meets the customers' needs\nGot ya got ya you know you mentioned the strong demand that we've got that goes for soybeans as well I mean it it it would be nice if we could catch a bit out of the civic northwest versus soybeans and help out with our overall the system or green flow and everything but job gone\nIs is Brazil\nYou know it's not unusual for Brazil to be quote unquote out of soybeans at this time of year but are they do they have anything ...\nWell that's a question that the market will will answer over time but unfortunately\nThe resilience in a certain sense saw this coming and they're playing with it and their own on their terms so what they're doing it it looks to me like there's going to be some beans come out of Brazil north of the equator\nBy late January certainly by early February they will compete with us beans that are just now coming off our harvest I I think the Brazilians saw this coming into a certain sense the Chinese leadership talk to them and warned him about it\nI had a time in my in my this is my opinion now and then they made sure that if this whole situation came unravel that they had a supply of soybeans coming out of the southern hemisphere\nNo later than the first in February and of course that would have to compete with us on a one to one basis so that that's what makes them being market even though there is great demand worldwide makes it a tough one to call I'd tell I was talking to the guys my offices this afternoon and you know whereas is headed where where are we going to go with this\nAnd they could be the question is how do we ... ourselves away from the negative aspect of this particular situation short term so that we can those who can live to fight another day when the markets get better I mean the ...\nAway from the negative aspect of this particular situation short term so that we can live to fight another day when the markets get better I mean the commodity market comparative stock markets it's on the Web and differential between two is unbelievable I've never seen before\nRight right and and you know we've been talking a little bit here in the last few\nEpisodes of a T. V. about that money flow whether it goes to equities commodities and if it does come out of equities where does it goes a treasures\nIs it is a commodities and and uh right now with the way you know you just set it at the start of the segment gym with the gains that we've got and the equities today it just it makes you wonder\nIt makes you wonder when when stocks do fall out of favor and and where that money might end up blowing but boy that is a it is tough to to to really knock back the stocks right now and if if we're not going to send them back the money's gonna keep flowing into them I ... isn't it\nBut I remember a conversation about six months ago about my when I get a nice sixty five and I'm ... I'm heading out a way and what we what I see what I saw\nA tremendous amount of truck violin and that's still ongoing so\nWhat's happening here chip is I think what China may do is work more towards improving their domestic economy internally kind of like ... they're going to have a copy of our success and dealing with this\nConstruction and infrastructure and so forth I mean the job market is is trivia in China's wants same thing as we do as far as er people as far as job they want they want jobs that create revenue [noise]\nBut the U.S economy in the stock market Italian yeah ... it's it's just still very strong and just unfortunate that the ag sector ranch farm center is taking such a hit off because our products are so ... by the Chinese population\nRight exactly okay we're talking with Jim power today Jim is with power trading everybody knows gym but when we come back Jim I you know we we all are\nWorking with the assumption that the China us trade conflicts are going to continue for quite some time [noise]\nAnd when I say we all [noise] I flew we're still in that assumption okay [noise] well what if it does it what\nWhat if it does it does it get to leave Brazil kind of ... moving forward or we'll we'll talk with Jim about that coming up next on ATV\nInforming getting things done early has a way of setting you up for success like using corpus for an early season when over weeds tourists keeps even the toughest weeds from gaining a foothold\nSo uh so the next several weeks will be important to see what they have to say about that as far as their strategy themselves don't forget China's trying to expand their operations not not just with Brazil\nI mean they have looked at the many countries including Africa\nOr Peru Bolivia Paraguay Uruguay Argentina the Argentine element ... there's more competition out there the new thing going after smaller chunks of our business almost ... almost on a ... a large chunk of our business on on a day to day basis\nYeah yeah okay let's talk hawks we've got the influence of a turn it is a U.S staff\nOr we've got to a halt heard here in the U.S came in just slightly under trade expectations in last Thursday's quarterly hogs and picks report but boy we've got a nice move going on in these hawk Jim what do you think\nWell obviously I dug does most of the training and hogs and hair and a dollar trading but I I Do\nSome of the feeder cattle and cattle and oh okay I I think the cattle are still the leader and ... in a certain sense provide a certain degree of security to the hog industry but keep in mind our freezer stocks are are pretty adequately fail with turkey chicken or beef I I think we've\nGot to work through that it's kind of like a surplus as a ... it'll eventually work its way lower but on the short term you you've got to work through it to get it to be more\nBalanced okay so I I I'm not quite the at these kind of ...\nOr but on the short term you you've got to work through it to get it to be more balanced okay\nSo I I I'm not quite the at these kind of prices with ... with interest rates going up and with crude oil prices going up gasoline prices now on the verge of starting to go back up I'm I'm a I'm a little bit hesitant about being overly friendly at the uh the meat factor\nGotcha gotcha so if you got a strategy that you're like in the in the cattle market right now\nI'm Will start to lay out some edges here if they get from this point on I've uh depending upon the size of operation we wanted that we're dealing with a on a cautionary basis but again I think the main thing I Want to point out as far as I'm concerned about this whole commodity market\nGray versus the stock market is we need time it will heal itself the function of the market is the discipline government that never fails that's the number one rule and commodities trading\nBut it doesn't happen overnight so it takes time to get that all blended together but certainly we are going to look at strategies to try to get around the negative aspect of it is\nA terrible situation which is you know major trading partners and it won't be solved overnight like I say even today's announcement won't really told her to be resolved until two thousand Nineteen so we've got we've got to find strategies to work a way around the problem\nYeah yeah you know that's a ... that is an excellent point on we still need Congress to ratify this agreement with Mexico and Canada I had Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa on average talk this morning gym and just flat out estimator I went when this does come to Congress will\nWill will Congress ratify this disagreement and uh he wasn't willing to just come right out and say yes because of all the\nThe bickering between the two parties right now I'm In and that does leave me more than a little bit concerned going forward here and it's just an ugly situation in Washington right now and that can have any kind of impact on the market's going forward right\nWas that you and I've been talking the Dow Jones industrial average is really dropped his down it's only a hundred and fifty three I think when you start we're starting to talk of voting\nTo hunter a great deal\nOf my my mom a a regular day but what I'm saying is if you if you take a chart of commodities or the the R B index at overland by the uh the essence of this or or the financial stocks\nDifferential between those is extremely extremely wide and so if something has got to give her you you're you're you're pulling the string both ways and falling into our ... and the more you pull it apart at the ... the heart of the snap\nYeah yeah and and it's just kind of like we're in a in a wait and see mode right now just exactly what those equities they're going to do because I think it will have a big impact on what's going on in the in the commodity world but\nThat inflationary trade that shouldn't be negative for the grain showed it\nNow that's one thing that's positive I the ... the R B or a commodity index has been beaten up so badly yup compared to other financial instruments there's got to be a place as I said that when the sap comes it could be a lot more\nUh adult more have larger impact people thing because they've gotta stretch so why now I mean how many days we've been up and up in the stock market how many days have been lower commodity commodity markets that are on the change every yeah\nAbsolutely Jim it was good to talk with you again I really appreciate your time\nNo probably always great to talk to you guys\nYou bad All right that is Jim power with Bowers trading [noise]\nYou know there's one thing about the market is a lot of times all you really need to do is take a look at where we are on the price charts and it tells

four CBS is the phone number\nI Do I have so much sympathy for all Thomas in a few of us on Twitter I get it at sports writers board sorry IT are\nSaid you don't have sympathy for people who hold out\nAnd philosophically I agree\nYou have a contract you sign your name on the contract you should live up to the contract and I do have contracts in in my jobs in radio and\nTelevision so it's not in that case just philosophical or or a thought experiment for me I signed a contract and whether I'm vastly overpaid are underpaid or whatever the deal is I'm expected to honor it\nYou know it's about your word right\nAnd there's numerous understandable you agree to\nYou agree to a very clear terms\nAnd not only be given your word you you've signed her name out now two things one lady on bells under a contract\nHe's franchise tagged in kind of semantics 'cause he operates under a CVA that\nIs the way that these deals are or John and negotiated an arranged in the NFL\nIn real time is not the franchise guy was hold out but I can still be really really bummed out for the dude then he got hurt and I I'm not mad at him for a given the finger to\nA bunch of people bunch of fans I'm just not it's not cool and I love it when when my kids to see it but that is such an emotional moment\nI feel like you cut the guy break a five five to one to four CBS\nJohnny in Nevada where I Am right now hanging out Johnny what's up about a year on CBS Sports radio\nWhat's up buddy out they just heard it's beat me up and I love every moment of I was going on yeah and I\nThink that so you know I I Do I feel bad for all Thomas getting her\nBut you know I saw it you know you\nSigned up for a year forty million dollar you know and you're happy with it\nBut in fact\nHe underpaid I think they had a felony that go to a year by year contract\nHit\nAt you know started it all live up to it but I played\nI played high school sports I play college sports and flipping your teammates off into

Nevada you're right\nI'm just I'm going to cut them some slack right like the Carol talked about because it's such an emotional moment\nAnd you're also right that a lot of these guys leave you know bill included aren't making minimum wage and hoping to make a hundred million dollars it is billionaires who are arguing with millionaires\nYou know today and we're not going to play this but it's an ape you Carol told somebody some other radio networks and radio station number four letters I don't know that in Seattle to cut exactly what I'm saying I caught\nLike go easy on a tough moment and last night after the game Pete Carroll Seahawks head coach talked more in the moment right after after it happened talked about that are all Thomas injury\nAnd somebody says something about that I don't know ... you know 'cause I don't know where it was Santa Rosa extraordinarily boys on the field for from what just occurred to to be so clear and so ah [noise] you know resolve to to what he he knew what happened and uh\nUm but he was so points given back to the players and all of us and and uh [noise] so I don't know what happened after that\nAnd what happened is real Thomas raise that middle finger in ... and ...\nAnd again not ... not a great decision I'm just not going to condemn the guy in an automobile eight five five to one to four CBS is the phone\nEight by five to one to\nFour CBS is the phone number the other day because I'm old and apparently really clumsy I banged my foot\nCouple of my soul a little bit\nAnd I know it's not the same thing but my kids are sitting there and I may or may not have dropped the words that I shouldn't have ... I may or may not have gone full Stewart Kovacs again not okay my kids like you know one of those Christmas Story moments Christmas sale moments\nBut people when they're in pain in this case really really angry and I'm sure all times like are you kidding me this is so unfair things are going to happen that you're going to regret\nThat the brutal moment\nRussell Wilson the quarterback who reportedly and I'm sure it's true had some some problems there was some distance or some jealousy is just between him and the legion of boom and most of those members are gone with the ... time has gone now they are gone Ross Wilson ... after\nThat Seattle game that Seattle when also talked about the ...\nObviously I'm you know a ... you know getting injured and are going out or he's one of the greatest players that play the game\nWhen the greatest place to play the game and he always will be um he'll come back stronger a definitely believe that and him a he's a competitor nobody that compete better than him\nI mean I don't know that it's coming back that\nBreak that leg break is probably a game changer eight five five to one to four CBS is the phone number Sean in Alaska what is going on buddy appreciate your brother your on CBS Sports radio\nThere we got a beautiful um yeah a longtime Seattle fan and I just think if you're gonna you know I have you know at all except for the in the world for Thomas ... you know this idea of the millionaire a billionaire thing\nThat's relevant what's really killing a guaranteed contracts signed up space so teams the teams have the money to ever go on what they don't want to do it half or their ability through\nYou know to build their team or to increase their ability to compete\nBy saying the guy with a hundred million dollar contracts and then having to get that for five years after the guy or you know\nOr is like camp gas or a you know we've fires with a concussion we're paying ... for six million dollar um he's not fight\nTold our well come into the show bill Ryder with you lived this week\nFrom Las Vegas Nevada show is called ride of the new rights laying mining get it right or then yeah and\nSo we're going to double down that right now\nWe're going to be double writer time not just needle writer\nBut someone I I I I presume were related back through the centuries back through the years but not the best of our knowledge Ben writer from Sports Illustrated senior editor at ... am obey writer and author of ... the new way to win it all joins me now\nWould that fabulous last name Mr hyde or what's going on\nBecause how are ya I'm doing good God everything good good on the you know right you're right or family everything's everything's excellent\nIs going to ... ... a great day great unexpected day for baseball today as well\nGreat day not\nNot as great if you're a ghost fan I'm a I'm not going to live and writer ... a little rub your cubs fan um made the mistake of watching some of that game with a brewers fan is there are there any words of encouragement or hold you can give this or any cubs fans after that last\nTo Milwaukee in that hundred and sixty three hundred and sixty their game of the season\nSure you can start with two words Antonio sends a tele\nThat's the picture they're going to be facing\nIn the wild card game at Wrigley Field they've got Jon Lester on the mound obviously he knows what he's doing in the playoffs\nHave to get by going to Rocky's our fence but look Jon Lester versus Antonio sends a tele at Wrigley as seems as if the cubs should be favored in that match up\nDo you are Ben writer here on the show then do you do you buy the notion that\nFour whichever team wins that playing game that that wild card game pardon me tomorrow\nHas some kind of momentum that can or will transfer and will be a series against the brewers\n[noise] um no I don't really buy that I mean I don't necessarily buy too much into the concept of momentum and I would think that you know whatever you might acquire as far as that would be wiped out by the fact\nThat you had to extend yourself in this way especially if it does turn into a battle against Antonia send to tell us just to reach the N. L. D. S. I mean it's very hard to be a wildcard team which is one reason why both the brewers and the cubs fought so hard not to be it\nBut you know that doesn't mean that can't win obviously but it's certainly a much more difficult test\nThen writer on the show not given me the poodle of hope that I got some of it got sent to fill up but not as much over that I wanted 'em\nThen that brewers bullpen is is pretty ridiculous and it reminds me of that royals team that won the world series several years ago where you just feel like you're down\nAfter the sixth inning it's gonna be really hard to scrape together any kind of a comeback when you look at the national league as we know now we know all the teams where they're placed how reasonable is it to start looking at the brewers is maybe the best team in the national league\nI think it's very reasonable in fact I think there's a good chance that they are the best in the national league although the Dodgers certainly could rounded forum at any moment it pretty easily won just a few minutes ago\nBut yes you're right I mean the one thing you look at with the brewers is they're starting pitchers are very good you know Jewish chest pain look strong today but outside of him you're talking about guys like chase Anderson weighed Miley who knows\nBut the thing is especially in modern baseball because starting pitching doesn't matter as much as they once did not when you have Jeremy Jeffress coming out of the pan with a one point to Ninety array\nJosh hater coming out of the pen blowing guys away or with his left handed fastball Cory ... who went through his struggles this year\nBut has now turned in or back into the all star closer that he was you combine that with an offense that has the best hitter in the league right now Christian yellowish orange have gained another VP candidate Hayes is Aguilar came out of nowhere to hit thirty five bombs this year\nStarting pitching probably doesn't matter that much in October anymore when you can get extended innings from so many quality relievers so yeah I mean I think that there are certainly in the conversation right at the top as the biggest threat to come out of the and now to win the world series\nSince CBS Sports radio I'm Bill Ryder he's done writer and it's like some kind of family friendly baseball version of ... here on the program then run up yell at you and obviously there's a few guys but where would you rank in your MVP your ... and\nIs I understand the arguments for Jacobs ... you had a historic\nA season from the mound but you know Christian college had one of the great offensive seasons in recent memory three twenty six thirty six Homer hundred and ten RV eyes came out just a few ... and those letter two categories from capturing the triple crown\nThe ten RBI came out just a few ... and those letter two categories from capturing the triple crown\nMean man like again Derek Jeter has a plan down in Miami but you look at what not only with John Carlos stand that this year which was you know pretty good you know as expected to some level but it seems like the ... trading away the and now MVP\nFor a group of prospects that doesn't necessarily blow anybody away I'm pretty good acquisition by the brewers\nAre outlets are when you talk to them cubs Rockies for\nMe in that A's Yankees game it's such a small\nObviously sample size it's a one game playoff series for for all the marbles what do you expect in that American League wildcard game\nSo much is up in the air I mean remarkably we still don't know who's starting the game for either side or\nThe aid that probably means as you know it doesn't matter because they often don't really have a starter I think we'll probably see them a use their own dominant bull pen for most if not all of the game as they certainly should a\nQuestion for the Yankees is what are they going to get from their starter and who isn't going to be I liked the idea of using Luis Severino obviously entered the year\nAs the eighth also went through his struggles a ... after the all star break but first of all he's ramming into form as last Seventeen two thirds inning has got a two point oh for your age Eighteen have you have that memory they didn't have a very good start last year as wild card game\nBut I think he's probably the ... not just for this game but the kind of set the Yankees rotation up\nFor the a out the yes because let's get on let's get real the Yankees are team that's not just you know probably not going to throw everything at winning this game if it will cost them the future because they are aiming for an LDS an ale cs repeat appearance and probably World Series\nThen writer from Sports Illustrated here on the show he's also the author of astro bowl the new way to win at all and the guy that predicted many years ago that the Astros would and they did win the world\nSeries when they did that um that Houston Cleveland series is really interesting what are you looking at there what do you expect to happen\nRight well of course I made a mistake last November first predicting that the Astros would repeat as champions like minutes after my first reduction came true\nA lot of people that I should have just sat on the world right and I should have written\nThis thing for the rest of your career I didn't\nBut I think that kind of quietly we might be looking at\nNot just the best team in the league right now this year as far as the Astros\nWhich they are by a lot of kind of fundamental statistics clearly the red Sox had more wins um but perhaps one of the best teams in a generation you know you look at a pretty basic stat like run ratio which is basically how many runs scored versus how many\nThey allowed the Astros had the second best run ratio during the regular season of any team since Nineteen forty six they were at one point for nine the Nineteen sixty nine oils where at one point five one\nThere's nothing more basic district says\nTen scoring more runs in your opponent\nAnd the Astros on a consistent basis did that even within off and those kinda riddled with injuries all year long was cared for much of it by Alex ...\nOf course that does not mean that they will run through a very good Indians team just like the Nineteen sixty nine or ... did not run through a very good match team things can happen in short series you look at the end end you say well they only in Ninety One way right every other team in the playoffs\nOr one no fewer than Ninety seven\nYou also look at the way the team's constructed that great starting rotation a bolt on those four five by Brad Hand\nAnd to legit MVP candidates and Jose Ramirez and Francisco wind or they're going to be a very tough for the Astros I still think the Astros will find a way to beat them but you're right it was going to be one of the most entertaining series we have in the early going\nThen writer if you're a Boston Red Sox fan which team are you rooting to win that wild card games you can say\nOh I mean probably the eighties I mean you you don't want to overlook the ... obviously they had an incredible riding\nIn the second half but that Yankees off and it's just especially in Fenway Park this has the ability to get ... hot and last year out of there right was judge healthy stance in labor tourism yell and do our um\nThat's a possibility with the Yankees the A's maybe have a better idea of where you're going to get as far as you're going to face the bullpen a they also have power and not as much as the Yankees but uh I think you know not a great decision but I think you'd rather see the A's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Norfolk", "day": "01"}
