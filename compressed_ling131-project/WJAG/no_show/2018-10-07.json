tonight\nHey thanks for taking my call that talk to you again you got a a a before I get to the NFL I just wanted to say you know I I I\nUsed to go back to back I went with a huge last year and I heard of that go back to back and I won't go into the Yankees Red Sox are napping I don't want to make no one Matt\nBreak a server uh he was talking about Minnesota ... tomorrow yes I think I think\nAfter that game uh after that game that there could be a lot of controversy what a ... at Minnesota look at her cousins and a a Philadelphia now a who's going to be the regular quarterback the rest of the year uh both record dark that impressed\nRight but there's no question in Philadelphia to carts and went to my\nHeart and win yes I I ... did what he did and a field in great when when I went down he was when I was playing like going to be paid before he got hurt late in the season and surely Nick ... put on one of the best backup\nQuarterback performances and the history the NFL but went to their guy or they they have the eagles lose tomorrow Carson when would have to go\nNine of dirty with two picks for any eagle fan worth his salt to say you know maybe we should think about making a quarterback change now they're married of course when they know carts and went to their guy and oh by the way in the same thing with Minnesota nobody's going to second guess the signing of Kirk Cousins but\nIf they get beat again there will be some questions about and how much should we pay him\nBecause they unloaded the brings truck to get him there\nAnd if he gets out at one three in one even though they gave me play against the uh the rams won Kirk Cousins wildly do for a ton of yards and touch downs and like the the rams were just better into biking deep bench\nA hasn't played up to expectations so far so I disagree with you that there'll be controversy after the game as tied to the quarterback position\nYour rights are and one more point here at one more thing that I just wanted to say that that uh you're right you're you're good I like talking to you and uh I heard there Scott\nAnd one more thing that I just wanted to say that that uh you're right you're you're good I like ... at talking to you and uh I heard their stock in New York about the jet\nAbout what's going on there and a half that very short guy in your throat art tomorrow here in town that New York giants so thank you so much Jared and\nYou got it done my pleasure enjoy the are paying the giants tomorrow I guess that you talk about controversy the controversy has already brewing in New York as far as the giants go and uh it is amazing\nThe lightning rod that he lie manning has become in New York that either\nYou think he's done ... why stop got nothing left the giants were\nIdiotic to not draft the future quarterback with the number two picking this past year's draft or there's a segment of giants fans who think that\nA yes the giants happens is struggling you have to admit to that there are way down the number of points scored any NFL so far and they thought they were going to be a more political ... widow do back home which darling sharp with the uh the addition of Barkley in the backfield\nThat this was going to be in our friends have been put points on the board and they just haven't so you can't uh you can't hide that\nBut some people are given Eli Manning a complete and utter pass that it's everybody else's fault but Eli Manning\nThe answer of course lies somewhere in the middle\nThat ... has been part of the problem but not the biggest part of the problem I don't ... I watched all the Giants' games and I don't see where you live manning has been terrible the offensive line is\nPorous was God awful last year and they are changed out of all there to pieces\nBut it hasn't been upgraded all that much not playing all that much better um I don't put it on Eli Manning completely\n... got a Ninety nine percent did a Ninety nine passed ratings in the top twelve in ratings in the national football league a but there is a you wouldn't cry by portion of the giants fans to get themselves they new quarterback even though Eli Manning has not one but two Super Bowl rings\nCarmen from Maryland's up on CBS portray garment\nYeah sure how you doing tonight good how are you\nOkay so you're you're Jody Mack first time caller what do you think that ...\n...

way our as fans\nI that under the weight or a hey does that happen a lot of on or off the air that you know\nPlaying to the last ... we had a man and fine art got in the ...\nUh as we got to bring our own good and we found them and I think we found a man in that game uh it wasn't very showing in Syracuse game with twenty seven point but I think we showed it today\nAnd saying that way\nOr the ... the events in the world because it's not\nHurting reports that say the least\nAnd you know they're going to say everybody got a\nHater I don't know there there are I'm sure there are but they're going to say well wait for it\nI mean it's still there may still have to go and when we go and on a day and a cup of undefeated all you know we survived another way is\nRight and they actually dropped a couple of spots in the poll or\nLast week because of the close game that they played against Syracuse now to ... on the poll means nothing\nThe only ... the playoff Paul and that's not coming out for a couple of weeks so it's it's a beauty pageant mark that's all it it is and just keep winning games do you have to do and then when the ... comes out then you can actually start worrying about it but they did dropped out\nOr they might take a step back up with this sixty cents style points seemed to count\nAnd they needed they they got Dr ... style points having to be a rallying from and coming back from behind the beach Syracuse\nSixty three to three does or should open up some eyes a you mentioned the Wake Forest deep and being a little on the poor side yeah that would be an understatement uh let me give me a couple of numbers for Clemson guys today\nAdam choice rushed the ball ten times for a hundred and twenty yards can Russia's Ron in twenty eight that said twelve\nBall ten times for a hundred and twenty yards ten Russia's Ron in twenty eight that said twelve point aid per carry the day for Mr choice guess what he was in the top choice\nLynn Jay Dixon also rushed it ten died for Clemson today he went for a hundred and sixty three yards\nThat's sixteen point three yards per carry and guess what Mr fix and wasn't there best running back the guy who took them on their back\nOn his back last week and lifted up to that win over Syracuse Travis AT T and also carried it ten times today so all three of their main backs got ten carries a piece that spreading it out evenly\nHe went before a buck sixty seven and ten Jerry's think the point seven per and oh by the way he\nFound the end zone three times a Dixon got it got there twice in choice got there once\nI say they ran the ball effectively well pretty well today against Wake Forest holy mackerel for a hundred and Seventy one yards on the ground insects touched down at getting the job done on the ground Tony port St Lucie is on CBS portrayed you write down\nIt's amazing how David Price a total waste sites out by the Yankees\nIs it the Yankees or is it the playoffs\nI get the Yankees on them and Sanchez forget about it he has like seven or ... or ... ah hits Adam Adam fourteen hit a homerun\nDamn a he my main thing is like the umpire behind home plate is the biggest pitcher friendly I'll call you there is ...\nHe um twenty games this year and four one on or off for when over and sixteen them from one went on there\nOkay you are my or Google when it comes to under over an umpire's in a way that they\nAre calling game apparently not affected but not from is the price and Sanchez much just see the ball will well out of advance cause a hit and below two hundred but if you tell me he owns Bryce seven home runs that's pretty damn impressive for a second year Blair\nYou um do you foresee box show ... that\nIt's a good question um it it's a\nBook will be talk to and my guess is ... will be offered at least one job he is going to have to take a pay cut not because\nUJA je\n...\nIf you cool new who you're talking about Jodie Matt I Want to ask about Jared call just so you know Gary

line going on [noise]\nThe guys on the other side of the glass [noise]\nSince I just screwed up and gave out the wrong telephone numbers for the show\nLast a segment my bad\nI worked on New York earlier today and I was just going stream of consciousness throughout the wrong number so you are my apologies America I'm so they come back with Ricky don't lose that number\nAs the song underneath a return to the program here so I thought they were taking a little shot at does cause he screwed up last segment\nBut then they play my boy Dan from Danville not knowing the ... are drawing right hander name but they use the nachos all by the way was a winner today a one earlier today for the Astros Garrett coal but I thought maybe were cut me some slack pointing out\nBecause of all by the way was a winner today or one earlier today for the Astros Garrett coal so I thought maybe were cut me some slack pointing out your job he's not the only one who screwed up the caller screw up every once in a while to get to know the guys who you're talking about when you call in\nAnd like why don't we all just try and get along here guys people make much sense why they put a raise these on pencils\nSpeaking of mistakes you ought to talk about me or putting out wrong telephone numbers that doesn't begin to compare to my foot ball picks\nMy God have I been awful the last couple of weeks so undaunted by that I Will give you three pro picks before we get outta here today\nYes please go forth with caution knowing full\nWell my picks up not been have been some standard of late\nBut I'll give you the three that I Do like in tomorrow's NFL actually coming up before we get outta here well let me get some calls in that's more important than my picks that's for damn sure ain't five five to one to four to seven midterm jerseys up on CBS Sports writer image\nI think ... the only good but the king of a say so uh I get more mistakes and when when they're caught and you know show\nHere's the beauty of it you get a chance to get another chance that's what's great about life you make a mistake you try and correct you move on\nExactly a great thing I think is the Dodgers and there's also I mean there are guys on base but at ... home run a foreign aid for trade the offensive side\nAnd you think they'll keep ... claim Kurdish or for next year but I went to a time I ... I didn't want to say that they could match up\nI think courage Shaw well I think there are about a fifty fifty shot on many which is good because every other team can make a play for 'em and if they are at fifty fifty that means they got a better percentage than anybody else I'm great\nWith the same in show that the ticket with patients he's ... he's got a ...\nAnd ... that's that's the question who plays where\nMany men and go\nBack there what made me sick and they weren't guy with a second because I'm I'm ... does your trees they don't have to get to this guy\nRight well do they were ... they wear what they were acquisitions for the rest of the year to try and get them home and get him a champion shows it's like a foot or I don't think either one of those guys are going to be back but\nJustin Turner is a stone cold key to that op ... when he plays in he hits they win so you turn there's got to be part of the equation now formally he was the second baseman\nUm he hadn't played out today well while he's become a third base when he's a damn good third baseman and I think he'd be below average second baseman but if you're gonna put see gored short to move many over started not move Manny ... which I don't think he would want to that to be the case it'd be resigned with the Dodgers\nThey're gonna have to be honest with them tell them where they playing I'm playing I'm\nHe he'll probably accept moving back to third I'm pretty sure I wouldn't accept moving to second\nBase which means if that's the case you got to move Turner over to second base going forward\nI have a first pay so Cory Cory is told in Cody play center\nYeah oh I think bill is going to be any outfield for them next year hey are you just replacing max Muncie I Know you could go Muncie it's second and Turner at first but now you got a lot of guys playing out of their best position\nIf they don't make Macs a part time played last month that you\nWould have had for allegedly that's what I mean so ah I I have many means going nowhere bad\nDodges that uh they got damp\nAnd that's why they are ah probably the favorite now Milwaukee fans will tell you because of their bullpen they might be the favorite\nOr the Dodgers and the brewers are going to play for the championship sorry Rockies and a brain fans but those two theories are over um no I I think it should be a good series between those two teams old big play here\nA Notre Dame lot tack\n... got no field goal cut it to ten nine and the quarterback was scrambling trying to get away and he coughed up the football scoop and score pick six fumble return\nFor Notre Dame I'm not seeing any flags on the play looks like it's going to stand so Notre Dame will extend their lead\nHad been cut to one but now a pending an extra pointed sixteen the nine with a P.

Thursday night with the colds coming out and playing very well off actually from the passing standpoint with Andrew Luck we all thought he was gonna struggle and of course he did not because no quarterback struggles in the NFL these days as\nWe're probably going to see in a the action this weekend or as you could probably tell neither of us are at a mazer our usual host of a I on fantasy football he is enjoying the Miami Hurricanes twenty eight twenty seven victory over Florida State came back from down twenty to win that game I'm sure Adam's celebrating somewhere in South Florida I myself I'm celebrating with the\nGators victory over LSU they beat the tigers twenty seven to Nineteen skater you celebrate anything today\nI'm just happy for you guys I Would never share against any of your seat\nOf course not [laughter] why we're here to help you do set your fast you want to call us up all throughout the next two hours\nAt eight five five to one to four CBS that eight five five to one to four to seven before we take your calls though a lot of news obviously that's what happened in the NFL and that's what we're here to help you\nSort of get through and figure out so let's start with some of the injuries that we're dealing with these in some news we already know we know Giovanni Bernard has been ruled out for the bangles Joe mixing is coming back how are you are approaching the bangles backfield with all the Joe mix and you can handle against the dolphins\nYeah you've got it all the Joe Joe mixing Joe mixing can handle I'm not sure it's going to be all we can handle they have talked about easing him back in and Bernard wasn't out I was going to be very very nervous about starting mixing 'cause I don't believe they want to give him twenty touches on his first game back\nAnd I'm not sure they'll need to against the dolphins I still think you start Joe mixing because Bernard's out there but you should also probably try to add ... is the two to four week apps for Bernard if there's any type of step back from mixing it all was the guy\nYes uh one of the beat the waiver where guys Walton three percent owned on CBS Sports as of now let her for that has been ruled out for the jaguars that means DJ yelled and is going to get a heavier workload in that match up at Kansas City how good candy jailed and B\nI actually liked Easter yelled and better than Joe mixing as we get the top ten running back the only thing that you said there that I'm I'm a little questionable about as he said he's going to get a heavy workload there's been two games where they've not had for net and he's not got the workload we expected this chiefs defense though is just terrible against the run they're not good against the pass either but they at least generate a pass Russia occasionally\nYelled and should be good in the running game you should be good in the past in game ... just a free space in the address this week\nHow do you feel about choreographed and if in fact we see him because the first game without for net and we do against the patriots had six catches for fifty six yards on seven targets grant is thirty five percent owns on CBS fortunately\nHe's a complete prayer play I Would say just because I don't think he's going to get enough touches the one thing we've seen ... they can't tackle at all and grant is a slippery guys you might take a bar the backfield and go forty hours for the house but I don't think he's somebody who can actually killing\nI Will say this though if you're looking at more wealth and you're looking at Corey Grant these are guys that if in fact\nThe current players who are counting on his he tells you don't mix and if he has a step back with his neat if for some reason yelled and goes down because Burnett not expected to return anytime soon or at least ... which is writing a then we could be looking at going grant and mark Walton in in a\nHighly and I'm likeable rules you know given what the workload could be there are two running backs to look at a game time decisions I ... I guess that's the best way to describe them dobbin cooked for the Vikings he's questionable with a hamstring problem Lamar Miller who has the late game on Sunday\nDealing with a chest injury if for whatever reason those two guys are out any interest in let's say the U.S Murray or Alfred blew\nA lot more interest in Alford blue actually the Dallas run defense has struggled with out strongly I think they're better this year than they were in the past without ... but they're still not very good and now for blue would be looking at a good side workload\nThe problem for the tape is Marie and for delving cook the Vikings off into line has been one of the worst in the NFL so far it generates pushing they're facing an eagles defense has been the best run defense league so I don't think you can start any Vikings running back to this week\nOne of the big stories we've talked about on CBS Sports quite a bit is the Packers wide receivers and we were expecting\nAt least we got one decision made for us ramble Cosby out with the hamstring problem we thoughts are on the house and we're going to be out with a concussion because it was considered there he was considered a week to week when

probably falls down to fifth or sixth maybe even a little bit lower I think he loses the shortage working working group is better in that spot and it'll be interesting to see the split this week specifically because we're gonna play but he's been limited all week with a bit of a knee injury\nAnd the saints made a move that I'm sure patriots fans will be happy about they ah they get rid of Mike you Leslie who may go back to New England because they have a shortage of running back there not that Gilles he's going to do anything\nTo hurt Sony Michel or James White Nazi were speculating here but just prepare for that transactions happen the Seahawks get their running back back at least presumably a course Carson\nWas a surprise an active last week with the hip injury might Davis was awesome in his place much tougher match up this week against the rams even though they're at home but how do you look at Carson and Davis sharing time this week\nI don't feel great about either of them this week I Carson my the one I prefer but we just don't know what Pete Carroll's going to do in a lot of coaches say things and then do something just a little bit different Pete Carroll says one thing and does the exact opposite and he's always speaking globally about those players\nMike Davis was too good to just sit on the bench I don't think were shot pennies to zero snaps in this game right so I of course Carson that they low influx for me you have to live prefer to play but I don't really want to play any of them\nI Will say this is just in their favor whoever the guy maybe since DJ fluke or has played for them the last two weeks matchups has obviously been a big part of it but they're run game has looked very good comparatively to what it was\nIn the first three games of this the first two games this season excuse me uh and then the falcons backed fields of are they Freeman is no longer injure not on the injury report he's going to come back after being injured in week one\nHow do you see the Coleman\nFreeman ...\nI I had this ranked a lot like I did and the free season except I'm just flip the two I think Kevin Coleman is going to be the better running back in this game I expect him to get the started working as it's not too much of a downgrade from wind Freeman was out because you know Smith was still taking a chunk of the work they were going to use to back no matter who was healthy\nFreeman a low in flex for me in that same range as Chris Carson but just behind him and I think Kevin Coleman's a lower number two running backs\nI actually have it slips I think Freeman just with fresh legs assuming is healthy\nUm they usually have gone back to him right away when he has come back from injury but I agree it's close if you have to have in common you don't have to run away from him now that democracy Freeman's backing conversely if you need Freeman or they use them as at least a number to running back or flex options are the one thing is that this game becomes attract me who's the better receiver\nAnd they tend to you guys ... you know there's there's no rhyme or reason to which when these\nSomebody has already tweeted me and told me what song that was which is Chicago feeling stronger everyday\nOkay well let's hopefully our callers are growing stronger everyday and let's go out to our our ...\nCalls up at eight five five to one to four CBS that's eight five five to one to four to seven and our first caller this segment is Spencer in Atlanta you are on CBS Sports radio and I haven't finished ...\nHey good evening guys can you hear me yup\nGreat OK I'm having a little bit of running back trouble um I'm In a fourteen team one point the PR league um and I'm trying to decide between grant checks ill ... Murray out\nAnd I'm Jamal Williams I Need to pick two out of those guys\nThe fourteenth ER ... Marie ...\nCorrect you're having a little bit you you're if you're having a little bit of running back trouble there I I think Alford worst\nI've got ... oh yeah well then you took a jet for three of I understand so\nTo super flicks\nThat that makes it sound sound a lot better I if delving cook was out I Would probably start with Dave is marina situation but I I Do think Alford Morris looks like the one sure starter out of this group if not ...\nI don't have much faith ... I I don't if I didn't make sure it is my choice right it is a choice but if I was making the decision small Williams probably see seven curious in this game\nIt was eleven eleven last game Aaron Jones has been better at every single term yeah at some point you have to think goes more fifty fifty more than fifty fifty four year in June so I just have a I don't have much confidence and Jamal Williams touches\nThe news I might be off as a president taking a victory lap over the cabinet confirmation that can sense Kansas campaign rally you don't hand matches during our citizens and you don't give power\nTo an angry left wing mob and that's what they've become\nTrump referring to Democrats on the Judiciary Committee speaking in Topeka tonight angry protesters were loud and clear during today's confirmation hearing to confirm Brett Kavanaugh for and associates seat on the Supreme Court\nThe protesters were pretty much limited to in front of the Supreme Court and that moment when they broke through the barricades and made their way up to the Capitol Hill steps but even then it was really tense or the police had things under control and it was an orderly as they are led led us away who were who were being um who are being arrested\nFox's Jennifer Griffin says dysfunctional [noise]\nKnow Eugene jeeze sky watching whether the whether our weather's flows around\nForty tonight under cloudy skies northeast wins eight Fifteen miles an hour\nIsolated thunderstorms likely tomorrow I Am forty six cloudy tomorrow night scattered thunderstorms likely forty six year old ... for news talk W. J. A. G. A. M. seven eighty and one of those five point nine eh than currently it's forty degrees\nUsed dog WG jeeze [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nSaw yeah we're uh we're jamming here to or something that\nNeither of us know what it is our music aficionados enemies are not here to help us out I'm Danny Eisenberg joining me see if we are ...\nFantasy football guys you're CBS Sports and neither of us are music expert so he's going to ask you any idea what they just like\nOh I like I have heard that song numerous times my dad loves playing that game and it was just songs like this you would disown me for not being able to NATO and I I could like even tell you I Saturday yesterday yep Saturday yup Saturday but\nBut no I don't know how to end it Saturday Night here in uh on Sunday there's going to be a lot of great games and CBS is Super Bowl season continue Sunday when Jacksonville classes with Kansas City Denver takes on the jets Baltimore faces Cleveland in an agency nor showdown Miami made Cincinnati Tennessee as north\nTo battle buffalo and out west Oakland collide with the chargers they kicks off with the NFL today powered by ram trucks lotta great games a week five he and the biggest one I think\nJacksonville in Kansas City and I think the reason is the biggest one is because of the quarterbacks and you and I are in agreement here and we might be going against the grain quite a bit by saying Blake Bartels\nBlake board all better\nThan Patrick my home\nSo I'm going to sit this one out and we'll let you defend yourself okay I Want to clarify first\nI Blake ... better than patterns of homes in fantasy for this week as a super star quarterback\nThis is a terribly difficult matchup against the best defense in the NFL whereas bottles is facing the worst defense in the NFL and match ups do matter especially on the extremes and this is the extreme\nSo I don't think you have to bench Patrick problems and if you see ... and your way or where you don't even have to go pick up ... to sort of overwhelmed if you don't want to use that roster spot for a second quarter back I still think bombs probably throws for two Seventy five and two touchdowns\nBut we'll be seen so far this year as if you're going to be a top five quarterback atop a quarterback you gotta have some pretty big upside I don't believe that upside exists against this defense on the other hand ... does because he runs all you can get a Russian touchdown wouldn't surprise anyone averaging about thirty three rushing yards per game\nAnd I would expect to throw a couple of touchdown passes and approach three hundred yards he throws more of an let her point it doesn't play\nI think the arguments for most homes against the defense will be what we just saw from homes against the Broncos them not to say yes at the same similar type of defense I Try not to say but similar type of defense where they have an aggressive pass rushed they has corners that can play and they're going to make things uncomfortable for him now he's yet to throw interceptions\nHe's throwing the ball left handed he's escaping pass Rashid escaping pressure and he's at home whereas last week he was on the road\nI think you're going to get a Tom Brady game against the jaguars like we saw in a week to where it gets it right around twenty fancy points doesn't crush your fantasy team I think he said it perfectly you have to make a transaction to go get somebody else to replace him\nBut if you are looking at it as despite having my home's maybe you're doing to maybe one in three maybe on for I doubt it because he's been so exceptional but he may have to look for a few extra points and I think ... can get you there because what he's done without letter for net\nHas been averaging twenty almost twenty four fantasy points for gaming leagues where there are six points were passing touchdown the way I look at it as a moral standpoint\nIs the Jimmy ... game against cheap to fifty one and two twenty three Russian Guards\nThat's a good day is not a great day but it's a good day and I think it will be a little bit better than the homes and to be fair uh I I haven't checked your rankings today but I knew because we do our show on on CBS Sports dot com she'd be a sports they do that you had him fourteenth and bottles at thirty ... thirty ...\nI've got right now board all that ten ...\nOkay so I have a Thirteen fourteen yeah that's my excuse me I thought we were both in the same boat but you are much more excited about much more excited by people will do you want to know what the song was a yes Elton John oh yesterday night alright for fighting yeah were terrible um [noise]\nThe or the other game I Want to look at here is a is open and the chargers almost call them San Diego again I tend to do that quite a bit apologize to find people Los Angeles\nThe raiders have had some interesting fantasy performances\nSo far this season a dark I Believe has been over three hundred yards three or four games or we see dirty Nelson come on we haven't been able to figure out what is the right time to start mark Cooper jak cook two monster games to not so great games and Martian lands very quietly or has been good\nFor fantasy purposes the charges on the other hand uh rivers have been awesome you know not so much like Williams up and down almost like they married each other or running backs however have been fantastic unknown Gordon ... how do you see this game unfolding\nI think the ... going to win I think they're gonna win handily I expect Kaine and Allen to bounce back Melvin Gordon is going to be awesome hecklers a fine flex I'm a little worried about the Oakland Raiders and maybe it's just because\nWe their car hasn't been ranked in the top fifty and quarterbacks and we've seen car struggle with the interceptions but I Do think the chargers defense is better than it's played so far and they're starting to get healthier and I think they may have a little success against car I don't want to start on this\nInterceptions but I Do think the chargers defense is better than it's played so far and they're starting to get healthier and I think they may have a little success against car I don't want to start in\nThe eye and and I understand that because we tend to get burned by them and we can start to buy in and it's happened with\nAlmost all their players you buy into our Cooper coming off a good game you let us down you're buying a dairy cook he lets us down joining doesn't I don't know how many people feel comfortable starting him and we for after his explosive game against the dolphins in weeks three but he was good and so we'll see how that goes I think actually cars going to play well an endless\nTrack record against for Cooper against the chargers for car gets the chargers has been awful I'm\nLike you said they are getting guys back ... is coming back from suspension that just help or their defensive line but without Joey both so there hasn't been the same password so we'll see I I think car has a chance to be a top Fifteen quarterback because this game as Vegas has told us\nExpected to be high over under in any event let's get now to uh some more phone calls this is science fantasy football and CBS worst rated calls up at eight five five to one to four CBS that's eight five five to one to\nFour to seven let's go to Rob in Florida Rob which question\nHey guys how's it going\nOr got fourteen team ah keep you early or Fox where am I flex has taken by a wide receiver them using um two running backs\nFreeman in grim\nWith terrorists were or heckler\nI'm going to go with mark Ingram an awesome heckler and it'll be an interesting one because I'm Still kind of down on Derek Henry and I know Jamie's or thoughts on Henry and you're more excited about it but this is ... would you start Henry over act where\nI Would not in NPR um\nAnd we're going to talk about some sleepers coming up in in in the segment or to\nResident bring up their country but in the ... league no uh I Do think this is his first touchdown of the season I'm never one to tell you to bank on touchdowns is more of a gut feeling than it is anything substantial\nThe one thing I Would say about Henry is when they've been in competitive games not chasing points like we saw last week I don't know if they're better than um nipping tucked type of game right where they are either had to lead or or been able to manage the the game flow game script\nWhich happens in week two and three ... and those two games and I think if you give them making carries against buffalo with what they've allowed\nIn terms of touchdowns I think Henry does square but NPR ... been too much involved in the past and game and we expecting them to do that as well or done and Florida you're on CBS Sports radio non fantasy football\n[noise] big I think for taking my call um [noise] I'm a full PBR lake and anger pick to lead guy or am I got clean coal\nColds easily Mark

for the forty niners the bangles\nI only seeing the jak even for two defenses this week that's the Baltimore Ravens and the team playing the bills the tightened so I Would start Jacksonville defense I don't think that they're going to grab a hold and the chiefs to low point total but I think that they will get turnovers and they may get ... get a couple of sex ah as far as those receivers I I'm\nTo

Joe Flaco against the Cleveland Browns and deer car against the chargers they're both under fifty percent they're both fine options I think you'd start both of them over somebody like Russell Wilson\nYeah I agree and and potentially over Carson and wants to who's been good\nAt least he was the last week but not necessarily greatest match up because I Do think that the Viking defense is going to show up a little bit\nI'm given what happened to them last week against their hands are tied in physician we know this has been a terrible position for fantasy owners awfully you've been buying into as we've been telling you since the pre season certainly he was very high on air he brought a he got you off to a great start on Thursday night Rob Gronkowski\nNot as good but not a horrible game for him just not what we used to seeing from ... we haven't seen that yet so far the season but we are still trying to replace that when you walk replace Craig Olson replace Evan Ingram so we're ...\nThe great thing is tightened is so bad that these guys just get thirty or forty yards they were successes a stream or there were three or four points are there are three of them I think uh been Watson on Monday Night Drew Brees as one less receiver to throw to watch them going to keep getting the red zone targets the James ...\nIs going to be flying tight in for the Bengals in ... it's going to be a split between have entire Croft taking over Tyler I for it but everything we've seen so far this year and everything we've heard innocence and how do you suggest\nThat he will be the first man up and then often so and he loves his titans and the red zone and Ricky seals Jones facing a forty niners defenses giving up a touched down to a tight in in every game so far this season\nI'm going to give it to more than just swing ... has come along the last two weeks for the cowboys they're still trying to replace does right trying to replace Jason when he's at targets have come up touchdown uh\nI'm along the last two weeks for the cowboys are still trying to replace does right trying to replace Jason went and\nHe said targets have come up touchdown ah last week\nFor them and the Texans I've been very bad against them so far to start the year and then Jeff firemen for the Broncos are Jake but out for the season with the torn ACL and the jets secondary who the Broncos are facing down to remain Johnson so there's definitely some things in the back in their defense their secondary has been good so far this year but\nUh it was a harm and get seven targets last week and with the ... throwing the ball or not necessarily throwing the ball with the level of success\nYou could see harm and continue to get some targets All right let's go out to the to the phone lines again you call up eight five five to one to four CBS that's eight five five to one to four to seven and our first caller is Matt in Seattle Matt what you got for us\nHey guys how's it going\nHey so I had a team a dynasty league twenty man roster um I had some pretty good receiver that public in the trade for a quarterback\nSo I traded ... who are pretty pretty tired of owning the honest and map Brita for I'm starting to all those women are your thoughts about that and that that feeling\n... the national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars value some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nCoal eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed by physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us too precious metals right now\nAt eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free gold Irish guy called eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven\nDoes your basement or crawl space a damp must be smell will watch out that's a sign of too much moisture and not enough ventilation and that could mean increased mold growth and build up of harmful toxins gases don't bother with a D humidifier if just circulates the same on healthier now\nThere's a better way to remove these dangers in odors it's with the computerized wave ventilation unit that reduces moisture and expelled pollutants\nWith wave units there are new buckets of water or filters and they cost only pennies a day to run wave can transform your home into a drier healthier environment satisfaction guaranteed ask about our indoor air package that includes the wave ventilation unit\nPlus a six stage portable air purifier dealer opportunities available for more information visit drawing house now dot com that's dry house now dot com or coal eight eight eight nine seven nine wave that eight eight eight\nNine seven nine W.

I was like it's like one game is last twenty that he's had over a hundred yards receiving it's just been a bad stretch for him and we thought the quarterback situation in which case gain and was there any things around\nThat has not been the case no pun intended tight and bust\nI it's hard to fight it tied in bus the position has been a bus but forty three percent of you are still starting Dave and the joke who we gave you five streamers I think in the last they went to tighten I Would start each and every one of them over and a joke with is we\nGive me some buddies though of the good side ends\n[laughter] we thought he was one of ... well I'm just saying like somebody that you have right not necessarily that you think is going to be bad but could be bad like for me it's George kill because the targets I think will be there for him but in eighty two yard touchdown reception and broken coverage is not something you want to hang your hat on I I'm a\nLittle like I Know people may be more excited about Jimmy Graham because the target should be higher if all those receivers are hurting\nBut if all those receivers were hurt the freaking put two people and I don't know that they're going to his big thing is he's going to work touchdowns I don't know that they're gonna get the red zone very often if the voluntary Adams employing yep so I'm a little worried about him and then I could see a situation where Kyle Rudolf just gives you nothing\nYes and I'm also and and this kind of goes back to the door skill thing I Do think that there when James gonna start to become one of these titans racers you cannot venture cook right now based on what the titan position is and what his numbers have been but he is just somebody that is going to have these ebbs and flows through a good game too great game so far\nTo mediocre games and I wonder if\nDarwin James on Dirk ... makes it a little bit interesting we'll see how that\nAll unfold cook as a good game after I just typed up the same thing last week and joins [laughter] and ah I Will stop talking about Darwin days but I Do think he's a great player I always go out to the phone line now again he calls up five five to one to four CBS eight five five to one to four to seven Jordan in Seattle which question for us\nTies All right I Am and a half point PBR way and I need to start your wide receivers and blacks from the following alright Emanuel Sanders killing coal\nAh Larry Fitzgerald Royce Freeman James Jameson Crowder\nA real shot Taiwan Taylor and kick he don't give me ...\n[laughter] that that is a lot of names there was there was ... if you want to ... there was what I heard there for sure we're starting to manually enters okay yes that that's the one for sure start Jamie where you can cross thinning out where I Know we're we're not starting him now I I don't want to see if it's your old no\nUm I think ... coal\nAnd a proud West Point graduate high\nJump all also praised the cabinet nomination claiming the Senate Judiciary committee members I become an angry left wing mom Fox [noise]\nKnow Eugene ... sky watching whether the whether our weather center flows\nAround forty tonight under cloudy skies northeast wins eight Fifteen miles an hour\nIsolated thunderstorms likely tomorrow I Am forty six cloudy tomorrow night scattered thunderstorms likely forty six year old just Derek height for news talk W.

yes\n... fantasy football and CBS Sports radio I'm Jamie Eisenberg joining ... is our final segment here [noise] hopefully we've given you a lot of information to get ready for weeks number five in our good friends around the city worldwide Web I guess some people the kids took all that I only saw it on the Internet\nUm argues breakers in the world of the NFL on ESPN NFL Network CBS for\nA I'm a junkie he's I stay up late I never sleep so I wait for the Adams after reports the in rap report reports about who's going to play is not going to play on Sunday and typically they come in the middle of the night or get lucky here tonight okay eleven forty eastern so let's let's catch you up on some of the news or this is according to ESPN\nDevout to Adams guy we're talking about a lot this week a lot this uh uh the show they expected the playlist this question of both the calf injury but according to ESPN he will play so keep Adams active we don't know about drawn out and bought rebel cobs out so without us playing Marquez about us gambling trust them or not trusting of\nNot trusting him in anything other than at the fs put and maybe some fourteen ... live very deeply as a as a third or fourth wide receiver\nSome some guys that we were expecting to play uh Marvin Jones going to play corny SPN Larry Fitzgerald going to play according to ESPN mad Brita and that same game will play for the forty niners again according ESPN and now the fun news\nGuy that you've been very excited about I was excited about hating Hearst going to make his NFL debut but not just make is that it felt they view he is going to start against the Cleveland Browns\nHate her sixteen percent own on CBS Sports league get that number up so he is going to play he's not your typical rookie ... twenty five years old so what's your expectations for this week\nWas sixteen percent has gone up at during the show if I was going through adding um as many leagues that good debt to drop them in a few it's hard to carry titans that aren't playing\nA I don't think you can expect week when he gets all of the titan targets with the ravens wherever probably but that's because they throw the ball they're tied in more than any team in football you're still going to see a little bit of action from Nick boil maybe mark Andrews\nBut I Do expect that maybe as soon as this week with him starting he leaves the titans and target and he's a yet another streaming option at titan there was a league where I didn't have any other roster spots and I had been watching as I started I didn't I just picked up her some enrolled and this week 'cause I'd rather have an alumni roster than watch\nYep and that's certainly a move that a lot of people should make if you're not comfortable with just starting tight and if you do have let's just say Trey Burton or the buccaneers guys have you been going to OJ our camera break 'em and you don't like ... or\n... or or excuse me just re emerging firemen or ... or whatever the case maybe we'll get ahead in her 'cause there's a lot of upside there in his office and then coming from the NFL Network remain Rapaport Donovan Cook\nThe Vikings are not expecting him to play so let's have is Marie he's at sixty three percent excuse me fifty three percent owned on CBS Sports but we've been telling you not necessarily a great start against the eagles you're you're\nJust hoping that he scored a touchdown because he's not he's never really been a guy that has a lot of success and the passing game and you'll probably catch up after two in this game but they just don't have much hope of moving the ball on the ground against the eagles I Will have him ranked in the same range of someone like ... the backup running back for the bingo this\nWeek yeah for me it's more of a flex but it's you know deeper leagues if in fact the the uh the one thing you've got to keep in mind with with this Vikings off as they've been throwing the ball so much but we don't know what they'll do when they get inside the five if they're still continue to throw the ball or they will get Marie and opportunity to maybe get a a a goal line chance score\nFind the end zone and they have at ten days off the you know get over that rams law so we'll see how they use\nHe to maybe get a a a goal line chance score find the end zone and they have had ten days off the you know get over that rams law so we'll see how they use very 'cause they do not use him very well or two games ago went down and cook was\nAlright the rest of this show rest of the segment is all about you all about your phone calls calls up eight five five to one to four CBS eight five five to one to four to seven Mike in Ohio you're on advocacy football on CBS Radio\nGreat great show guys thinking I'm going to twelve to word have few PR three quick question as a quarterback Rogers are rivers a defense Houston or Philadelphia a flex mix recoup\nThose were quick question yeah [laughter] I'll I'll go with rivers quarterback over Rogers even though he's got the ball on day Adams I still don't feel good about that situation degree I Will go with ... almost silly I've got back to back to my rings and I'll go with Philly okay and then it flex I'll go with Nixon mixing over Cooper\nYes that's an easy one good job my way to make that quick a guy tried to keep it to one question and want to get through a lot of callers before the show is over Jeff California you're on I as soon as you flip on CBS Sports radio\nThanks for taking my call running backs Freeman Powell will record I Need to which Freeman

P. R. my going I got Calvin Ridley Tyler Boyd willful or math Brita Christ Thompson I Need to standard link\nSo I'm starting to either bored\nI don't ... really Chris Thompson and who was the last one Brita Brita I'm going to go or something\nYou're going to go to ... you know I'm going to go full or\nYour your full or yeah I'm going to foreign boy I'm just a little bit worried with that being an eight PM game and I think he's fine but if he's had so many problems in the past\nSo here's what you do you have Tom since the wedding\nThat's true that's true Thompson place Monday Night so I just ... ... fuller is a guarantee you know I mean obviously is going to start not find the end zone at some point with the sun was about seven or seven\nThey play seven games together going back to last year and I just don't see it stopping 'cause they can't run the ball so um I think you just play the fuller Thompson fall out if there is wonderful or does not like I'm next to go to Jesse in Kansas you're on CBS Radio nonsensical\nBig guys the things you taking my call a any to choose one of the PR between sterling shepherd and ...\n\nThat's a tough one I I think I Would actually lean towards breed I Know that there is a tough match up for it all back him but he is squeaky wheel is for real and I expect that can be force fed in this game both are good start but I go to\nIf it was non ... yard agree with you but the PR shepherd is just the targets that spike since Evan Ingram has gone down and there is no better set up for secondary receiver against the steam\nBecause really went off when who struggled Boyd went off when they take green struggled\nShepherd bully oh I agree with you although I was gonna come through at some point but I don't think that means shepherd that gets in to get the slot receiver against the Panthers has been very good and if it was again not to keep your eye I Would go with three to but I'm going to take him in a mythic shepherd in a NPR David in San Diego you're an advantage football CBS Sports radio\nGuy PBR question for teams on foreign oil and I'm looking for upside I saw my waiver I'm Free agent who of course got when they ran do I'm just looking for upside of going for 'cause my receivers this Landry\nCoats and um and I just wanted to see what you guys thought about that thank you\nYeah I definitely think God when it has more upside than Randall ... especially since you don't need a receiver of this week neither one of them are playing I go with God one\nGod was ownership has dropped to about fifty two percent I saw when I was going through some looking at school and they're always well it it looked he's coming off the bat game he's on by week but I still think that he's going to be what we thought he was going into the

D as Conor McGregor have a fight\nWhere this Gulf five rounds I think if this last three to four around it because congressman on his back from a drone at the time and he won't be the last on his back for four rounds I don't think I'll be able to get around\nIt completely unlikely but I think the factors counter you know multiple times in his career whether the end of the Floyd or whether as a boat ds fights if you think about it he\nHad these gut check moments where he has to dig deep or he has to just tap out and give up if this goes to the decision this might be in the fourth round when Congress getting just\nPumped with fist in his head and he has to look inside and say am I doing this for the money or am I going to be a competitor get back to my feet and started throwing punches we are going to see what kind of McGregor is made of after\nThis fight if you look at that an atheist fight where it went five rounds\nThe last few rounds he had opportunity to to strike and walk away he he knocked down Nate was able to walk away and and and not engage and not take the fight to the ground 'cause he counters not stupid he knows his best if anything ... pound is a possibility but his best weapon is standing on his feet 'cause his his left\nA hook is where it's at ... with with Habib he's trying to put this\nOn the on the ground as soon as possible we know that but\nI Will con or be able to to to have these breaks\nHere and there against can be I don't think I think it's almost like we still call because things and not too long ago a you know completely destroys opponent by just taking it to the ground are the aid to the ground constantly and these wrestlers are able to air conditioning is so good that they can go five rounds straight\nThat's a great reference the Kobe covering this Kobe couple attended against any opponent 'cause he is relentless man whether it's Damien ma or already with the constant pressure\nThe thing is what Habib doesn't that first sixty or sixty seconds to two minutes is he's gonna try to just wait on the outside and then jump at the legs it might be too late by the encounter might catch him with an upper cutter knee\nHabib needs to just apply pressure just go straight through the storm do that John Wooden the old UCLA coach mentality just\nDon't study your opponent just study yourself just go forward if he's a fantastic wrestler do deal with one shot and then the fights in your hand if he wants to play on the outside that could be lights out from the first round I really believe that we ... we we see what happens\nWhen counter walks out that famous as soon as his name is introducing you seemed kisses hands and the the crowd has his ... he has a ... or of the crowd in his hands\nBut we've seen fighters crumbled to that Eddie ours look like a deer in headlights\nThe funny thing is is is that um yesterday at the ... ah what what is it wasn't a press conference with the was the way and but they had a moment to talk afterwards and it seemed like Habib\nWas not shook was ready for the moment what he said ... quickly but it was brief but he said bring it on he would have\nTo flush of boys with ten thousand screaming Irish fan love it and he was running for he goes without you I wouldn't be here so thank you thank you for this moment I'm ready to smash boy that's crazy I listen I we saw any we saw Jose although no one felt seemed as confident as a veep no\nNever been shown replays of the first press or in Radio City people thought oh man Habib or maybe ... got under his skin I go no Habib look calm and cool and collected\nThe only thing that's why I'm picking counter I think he under estimates counter I don't think he's I think maybe he just he's so reliant and so confident in his skills that he just thinks he's going to walk through counter I ... it could be a short nice for him in and counter you seem that like he needs to garner this um\nThis this energy he needs the crowd you know he he needs he needs to contact he needs is opponent to blink or push back I think he didn't get that but I think the last minute before the bell rings to start this obese might just feel like he's in quicksand\nWell did it did counter mess up by getting to the pressure on Thursday late\nThat's the question I have yes because it because it seemed like if he was there on time there he he answer all the questions everything's great encounters not there and you didn't have that sparring opportunity to just kind of go back and forth and say all the incentives things things you've been feeling for the past two days that you've written down about as\nSpring opportunity to just kind of go back and forth and say all the incentives they things you've been feeling for the past two days that you've written down about as I Know\nMan and he caught a cold hubby while he had the the Mike and the screaming Irish drunk fans we know they weren't so I was in the home so well [laughter]\nI did see a couple of empty bottles so does sound well congrats the ... um but yeah that that was a huge opportunity well how beeps cutting wait and we've seen them kind of freaky on these cutting wait weeks\n... could have leapt on and maybe gotten this had could have got to be to maybe a show a little emotion but yeah that was that was messed up counter you got to be a little more punk show my friend we need to work on this who's his brick NPR manager\nHimself in a way I don't know Dana Dana seems to be unconscious and I think if he doesn't like that also about Dana I don't know if there is a ... if they don't like each other but I think could be gets rub the wrong way by Dana being so supportive of Conor but I think I feel about that I mean\nThe New York Yankees even the American league division

[noise]\n[noise]\n\nPaid off in the film in our back\nThe game [noise]\nYes we're back on CBS Sports radio outside of the cage with your host I film if Pete Hoffman I could live in Vegas I'm here in New York City studios and it is time it's actually happening Connor ... it's about to go down your change the result there are like you want your you just you're sticking with Conor\nMan's counter looks worn out [laughter] Coby was sniffling Conner looks drain I don't know what's going to happen here dude\nAnd then start as B. gun oh man this is crazy we waited so many months for this to happen you know as soon as you've got the got the winning Barclays against ally can't the obviously all that\nA ... a girl drama the each Hollywood Story that went down at Barclays Center with uh the the ... through the bus them catching each other in the hallways and ... it's finally here man this is this is the biggest fight and us the history I Know a lot of people haven't been a sharp and about this fight 'em\nBut I really believe that this numbers are going to do really well\nThe the highest you'll see pay per view um is one point six and eight Diaz verse Conor McGregor to USC to go to those back or to two years ago in two months\nUh I think this is really going to surpass one point six million I'm looking at one point eight maybe two million and Floyd and Conor did how much damage that was four point what was the ... for for for people to buy I mean the data says like six or seven million\nYeah somewhere to four million ... and ... point three and that's fantastic and you have to think that a lot of that was based off of\nConor McGregor not ... Floyd brought in about two ... I Would say but counter broke the other two because ... is the name he's the he's only Thirty years old he's in the prime of his career he's doing something outlandish is going to boxing this fight though he hasn't been in the ... gone for almost two years\nThey finally stepping back there in Vegas\nHe's fighting the best light weight fighter ever yeah and he's on his ass right now\nWhich by the way so that was one of the big things how ... how how would ... be able to take down Connor how ... how would take place would counter be able to get one of his uh your signature strikes knockout punch is early on and ... was\n... uh well you know he was calculated with his risk and he didn't take any damage going down to the ground and it was it was a tug of war for a little bit right now ... is on his back ironically he is\n... oh well you know he was calculated what this risk and he didn't take any damage going down to the ground and it was it was a tug of war for a little bit right now ... is on his back\nIronically he's right on his feet and he's sitting next to the proper twelve like [laughter] it's it's so apropos man like what I I Hope we get to counter fight our hope it gets back to his feet if this makes the second round I Hope he comes out in the second round fire and\nAh because this is just the so apropos that he's sitting next to property while because if he a businessman now is is whiskey guy see uh this politician in Ireland or is he going to be this fighter is is I Want to see how fat he's gone and and not literally physically I'm Talking about mentally\nDoes he still have the hunger I don't know if he was trying to convince themselves that that's what I was kind of getting but also get the sense that he was anxious to compete again\nI mean he's not sweating it seems like a part of the strategy was just to relax and maybe take it easy not grapple now that the muscles fill up with blood but how be man he's sticking his game plan he's ... he's running through the tunnel\nI wouldn't say that corner I'm you know ... that he's gay taking much damage right now he's not able to to to get up off the map but the one thing is he's not taking any serious damage and that's one thing that all their fighters in in previous fights with ...\nYou saw that she was demolishing then was able to make them you know find a way quickly to to put those strikes a land those strikes while they're on the on the net\nAnd that's not happening right now it could be Connors given could be run for his money on the on that now the positive for Conor is there's a minute and thirty left to this round yeah they're standing up soon so so he's got it right now doesn't work out for comment they stand up in another another minute thirty and they'll be able to go back to\nYou know the feet which is obviously Connors um main goal that's where he wanted to be\nIt's almost like counter predicted that he'd be on a on the on the ground in the first round he didn't do his hair if you noticed there was no gel and they're pretty as normal but it was it a little shaving with the the dodge all along with Ben Stiller he's like it's ... and it's dangerous counters hair was not a thin reached the ... plus level tonight\nBut it's like a pick your poison he's laying on his back but like you said he's\nNot taking damage if he's keeping the ... a guard underneath a beep and he makes a beep I have to control all of his limbs obese is not going to be able to land punches I mean I I Would credit counters corner if he does come out with a when\nThis was a fantastic strategy to show that Habib not going to do damage on the while he's just laying on him and Connors just going to chill laid out take a sweater whiskey get up and throw some punches I Hope I Hope some action happens in the second round as we near the end of the first so you think\n... and the water bottle is that what it is [laughter] product well not for not that but you talked about fat mentally you know if he is his is his mental game fat yeah his Walter fat\nThan you thought about being a multimillionaire or and they asked [laughter]\nWhen do you think will be a billionaire and they think he's had thirty five which is not going far away [laughter] I Know that's like five years what are we doing wrong right now I get the uh okay I have a list here and I say I have bought a this is one thing that is it's I'm surprised right now it's gone past the first round pretty much\nYeah there goes in first round\nThat is amazing to me that Connor was able to withstand any significant damage on the ground now we knew\nThat if he was most like to get to be on his back at some point in time and he was with there was nothing real significant right there on either side as far as damage it but it just it was it was a test to see what what happened\nThere that was a warm up you didn't get the knock for [laughter] I'd rather go to if they haven't been scripted [laughter] I don't get those emails now um the the other thing though is that you know Connor wasn't able to do anything as far strike why\nHe was able to prevent could be from really get a it took about a minute friend that he made them work to get on it but I think he poke them in the ear [noise]\nYeah I might have seen that that that that that's a possibility [laughter] the other things are you talking about hunger there was something about the press conference that just didn't get off the hungry question what was that what that\nWhat they asked ... who's hungry and they ask condos under their Dana who's hungrier oh I'm I'm a I miss that I missed that I Know you're a she is it like three times I couldn't take it and they kept on asking I don't understand what you're saying I don't know who are older than ... yeah oh yeah\nThat got awkward and Dana when Dana knows that he could just pick on a certain reporter uh maybe there's like a a lost in translation type of\nThing going on and you go to Graham oh 'cause she kept on asking again is ... is like I'm hungry for this Monday [laughter] I Know where to start around two again you see two twenty nine were outside the cage or breaking down you see two twenty nine Connor averse Habib surprisingly we went through the\nFirst round with very limited strikes\nYou know ... not much going on just Connor on his back what she did shot Mendez fight oh whoa whoa whoa right from the Habib Habib lands wow it's crazy Conor McGregor we've seen him on his back a few fight we saw it with\nNot Dennis Eva we didn't really see we saw the attempt there but nothing really significant happen with\nChat Mendez for two rounds you saw a corner on his back and he was able to withstand that 'cause Chad just wasn't for many different reasons given for the last minute ... Chad Mendez we were able to see Conor withstand that stand up towards the end of I think was the second round\nSo that was the finished yeah and you know with thirty seconds left knockout Chad Mendez to and that fight the other time we saw Connor on his back was Nate Diaz for ah for kind of neat part one and that will that was the only time we saw\nYeah luckily for Conor or Habib doesn't have the uh jujitsu experienced that Nate Diaz has you know he he climbed past counters garden after taking picking them up above his head taking them down\nAfter we've ever seen him in a full bar before notes on yeah\nThis is we're meant we always wanted to see as you said this about Eighteen months ago you're like I Want to see what kind of can do on the ground and honestly man I say there's a I used to say this jokingly but now that the fights happen and it's working out that it's a grapple of match what if all of a sudden we counter wins a whole bunch of fans with\nHis jujitsu Olson counters thrown off leg locks and arm bars it's not looking like it now but\nI I don't know if he's looking to pull off the interest in silver fifth round against shell sun and uh he he ... he'll be all end of the biggest strike with that over hand right but ...\nOh yeah yeah yeah that was great I mean counter seems recovered I don't think can be getting off that strong ground in town I mean I Know you got to be honest about this of course they are but the thing is to is that getting back to the chat men despite where\nIf you have hard water the lime scale not only leads white spot the plugs pipes it

I ... that could be part of I don't know maybe the past\nTwo or three years that Khan has been in the spotlight he's got under his skin and he finally had them underneath them I mean\nThis just seems like it was a combination of everything man Habib this humble Family Guy undefeated Muslim Russian fighter grape background very marketable it just seems like it was a combination of everything he's had to deal with he had to deal with the the pony show or the circus that counter how to just deal with in boxing\nAnd he came through is the way it may whether a man of and the may ... hats off to him but\nHe was Michael visiting and tiring wildly on the uh Fox Sports post a fight that they agree with you this was that this is a dirty mark on ... a record right now like a great hats off to the fight but through the whole world just saw this\nUh you know the one thing that that Congress said to Joe ... who wants to didn't want to see that hat on Joe Rogan had and he did\nHe did not have to say it could be tied on July ... mission accomplished I get any ... better out here in Vegas [laughter] yeah you you wanting to fight you you said you can be too when you one now but you didn't get that we have tons of phone calls right now is trying to trying to get some in ah we'll go to Tom in Stockton\nWhat's going on Tom are you guys doing very well done and the two oh nine [laughter] or\nNine eight this is either grace jujitsu country ma'am I'm actually a acquaintances and Diaz brothers and of course you know I don't like corner McGregor but let me tell you something about this fight now and this is what I think every but I'm I'm looking at\n... tweets about how could be there is um you know being a sportsman like what a terrible wave after winning this ever tell you something you know Carter went over there and from Dublin came coming over there and he ... he not only just disrupted\nHe just started a lot of fighters there I Believe that this but kitchen corner guy deserved and that little thing that could be get afterwards while you deserve that to corner I'm Sorry if I'm Crazy but that's how I feel\nNow at Tom thanks for calling you don't sound crazy or you know in my ... I always hear this from a few people when something bad happens in the sport is this is just a bad thing for for the ... or like you know when counter through the Dolly through a you know for that but\nIt's just a bad thing for you guys it's just a bad thing for you if see its publicity\nThis is what's going to be talked about so you know for for them for ... for Congress getting is justice\nYou guys it's just a bad thing for you see it's publicity so\nThis is what's going to be talked about so you know for for them for ... for Congress getting is just deserved some people might feel that that that this was just\nUm but in reality I mean they're just making the sport more publicized they really are ... and and some people are gonna sit here and say that was a planned thing this whole thing was planned between Connor and could be to get this night to what it was\nYou know and and people can say is planned out well listen I don't think any of the plant out but whatever they're succeeding and making this a big big fight number two I think that this is going to have to\nHappen whatever happens you have to have a number two in here\nMaybe eventually but back to this like uh the publicity good or bad publicity is still just publicity I I we kinda both agree that this is good for the casual the publicity out of the sport but my opinion is that this is really bad you know you had the humble fighter the guy who's\nA he was just soft spoken not a trash talker he doesn't drink a family man a very religious man he comes out and he smashes the quote unquote poster boy Dan is boy encounter and he could have just taken the bell and be quiet be undefeated\nUh this is bad man because like I said earlier the USC is about to go into a new age they have a one point five billion dollar deal waiting for them in January with ESPN they could this guy so marketable you don't want him to be the evil Russian that's played out man he humble chip and it was a chance for that\nIt was in ... rose ... units who is destroyed a sham rage champion ... you know ensues that she has that that that character I'll just humble I'm here for a reason and and I'm not I don't mean to talk smack to get to where I Am I'm going to just proved to you that I'm a better for you and can be for that\nWas with that type of fighter up until a twenty seconds after ... um let's let's go to David in San jose how those sharks doing but\n[laughter] oh [laughter] yeah let's start worrying about\nThem or oh okay [laughter]\nI'm a black hawks fan anyway oh disarmament applying\nUm yeah well\nIt is what it is anyway um I think that a counter losing ... can be the aside as the best thing for him I may right now\nBecause uh counters or more is a terrific loser\nOr rather eat more entertaining as a loser than he is as a winner\nRight well that that wasn't that wasn't con are are making that entertaining the after he lost out that we can be\nYeah well I mean even even if they hadn't done what he did or we're gonna see Conor over the course of the next you know however many days just I expect a\nMore Connor like stuff more so than if he had one and he's going to keep up casual interest and nocturnal lose any are diehards by whatever he does as and more so it was a loser then there's a winner\nBe ...

McGregor incubate but\nWhat do you think then give us a it was we got\n... honestly I thought it was very hard fought five by Connor man is dead or really showed along with the takedown man I thought it was going to be setting a record honestly but\nYou know after the fight man it really I think it'd be colors truly showed man and um\nI think there was a huge difference between when you look at the way Connor reacted with Joe they out and you know I mean he went out of the cage but there were no sort of altercation between besides screaming of Connor and when you look at could beat I mean he physically hand which is like\nYou know at at definitely illegal man I mean\nIt it really just really threw me off and I think that's going to be a huge topic coming up the next ... you have to say no\nNo question thanks for the call but that's one thing I keep on saying Connor every time a he finishes the fight he jumps oh it was like oh well ... when does that can be solved this winter they run out of the case they always want of the cage\nAll the time but security he's he plans to know\nCounters or an entertainer he knows where the security guards are he made sure that they're in front of him so that there's still no damage even yesterday at the pressure when he threw kick\nAt uh at at could be they made sure that that he had plenty of distance when he flew that guy that kick it could be that there was that was never going to land even him like a slap in his his hands in front of ... he was never going to lead to anything significant the fight is in the cage the rest of his\nLittle build up you know yeah I mean I I disagree with the caller from Arkansas um the fact that he it's a little hypocritical because he's saying that he he's laying his hands on people and when Connor jumps out of the cage that he doesn't hit anybody\n... through a freaking Dolly in a window and actually hit re board with glass and Michael key as to a class\nAnd Rosenbaum Eunice is now dealing with a mental repercussions from that we don't know when she's going to come back don't say that what Habib did is the worst thing in the world the guy he just thought needed to be humble great job of by a beam of you know great job inside the cage but he didn't handle it he wasn't completely humble but\nDo not say that a ... is the worst person in the world that's maybe what you see my ... the PR team that's might how they shifted the next fight you know he's a big\nBad Russian no question in and talk about more hypocrisy a we have Rick in Toronto if I can do this right I'm not doing this ... is this hypocritical Rick I don't know but could you possibly can for me because I'm not either hey I'm going there we go over the\nUm so uh if you conduct a book that I uh first of all it turns out that a heavy but not only had the uh the proper Chan\nAnd was you know dominant underground as we expected but he was also the better striker if you go back and look quite everybody's honest with themselves you was the better striker it would never in any trouble trucks and shot\nWhat didn't faze him at all he went to the ground he dominated um and then after the flight you know I think we can forgive him for that because\nBeen forgiving McGregor for everything\nYou know why\nIt was not exactly the most dire straight up character if you do your homework on Dana White Dana White should destruct his mouth now after this white because he got what he you know he wreaked what he's been showing\n[noise] they call Rick I appreciate it man uh yeah you know I listen Dana\n[noise]

reaction like this in a while we got a phone lines lit up we also have\n... you know Twitter left and right at ... people tweeting I loved it I hate it\nYou know this is the first time watching us see it was spectacular was gray\nAnd this is just unbelievable to see the reaction and like I said in the open\nWho gives a rat's ass about who won the fight\nWe're not leading with this we're not talking about this if it was just all could be made McGregor tap out it's what happened after the fight\nIs what will draw more people in the U.S he likes it or not\nAnd if the traditional likes it or not we'll find out\nBut this is now going to be talked about on all the major networks and someone that was doing a fantastic job along with his podcast partner and I felt when they were hosting a live show right here on CBS Sports radio many of these same CBS Sports radio affiliates\nAnd that the pockets it's cold outside the cage it's a great list and they get all the fighters and these guys Pete and I and I've got to known them since working here they do a tremendous job on the podcast and they bring passion you know ... sitting here during the fight\nAnd like he's losing his mind he's breathing in ways that I have never heard people grieve before he's making these noises\nAre uncovered and he's just getting so Pete and you can find on on Twitter by the way the hop WFAN and you got to be loving this stuff\nWas incredible and Zach thank you so much for having me on ... but this was\nThe night was expected to be um\nChaotic any way inside the cage but the aftermath you know there's all eyes were on than the rule of Dana ... set this up as the world is watching and the world's washed something that was that's never happened in in this uh in this format\nAs far as the the hatred for both fighters and the chaos after the fight is going to be more talked about them will happen in the cage and that's the thing to me because I said this and they open\nUsually would fight like for example the may weather McGregor by\nAnd that's the thing to me because I said this and they open\nUsually with fight like for example the may weather McGregor fight that was a bunch of hogwash lead up to now yeah what was said was not actually met\nWith these two guys they hated each other ... each other's guts but the thing for me is as someone that was just casually watching it you would have expected after the fight I'm not expect them to hug and love each other but\nYou don't go jump after someone the minute you when do your mouse guard like a ... a little baby jumbo virtually the octagon go fight someone in your guys jumping the cage and attacked the fighter it's just a total disrespect for the opponent\nNormally you you you will see the ... the respect\nThat fighters have for one another and the sport and I say there's all time these fighters I Know they're athletes and I know some people just like oh they're just they're millionaires they knock each other out of the law but they're very knowledgeable they're very smart people they have to learn many disciplines as there was one of the training that goes into it they do\nNormally but nine years yeah features to each other and they were both asked the pressure on on Thursday um if they would shake hands if they would you know ... it wasn't even there when ... was was speaking at the press or he was Fifteen twenty minutes late\nAnd can be said you know this is probably not going to be over but I'm not gonna shake his hand and Congress at this is never over they don't like each other and it proved after the fight you know normally\nFighters jumbo some fighters jump over the cage and we'll go towards whoever they're yelling at and you know cause the scene but never will they literally getting their face and started a new alter the case in front of the ... in the crowd in that doesn't happen that he was a ... charities steps in before that happened\nAnd going into this fight I said I was rooting for could be but I was sick of McGregor Zak yeah but now after the fight I Can't stand it could be because what he did and what it seems it was absolutely gutless even though things that were set were person on regular leading up to this fight when he did after the fight was gutless it's weird because you want to sit there and say he's got\nList but what happened in April was pretty bad too you know safety ... if you just take this isolated incident yeah of course ... awful and this guy is that's such a respected a fighter he doesn't fight during Ramadan because he you know because he because of of just the religious aspect of it he won't fight he won't training won't do anything\nSo he he is such a humble person it's weird or odd to see him\nUm do that you know I don't think anybody expected which is why maybe security was not ... I read that security wasn't life that they were they had everything set in place for something chaotic to happen to make sure didn't happen\nJust odd that could be will be the one to take those actions ... the lead up\nTo this from my understanding correct me if I'm wrong could be camp originally cornered wanna McGregor it's guys and that's what a vote the reaction McGregor coming in and and throwing the Dali and everything and then from all they're all hell broke\nThat was the April ... yes that's for sure I mean there's been cast for the past few years a lot a lot of these teams don't like each other and they just don't they know that they want to they're going to fight head to head eventually they don't like each other um but the April thing with a with a low balled\nAnd we're ... entire camp or you know wait cutting is one of the worst things in the sport it's it's constant debate about uh you know changing weight classes a weight limit and when you're cutting wait\nYou're kind of attempt at all times these interviews get really bad with people because they're just they're on edge they're rude they're not hydrated themselves they're they're they're not there\nYou put thirty people in front of one guy and you choke amount it's kind of a bad situation yeah that that was not good and that that definitely trickle down effect of Conor bringing his posse in in a tough to Brooklyn and causing some scenes and come in today and that's that's the trickle down effect\nTalking to Peter happen right now to ... show on CBS Sports radio so the fallout from this ah three members of can be a team who attacked McGregor in the cage posts fight had been arrested for Dana White and it's just came across by screen as well the Nevada commission is withholding beeps check\nYeah I mean that's the first I I haven't heard that I mean the ... it probably has happened before I Know we would either and I were talking about there was a dent in Henderson fight uh that that there was some chaos at the end I'm I'm sure that to be at the end of the day is going to get paid I'm sure you have to pay fines to us with the IRS Connor\nThrough with Dolly through a bus\nAnd the ... and the ... and he was arrested and he was arrested in that isn't the fact that this fight was in Vegas and not in New York and it's cheap to ah for for duty to thirty which by the way still has known main event\nThis is this is kind of the cause and effect you know this was not going to happen probably should have been UFC to thirty when Dana White goes to bed whenever he does that they're selling all this and he's looking up at the ceiling he happy if the happier he's as you know it\nOut never ask God to register that they're not never did that for the step forward and more information on October when they paid for my survey for African and within a breast cancer association and things and\nThat that'd be a JAG take you to see them eating\nLegend share live in concert in Omaha Beach I help center I may have serious concerns aren't\nHas over the top costume changes and high energy choreography to all of her friends to print\nPrice of one hundred and eighty one dollar per person includes grades decent section one twenty and the motor sounds\nDoor the W.

[noise]\nAnd I have no problem with that that of course is the voice of Dana White toddler McGregor before the fight yeah sure just seems wrong and he said things that were wrong but after the fighting denouncing wrong so we should get paid to be that eventually get paid you would think\nBy so we're told the check right now I have no problem with it because what occurred after the fight yeah it was entertaining it's great for us but\nI ... the things that shouldn't be happening they should have bay\nBut they did happen and man that was a whole lot of fun to watch Brian Campbell at Bryant Campbell CBS data right revealed the other three members of ... team that were detained by police were later released after counter McGregor chose not to press charges also Dana White here we go\nI told you he was going to act all disappointed I've been doing this for Eighteen years and the biggest ever and I\nCouldn't be more disappointed and you know may I'm usually mad at everything I'm not really mad I'm just disappointed yeah sure you're disappointed that\nYeah the what now do interviews and lie and say oh yeah it's a ... ... let's be realistic\nThe actions speak louder than what you say right now and will eventually every batch of actually see all this footage over and over and over again\nIt will be hyped up or promoted this way and you'll just tell both guys hey don't be idiots and after the fight\nYou know let things go and then you move on from there All right let's talk to you on the phone they bought by do you want to for CBS I Do appreciate you guys holding on so patiently will start things off with Adam in Phoenix, Arizona first stop on CBS Sports radio what's up at him\nAnd what the guys doing great go ahead Adam\nSo I consider myself a regular person like most of us you know some call the basement and lawyers Tito fingers but I just try to keep a realistic perspective\nWhat I'm trying to wonder is how can anybody even understand what could be then\nGregor do when they punch each other on the base and hurt each other and make a living and expect for that to happen to themselves so it's kind of ironic we ever try to place ourselves in their shoes\nWould that being said we all have Merrill's ethics and believe\nAnd we've all had friends and the people who do crazy things just to prove a point\nMaybe that would be was trying to do he just made his money and he had to prove a point or another perspective be considered McGregor shows up an invite an attack the bus due to beef with Habib\n... lawsuits against him from other UFC employees\nAnd he's still fighting making some say is fifty to a hundred million\nSo how could be I\nThink he's doing wrong\nHe's not throwing hand trucks and breaking windows\nIt's just a perspective for all of us to think about it so easy to sit from the sidelines\nBut we don't understand what any of those spiders are doing\nI'll tell you that Sunday in a white then 'cause they know white allowed this to happen as he should and he like Conor McGregor get away with what he did he said he was disappointed then we eventually saw the fight happened and guess what would this\nBe is going to get the disappointed talk you know I'm not mad I'm disappointed in yeah Habib but there'll be a rematch USC would be stupid not to have a rematch with this\nI Can't name a whole lot of fighters I've interviewed a view of the mantle\nBut there will be a rematch USC would be stupid not to have a rematch with this\nI Can't name a whole lot of fighters I interviewed a view of a man of why and you know Mr wonderful er and I interviewed Daniel\nTour me I Can't name a ton of these fighters Italian out I can name a beat back in ... and there's great reaction from this to get these ties in an octagon again let's go to Jay in central California next up CBS Sports radio morning John how are you\nHey I'm doing good I'm going to nine or getting them all out your screen my voice shots not mad chime watching them fight\nIt was talking about like first I was a good\nWhy you know I think the only around key\nDidn't fight his fight was the third I think he would just kind of catching his breath the most part he got McGregor\nOn the ground he'd wrap his legs around him McGregor didn't have an answer for it the better fighter won the fight no question bars\nYeah no question no question um but you know when that third rail macgregor was teen all want to wish you the challenge is really\nWell you know it was interesting after the second round we're McGregor gotten it handed to him\nAnd it just shows you how crazy this guy is and how they're different animals in there and why or a different way than we are and like the caller said we can relate to them McGregor after getting his brain beat in and the second round the minute when around was over he's smiling he'd smile and he's laughing going into the third round them it's unbelievable\nOh yeah but that's his game you know he wants to get because he said that he can be said before the fight and I I think you know\nNatural disagree with you or because when I looked at a bead been clearly took a lot of things personal with this and that was reflected after the fight where he didn't let it go\nBut when you add the way and and when they were looking at each other and sides in each other up\nMcGregor saying all of his stuff that he always says and how we didn't look scaring whatsoever I made that point yesterday that's why I took a bead to win the fight because he didn't show any fear at that way and he just looked at McGregor and basically he gave me a look where he said I'm going to kick your ass and you know it\nOh you're definitely right and I agree with you that I'm not saying he's gotten his head with fear he got in his head with hay and he hated the courtroom and two I Believe they were talking a lot of crap but you know talk crap yet crap so Egypt I have no problem with him jumping\nThat ring and going after their corner is just like the last caller said we're the ... on the bus window yeah and then I'll let you guys noticed this\nBut whoever that policemen was that was it rained side that man could throw some blows\n[laughter] I'll tell you the security you know it's ridiculous that you don't somehow these fighters got away 'cause usually you have you guys I Know like you put a security guard in front of me hold me back to the security guards you know this stuff going down\nAnd then the next thing you know all the security jumps out of the ring due to separate uh be men and whoever he was going after McGregor camp and they eventually did that but then macgregor was left a vulnerable than to go to these guys jumped in it was absolutely wild but\nIf you have a hard one or the

which led to a rats were kind of McGregor that could be ... and his team at something mind after the fight happened 'cause I don't think right when the fight ends\nConvenes initial reaction is to just jump out of the cage and I'll jump out of the act the gun and start finding people I think that's something he was thinking about\nI don't think that is just something that it was oh have fights over let me go kick someone that no I think he was thinking about that and that was brewing in marinating for awhile and his team jumping into the cage I don't think is an immediate reaction oh well this was going on so let's get our ... you know I think there were thoughts about this\nLead it into the fight and then once the fight and that they had something in mind that something with the plant so let's go to Alex in Detroit will talk to him next on CBS Sports radio what's up Alex\nHey how's it going doing great go ahead\nI'm man I Know I just like everybody starts at all or I'd be hard to

one of our or other brothers or to the fight for Ninety nine or ... or you know like a pyramid like and and long time and I never ... nothing like that the thing that blew my mind that we're very like

the show and just takes that college football college football college football I appreciate you hanging with us 'cause we will get to the college football and just a minute or two but we're still\nReacting from this could be McGregor aftermath and that's why we spent the first hour and twenty three minutes on it because it carries that it's been such a\nIncredible thing to see right after a fight and it was it was really remarkable assemble evil ball with what went down and my plans to go out into the show wasn't the lead with that uh I ever thought he'd mentioned the the show at like a a you know at a three forty I Am eastern bring it up and talk about the the big result but\nHey sometimes things happen that you don't expect to happen and that's why it's been something that carry in the aftermath of following the fight in Las Vegas let me get brown back up in Boston as his phone line was absolutely terrible in the last segment but hopefully be clear things up when we get here brown right now\nIs that ratio thank you appreciate it go ahead\nAnd you know two months ago you heard a may whether our mayor was talking about how great Conor McGregor was so they're trying to set up a second fight with them right was wasn't going to go because they didn't want him to uh protect the ... the title shot\nYeah but I don't want to see honestly I don't want to see whether McGregor again I I don't think it was it was a better by then I thought it was going to be I don't think it would have the same juice this time around as it did the first time whereas this could be a McGregor thing would have juice the second time around\nNot that people think male McGregor would come back and when it's because of what happened after the fight\nRight but but a man he aimed his back in Russian mafia guys and tough tough guy Levin oh ... ... bunch of my friends that are in and then they thought that it kinda would lose and uh\nAnd he ended up being and um but it was just that ah you know that's how it was set up and uh he beat them through a I think a monkey wrench into\nThat thing with a second fight with McGregor is that's why I think the Russian guys looking forward to that that's where the big money is a hundred million two hundred million dollars was it was the money's going to be there or not but\nI mean the kid the kid just beat them you know\nYeah I did beat him and he was the better fighter and I thought that was going to be the case go with it I ... the\nPhone call okay let's get to the college football and we're going out to the two segments on this because there's a whole lot of reaction from the college football yesterday let's start with the most entertaining game that was Texas and Oklahoma cotton bowl it was forty five to twenty four\nAnd when Oklahoma's traveling taxes by Twenty one I'm thinking turn out the lights the party's over Texas is going to win the football game out east and I'm Still thinking that in the fourth quarter when\nThere's ten minutes supply in Texas is still up by Twenty one and I'm Still thinking that it's we're approaching the ... minute mark\nAnd Texas is still up by Twenty one\nBut then this is way out of college football\nIt changes in a snap the finger\nAnd in a few plays Oklahoma who's seen the dead in his over match this could be\nFinds a way to get back into the football game and not only get back into the football game but at one point tired so they got to touch down to cut it down to fourteen then they make a stop defensively which Oklahoma\nStruggle to make stop but when it mattered up until the final dry they made the stop that they needed to\nThen Tyler Murray after the stop after they forced upon calamari goes through sixty seven yards\nAnd I know people say all the time oh we want the NC double a or football video game back I'm watching that won't happen on saying\nThis is a video game the speed on that kid was unbelievable it was great I thought I was playing now editor NC double a\nCause I I I thought the the guy that was control the television on what the channel the game was on was the first president effect but we're bonding because the way that he was just it was so quick so energetic and it was so lightening fast so he gets the touchdown that cut that down to seven\nOklahoma forces another point from Texas\nAnd then they got a touchdown and tied the game so when they go down and they cut it for Twenty one to fourteen from down fourteen and on it took four plays to make a fourteen point ... percent go to a tie game\nThat says no way that you come back in a situation like that but limited time as yet they don't big place and down the stretch Oklahoma was able to hit on the big place to get back into the football game\nBut it doesn't it and then I Would have wanted the game went over time but the beauty of college football is someone you're not talking about before the game ends up becoming a big story because before the game or talking about Tom Herman\nBefore the game or talking about Lincoln Reilly before the game or talking about saying I'll injure before the game or talking about ... who was talking about Kamron decker\nWas talking about and that kind of get gr\nAnd wants when Oklahoma\nHas a Twenty one point deficit go away and they come back to the game hooked on Texas was wasn't that football game even if you're in Texas than when you blow that lead did you think you were winning the game\nAnd there's no way you had a feeling of just a big not in your stomach saying oh they just one of the lead it's not going to happen we're going to lose in overtime\nBut Texas was able to block out that noise Texas was able to march down the field and then declaring the kicker hit say forty yard field goal and this is a freshman kicker how many times in college football do we sit\nThere and say never trust characters never trust characters you know just that's Kentucky for crying out loud and this kid\nStepped up on the big stage and drills the forty are ... so that came with everything you wanted and the college football game Allen germ was tremendous titled Murray bounced back after a really bad bumble and he was great

clients in that are very good but like I said yesterday and like I've been saying for the last two weeks I'm not paying them more on that picks against Alabama until they go out and\nIf they go down I think it's going to be a game where it's in the college football playoff if they go down I don't see them going down in the regular season I just don't and things can happen in things you'd be unexpected but until Alabama goes down I'm not believing in this year and then one more game I Want to get to\nState Ann Arbor I'd been critical\nAbout Mississippi State 'cause the teams they beat the

jet team that has a rookie quarterback who's good but I don't want to throw the football too or get time to throw the football to you need to dominate with your defense in that case keen I'm\nQuite turnover free football that's what it is for the Denver Broncos you should be the jets who don't have an identity this year and has a coach who punch bowl late in the game or when he down\nBy more than double digits is elected to kick field goal to try to make up ... points when he needs to make a big point late in the game so top bulls right now not a good coach\nAnd the Broncos should be able to take advantage of the J. G. S. yet jets jets the jets or at home plate the ... stadium at the jets are able to play from in front the Broncos can't let them play from in front the Broncos are the better team and the match up Packers in line\nThis is a game where the lions the last two weeks they beat the bats\nAnd then this was the lions team that you played Dallas and when you play Dallas you'd take a score late I Believe it was golden Tate and then you let back hook up with the ... before the game on a field goal\nLions I don't love them Packers I don't know what to make the Packers yet it's all about the health Rogers that I thought it was taken off the injury report\nAnd I don't know the lines are going to be able to contain Mr Rogers but they get to them make them feel uncomfortable you have a shot in the game and you have a chance to win the game just at the Redskins who were able to defeat the Packers before they're buying the Redskins from seven was cooking\nUp against the Green Bay Packers off ... Rogers giants at the Panthers\nThe science team looks is dead is dead could be\nBoth the New York football teams are just not good\nThe giants fence you can tell you want or don't see that more more touchdowns yeah you have one on the air or don't do this or don't see that safe from ... could you know should be doing this\nWhen you don't have an offensive line I mean the opposite signs up plans a level that it can or the level that you should expect it to play you're not going to be a whole lot of games the national football league\nThis the Panthers team that home just as long as Kansas and turn over the football I think they'll be fine and the Panthers they do have a good defense Panthers or just the better team\nIf the giants show up and surprised people I'll be very surprised just because the giants\nAnd they're all sense it's a mess and it's been a mess\nEven when they were eleven and five but that knack if they're going to the post season there was a mess last year so why should I pick the giants and even the giants do find a way to when\nI'm not going to be confident about the giants until they put two wins together because we saw them with the Texans when and the Texans are in a great team this year and they have no offensive line and then they were fly up against the New Orleans saints so the giants want me to\nHave the giants come back to my good graces and start talking about them in a positive way going to interrupt but before you went to in a row you got to win one and we'll see if the giants can take care of business up against the Panthers I'm just not going to believe it until I see it tightens in the bill\nThe titans are football team that a surprise a lot of people were able had been aggressive and really connected with the players we had on a Logan Ryan yesterday quarterback for the Tennessee Titans and you could tell they have a comfortable fill with their coach and they really do like what he's about these players coach will be a

now\nWhile I'm doing great too but this must be awesome call them the games are with the former teammate of yours and ... street by listening to you guys sounds pretty good so how about this experience so far\nI work in progress for I think it's been fun for us I mean we were looking to\n... quote unquote call all the perfect game and so that's where we're searching for it's always interesting to be able to talk about the game as we see it from an officer standpoint but also to be able to Philly and and just talk about a ... perspective as well I mean what's interesting is both of us\nObviously play with Drew Brees and play in that organization and all of that organization being in New Orleans so it's a interesting match up for us in the booth and uh it's a lot of fun and also the\nWell since you mentioned your this could be a big game for him because historically he could pass the all time passing yards record and also could throw first five hundred regular season touched down just about what you're able to do especially at the age of thirty nine\nI think it boils down to a couple of games and I think obviously being able to\nBe healthy is one of the key aspects of it I mean you're talking about Nineteen years in the NFL and\nFor him the way that the science obviously required him was because the chargers that grafted Philip Rivers he gets hurt in the game uh pretty much his last game and he was injured and so um he visited Miami first and most people know the story\nBut he visited Miami first an excitement and the dolphins will not pass the physical for him and so the the opposite was the ... or ... physical and the record kind of history and I think it's\nObviously you're talented player but a lot of it is is preparation as well how he prepares to go out and play and then he compete in such a high level and it's just amazing to see him be able to just do the things that he's done but these two records\nHe uh he's poised to break both of them\nLike you were saying we all know how this went down colpepper goes to the dolphins and Drew Brees winds up with the same that ends up becoming a hall of fame player back in two thousand sick the first day Drew Brees walked into your facility take me through when you met him and and what went down there\nBut actually what's interesting is I obviously met him before we were both two thousand and one drastic certain so during the circuit and you talk about some of the pre season all American teams in postseason all American teams uh you're you're talking about being drafted in the same class but what was interesting is\nThat two thousand and six year myself and he we're both rehabbing in Birmingham with Dr Andrews at the time and so\nThis was before he signed with the same so I knew room for a couple of months just you know from a rehab standpoint\nNot knowing that just a couple of months down the road that he would obviously be my quarterback and my teammates so just to see how he competed in rehab room back in Birmingham was always interesting and you just remember some of those moments and uh when he walks and he signed the deal the new deal to\nBe the quarterback in New Orleans obviously that Sean pains first year\nWe adjust drafted Reggie Bush so you see a lot of new peace is being implemented in New Orleans is post Katrina\nYou you're hoping the city comes back you're you're hoping this team\nReturns back to form at least competitive for him and uh it's just amazing right since those six\nSince you know do you get to watch him play football right now on the same radio broadcast or just tell me how many more years do you think Drew Brees is still going to be playing football for\nThat's always a tough one to answer for him he's always taking a year by year particularly the last four or five years and and enlisted probably the last two or three years my sales I sell he only has one or two years and that was three or four years ago so you\nKnow I I I'm just going to enjoy the moment you know because I don't know when this rival end but for us as fans and having the ability to call and see what he does in practice in having the ability to call the games it's just been phenomenal the watch but uh I'm going to enjoy the moment but I don't I don't know how long how much longer he can't do it at this level\nAnd whenever that does happen when drew called the quick people are going to talk about that Super Bowl and that he did deliver for the New Orleans saints is an interesting background no behind did not does involve you where you weren't playing for the same set the time and right before the playoff run\nThey bring you win and they gave me an honorary kept in just looking back at that oh what does that mean to you after all these years\nWell it's still a special moment for me and to be a actually\nA to be signed to the active roster and you know the people I was a friday when it when it was released and that happened you know the first thing that people wandered was you know do sit down and play he's going to play because if you go back and you look at it the ... loss\nBecause they had already locked up the number one seed but they had lost a three games or two games to end that sees him to bed already locked up the number one seed and so people were thinking oh this is gonna play do since\nI was in no condition to be able to go out and play particularly you know when you talk about being in football shaped but for me I told ... paying a Nikki Loma Somalis grateful for them just to be able to bring the board and\nClearly not a place to speak on it because you know it's just one game that I saw I don't know if that's been the trend for them ... year old are they just feel like hey look business who we are and you know right now will lose and I'm sure\nThey do is always a pleasure to talk to you is a lot of fun to watch you play and now you do a great job in the saints radio network outbreak called

GOP throwing those light switches on and all of a sudden it's so freeze people up I'm sure you see a lot of that it's going to be great but absolutely\nAnd the thing is most people see it over the same types of issues I did I call it the a ha moment yeah because I remember my ... years ago well\nYeah I don't understand all this but now I've got I've got here sort of the Keystone issue for me I got filling the gaps but now I really I got my my wrapped around where I Need to go\nAnd so often when I Do conferences and I'm probably even pastors who preach the gospel for years I mean I'm Talking about on fire for the lower than evangelical guys are just just so winters\nBut there's just one or two pieces I never really thought about before us or not that I'm some great orator I don't mean it that way but some of the things that has affected me are the things that really where my mom was when I talk about those in seminars sometimes they'll go\nOkay now I really get how to connect a and B yes there were just certain things that they just never hands theater and I understand and they go man now I really understand I understand why this is important\nOne of the things that I see over and over again an a ha moment that happens or in Christianity are for people buy some time to say but don't really understand what they have and we're the others will say don't well as long as you believe in God that's all my manners and they say well how do I answer back to that\nAh I tell them that the Bible says Jesus is the way and but that doesn't seem to have any power to her and I'll say it may be true or\nWhat you tell them but it doesn't have much power to him because it doesn't assist the ability to reason well then it's not fake and I say the lesson who you're talking to probably doesn't have safe you have to give them a reason to have faith they're fighting it they they don't want to be stupid they don't want to just swallow anything I always tell people\nGo ability\nIs a counterfeit\nIt it looks right many people are out there thinking they have faith and all they are as normal they're swallowing untruths that seem to line up with the scriptures and everything else but deep down to really really not correct so I look at the righteousness of Jesus Christ I say it's pretty simple why nobody else\nCan be the way my hammock can't be the way because she never lived a perfect life there's no other human being on earth that lived that perfect life how can we get the righteousness from somebody that wasn't rice just when we think of righteousness Tommy I think we thank goodness\nBut they're just gonna say God was talking about the righteousness that Jesus talks about his perfection she just said there are none righteous about God and there was not good but the odds and ends so to me that's an a ha moment for a lot of people when they say oh well now I see what Jesus as the only way because\nHe's the only one event led the perfect life 'cause I Can't give us something that Jesus didn't hand in his perfect life was the culmination of that righteousness that could be given to us and\nAnd people understand that and as I listen to this I think our listeners lesson in in the here and they say oh my goodness I've never thought about it this way I never looked at it this way\nThey don't want to fight it and even as Christians they don't want to fight it but they don't know how to conduct and be like you said\nAnd they don't want to be gullible right they don't want to be going all they want to truly under stand properly even as I sit and listen to you\nAnd and when my own self through the years I've had questions in the majority of those have been answered but like the gap theory\nThat's always remained a little vague to me because I you know couldn't quite fella or the carbon dating sometimes OK so who doesn't really know\nAnd and as you and I both know many times there isn't necessarily an answer when I look at phone soccer a big shock to me in the Bible it doesn't matter it's incorrect what people are saying just because the scientist says something doesn't mean it was true scientifically ... is that correct\nAnd we call those racial characteristic they should really more actually been called ethnic or cultural characteristics because all people are the same race the human race uh-huh\nSo you look at different people groups you could explain how we get the different groups of physical characteristics just based on the dispersion of the tower Bible but it's not because they're different races we just have different you know I say populations of cute\nDevelop a these characters because of multiple generations you know reproducing within those same groups\nI don't like to play the devil's advocate on him and it's not what I Want to do here a month you will have people that will come back and ask your question [noise] okay so we have a different people groups and and there was they they so called\nAdapted to they're closer to where they were or however you know and um money if I Begin to change now you're talking about ...\nNo ... the thing is that what they change into his people\nWhat they're doing is there is no new information involved here what you're doing is you're sorting the information that's already there evolution requires new information to occur to go from the simplest one cell creature to man ... you know you ... have to increase what you're doing is you're sorting the information that's already there\nNow what you'll find you'll God put the maximum amount of genetic information you know Adam and Eve in the original created can if you will yeah so over many many generations what you have is sorting the genetic information you ... over time have we lost the variability\nNow we have the same amount of DNA but you lose certain traits you have certain information and certain people groups that sort of becomes\nWell just over time the other the preferable characteristics\nUh become predominant in certain cultures or whether it's the with humor sometimes it's a choice certain cultures have certain with is is that you know these characteristics or make the ideal husband or wife so you you have a you have a choice in choosing though so you select certain characteristics sometimes because of\nAgain you know the amount of ultraviolet so people with fair skinned can convert vitamin D ... complex but you're not generating information because chains I mean evolution is base level can just be called a change but evolution in the sense that we talk about his molecules demand evolution\nPeople to change but they changed into human because all you're doing ... information it's already there\nYou know strong ... percent of the human you're not bringing something from something negative about it\nYou're not adding anything where you're always use a different combination of genetic material to give you expression of different sets of traits\nYeah because there's so many different questions that people\nAnd these are these are legitimate questions and a and and finding the truth finding the answers are as so extremely important for us for everybody out there it is so difficult to struggle with questions that nobody will answer nothing frustrates me more as I moved along in life when I was young and they just said well you just have to believe it\nOr why do you tell me that one because it's just believe well well that's because if you don't believe you're lost [laughter]\nIt's not because of the believing magically does something magical your said because of the brief itself\nIt's what brings you to accept that struck brings you to ground if I don't believe I'm not going to act you won't act on what you don't believe in and so let's let's go back over to the beginning you told me earlier that you were Seventeen when you became born again\nOr how about sharing your customer service well\nI I just beyond that I did not grow up in a Christian home okay when I was growing up you know Cindy was just a day to lay around the house and some of my friends went to this building with the people on it and sang songs with these and ... and it and they left that Sunday after church on Sunday that you'd like everybody else the rest of the center for that I wasn't really sure what it was all about\nBut uh I was blessed to be a\nPart of a good crowd in high school or the kids that were doing a lot of running around a lot of you know a lot of the bad things that kids get into and I kept telling me to go to church with and you go to church with this guy and I thought well you know these are my best friends of ... this is going to be a nice social activity yeah and I went for a few months and all of a sudden\nI was confronted with this really difficult issue I was a center who needed a savior\nAnd it was it was something that never even crossed my thinking that I was never confronted with it for four\nHours stores they say when I was Seventeen are certainly won't take understood all of it at that age are good for us but uh I mean it was a genuine conversion and uh I remember even my friends were thinking you're Tommy's never been to church but he's really seriously involved in this now out of it and\nIt was it was kind of an interesting time in my life as as you understand but then it was right after that I was off to college and that was confronted with evolution uh-huh and that's where a lot of my ... even though I was saved a lot of my struggles began sure under man and a\nYou know even at that point I knew that uh you know I wanted a hoping to go to medical school or have a nice thing about what am I I wanted my kids\nTo be raised a Christian home that's always been on my heart since Seventeen I Want my children to grow up in a Christian home and that's why when I when I got to medical school and got in my practice and\nMy wife and I was talking about when you know we want to start a family my first thought is I Want to be the Christian\nDad that I'd ever had a um I Will add this my father got saved they Seventy six really which are which are primary offering landlord a man but you know I wanted my kids to grow up in a home or God was honored and\nChrist was put at the forefront and you know where you are but in church and active and participating and ah I warned in the novel lord and uh all three of my children came across as an early age and\nI've already been blessed my oldest two dollars from on the mission field now but\nI wanted him to have the environment I didn't have children\nSo you weren't brain works as a child\nNo I was reading the child\nAh our remember uh when I was you know seven eight nine they would take me off to my grandmother's house for a week every summer sure and against all the odds that you could imagine it was always the wake of vacation Bible school huh and you always need a vacation Bible school I always remember\nFeeling abandoned because I didn't know what I was doing in this building I was a different time with people that weren't my friends my grandmother drop me off and I've I've got to say as I look back that was one of the sort of\nI'm really not sure I'm going to like church ideas are and\nThe funny thing is ... years later my wife and I are both very much involved in teaching vacation Bible school and and\nBecame a joy for us at that point but ah yeah I'm not sure that they're not a thousand other people you could talk to\nA they'd be the same sort of testimony but as I look back I can see the lord working in my life even when I was younger teenager because I struggle with issues of spirituality and wondered about God and fly to my friends go to church and found is this really important and\nAnd I didn't really understand how to ask the right question tests [noise]\nYou've been listening to author and vital teacher bill segment and answers in genesis Dr Tommy Mitchell here on principles for a living thanks

[noise]\nFrom the W. J. G. news talk\nNewsroom and your bombers brought studio good morning I'm Doug Scott\nThe rescue prison officials say to staff members of the state prison that Lincoln had been hurt in separate incidents involving inmates sources report that the first incident happened October second when an inmate attack staff members trying to stop him from opening a secure door\nPath to get them on the honor roll past this is really critical that you don't burn them out\nRight and kids are feeling more pressure than they ever what's a good thing for a mom and dad to think about that a little healthier perspective that way that it's healthy to have idle time it is absolutely healthy to have I ever growing up ... times horrible idle times horrible but actually some downtime is really\nCritical yes and to pay attention I mean it's what you were saying what are you noticing and your child and they're going to tell you that there ever stimulated but it's often get to be and that's one of the things I was kind of going towards the things out of it comes out of anger\nTypically for girls and boys and so you will see they're going to respond in a Baker weight in the situation warrants and that's when you know something was happening and how can that kind of died down and figure out what it is\nThat's good advice I liked the boys and girls develop differently obviously the culture especially the elite culture wants to kind of dumb that down that we're all the same that it's just a matter of imports and society that cast those kind of but science is pretty straight on this our brain chemistry is different\nThe processes in which our brain a sinks and responds to outside stimulation is different describe for us those differences between boy and girl development\nIn terms of emotional development a great example would be that she will have a more expansive vocabulary period\nSo she's going to have a more expensive as it is true yeah and I'll take them out or\nWe can take all the females that she has more words she has more vocabulary so her ability to express to articulate hurts me is going to be advanced because she's got more words to work with\nAnd in addition to that one of the things we know to be true as she is advanced abilities in terms of reading the emotions on other so she's habitable you going to be ahead of him oftentimes not always are certainly exceptions to the rule\nBut ahead of him in terms of empathy because she has advanced skills in terms of understanding what's going on inside of another person yeah there are two examples right there where the\n... and that's a good one to girls being a verbal more verbal typically the boys struggle with expression and when you talk about an emotional vocabulary how do you help boy what age\nShould a parent begin to help a boy become more capable in their vocabulary to express their emotions\nRecommend early on from one year on be using a feelings chart and and it's the starting point that when we were used\nOcean all words with them were referencing a chart and just pointing felt sad today and I because I think I heard a friend's feeling I felt embarrassed today that dads are talking in front of voices say I felt embarrassed today I had to give a presentation to the board of directors and I didn't feel prepared\nThat those words are landing on kids and I would say for boys they're seeing that emotions reside in the life of a man that's what it looks like\nAnd for the listener who may not be grabbing what we're talking about social typical charts that have a happy face and angry face and you have your child point to what they're feeling if they can verbal express it and then hopefully down the line there'll be able to verbalize it like you said that's what we're talking about\nAn end to understand accurately what's going on left to his own devices you on this with teenage boys you know their feelings chart would include boarding annoyed\nThat is [laughter] pretty much yeah we've got to help them figure out what's underneath what's really\nGoing on and so they knew and figure out where there are so many cultural influences that seemed to say guys don't feel or guys are angry what kind of two extremes right yes\nAnd we are quick to push into that may have to say it's not that girls have more feelings she just has more a vocabulary she's\nBetter ability to articulate those things so that's why we have to labor a little longer I Love your work concentration concentrate on that space with boys that we've got a labor longer in that space so that he developed an emotional vocabulary and\nWe talk about how these mountains build on each other parents are so quick to want to go to I Want my kids to figure out how not to melt down and want them to figure out how to work through frustration better and that's an important objective but if they don't even know what they're feeling like that's the foundational building block that's why we start with ... we've got to figure out\nWhy does it then I'm feeling so that I can then figure out what to do with it\nSo you have all these um obstacles and the culture in in the home and in your make up your personality or gender plays a role in that how do you begin to counteract those to um work with it I guess would be a better way to say it and provide building blocks\nOr that the child like the emotional chart how are you feeling today let's move that up to five years old when they are a little more capable of expressing themselves a sissy with a little five year old girl what are we going to do\nWell and it's interesting 'cause boys have a hard time expressing which is our first mouse that in perspective as a second one which would really be regulating and that's where the struggle more as in the regulating of their medicine because there's so much more aware of it and and I've started one of our building blocks that we talk about that\nActually born out of counseling with girls I've started doing something called a scale where you know we think about emotions on the one to ten scale and you all know having children yourself some of them just lean toward ten on everything sadness anger embarrassment worry that they live at ten and and because I work primarily with girls I call it a try it on on the air\nAnd monitor yeah I I could use one of those yet [laughter]\nAnd so what I Will do with families is in a calmer moment for a child who live that tend to have the parents say to them tell me what it would be on your scale you know what's the saddest are the worst or the scariest thing you can imagine happening\nAnd said they name that early on and just like we're talking about naming our feelings and then when the child gets in the car and says this is the worst thing I've ever had in my whole life\nYou can say gosh that sounds really hard because we always want to start with empathy that sounds really hard to tell me what number you think it was on your scale and then that some automatic perspective that that child in particular doesn't have\nTo say I don't want to let go of this because again in your book the stumbling blocks that you identify for girls in addition to the one you just mentioned like the pressure to please yeah that's a big one at a the pressure to perform and the need for control\nI mean I I most women listening right now are going yes I still struggle with struggle with those things 'cause that and again it's not to this merger demeaned this is just wiring issues you know and this happens\nAnd that's such a big part of it because I think as we talk about the net it components that from the earliest stages girls are kind of defined themselves against the backdrop of relationship and said that need to please come out of that is born how do we\nEquip our daughters and at what age and again I Want to move kind of the age continuing if you can carry it all the way through from a three or four year old up to sixteen Seventeen year old\nHow do we give our girls equip them to avoid the pressure to please that if you can achieve that as a parent in your girls that is a milestone in a city that is an incredible achievement how would you go about that just take us all the way through\nOne of the things I talk with parents of girls of all ages about is a combination of kindness and strength and how often we lean towards one or the other that we either just\nDon't have a voice at all and so we don't ever stand up for them to ourselves themselves or were really strong and we have these strong boundaries and were unkind and the Mets did that and so\nTeaching girls from the earliest stages to say things like\nI Want to play with you but not when you treat me like that you know how different for a woman that my adult relationships would be if I learned how to act more at ten or at fourteen what that looks like in a friendship I Wanna be your friend I I'm not going to continue to hang out with you when you're posting like that about me on social media are when you're relating to me and\nThat really is the strength to be able to say that they feel safe on their way to the adult express how give me a practical example of how you would do that at age eight\nAre you taking your daughter's side if you observe something and say hunting here's a better way to handle that or if she comes to you in tears because she was overrun by a friend gave me an example of how that you play\nOn our magic formula we get over and over our empathy and questions that sounds really hard what do you want to do about that what do you think would help where it's her voice trying to say this is what's going to make a difference and were empowering her rather than when we say I want you to go right back after and you tell her\nShe doesn't get to tell you then all of a sudden we're saying you can't figure it out I'm going to tell you what you need to say if you don't have it inside of you that's really credit we want her to feel like she's got it\nAnd that really is true all the way along that continuum hog the age was at the same question let me let me ask you this David when it comes to the boy side of that you know these things that we just expressed the pressure to please the pressure to perform the need for control\nWhat's early in a boy's development that we'd be similar to those things but more boyish\nOne of the first and biggest obstacles for boys is going to be\nHis hardware and we're kind of back to those differences and I talk early on about how emotions for a boy have a lot of physicality to them so it was white toddler age boys are so prone to\nBiting kicking screaming teenage boys are so prone to punch in a hole through a wall yelling moving toward disrespect and so part of what I Love to do with boys and parents are boys is helping them understand that's a normal part of how God hardwired you like you need an outlet to channel that intensity that physicality so with\nToddler age voice for example I have twin boys one of my sons were three years of age we we purchased one of those Bozo Bopp it's like an inflatable something was saying in the bottom or you could punch ... felt that it was\nOur rest in a changing world based on some sixty to the opening words of salt I'm sixty two are for God alone my soul away\nSt John Lutheran when GPS ministry that's

the problem playing the violin but can do it now even better than anybody else [laughter] great story virtually no one would ask you wind up to date on with like an update or on the stimulation of the spinal cord and patients who've been been paralyzed\nAnd potentially a can get some return to function\nYes you know this is another technology that we've been working on here at the Mayo Clinic for about four years now a within growing this pro program slowly and I'm I'm very happy to report that this is another technology that is emerging to be very powerful\nIn addition it is also allowing us some interesting understanding of how ... control of movement happens that what that means is how does the brain control our limbs voluntarily so this is a finding that was just reported in nature medicine\nYes that that that's correct so maybe I can tell you a little bit of background on this so\nAbout four years ago that the ... or ten and efforts to see how come I had 'em published a paper very interesting paper where they implanted patients at that time about four patients where\n... simulation below the level of the spinal cord injury could cause a voluntary movement back in the lower extremities\nAn epidural means ah\nAbove the Dora ...\nIs the outer coating the around the spinal\nThat's correct yeah so this is technology that is essentially the same as what we use for our pain patients under the skin but outside of the spinal cord\nOutside of the spinal cord but just outside of the covering up the spy okay okay so these are actually surgical implants and what's been demonstrated with these devices and pain patients\nIs that they can help with pain so this is already approved by the FDA for pain that what that for ... and ... group that was too now apply this technology and spinal cord injured patients who've been paralyzed for example with a thoracic were\nUm childcare has level complete motor and sense re meaning they can't move their legs or sense there is no sensation\nSo when that paper came out that you can get movements we were very excited about it because this really changes our whole view of what we can do for our spinal cord injury patients\nSo we'd teamed up with Dr ... group and decided tend to replicate those studies and so initially the goal of this study which is male I already approved investigation though of review board approved as well as the U.S FDA\nTo do this study and so we've implanted now to patients under this study and this paper that is um ... being reported in nature medicine\nDemonstrates that indeed but was found was true but we actually went beyond that replication so the replication portion of it we actually already published than male clinic\nIt was true but we actually went beyond that replication so the reputation portion of it we actually already published than male clinic proceedings last year and this was really exciting because our results come from the findings of type of Suzie how come out and register ten\nSo that was exciting but what we discovered is that we could actually go beyond that finding and in this paper while we demonstrate is that the patient and now is able to stand\nAnd take independence that now he's still requires a Walker because he has no sensation still but he is strong enough now to to control his legs and make movements are stepping movements\nAt is an incredible story no when the word gets out as an every paraplegic in the country going to want this\nWell you know this is still very early stage research like I said this is only\nOne patient that we have reported in nature and medicine and so what I Would say is this one study really challenges what we used to think what is possible for treatment of patients with spinal cord injury but\nYou know as a neurosurgeon I often see these patients and emergency room after the trauma and you can imagine how devastating such an injury is but I think what our study shows is that there is this tremendous hope\nAnd being able to regain some of that function so you you're regaining function but you're not able to cure\nOr fix the fact that they are comparable\nEgypt yes now what is really interesting about this study is that the patient is actually able to control his legs again wow and that's why this is such a powerful study and I believe why the reviewers and nature medicine which is one of the\nTop journals in medicine I'm accepted this publication\nSo let me ask you if if someone comes into the emergency room and they have cut an or in the armor their leg we can show it back together and they get at least some return to function why is it that the spinal cord seemed to have no ability whatever to repair\nSo you know that's an excellent question and we believe the reason is because while the nerve those are peripheral nerves and we know that those performing arts can wreak world but the spinal cord is our central nervous system and unfortunately with central nervous system when that system is cut them those nerves to not ...\nWhat we believe in this case though is that the question then is how the information from the brain that wants to move the leg\nRegained that function mhm we do not believe that the nurse has ... I we do not think that's how this works but rather that during the trauma there's probably enough connections that are not functioning enough but that epidural stimulation allows these cells dormant\nTo be able to once again we gain its ability to get the command from the brain\nIncredible ... do you hope and suspect that some day people who are paraplegic or even quadruple let's give a paraplegic right now the lower extremities paralyzed will someday be able to walk\nThat's precisely what this patient did\nThat we have reported in um in nature medicine\nWhere his research headed you know I I think now this is opening up a whole new direction and research for spinal cord injury you know before\nThere's been tremendous amount of research effort and funding that went into trying to re grow those axons now what I think will happen is that the research will be in these type of new devices how do we now take this finding\nWhich used a device that wasn't even intended for this purpose now all of the things that we have discovered in this study how then can we take that\nTake a step back and re engineered the device specifically for this purpose of ... animation in spinal cord injured patients\nDoes there have to be a different type of approval by the FDA for this absolutely okay and the ... and that's why I think we are indeed very early infant stages of this technology incredible story\nAll right ... he is a neurosurgeon and director of Mayo clinic's neural engineering laboratory thanks so much for being with us thank you citing exciting stuff\nTo them send him order out put to the muscles\nSo does this type of therapy continue indefinitely for the patient\nSo we quickly realized that you know you can't have epidural electrical stimulation without physical therapy we feel they're both in are going to this type of recovery so we know it's really important\nTo you but you can put the implanted in but that it won't do any good if you don't have this era\nWe that's our theory that has yet to be proven as well but um well we know physical therapy itself wasn't dancer so we had the implant and we added the therapy in the nation together and we got these miraculous result\nUm what goes on from here is a little tricky because number one like I said this is not the standard of care for someone who has a completely I'm a severe spinal cord injury so to be able to send this individual out to the clinic now without the standard of care will be tricky because our clinicians don't know how to manage to save me later\nIn conjunction with a therapy which we feels really really valuable\nSo where's the point with this trial where we're really trying to integrate the home exercise program identify an activity that have been really proven safe impossible for the individual to do on their own at home with some minimal assisted devices\nAnd then let them do that stuff at home on their own um and then and then it it's our job to figure out you know who is this appropriate when is it appropriate if it is appropriate and how to implement into standard of care\nSo how many patients who have had the same year later now are are presently going through the therapy and ... what are the things that they're actually able to do that they couldn't do before\nThere were on our second subject right now are patients so even wrote to 'em we have some research funding to hopefully continue into a new protocol that will be very similar but will allow us to enroll additional subjects\nI'm right now the subject I'm the first subject is able to um you know stand alone for a long period of time he's able to um in wheelchair bound before yes\nHe's able to walk 'em or independently stepped on a treadmill and also over ground with a Walker so he has some assistance obviously to help him you know their weight on his legs but he's able to um\nAs Megan described volition ally and move his legs when he wants so on command so that's really the exciting part is is where where we can go from here now to improve bladder and ball function for him we've\nHad some anecdotal improvements although um we didn't measured those things directly so I'm at this point um our next studies were going to do more\nUm data collection which we hope will help inform whether there's actual return of of bowing bladder um but they do report I'm kind of a shorter bell on time so that's a good\nThing and we just don't have evidence that you're working with a second patient is it's very similar to what the first patient was or a note to patients the same [laughter] no two patients and\nSo how do we go from one or two individuals to millions because we know there are somewhere between five and six million people out there who have the spinal cord injuries maybe not complete partial ... out of wherever we go from here how can we get\nThis technology to marry for five million we ask [laughter] so I think\nMegan alluded to this earlier and we've probably both looted too you know one thing we need is obviously\nTo gain additional research support money to do this work and to keep this team moving forward I think one of the other critical questions is you know which patients will respond to this therapy and which ones will not so can we come up with a way\nOf saying you know out of the millions of patience you know the these people will respond in these won't so that we don't try to deliver a therapy that's not going to be a successful\nFinally do you believe that someday paralysis won't be permanent for all patients\nWell we're definitely making a term because we used to just talk about how do we compensate for the deficit their existing for this population and now we're talking about how do we recover and how do we make neural plasticity occur in the central nervous system so\nWe're definitely making a change and the progress of how we're managing and dealing and spinal cord injuries but there's still a lot of work to be done\nWhere you've made so much progress sold so far and there's like citing technology and both of such great work and we wish you the very best of luck thank you [noise]\nWe've been talking about spinal cord stimulation the role of rehabilitation without the Christians out from the Mayo Clinic assist everyone restores the technology laboratory this oppressive [laughter] and they are

Senator Graham pointed out he had the less is twenty five twenty six or judges that are all members of the courts of appeal or this is a state Supreme courts I I'm not\nAsking you but I mean my guess is that you and Chuck Schumer and a lot of Democrats which I'm not a single person on that list is a member of the judicial mainstream\nSo Chris the way it should go away the former presidents have done they developed a list not an outside group\nThey're the ones who developed the list and yes they do talk to the members of the Senate before they make the nomination and try to narrow the list to one that will be more acceptable or among the United states senators that that's how the process that one what brought up almost press any talk to both Democrats or Republicans on the Judiciary Committee before he made\nHis his announced that that's the way the process should go you don't take it outside list by an outside group but haven't\nRepublicans been less political about Supreme Court confirmations than Democrats I Want to put some statistics up on the screen take a look at how many yes felt democratic nominees have gotten since Bill Clinton\n... these are the Democrats appointed by Clinton and Obama from Ginsberg what Ninety six votes to Kagan was sixty three now take a look at the Republican nominees by Bush forty three and now President Trump from Roberts with Seventy eight to Kavanaugh\nWith fifty ... Senate Democrats have been much less likely to cross the island vote for a Republican nominee than Republicans have been to vote for democratic nominee\nBut let me also point out that even though some of those ... sixty ... the filibuster was not used in told Judge Gorsuch to change the number from sixty to fifty that put us in different quarters so the change that Senator McConnell made to rules when the Supreme Court really caused us to be much more partisan in this such where there aren't as\nYou guys did a person twenty Thirteen not for the Supreme Court but for a lower court judges and we saw it may not know\nHands that are really great way to go back and forth of course the Republicans blocked President Obama for putting anyone on the court of appeals on the district so we can go back and forth here my point is is we need to have a president who will consult with Congress the United States Senate\nBefore he makes those nominations have an open process we're considering nominees not restrict himself to the federal ... why should how\nBig an issue do you think this will be in the midterms if Democrats have already been mobilized Republicans are saying you gave them a political gift by opposition and that this was going to energize Republican\nI think it's going to a boil down to our concerns about whether we are going to protect against we've made in health care or preexisting conditions where we are concerned about the more investigation being interfering with I think yes constitutional rights of women are those issues are going to be on the ballot in mid term and judge Kavanaugh underscores those issues senator\nCardin thank you thanks for coming and always a pleasure to talk with you sir objects Kavanaugh's confirmation is a big victory for conservatives but will there be allows fan costs to Congress and the court will bring in our Sunday group to discuss the fallout next [noise]\nHere's a special message for those who owe the IRA should at least ten thousand or more in back taxes the IRS has special programs in place that could eliminate or reduce your tax dead by thousands of dollars\nA call the federal tax management help line that has been set up for you eight hundred to three three eighty five forty\nDumped the wage garnishment celebrities and tax liens now once you've qualified and enroll the IRS will stop all the collection activities against you these unique programs have been allocated to help the economy and significantly reduce or eliminate your tax burden the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements and other favorable programs\nYou may qualify for substantial savings so get the help you need if\nYou owe more than ten thousand in taxes call for free information and to see if you qualify take down the number now for the federal tax management hotline eight hundred to three three eighty five forty that's eight hundred to three three eighty five forty eight hundred to three three eighty five forty\nNews talk W.

Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and it's time now for our Sunday group Josh home Senator Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff\nEnergized Republican voters I Want to take a look at a polling let's put it up\nIn a full on July Seventy eight percent of Democrats or the November elections are quote very important compared to sixty eight percent of Republicans\nBut in a new poll about ten point intensity or enthusiasm gap as now shrunk to two points eighty two percent for Democrats eighty percent for Republicans what is it about the Kavanaugh confirmation process that you like as mobilize your voters\nI think it's been a combination of things that Democrats have doubled down on resistant obstruct the past two years but this has brought all of that to the forefront with the protests\nAt the interruptions during the hearings and now with the smear campaign of judge Kavanaugh holding these allegations back towards to the eleventh hour I think Republicans have woken up and said listen it's a very clear choice do we want ... resist obstruct a lay\nA dysfunction in Washington and and they're also seen the results three point seven percent unemployment for a million new jobs in this country so it's a pretty clear choice between which party is delivering and which party it's obstructed\nSome analysts say that this new energy of the\nSouthern comical to political gift of the capital case or it will help you more in Senate races in state races statewide races that it will in house races particularly in suburban districts let me put this\nUp on the screen in a recent Quinnipiac poll when voters were out the generic ballot question who do you back in your house district\nForty nine percent said the Democratic candidate while forty two percent said the Republican so it's still plot southern for the Democrats is the capital bumped if there is any plane differently and house and Senate races\nIt's not it's helping across the board and house and Senate races were saying that you that generic ballot has narrowed it was double digits now it's at seven but I'm looking at every race across the country about thirty that are within the margin of error certainly districts where Hillary Clinton one way of Republican incumbents\nAre jobs to turn out our base first army base is completely energized right now and the Kavanaugh hearings have just highlighted how important this election is for them\nBut in the house races we also see a big gender gap and again let's put up the numbers men vapor Republicans took control Congress by three points forty seven percent forty four both women back the Democratic candidates to control Congress by twenty five points fifty eight percent\nTo thirty three and won't the cabin off site where Republicans sided with the male accused over the female accuser only add to that gender gap\nRepublican sided with the process and the rule of law and the presumption of innocence that had nothing to do with male versus female they said this is our standard for our country\nA doctor for did not produce any evidence that added to her allegations nobody that she named at that party has backed up that story and Republicans have said we're not going to change the way we conduct the law in this country\nSuburban white women which I happened to be one of them educated women we looked at that and said we agree with the process and I was at a beauty salon and right after the Kavanaugh hearings and suburban Detroit where I live one of these battleground district and everyone was talking about it and they agreed with the important of the old\nShows that there is a gender gap\nThere and there was like sixteen with women at especially college educated women I'm going to these Trump rallies I've noticed in the past three I get the demographics more women are showing up than men uh we have seen and insurgents of new online donors it's coming from women and men I\nI we have to do I work with women but ... Democrats ... in a single issue voters we treat women as the whole voter they care about health care they care about the economy they recognize that for a million jobs have come back to this country they recognize\nThat a twenty five percent gap twenty five point gap between ... women view Democrats versus Republicans are well they're just being fooled by the Democrats and what it was a single or should be\nWell the single issue with the cabinet areas abortion rights I mean Democrats tried to mobilize women by saying\nA ... ... if Kavanaugh to the bench women are going to die I mean that's the type of hyperbole in rhetoric they're putting forward Susan Collins highlighted that and in their speech they want to make it about abortion rights were talking to women about the economy about health care about results that are happening that are making ...\nMaking people's lives better wages are up unemployment at a record low women our whole issue voters\nThen there is President Trump who this week went after Christine Blasey Ford at a rally let's listen to them about\nHow do you think it was I was wondering\nHow did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many\n\nDo you think that's helpful with suburban Republican women\nYou know I was what the president that day it was more about the media the media was printing stories about Brett Kavanaugh and vibrant\nAnd then I was in love\nWith the media was focusing on an ice fight with Brett Kavanaugh they were focusing on everything he had done it in the sixteen and Seventeen year old boy and they were not being fair\nAbout recognizing the inconsistencies and her testimony and to say yes she doesn't know where it was when it was who was there ... who drove for their who drove her home that is fair and why didn't the media give that the same attention that they gave to Brett Kavanaugh as they destroyed his character\nEven without the job at all\nAre there who drove around there and why didn't the media gets at the same attention that they gave to Brett Kavanaugh as they destroyed his character\nEven without the Kavanaugh confirmation which is obviously a big victory for the president this was one of the best weeks of the Trump presidency finalized\nA big trade deal with excuse me with Mexico and Canada a ... and we also saw those unemployment numbers come out on friday three point seven percent the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine is the economy still the strongest issue you have going into these midterms\nYeah we'll be putting forward I Try to voters\nAt results birth resistance are you better off than you are two years ago our jobs coming back to this country have we had to turn around is our military being factor that I found it on other

men\nBelieve he is a neurosurgeon the Mayo Clinic and we've been hearing about is deep brain stimulation\nTechniques including the patient that had the problem playing the violin but can do it now even better than anybody a great story actually now I Want to ask you we needed update on with like an update uh on\nYou stimulation of the spinal cord and patients who have been been paralyzed and potentially a can get some return to function yes you know this is another technology\nThat we've been working on here at the Mayo Clinic for about four years now a within growing this ... program slowly and I'm I'm very happy to report that this is another technology that is emerging to be very powerful\nIn addition it is also allowing us some\nInteresting understanding of how volition or control of movement happens that what that means is how does the brain control our lemons voluntarily so this is a finding that was just reported in nature medicine yes that that that's correct so maybe I can tell you a little bit of background on this so\nAbout four years ago that the Reggie accurate ten antitrust who's the hockey my had 'em published a paper very interesting paper where they\nImplanted patients at that time about four patients where at the ... simulation below the level of the spinal cord injury could cause voluntary movement back in the lower extremities\nSorry epidural means uh above the Dora soda so then the jury is the outer coating around the spinal\nThat's correct yeah so this is technology that is essentially the same as\nWhat we use for our pain patients under the skin but outside of the spinal cord outside of the spinal cord but just outside of the covering up the spy okay okay so these are actually surgical implants and what's been demonstrated with these devices and pain patients\nIs that they can help with pain so this is already approved by the FDA for pain that what that are up ... and ... group that was too now apply this technology and spinal cord injured patients who've been paralyzed for example with a thoracic were\nUm chess gas level complete motor and censoring meaning they can't move their legs or sense there's no sensation\nSo when that paper came out that you can get movements we were very excited about it because this really changes our whole view of what we can do for our spinal cord injury patients\nSo we'd teamed up with Dr Reggie ... group and decided tend to replicate those studies and so initially the all of this study which is male either be approved investigation all of review board approved as well as the U.S FDA\nTo do this study and so we've implanted now to patience under the study and this paper that has um\n... being reported in nature medicine\nDemonstrates that indeed but was found was true but we actually went beyond that replication\nSo the replication portion of it we actually already published in male clinic proceedings last year and this was really exciting because our results come from the findings of that go to Susie how come out and rich after ten\nSo that was exciting but while we discovered is that we could actually go beyond that finding and in this paper what we've demonstrated that the patient it now is able to stand\nAnd take independence steps now he's still requires a Walker because he has no sensation still but he is strong enough now to to control his legs and make movements are stepping movements\nAt is an incredible story now when the word gets out as an every paraplegic in the country going to want this\nWell you know this is still very early stage research like I said this is only\nOne patient that we have reported in nature and medicine and so what I Would say is this one study really challenges what we used to think what is possible\nFor treatment of patients with spinal cord injury\nBut you know as a neurosurgeon I often see these patients and emergency room after the trauma and you can imagine how devastating such an injury is but I think what our study shows is that there is this tremendous hope and being able to regain some of that function [laughter]\nSo you you're regaining function but you're not able to cure or fix the fact that they are ... yes\nNow what is really interesting about this study is that the patient is actually able to control his legs again\nWow and that's why this is such a powerful study and I believe why the reviewers and nature medicine which is one of the top journals in medicine I'm accepted this publication\nSo let me ask you if if someone comes into the emergency room and they have cut an or in the armor their leg we can show it back together and they get at least some return to function why is it that the spinal cord seems to have no ability whatever to repair so\nYou know that's an excellent question and we believe the reason is because while the nerve those are peripheral nerves and we know that that was profound our skin wreak world but the spinal cord is our central nervous system and unfortunately with central nervous system when that system is caught than those nurse do not require all\nWhat we believe in this case though is that the question then is how does the information from the brain that wants to move the leg\nRegained that function mhm we do not believe that the nurse has ... I we do not think that's how this works but rather that during the trauma there's probably enough connections that are not functioning enough but that epidural\nStimulation allows the cells that door meant to be able to once again we gain its ability to get the command from the brain\nIncredible ... do you hope and suspect that some day people who are paraplegic or even quadruple stickler paraplegic right now the lower extremities paralyzed will someday be able to walk\nThat's precisely what this patient did\nThat we have reported in um in nature medicine where his research headed you know I I think now this is opening up a whole new direction and research for spinal cord injury you know before there's been tremendous amount of research effort and funding that went into trying to re grow those acts on\nNow what I think will happen is that the research will be in these type of new devices how do we now take this finding which used a device that wasn't even intended for this purpose\nNow all of the things that we have discovered in this study how then can we take that\nTake a step back and re engineered the device specifically for this purpose of ... animation and spinal cord injured patients because there have to be a different type of approval by the FDA for this absolutely and the ... and that's why I think we are indeed very early infant stages of this technology\nIncredible stories All right ...\nHe is a neurosurgeon and director of male collects neural engineering laboratory thanks so much for being with us thank you citing exciting stuff thanks a lot\nStill to come a Mayo Clinic radio will learn more about the spinal cord injury research from the rehabilitation point of view\nAnd later on in the program we'll hear about the important role volunteers play at Mayo Clinic [noise]\nTo then send them motor output to the muscles\nSo does this type of therapy continue indefinitely for the patient\nSo we quickly realized that you know you can't have an epidural electrical stimulation without\nPhysical therapy we feel they're both in are going to this this type of recovery so we know it's really important\nTo see if we can put the employer it in but it won't do any good if you don't have the therapy\nWe that's our theory that has yet to be proven as well but um and we know physical therapy itself wasn't cancer so we had the implant and we added to therapy and assimilation together and we got these miraculous result\nUm what goes on from here a little tricky because number one like I said this is not the standard of care for someone who has a completely I'm a severe spinal cord injury so to be able to send this individual out to the clinic now without the standard of care will be tricky because our clinicians don't know how to manage ... later\nIn conjunction with a therapy which we feel is really really valuable\nSo we're at the point with this trial where we're really trying to integrate the home exercise program by identifying activities have been really proven safe impossible for the individual to do on their own at home with some minimal assistive devices and then let them do that stuff at home on their own\nUm and then and then it it's our job to figure out you know who this appropriate when is it appropriate if it is appropriate and how to be implemented into standard of care\nHow many patients have had to stimulate her do it are presently going through the therapy and ... what are the things that they're actually able to do that they couldn't do before\nSo we're on our second subject right now are patients so even wrote to 'em we have some research funding to hopefully continue into a new protocol that will be very similar but will allow us to enroll additional subjects\nI'm right now the subject I'm the first subject is able to um\nYou know stand alone for a long period of time he's able to um in wheelchair bound before yes um he's able to walk 'em or independently stepped on a treadmill and also over ground with a Walker\nSo he has some assistance obviously to help him you know their weight on his legs but he's able to um\nAs Megan described volition only move his legs when he wants so on command so that's really the exciting part is\nIs where ... where we can go from here now that improved bladder and ball function for him\nWe've had some anecdotal improvements although um we didn't measured those things directly so\nI'm at this point um our next studies were going to do more um data collections which we hope will help inform whether there's actual return of of bowing bladder um but they do report I'm kind of a shorter bell on time so that's a good thing\nAnd we just don't have evidence yet you're working with a second patient is it's very similar to what the first patient was or are known to patients the same [laughter] no two patients on his\nShow how do we go from one or two individuals to millions because we know there's a war between five and six million people out there who have spinal cord injuries may be a complete partial out wherever we go from here how can we get this technology moves\nTo marry for five million yes [laughter]\nSo I think Megan alluded to this earlier and we've probably both looted too you know one thing we need is obviously\nTo gain additional research support money to do this work and to keep this team moving forward but I think one of the other critical questions is you know which patients will respond to this therapy and which ones will not so can we come up with a way\nOf saying you know out of the millions of patience you know the these people will respond in these wall so that we don't try to deliver a therapy that's not going to be a successful\nFinally do you believe that some day paralysis won't be permanent for all patients\nWhile we're definitely making a term because we used to just talk about how do we compensate for the deficits that are existing for this population and now we're talking about how to recover and how do we make neural plasticity occur in the central nervous system so\nWe're definitely making a change in the progress of how we're managing and dealing with spinal cord injuries but there's still a lot of work to be done\nFor you made so much progress sold so far into the exciting\nYeah and you both in such great work and we wish you the very best of luck thank you [noise] we've been talking about spinal cord stimulation and the role of rehabilitation without the Christians out from Mayo clinic's assistive and restore

Joseph an eagle sixty three yards returns it\nAnd the Vikings I have a tendency in league with Ford fall to go here and the second quarter\nFine thank you very much into the other touchdown habit in Seattle is go out there and get the details from Kevin shocked\nHe ever is not really going according to plan for the rams who came at a certain point favorites and fell down by seven early\nAfter you're gone for red zone interception to Frank Clark on attempt to pass Seattle kept up Seventy four hour drive with a six yard touchdown run from Mike Davis LA answered quickly with fifty eight hour drive after a big return for the rams and a touchdown by tied girlie their next chance they had to go up a jerk golf found talked early on a pass\nAnd was tackled at root a touchdown initially after review went for a down at the half yard line and they were unable to score on the next plane had to settle for a field goal from Nineteen yards out\nSeattle just for the thirty nine yard touchdown pass from Russell Wilson to Tyler lock it has the lead here with nine minutes and eleven seconds left here the second quarter it's fourteen to ten Seahawks over the visiting ...\nCenter and the battle between the chargers and the raiders and the chargers pulling away quickly here is Erica Thaler\nYeah it was three three midway through the second floor of them that ... went on fire breathing under a minute left in the second quarter raider trying to get it for ... for the half it was three three as I said in the\nMiddle of rivers caught up in that we're in the last for a fifth or you're just ran down the sideline for yard for a for a touchdown he made at three and then about oh a minute and a half ago uh the chargers went on a minute ... seconds Dr\nAnd insights humid it was six place forty eight yards and I'm Melvin Gordon rented from one yard out it it can make it better than the the three rivers in a hundred and forty architects down Robert Gordon hearing Cory Gardner crack down\nAnd up and that was the one ah it's actually a forty four yard touchdown cats\nAre the charges it is Seventeen the three the raiders of trying to get them going inside thirty second ... stuff up better\n... thank you very much Aaron Geller and checking in from Kansas City is crushed inventor\nAfter the big win today Christian welcome back how are you\nI'm doing good rich thanks for having me on big game here today you know two teams that are considered really AFC or one of the top two top AFC contenders a meet up today string for a straight a lot of talk about the best off as versus the best defense\nBut that's why I play the games today and uh you know the chiefs uh start out the game you know whether it was going to be a factor of the opening of position for the jaguars they have the pomp and then punch rather and then the the skies seemed to open for the chief says the sun kind of came out a little bit in the rain slowed down and they went\nOn a Seventy three hour drive to get a Patrick homes where you are touched down to go up seven nothing it really didn't look back until the second half they let twenty or nothing and a half time so\nIt you know there was some cost of this game because of some injuries but I'm the chief student group the five uno and jaguars fall the three and two but some somehow I I I figure out Jacksonville will figure into the mix later on in the season\nPatrick moms prove these moral today with a couple of interceptions but again this one was never in doubt and against a very good Jacksonville defense or you know this team really an assertive itself today and really made a statement about ... who is right now by far the best team in the AFC\n[noise] yeah I mean obviously the chiefs are really don't have a ... point average and thirty six points a game coming into this game they put thirty on the board today they obviously had a defensive touchdown Chris Jones had that twenty yard interception return or right before the first half ... and the chief twenty or nothing or half time but when you look at the line Patrick homes\nTwenty to thirty eight three hundred and Thirteen yards touchdowns through the air and two interceptions you you know really that line not too bad when you when you consider going up against a team\nThat is you know one of the best if not the best defense last year and I felt so uh he you know due to pick a she's got to you know came right back into the forgot that second forced to follow the chief get the ball right back and then I think very next play ah he did not let the interception rattling\nConnected on a forty hour past flights Travis Kelsey and got into the Jacksonville nine\nHe did end up with a fourth of twenty three ... for a Fifteen year lost and and they had to settle for a a Harrison Butterfield go there and went up twenty three twenty three and nothing there but uh uh for all at all you know for a second year fifth game this year I think you know considering playing a tough tough defense I think he did pretty well\nOf course the wind does not come without cost and that's Laurel and hardy a suffered a broken leg today and the wind and that's going to sideline him for quite a while if not the season but you know what kind of losses that are considering how well things are going here kind of kind of ... despair it's just a bit\nWell yeah I saw I saw the effect of the game walking out on crutches and and\nThe chiefs uh I've been playing very well you know I'm I'm off into line that that you and it's been pretty consistent I'm\nYou know I I guess they're just going to have to eat the aid to read it in that office of coaching staff of the staff to find a way to fill fill that gap it's a big a big loss for the chiefs off and stuff but they've done a good job up at this point and you know I mean I Know it sounds cliche but they they that's\nKind of what you what you do next Matt up and they had to do that a lot of defense and\nThere was some defensive is read out there today to them what track at a probably played a big factor in some hamstring injuries adjusted Houston at a hamstring injury left the gay mercury a filling in for air bury\nA left the lower leg injury in our body watch a a growing injury so uh they had some injuries on defense as well so\n... really fit and especially that secondary\nTough day all around but ah

six yards rushing but the um start a game so far for the forty niners had been a while back ... years check and he's the top receiver for the niners three catches fifty six yards from the day after

David Johnson or they truly are scoring run right now Arizona keeping their own territory that can ... from their own uh five yard line daily ... forty eight to go in the second quarter\nAlright Vikings and eagles has been an interesting one of the vice just extending their leader seems so let's go to Michael along though at the link\nAnd then moments ago as Kirk cut of the touchdown pass the ad on the field and off three yards past and the the the liking of al waiting the extra point and that led by a score of sixteen the plane was led by it was a help\nAnd they ended up by are up in the past or penalty to Michael Bennett who was called for a low head on her cousin and that that kept that travel level put the ... the first and goal one player later the touchdown pass the ad on the failing the biking to the score occurred earlier also on the fence of play chart over 'em up it'll Carson west will sit\nBy Steven stepping widely a ball bounced off the air and into the arms ...

McCray them that that was way short\nSo at six seconds left the chargers have to fall back and are still up river as what big band and Bruce serving back and building was dropping the path or after

process uh we got to find a way to be a little bit more potent into an office you know we went from last week from forty two points and um got to twelve this week or so that's not any\nUh you know want to be better than that but at the same time we did when we need to do to win and that's what it all with this is truly all about defensive land up there and get things done I I thought I saw some improvement in special teams do some things that keep working at\nUm you know obviously the kick went in at the end and that's the most important thing he bounced back from the kicker earlier and I told him I said you go and we don't we don't need you later on you know you're going to make a ... force and sure enough he did so\nI'm again probably the team I'm happy for fans we play good or at

one was to make the best someplace\nAnd let the some scores the federal recovery of ... that led to it then they'll just the touchdown maternal sixty four yards and then it was a ... jai after a I'm On the second quarter\nA late in the first half or two atom feeling a a full recovery by the age that Viking the fence when the eagles at first and goal at the six\nAnd then that will lead to a twenty two yard field goal by damn mail a couple of big places that drive\nA sixty get your past play from Kurt cousins Adam fail and get them up first in ten at the um Philadelphia twenty seven now that I'm twenty seven those up all ... past the step on digs them twenty five yards\nI gave him a first than go at the second but the eagles again trying to ... trying to get something going here are they

they did to start the game on this one the big play are run by Mike Davis gives me a run by yes are run by Mike Davis\nUp the middle that ended up having Russell Wilson out blocking former head as he went down to sideline\nAh tackled for thirty seven yards of after thirty seven yards the touched down on the on the play Russell Wilson found David more the are fairly\nLittle known wide receiver for a three hour touchdown he appeared he it might have been pushed out of bounds they are referees and officials did throw down their hats but after reviewing the play the play stood and they do have that seven point lead it's twenty four seven teams Seahawks over the rams with nine forty nine left here and the third\nQuarter signing AFC West battle which really hasn't been much of one is the chargers of just increase their lead let's find out how they did it for America Keller\nIs now forty nine forty left for the chargers pulling away I think the last time I read the raiders were driving and there was a very seldom get LA that put her to go up the yard line that instead of getting hit the Mark I'm glad we're up here that or\nTheir car through over the middle and was intercepted in the end zone and find out the neighbor who brought it up or yard line\nBirth kind of LA so the charges proceeded to go on a Ninety six yard ... drive ... minutes and twenty second combination of Thirteen yard touchdown pass from rivers to fight in first grade that he was like ... or twenty three\nCharges are about to kick off of them like they're about to get another way to let something miraculous after your\nOr the raiders so again like forty two left in the ball game but it's the chargers lead over the radar for up up up up better\nOn up the coast we go to Santa Clara where Reilly August standing by cardinals with a good showing so far today against the uh forty niners here's right\nAll right rich the cardinals got the ball back another turn over by San Francisco this time though is you get that they're going back to past strip sack with a ball and then the cardinals were covered with it so now they're on the move again\nOn this current Dr ah right now John Rose and not looking too good at quarterback you ate at Seventeen for a hundred and fifty five yards and a touchdown\nFor it and as an update for you\nGames are the first half the with the age of fifty six or eight that cares for the six yards rushing but he left ankle injury and again will not return to the bathroom sixteen twenty six hundred and fifty or yard\nTouchdown and an interception but the key thing keeping or not in this game Arizona for six on third down but again the fourteenth six eight minutes to go on the third quarter\nAll right thank you very much Ryan Lee are so it's been a mixed bag of a day for Josh Rosa me as the uh Seventy five yard touchdown pass to start things off but after that it really hasn't been much for\nNOAA ninth grade on the convergence as you just heard it leaves it to not great football teams uh when Jimmy grapple game went down that compromise\nSan Francisco's a season as far as I was concerned\nAbout sixteen of twenty six hundred and fifty yards with a touchdown but also and I n T I just don't see him lifting that San Francisco up once in a special specially would breeder going out he is being a pleasant surprise for them stepping up and running very effectively they lose him got turned out for Mars\nThat San Francisco often becomes just that much more compromise\nYou know we talked about last week and I'm I'm Still not sure what the answer is other than you're just trying to get it out with CJ better to quarterback because\nYou know at this age of the game who you're going to get a you know what kind of deal you're going to make a we saw that it you know they did not expect ... to pick up the fence as easily as he did last year but you know mid season trades in the NFL you don't really see that often especially quarterbacks that to fill a void\nFoundation will help you get started and they didn't Michael J. Fox dot org slash his it then perhaps to download the new parking child participant tax free and it's available right now that's Michael J. Fox dot org slash his it didn't pack [noise]\n\n[noise]\nHi on football is back on CBS Radio here all your movies rich urban and chew gum time\nFor games going on right now he have a twenty six margin between the Vikings an eagles was Minnesota in front meanwhile the writers have gotten closer but still a long way to go with five minutes left let's go to the suburbs center checking with Eric Keller\nYeah rich the raiders answered that Ninety six yard touchdown drive by the chargers with a long drive with their own Derek car I took the raiders down nicely Seventy four yard that warm in thirty one second\nAnd the the word on a one yard touchdown pass for car that's already now in at the ... he made it twenty six and the raiders just try to live side it was not a successful so the chargers out at now\nVersus ten at the rate or forty nine yard line at the clock is running with five had left in the game so that the status right now the writers are still at it but it's still a long shot or um\nAnd uh uh get it right there and just inside five minutes left talking I'm Eric our stuff up that\nLied to Philadelphia we go Vikings an eagles fourth quarter underway with the eagles trying to make a comeback here let's get more for a long ago\nAnd the ball is the fourth one I got to try that some of the Gulf War a fourth one that called time out there at the Minnesota twenty yard line trying to get back on this one as you mentioned before the down trailing by a score\nOf twenty ...\nAh in that first half a ... to the fore yard the bubble recovery touchdown and then I'm feeling the are passed\nOn her because of the power of the goals of Ben Bailey in the process of trying to convert on our fourth and one of the try and get themselves back into that they've had some pretty good offenses success\nIn that first have but the Vikings defense able to come to make some place when they had to kind of shut them up and put them down and kill any ... any ... can running\nOn the fourth one now Sean jeopardy so they have a first in ten and they are past the Jeffrey first in the twelfth they fell by a score of twenty to sex with twelve or does it go and the fourth quarter\nAlright perhaps the best game going on right now rams and sea hawks in Seattle where all tied up once again a couple of minutes left third quarter has given shocked to\nHear her back and forth here the Seahawks often spin\nParticular successful they've already met their season high for points in the game with twenty five minutes left to play in this one at twenty four\nDefense not quite as much access a successor to see how it had been on the ground significantly a hundred and sixty four yards gained on the ground Chris Carson Ninety five of those Mike Davis was sixty three of those including a touchdown for him but every time they see also scored a touchdown the rams head immediately scored a touchdown of their own\nWith arrives at fifty eight yards for a score\nFor a score and then sixty four year at first score so right now it's twenty four twenty four with two minutes and twenty three seconds left here in the third quarter\nNine Jody where we actually looked at this one and a wait for the rams the top thirty once again but uh so far it's been very evenly play a game you wouldn't know which team as foreign on which seems to into\nExactly didn't know that the ah the are going to be able to run the ball as much as they have against this ram defend you mentioned a it runs beside before the game started\nUh no uh keep the lead Peters questionable and the life let's they're outside covered guys and they see on the run the ball right down the rams throats today can't blame injuries and the secondary for that\nThose small would just catching a touchdown pass from a Carson when Sarah Kendrick the linebacker and coverage seemed to question whether or not he had possession of it as do I am absolutely but all touchdowns are reviewed so I'm obviously they're going to take a look at this and we'll see\nIf in fact stands referees conversion you right now in a and talking about it\nI Would be surprised if this tax I didn't think he had possession of it I thought it came out pretty quickly out of his hands or would take a quick look in an instant replay this one is slow mall you know looks good okay yeah maybe did make to play a came out late um you know how they uh you called it last year and the NFL\nYou must have finished the play and survive the ground he didn't survive the ground but they haven't been calling that\nAs much this year so we'll have to wait for\nThe referee school year thing is as important today about the eagles as last year winning the super bowl take him to run that they were on they had one of the ... lines in football\nThey're basically back intact this year I got a couple of guys who were playing with nagging injuries but they had their entire op eds on line a healthy and cleared and ready to go\nThey'd been porous today Carson wins gets hit on almost every single play's been fact got sacked four times last week he's been fact today\nAnd even when he gets out of the ball out of his hands quickly he's still getting hit the eagle off into blind has not been good this season after the after the first game of the year they haven't been good for four straight weeks now\nFeels like we've been a holding pattern in Santa Clara fourth quarter underway no scoring change no points in the second half let's get more from Riley young in the cardinals in nine years\nYeah it's a good way of putting it rich definitely holding pattern since the first few minutes of this game\nDesigner to struggle so much off and said well here's a good ... illustration of that Matt ... leading Russia for the forty niners eight carries were fifty six yards all in the first quarter offered more so that was catching up he's got Thirteen carries fifty two yards rushing and he most or five carries for eleven yards he had one\nLong run will have an yards are rather twelve yards\nAnd that's what got him into plus a in a shortage um the big difference so far this vote seems Arizona right now struggled\nAnd third down conversion one of eight but the forty niners are committed three turnovers Josh Rosen for the cardinals just nine of twenty for a hundred and sixty eight yard touchdown but it it kind of um\nDeceiving when you were when you consider that he threw the very first half of the game for the Seventy five yard touchdown to receive are Christian Kirk or David Johnson the running back for the cardinals only eleven terrorists were twenty five yard but it does have a two yards scoring Ron anti gay battered for the forty niners twenty or thirty for a hundred and eighty seven yards\nAnd types down but it's still Arizona leading fourteen to sex as we started the fourth quarter\nI think you're right and let's go out to Houston right now Aaron Wilson of the Houston Chronicle joining us will be a closer look inside the Sunday night game Ehrenreich Akron joining McDonald's how're you\nDoing well thanks\nA you know this one is to struggling teams in the state of Texas obviously there was high hopes when the show on lots of then Jean J. what came back to start the season after they had uh some devastating injuries a year ago but it hasn't come together yet\nKnow how much did the fact that you know watching rehabbing during the off season there's there's no many camps ... there's limited reps in training camp now how much that him back\nIs nothing to do with it he he did plenty he's gotten off into line\nOh he's got a little bit of ... because they didn't let them do more during the pre season because they want to make sure that he was okay but he's been practicing pogo without a knee brace\nSince may so yeah ... I I don't put on a nice yeah these guys recover faster may sales now he's very healthy he had one of these before\nHe's averaging the last three weeks over a hundred yards that game and\nHe's on pace for like five thousand passing yards their score ... points they don't play very good pass defense they don't pass out very well protected quarterback when ... guard the past you're not going to a lot of games they have a pass Russia's started to emerge a little bit but yeah they're just not to get off the line and he's on pace to be hit\nA hundred and Seventy two times and sex sixty eight times share\nThat scary stuff that I'm a yet they do still continue to score\nI'm with you in that and the defense of secondary hadn't gotten the job done but part of that is the past has been lacking I thought that was going to be a big string coming into the sea and didn't know how long the central blind and they're not getting their\nYeah they just started getting after they're they're not listening enough in my opinion but [noise] and they're not covering the line backers very well uh ... played very well for the last year but yet it why he's got five ... he was the AFC\nWhere the money he's got five sex in the past two games so that he's awake in disguise looks like he's back getting ... he was safe CD player of the week scored a touchdown at Fort tackles gloss to sex it looks like those two guys are doing well when you merciless also really slow start that's hurting them but yeah I think overall\nThe cash Russia's is not the issue if they don't cover well\nThey just you know Jonathan Joseph these guys get picked on and now they've lost a cold and for at least six games so that they got their short handed they're going to face came I Webster ... Jackson and they're going to have to do a lot they got shuffled again yeah they got some problems\nThe one good thing so far is their force in the run up for the NFL against the run they do faces ... Elliott tonight who wins that battle\nThe thing about it is I think they can slow him down but I Wonder if the run defense thing it's a little bit deceptive because of this fact that you know there is so easy to pass on\nUnderstood that uh I Would do the same thing too with the way the ... been going I just keep blown up on the past um is there a\nBetween the Texans and the cowboys\nNo not that the
