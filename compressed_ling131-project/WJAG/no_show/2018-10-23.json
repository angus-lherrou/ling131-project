the new on CBS Sports radio while the back end of the show runner with\nA five five to one to four CBS\nI really like my ...\nAnd he also kind of I'm amused by the guy because he gets very nervous and uncomfortable and situations that has to do with confrontation you're just not he's just not good at not comfortable and there's people were built that way in fact most people are built that way he's just in a job where you have major he goes in and\nDifficult personalities to to manage and it was interesting just listening to Dan Tony talk about\nAfter the fight after the ... came down to the suspension to his star point guard I guess one of his two star point guard Chris Paul\n... moving close to it was just not equitable um you know understand maybe a gift one but\nYou know how does he not my orders you supposed to do just stand there and get spit on them to take a phase a punch in the face and then\nSay well that's okay I'm a doesn't make any sense to me\n[laughter] I'm like well like I I Do think\nThings go on on on the floor all the time you can't hear\nAnd that Rob us of a lot of context when you're watching the game on on television and even when you're at the arena the rare times when I covered the heat it never occurred on says on the road because I was so hard on the brown they put me up in the nose bleeds but the rare times that was on the floor seeds covering heat games a true story trace um\nIt was a totally different level perspective I once when the lose owned the Sacramento Kings I did a story on them\nAnd I kind of hit off with their mother so they let me go and sort of sit with them on the floor at a king heat game all the problems there all my favorite moments my career that I was\nKind of hard on the Bronx where he wasn't the biggest fan is like LeBron like when dive into the stands and got the ball and looked at ... goes with the guys and they were talking smack and he looked at me and he's like huh [laughter]\nMe the reporter but\nIn that situation sitting there you can hear you get a three dimensional perspective on down I Wish I had had that and I'd love to see a reporter\nWho's willing to tell the truth you're going to really put it out there what the talking was what the words were what actually happened between those guys because ... spinning\nCruise Paul something escalator that there were some series of things that went down we don't have the whole story\nAnd I'm not justifying spend another man of punch in another man but I Am saying this and I've been telling you this and they're ready for a year and a half\nOf course bull has a reputation in reality that does not fit the one that you see on his commercials on TV Chris Paul is viewed by the majority of his teammates in a way there's a lot similar to how I view him than the people who write about an everyday\nAnd whether it makes me reckless I don't think it does or honest or whatever it is I'm never I'm always going to tell the truth about the people that I cover and the people I talk about and that's what it probably costs me some day I mean of course both probably going to be a media star when he's when it said and done and wherever he works\nI'll never work I get it\nI'm just not built for deception like I was trained as a journalist and someone to say it again I I think the Rondo Chris balding has to be taken the contacts with him and tell me a for a year and a half Chris Paul is not like he is not likeable and he doesn't treat people well and there are two reactions when when people in power demean other people\nOne is that you cower and the other is the overreact\nRon does an over reactor and to me what Ronald did not okay but it is the least surprising thing that's happened a long time in the NBA for for me uh before we for a close on this topic and if you'd like to weigh in because I can tell me\nI'm absolutely wrong and you can do so on CBS portrayals toll free line is eight five five two and two for two to Seventy ... by guy go great news for ... you can save money switch the guy who got a guy go dot com and Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent of our car insurance\nUm James Harden\nIs gonna have to carry a bigger load\nWhile CB three is serving his games under suspension and the beard talked about\nThe with reporters the skull itself\nBusiness that would happen\nTo us was that was also says that's what it says here and there was a man and you can do or reactors [noise]\nWithin a few of them are so we'll see how ...\nWhat it is I I totally get it I'll just say this\nAnd again ... we had to someone who called in and said that the spin and happened if he gets been the face\nAnd usually the one probably swinging the punch right I mean it's such a weird\nSequence of events and I met a lot I mean I've had the crap kicked out of me when I was in first grade at five\nFourth graders like just hold me down to the that was really fun Dubuque, Iowa a playground and and uh the karate kid was out so I got crowded kicked you know credit kitten you know ... you know where you know where I've been in fights that I've lost but I ... I mean I thought a lot of crazy stuff happening in my younger years\nI've never been there in the face even ever anyone that would I guess another thing about it if somebody spit in my face I probably lose my mind\nI've never been there in the face even ever win that well I guess another thing about it if somebody spit in my face I probably lose my mind\nHave used to I have never been spit on or no nothing like that and I was at the yeah the clubs I guess at one time the cubs sometimes came close but I never I never having a fight I write that it doesn't matter if you're a fighter and not that would I think that was the rage me a trace everybody's but I\nBeen spit on yeah really\nUm it was who was gonna get ugly\nIt was Penn State's first a game when they played Rutgers in Rutgers and Rutgers came to be part of the Big Ten back in twenty fourteen\nAnd a lot of Rutgers fans are talking smack their fired up\nAnd someone who's running their mouth I started checking back I got spit on and I turned around 'cause it's like a group like four guys and I am all by myself all my friends lost me\nSo I had not much choice there so I unfortunately took to spit and left ... dead serious yes it got pretty heated crippled\nReally known for off the feel antics and stuff like that so as a former player of course she was embarrassed his hair and everything that was coming out but\nI like kinda how coach Tomlin kind of a rally the guys together and just taking that one game at a time in a you know right now they're stocking W's and that's what it's all about you know ... and going on the road is this and that and went down there was that in that fashion uh\nTo have to come from behind and then score with Antonio Brown alive drive I just think you get you build on that you know we've got two more divisional games coming up with Cleveland Baltimore and the distillers or we can take those two games I mean we're sitting right and we're sitting in the driver's seat or we want to be an absolute nor\nHeinz Ward here on the show Heinz\nWhat is your your personal perspective is a guy that played in the league for a long time had a lot of success on what lady on bell is doing that balance between this idea you don't criticize guys over their money and the fact that obviously this is a fairly unique situation or seven weeks in and he hasn't shown up yet\nYeah it's kind of president I mean you know you you you know that's always an option for guys I'm you know who wants to get out of their contract I mean that's unfortunate situation but I totally understand me being a fan of course I won't live beyond out there I Know\nIn order for the Steelers to to to go where I think they know they need levy on bail out there but also understand the the nature of the business and especially at the running back position you know for so long\nAt one point running backs weren't even get drafted in the first round because you know a lot of organizations this they want to pay a running back they throw like go find somebody you know and and the latter rounds but you got a guy like levy on bail who's\nYou know I think the best running back in the game today you know no disrespect Qatar girlie by Georgia boy\nBut I just think uh the receiving a dynamic that that ... a bell brings to the table I mean it really puts a lot of pressure on on defenses because you know when he lives up out there and bingo spread I mean you have to put a defensive back out there really\nUndercover Libya but you know that's what type of dynamic player that he is the last\nTime I've seen a player like that was probably Marshall fall you know I just remember Marshall he could do it all I mean you can score anytime he touched a ball lined up as a wide receiver get the one on one match up\nAnd how dynamic levy on bell is so I get it you know their franchise once as a running back you know hey I understand but they have banned franchise twice as a running back\nA ... is different than being a quarterback you look at what current cousins or what he was able to do but\nYou know the game protects the quarterback or the game\nIt they don't protect running back you know you're getting hit every play from blocking to to touching a running the ball and also a receiving the ball so I totally understand from the business aspect laid down bell wants to maximize all this short opportunity you know because we all know when you hit that age thirty\nI mean it's downhill for running back and it's hard to get a huge payday so laid down and try to maximize says the total value of what what has worked is\nTalking to NFL grading current player relations executive for the alliance and American football hind word you're on the show Heinz trying to make sense as best we can what's going on with the Philadelphia Eagles we had this conversation earlier about championship hangovers whether they're real whether they're not you are\nYou're on the show high in China makes sense as best we can what's going on with the Philadelphia Eagles we had this conversation earlier about championship hangovers whether they're real whether they're not you are a two time\nSuper Bowl champion and the following seasons at each of those seasons when you guys\nHave the ... for you and your teenage ... NATO and the first time around them is the play offs and that's the second civil went nine and seven and miss the post season so I'm very curious your perspective just on the idea as a team of championship hangovers and whether you think the real\nWell it is definitely real I mean because now you you have the target on your back everybody is giving you the best even the teams that don't have a great record I mean they they're coming out\nAnd play in their best because they want to say that you know they want to compare themselves or let's say how good we are I guess the defending Super Bowl champion so weekend and week out\nYou've gotta come bring your AAA game not Fisher a game you gotta come out because these teams are matching the intensity and they want to show their bet\nAgainst the defending world champion so you know I kinda think sometimes you lose that hunger you know that you had a you know in order to get to the super bowl and what a great story to Philadelphia Eagles were\nLast year I mean going on the run and then of course uh you know a ... a gets hurt and then they fold comes in at the rally the troops to lead them all\nThe way to the super bowl but then you look at when you know if they won the super bowl but even though he was on a team he felt like he wasn't a part of the team you know so there was added pressure uh went to go out there and get the job done and I just think sometimes\nYou know you're rushing back from a major knee injury like that and you're forcing the issue rather than letting the game come to yourself but you know still early you know the halfway point you kind of figure out your identity as a teen who you are what you do good and what you do\nAnd then from there and you build on there with some divisional games so um I think from Philadelphia they're still in the hot or end a division so now it's just taking a week by week and then come October and November of ... a real football star\nHeinz toward the rams are undefeated the chiefs has been really fun to watch offensively and they were very good defensively against the bangles this past weekend the saints it only last a single game when when you look at it the landscape of the NFL season is there a team that to you\nKnow I just clearly the best now but you think will be the best at the end of the season as well\n[noise] uh you know I just look at the rams I just think you know of course everyone's excited by the high power off and so the Kansas City chiefs but defensively I just don't think they're comparable to what the ramps half I mean what\nOr whatever and Donald's Dylan is just phenomenal I mean that is a reason why he was a hundred million dollar band but talk girlie I mean right now I'm going into a week I just think that you know I'm I'm he is the leading a VP candidate I think I mean the guy's a touchdown machine\nI mean he's Israeli or the engine of that that Corvette that they have a I mean they got weapons everywhere but\nYou know it all starts with talk girlie or is he continues to go he puts a lot of pressure on defenses so you you see a lot of eight nine guys in a box and it makes it easier for Jared golf just go out there and find the open guys and I love all the receivers that they are\nBecause it seems like every week somebody's different stepping up and and how can contribute to two wins but you know you just look at rams for from special teams to all sense and defense they're probably the most rounded team and the NFL right now and that's the reason why they're on the street it\nHigh and then she science Howard often is land there's a lot of weapons there too but led by\nPatrick moms we've seen him for a total games include last year seven this year is seven games for he's not a rookie but for young quarterback who's a start up for the first time is seven games are big enough sample size for us to ... and whatever we must still on him quarterback in the future or whatever it is yeah\n[laughter] well you can not what he's done I mean what he's done has been phenomenal I just think uh the ... kinda as as has said his off and you know are designed around them and it looks like he's in his comfort zone like he was at Texas Tech all over again\nI think had making place in a ball around and also does help to have all those great great assets and weapons around them but\nUh you know it I I think for Andy Reid and Kansas City chiefs and Patrick my home is is what they do in the playoffs you know that's kind of always been the knock on coached Reid is you know getting his team prepare for a playoff a football and then as a young\nA second your guy when you know you get a chance to go to the playoffs\nThat's when you got to turn it up a notch I mean defense is you know they don't hold back you know they have a whole season the study you watch you know some of the good and bad things that you do during the season so\nPlayoff football's like no other I mean it's a different animal and if you you know some guys they they don't know that they're in the playoffs so they play well but\nSometimes you know the ... life is too big is too big of a stage for a lot of young guys and there's a reason why you don't see a lot of young quarterback or have a lot of success early in their career when and during the playoffs\nI just want to I Love on a small world can be I on top of this radio show I hosted a television show and CBS Portage Q and a new streaming sports network and we had this great producer\nAssociate producer ... and he uh he left us recently were bombed really talented because he went to work for the alliance of American football and you happen to be the um current player relations executive for the a ask for people who aren't familiar what can you tell us about the league and one's going to mean for sports fans\nI think it's amazing for for for for sports fan so I was just saying that you know the timing is as as right I mean fans want more football and we want to get them a good friend of football during the spring we start February Ninety two thousand Nineteen and week out the super bowl\n... game season way a playoff games uh are season ends at the end of April so right when the draft comes around so I just think our league is a league of opportunity I mean we've given guys an opportunity to began extent and revitalize the football careers\nAnd and the great football minds that we assemble collectively as a group\nUh started with Bill poll in starting to you know with our coaches and GM that are

are best weapon\nI just hope that alternate Derek I heard that the rumors are that their cars going to Jacksonville if they do that that is just a stupid you better do their car and I I'm done with

insurance than Ryder is a senior baseball writer for Sports Illustrated ... million times and we're going to talk about the world series Ben how're you doing\nGood how are you I'm well so I was saying earlier on the show that I hear the weather's not supposed to be too good in Boston or for that but let's just say tomorrow night eighty percent chance of rain and marrying Wednesday rain as well that'll be a drag it they can't get these games and\nIt was it will I I just saw it was like a fifty fifty chance of rain or by game time who are not going to be pleasant it's going to be you know maybe in the forties or the game but from what we see right now well at least get in on that\n[noise] well I guess that's better than uh what I'm hearing a that it's all day rain and Boston and that may be the case hopefully they'll get it and\nStranger things have happened or how do you think that'll affect a either again like I wouldn't say the Dodgers find that very pleasant playing in a freezing cold that's freezing all when you're from LA when you go and play and forty degree weather and it's raining\nAh that's that's freezing ass when you're from LA I used to live there believe me forties freezing\n[laughter] you're right and you know the first game in LA last October was about a hundred and one\nAt first pet and yeah I didn't think Clinton cursor as much experience\nThrowing in elements like that clearly Fenway Park has its own home field advantage to begin with\nFor a team that did not play the red Sox all year long played there haven't dealt with the green monster a combine that with the elements that the starting pitcher for the Dodgers hasn't had much experience throwing in clearly an advantage to the red Sox\nSo uh\nBuying that we've elements that the starting pitcher for the Dodgers hasn't had much experience throwing in a clearly an advantage to the red Sox\nSo uh when you saw what happened with the Dodgers beating the brewers\nDo did you think would lend games out there and were you on the Dodgers or did you think the brewers were one of the hottest teams in baseball and that they would get into the world series\nI was on the Dodgers there look I mean the Dodgers debt\nIs just overwhelming especially in the line up they simply have like to lineups to throw at you want against friday's one against left these you think in a seven game series like that uh the till goes towards the the deeper team and that's clearly what we saw in game seven\nSo a current job review and beautiful or the first three games game theory and would be a free born Biden lipstick sending it should as their main how do you feel about um\nThe dealer was incredible in game seven and I thought I ... a scene was actually pitching better than anyone in baseball for the last\nThree months when his innings fuzzy RA strike out his slider as vicious and then wheeler kick ass\nYeah I mean look this guy is one of the best work has to come along\nIn a while or it'll be interesting to see how the red Sox counter him\nHe's the only right handed starting pitcher they're likely to see in this series review curse shot rich still are all left these um without the G A lot there Dodger Stadium you wonder what the Red Sox are going to do I'm guessing based on some ground balls we've seen taking\nThat they'll play moody bet at second base you take the best right field or in the game defensively probably the best player in the game over all this year you put them at second base\nSo you can have JD Martinez in right and then the left hander Jackie Bradley an Andrew been intend to rounding out the outfield so that will certainly be an interesting wrinkle and interesting strategic possibility for our score\nOn a problem with that to be honest with you because his bad it's sickening with dirty Jew cameras in eighty army I hadn't had postseason homers batch but every time he's up are literally every at bat as quality the guy just gets in his wax and he's just constantly in my view putting the bond play\nYeah and there's really no better all around athlete in the game right now we saw that on that controversial play in the ... yes in which a Joe West cruelty been interfered with in right field but look\nRisky bets can handle this he was drafted as a middle infielder you actually played six innings at second in a game against the Yankees this year I think it will be fine there and if the tradeoff is getting those left him that's been intend to eat and Bradley both in the line up because they're not gonna take Judy Martinez out of it that's certainly a trade off that I'd make two\nSo what do you think of all this talk about a Machado being on the villain and then I even saw story today that uh you know\nWe it gets crazy like that he's crazy or something and we're all supposed to believe that he's out of his mind or something I don't even know but they basically had two guys that you can frankly a love to hate\nAll the red flags that particular reason to dislike many Machado who has emerged kind of as a super villain in this year's playoffs remember Machado we slip into second base a banged into Dustin ... his name he hasn't been the same sense than they used to see 'em a lot when he was a member of the Orioles no love lost whatsoever there\nBut now that's kind of extended nationally after what he did with ... at first base in the end all cs getting fined ten thousand dollars are spiking is ill for no reason\nTo interviews where he says he never known will ever confuse me for Johnny hustle and many doesn't always play hard that's not going to do in gear him to anybody more pressing concern as he hasn't been playing very well you know over the last four games that and also yes it's free hit\nAll of them are single but you know make no mistake this is one of the best players in the game he's going to get well over two hundred million dollars perhaps much more than that as a free agents I'm unlucky probably has a maximum of seven games left\nIn his Dodgers career to ah make a reputation that will probably follow him no matter how much money he makes his off season\nSo ... are you a leanings on him leaving the Dodgers\nI think it's almost certain that her leave her daughter's first of all the Dodgers for all of their money or don't tend to give massive contracts you know under Andrew Freedman the team president they haven't paid any one\nMore than the five years eighty million dollars a game to Kennedy Jansen or to where they're going to put a they got Corey Seeger coming back next year short Justin Turner's entrenched at third base they got him for this year a and ... this is a time for for which they got um this is the time they're they want us to perform\nGuys ... we saw

I'm sitting here watching this a giants game editor it really is an ... to me\nI mean can anybody figure it out Garber I because I mean honestly like\nSo you look at the same right there this game's over the twenty sixth or six minutes left or the you know all keel over an hour to an all drop dead right here if they come back in this game is even if they score they're not going to cover and are getting what say that they're not going to cover either way they're not going to I think any of his car was let alone twice\nOr their atrocious but\nYou're going to tell me the guy throws for two hundred and eighty six judges twenty or twenty eight\nAnd a pop average\nI mean how is that those numbers are honored in for reading is good\nYeah he's throwing the ball but it's all mental dang basses\n... but there has to fifty yard plays wonder wonder back and won the shepherd both of those were a lot of ah probably catch around ten to Fifteen and the other thirty five yards of it will run out okay so he felt like he threw a deep down the field but he does have two fifty fifty one of the guys are over a hundred yards and I got no scars\nWell the couple of times that they've had the ball down inside the ten uh twice you lie miss guys on plays and other times to play calling was just bad I mean they are on the fourth a goal that they had down there early in the second half\nThey rolled Eli out to the right it was just a terrible play call\nUh another one he had backed them going across the middle on another play down there inside the tent and he missed them any any went for another ... be ... to the to the tight end instead and I got knocked down it's been a combination of a few things but they just can't get it done when they've gotten side of the dead of night\nDo you feel like it wouldn't matter at all the coaches whether it was an academic or Sherman neither one of them they look like spitting image is the same football team as last year there's absolutely no improvement\nYeah I don't think it matters a while back that could do was doing some crazy stuff at the end of last year as we know what a little road with the quarterback situation what whatever went on there are but the same I mean the defense looks the same doesn't it\nOr do you look at the same about this guy Jenkins who ah got absolutely\nShredded earlier in the game not by Julio Jones not by a who's the other Calvin Calvin really not by the new\nSome guy I've never heard of uh what was the guy who called the first touchdown name Mel something that was ...\nI mean you're getting destroyed by guys that shouldn't even the league Marvin\nAll catching a a de Paul art and all that they are being alone Marvin badly\nHall halls\nCatching a a de Paul are that are all that they are being alone Marvin badly\nEmbarrassing Marvin Hall halls one and I assume that all we're all burnt\nJenkins on that Jake it's just one of the highest paid players on their defense one of them\nBut once again a lot of ... way once again eight eighty five ten average no TVs longest catch and pain yards eleventh markets can you explain to me because I Would love to ask him a I'd love to ask a dummy drop if he were to call and let's say a\n... and this guy that doesn't catch touchdown passes\nI mean can anyone explain that to me\nHow do you not give this guy if you're at the goal line Let's say you're inside the tent or you're not going to throw it on three times\nReally when you were as bad as they are you would think I mean it is unbelievable to me I Wonder what does sort of the mind of these coaches\nSeriously Dan Quayle and what are you doing why don't you throw it in the sky is or is he did you pay 'em all that money to be a ...\nIt's like a ...\nSo I'm watching their receivers right now driving little passes write to them right in their hands and then almost getting picked off\nIt is unbelievable they're so bad I Can't even talk about him anymore let me say this can we go there is a Carolina Panthers game for a second I was talking before with\nJohn ... about it in the studio\nHe's a big eagles fan\nRight then I'm like I I just wanted to say your team sucks\nSo that's the first thing I said during the night when I saw him I go it's good to see your team sucks because they don't worst Super Bowl team that you've seen in a while like honestly because everybody talks about how good they are they are not good and here's the deal or he told me he told me that that went to his grave yesterday until the last drive and I'm like well that's why it matters\nAnd then what am I sat on the show a thousand times mafia in the last week on this show I said do not even on brown bats do not give candidate and the ball [laughter] with a chance to win ... he had two games the last ... last Dr Atlanta\nAnd Washington right where you had a ball and he had the last question and he got down to the red zone both times right and then they didn't make plays\nBut he made the passes they didn't catch him like he made blue eyes and they didn't score right so you either score you don't so everyone thinks\nIt's so easy right the score and the NFL and a red zone but it's not because you're going up against pros and they're defending that that goal line right there defending the end zone and so yeah the average I don't care who you play inside to read some F where everybody makes their money because you get down there and that's when you find out who the men and the boys are and so\nThey get down there twice and both those games they didn't get it done they lose right but what happened yesterday they were down Seventeen nothing in the fourth quarter they came back they won a game who end up all last Cam Newton what did he do with it\nCity water will be

I just couldn't believe it\nI couldn't either I thought it was weird that you will call that call because I Do feel that he pretty much basically do the same thing on every snap so just because the fifth reacted to it doesn't make it a penalty so if he if he does that all the time\nAnd it's a penalty call it every single time with the defense jumped the not so I just don't see how they can call that at that particular time if it was ... and I said hey check a check out the uh snapper maybe who moved the ball a little bit\nBut I can promise you you did the same thing on every snap leading up to it but the defense jump and that's why they got the call really weird because\nUh if you want to be real about it that we'll go would have been good for forty so it was bad for fifty two would it be good from forty seven they would have gone over time not saying that the cowboys would have one but it leaves Hooper give them a chance to uh\nPlay play an overtime I directly affected what happened ... is what happened [laughter] yeah\nI mean it was unbelievable I I was sitting there going I wait a minute so that is that he was there and he is going on as I saw him jump and rats saw something different and then we get the same rhetoric the play in the game didn't come down to that play the game here and that it didn't come down to that play\nYeah you get extra football now whether they wanted to do with drama not you don't know but still they didn't they didn't get an opportunity to win it\nA try to bring it all the time because ah lp didn't lift the ball I can understand if he'd jerk that you know you see that some parents that they are like they're going to snap it but they don't with the movement or if they lived above the ground he didn't have the describing it out before you snapped like he does every time so yeah I'm with you they got screwed an echo\nWhat it is a Jason Garrett are saying\nWell he talked about a because the concern was not even about the snap because every one but the look of pissed off that he didn't\nGo for the touchdown once he got in the Washington Territory would ... two seconds left in a time out so everyone around here was very ticked off that he would conservative and ... for the field though not equal to\nHe was ... he wanted to maximize the field goal but man to have all that time was the term out and you can't get any closer than a forty seven your will go it just doesn't make any sense they ran to play\nAfter that with two at a time left and that's just it doesn't make any sense that you wouldn't try to get hurt you wouldn't try to win the game\nThat you would try to get\nAs close as possible to make this bill go easier for your kicker instead of afforded to them you ought to Mars been great but man would much rather him chicken or try to take a thirty two yard field goal in a forty seven you order it just it doesn't make any sense a conservative approach of this team\nThat's been going on for a loan Konrad maddening\nGo a lot of people so Donovan Lewis with us from the ticket and out so I'm thinking that this way as well like so for me and I'm not you know I like you are in the middle of it all in Dallas so I'm On the outside looking in ... and ... you know I'm watching I'm thinking to myself\nAh All right you know\nWhy do you put it to me it's desperate eat when you're desperate you put your kicker and when you have no other choice you go for the ... where you at you know after you die to game when the game over time whatever it is when you have\nTo you gotta you gotta get your either when you play to you don't have to get back cat that's that's all you blame her which is what it sounded like he would do and I'm trying to maximize the the vehicle instead I agree with you that why do you Rashed your laurels on a kicker in today's NFL when guys like\nI say it but I mean we see these guys every week now mission extra points mission field goals like nobody's business even talk or who's never missed one in his life\nI don't count on for anything unless I have to why wouldn't you played uh when when you got\nA you know back in a game you got a shot Gomorrah ... when the game why the rest of your laurels on some guidelines when everyone now is now Doris Day in a world you're doing an NFL game anymore it ...\nYeah and that's what gets you in trouble and that's what gets the seat warm a little bit when the rest of your low on a kicker and where you're going to try to get him as close as you possibly can because\nIf you're the cowboys you will is on the road you're desperate you should play with desperation to try to go\nUh to Washington and get away and especially in a game where it felt like you're getting drill because you didn't play well there were a unit that didn't play a role at all but you found they found a way to calm your way back into a game and you have a chance to try and go for the just like you got to do it it's almost like\nThey played ... thinking that the we'll go we'll get him to win instead of going into overtime I don't know any person out there that will sit back and say you know what this much rather

was\nI don't know what you want me to say to you that it doesn't matter what he does if you lose right I mean so he had over a hundred yards and a touchdown catch 'em I thought the two point ... to ... to it right in his hands should've caught the ball so I I ... he had a good game they still lost the insects they're awful\nTo me and that's it it doesn't matter what you do you lose by three of the only thing they did and I which doesn't matter to them as they covered right they covered that six and a half that's a backdoor cover and that was a bad day for a lot of people I can guarantee you when you're up twenty to sex right\nAnd then a twenty three and a twelve then you still give it up right that's a bad beat but whatever or I'm not blaming him brain but he had a good game they still lost that's like saying the guy is thirty points in a basketball game he had a great game but they lost so what does it matter\nYou know it's that simple you'll never have like a rubber on or something like that Steph Curry Kevin Duran tell you how do they have thirty five forty point that a good game when they lose right and that's just the bottom line so\nYou can say whatever you want to me I don't care it's not my game semi problem but it is what it is you can brag all you want about how great you are if you don't win the game you know [laughter]\nI mean it's like listening to a

mean I guess I can ... well why not yet a better game to Blake morals\nAnd that's the problem we talked about going into this off season how who should bring somebody in one of the veterans just to be there was a safety valve where someone to push their blood job and they did nothing was said oh no you are gone we'll give them a new deal we are going wrong with him look was getting them out they brought some of the year and\nThen I'm someone to go through and so there's a ... with us or are we are screwed is where we got\nI honestly I look I Know he's not that great I think there are whole often sucks I made\nWhat's so great about the jaguars often I Know that he's not that good but what's so great about they're often nothing nothing so\nEverybody by the quarterback always gets the blame I understand that but there are often isn't that good they don't have the impact lawyer and no running game everybody talks about four net and I know for net when he actually plays\nA because he doesn't play he never played he didn't play last year\nAnd he he barely but he barely play this year when he does play obviously provides more help\nBut he's not a top five running back in the NFL\nThey say he breaks everybody down with these so powerful a writer the recent he's always injured his 'cause he plays so eight so physical and he takes so many violent shots\nThat he he just as always injured so he's the most cynical player on the team but he's always into which is how physical are you if you can't take the beating like he's he's dishing it out but he can't take it right obviously dish it out punishment but he can't wake up the next day and get on a football field\nAnd that's all there is to it and then you talk about their receivers right mind brief\nA killing coal

tomorrow I'll watch that one on I chose wherever pockets are available following me at on the badge W W O ... forty nine tomorrow\nIt runs Tuesday to Sunday six shows a week so let me just bring up this re Caruso saying okay so\nI was talking to the boys in the break and I was like what do you think\nA guy gets out after Twenty years right Nineteen years is that what it was and I of course he had he drew up the plans to have his girlfriend right murdered\nAnd uh she was pregnant\nSo they killed her right and then they had the baby\nThey deliver the baby the baby was a boy and a boy was born with a prematurely very early and\nAh what brain damage right away so we had cerebral palsy is that about accurate so uh I shot a kid and you know he's obviously a fortunately or been through quite a lot he's Eighteen years old now and he's been you know\nPretty uh you know\nUncomfortable to say the least or at change has always had a rough life\nAnd now this guy gets out right and it wasn't in North Carolina somewhere serving time and he got out today and no one who didn't believe it like when I saw it I was like the first thing I thought was wow it's it's been Twenty years whatever and they're letting this guy out\nRight so he got out of a prison and ah they showed him getting out and one thing that was weird to me was like everyone was\nAnd they're letting this guy out\nRight so he got out of a prison and are they showed him getting out and one thing that was weird to me was like everyone was hugging him when he was leaving like he was like their best friend or something a white guy's black guys PR people media everyone was hugging him I was like wow that's weird and then he drove off and that's sad but the weird the audacity\nOf this guy Carver eyes what bothers you the audacity of what he said somebody interviewed him and what did he say right well\nFirst of all I think you probably shouldn't ever leave a jail cell he did his time whatever he's getting out it is what it is but you don't think you should have got caught\nFor this guy to have\nThe stones to say when he gets out that he feels that he should be a that he should take care of his son\nI think he's absolutely just criminal disgraceful a criminal describes I'd put them back in jail for saying that for saying that he thinks that he should be the one take to get away from the grandmother who's been raising the child for uh Eighteen years take away from our\n... our relationship with them I I thought I read in one that he wants to like what's that custody of a\nBailout wants to be the uh the boys are a guardian yeah you know he wants to be the father\nThat is just too much that's too much for me\nSo one thing did you notice I don't know if anybody saw this but like in the beginning of the day I saw it like on ESPN or whatever the story and then uh after the fact like let's say\nIt was stories little there but they've kind of push it off the front page\nPushed it up front page I'm Still looking for it where did you find that\nIt's under its it you've got a really well it doesn't matter because I guess because it happened this morning they've other things have happened through the day so it's been pushed on the dock it'll happen on down that died still haven't found it I maybe looking all night\nI I really I I just I still can't find it but\nWhatever mafia you feel you did you not say it I mean you think he should\nAh ah have never got out\nOf course I mean he's lucky to have him put him down I mean it's one that I don't know whether you're ... you're very hard topic for a lot of people but you know I'm not always offered on and everything but to raise the murder of Harry oh you're a girl from butter you know your unborn child\nWho's just

life is a\nA horrible or you know worthless person\nAnd I just uh don't believe that\nRight I just think that you know some people have to go to prison and served time for crimes and then at some point or another do you learn away ever to get a better on another words can you change can you\nTurn your life around can you not be the a murder planning individual that you were are able to hit on his girlfriend and they killed her that it it is heinous it is awful\nAnd I mean if it was so bad they would've given him life right if it was so bad because they you know he didn't do it he just planned it right and he helped to execute it but he didn't actually cuter right someone else dead so he got what he got and he served his time and I think at\nSome point or another you have to believe that someone could actually um\nPeel or change or get help or you don't get treatment or you know go to meetings or go to therapy or\nYou know whether you believe this or not find a religion or ... or ... or\nSomeone to forgive them and that day would ah change as a as an individual now I think most people would say that a murderer or someone that plans or murder is a you know unpredictable if you

Alabama climbs to Notre Dame LSU Michigan ...

they beat teams well they didn't pay taxes today\nHow the hell do you put in my head of taxes when taxes beat them you know what he said he said if there were three more minutes in the game they would have won well ... here's a newsflash for you there wasn't three more minutes okay now thanks that's funny if the gas [laughter] they've every game at three more minutes there might be all kinds of different outcomes\nIn football eating and dream I imagine I the Lakers won\nThey didn't win either it's called the clock and it you lose do you believe or when they're when\nMichigan Carver high that they can uh let's say let's say they get because they're on the doorstep now they can be Penn State and do each of the big out there playing Ohio State bird a world right and if they beat Ohio State I got to play for the Big Ten championship if they win Matt let's say because you can't tell me they're not better than the other side\nBut say what they had to play Wisconsin again is that what it boils down to because my question is do you think they beat Ohio State and when that they tend to go into the play off\nYou know I think if they ran the table right now I think that they would definitely\nGet into a Wisconsin land northwestern battery Ryan build the winter is going to win the laugh\nWhile I was in the mix there too in a way\n... is in the mix I'll give you that I Want to see what they have left in terms of uh they do have a pet day a Penn State on the road or this week and Purdue next week on the road and I have a hard time believing they're winning both of those games\nYou know what I mean the rest of it's easy to or not really northwestern at home that will be a tough game but I think there'll be done in a can act I think\nThis week the tough one for Penn State it is at home uh but this I said\nOh it's not at Penn State oh is it at Iowa to add Penn State this week an app or to naturally to enroll in a road brutal if they can't win in a rod said how is\nIowa you know when you can't tell me I was better than Ohio State despite the record so I I question that bully so Ohio State now out of it do you believe that that they're out of the\nPlayoff or are they still in it so now do they still get in there because I was before they get in\nThey love Ohio State and urban Meyer in the in the uh college football playoff don't they are all I can work with this sort of for both you know trying to get in their percentage wise which are these ridiculous but I mean there's ... there's going to run them in there because they just want to\nEither good right now to Alabama Clemson Notre Dame in El issue and Michigan on the outside you cannot tell me that I I mean I'm In Michigan Texas Oklahoma Georgia I I'm In central Florida ahead of them now let's remember\nLast year Anna Anna Washington state last year\nThey had one bad law the game at Iowa where they got whacked kind of like how they got whacked against Purdue yeah they ended up running the table when a big dent title right and what happened they well they didn't get in\nHere's the deal if they be everyone and they beat Michigan so good they are going to be in Nebraska they're going to go to Michigan State I think they'll beat them there believe it or not and then at Maryland don't win and Michigan at home\nSo I think they went out already and then they'll uh they'll play Wisconsin or northwestern or et cetera Iowa for the big championship right so there you go or they go out they've still got a great shot it running the tables and one of those game shows Jim Harbach harbor I silence\nBeing shipped right so there you go I think they've still got a great shot it running the tables\nAnd one of those games so as Jim Harbach harbor I silence the Michigan haters when the second

either validated\nOr their negated based on the outcome me let's be honest life as an outcome based reality as is sports now I Would say this in sports we don't like moral victories we tend to pooh pooh them\nBecause you are what your records says you are\nBut in real life because sports is a microcosm of real life but it's also for us entertainment in real life\nIt's more than just outcomes that matter it's also about the journey it's also about the growth it's also about the struggle it's also about the character that we build along the way and the wisdom and the experience that we pick\nSo it's not as black and white as it may seem but yeah in the United states of America\nAnd in sports in the United states of America very often we evaluate the choice is solely based on the outcomes and we decide whether or not it was a great choice based on the result\nWhich tend to the limit our perspective\nInteresting to apply that to Monday Night football do you know\nI'm sure that somebody who have looked at the stats but you know the giants and the falcons produced almost identical stats for Monday Night football and I mean\nAlmost identical\nThey'd almost the same number a first down\nTheir percentage on third down it's about the same they had exactly the same number of play sixty two each they're totally already separated by just ten yards their yards per play almost exactly the same\nRyan Eli Manning had very similar passing numbers and a very similar quarterback raiding\nThe falcons average eight and a half yard for past ... boy nine yards for past\nOf rushing yards as well as the same average per rush\nThere are penalties were about the same though the giants were punished a little bit more when it came to penalties and about inside the ball an extra few minutes\nFalcons had warned turnover giants had none\nBut the giants were in the red zone five times whereas the falcons we're not and there and live the one major difference between these two teams on Monday Night football\n\nGiants were over in the red zone they never got into the red zone they had a bunch of a huge plays when they needed them big plays down field\nWhereas the giants in the red zone couldn't capitalize on the opportunities\nThat is the one glaring difference which makes some of the giants choices especially in the second half of money I'd football come under scrutiny if these choices workout if the execution upset and choices play out differently\nMany giants fans in football fans are evaluating not just the game but the team\nA whole lot differently and instead despite nearly identical numbers for Monday Night football it's a win for the falcons and a lot of second guessing of the choices that the giants made\nIts after hours with any Lawrence on CBS Sports

I think he's shown the talent to be a clear cut number one guy I was way more surprised\nThat the cowboys for over a first round pick a rather than just the fact that the raiders traded another three first round but you're\nRight according to Reggie McKenzie they weren't necessarily looking to move I'm already Cooper but you're saying it's not a surprise that he got traded why were you expecting this to happen\nI think regardless of you know the word tanking is obviously getting thrown around a lot I don't think the raiders are tanking but I think it's more just to clear fires rebuilt toward the future um\nOther teams know that the raiders are in shell vote because obviously they're not going anywhere this season Marshall Lynch's on I are are there left tackle banged up\n... obviously be people can say the raiders were unreal rebuild from the start but share their best player but I think out the trade of arguably their best offensive skilled player um it it just shows aren't complete fire sale complete rebuilt own\nAnd John Gurdon is building for Vegas and I think that's why I wasn't surprised because of mark Cooper is one of the more tradable guys because you can get drunk or him at the same time\nReaders probably weren't even got to keep him next year 'cause he was coming up to the same situation ... face the long term contracts mentioned in with howling and fifth and he's been in his career\nThe longest streak ... he's out of more of a hundred yard where she was just two games and the past that he hasn't been very good so I don't think they were going to keep them anyway so I think that's what made him a ... trait Canada\nBefore we talk about Mari specifically you talk about grew to in planning for the future and just being about the mood to Vegas and putting it together a team that will be competitive there does that jibe with the philosophy of ownership and the front office\n[noise] I think so um where it doesn't jibe with the fan\nBase and grew and has made it and of course that's a big part of\nHis re introduction to the fan base that he was going to do everything to win win for Oakland because and I think this is honest you know she knows how much the\nRaiders mean to the Oakland fan base she spent four years here\nAt the start of the century he knows what the Oakland fan base I mean there was just a couple of months ago where I was at a fat rally at the local raiders bar in the day and he proclaimed then we're going to win now you know he said we got Gary Johnson from the chief he said we're going to get ... back and hear their cars one hell of a quarterback so\nJohn Gurdon really cares about these Oakland fans I think that you it's going to hurt or this\nIs fire sale I think management is obviously that they're not winning now it's\nCares about these Oakland fans I think that's who it's going to hurt more this this fire sale I think management knows obviously that they're not winning now it's a long run but a ... and you just saw from the locker room today you know it's a hard sell to players\nPlayers see this as you know management and ... has given up on the season and players hate that the players and the fan base I think are the are the two groups to this is going to be a really hard sell on less so management and ownership\nMatch nine men covers the raiders for the San jose Mercury News with us here after hours on CBS Sports radio to your your best ability you know what would it be able to gauge about the players and their reaction to this latest train\n[noise] yeah so you know players aren't really going to talk about this you know Gurdon talks on Wednesday and there was another open locker room on Wednesday so we'll see if there's more on that but\nPlayers ... I Would I take by them not talking is you know they just don't want to express their disapproval you know John Feliciano who started that left guard for the raiders last week tweeted a\nA a medium I Believe it was of Will Smith and an empty living room just looking around like why nobody else here I think it's layers are taken aback by in week seven yes the raiders are one in five of players that we have that optimism of you know we can turn this thing Renee\nIn our area the the raiders next four opponents are terrible the cold forty niners and cardinals so they probably have some optimism they can still turn this thing around make a late ...\nIn a lackadaisical AFC but Gurdon and Reggie McKenzie making these moves just tells the players we don't think we can win with the people we have in this locker room right now so I think there's a little bit of a\nDisconnect there right now I don't I I wouldn't say Greece has lost a locked room but I also think there's a sense of who's next these players are like well if little Mac and get treated if I'm Ari Cooper can get traded I might be the next one to go and I think that that makes guys the little uneasy and that locker\nMatch Nyman covers the raiders and in San jose Mercury News on Monday with a big trade I'm Ari Cooper and Reggie McKenzie said to get a first round or from the Dallas Cowboys was too good to pass that chapter ours here on CBS Sports radio\nCooper definitely has struggled a and ... and a lot of people would point to the issues with your car in general the off and what do you see when you see that relationship\nI think it's a combination of things you know last year I'm\nCooper was one of two receivers in the NFL along with does Brian to have a drop parade of over twelve percent so I think the drops really hurt Cooper\nUh last year along with some nagging injuries you had a concussion yet ankle injury\nLeave yet a hamstring so nagging injuries and the drops for what hurt Cooper last year so I Would say it's a little bit of bad luck with the injuries drops on him this year I think it's a it's a combination of ... and not calling enough plays with her as a primary option it's dark car\nNot looking Cooper's way enough it's\nYou know Cooper not getting open enough I think this year it's a little bit more of a combination like when they play the charters two weeks ago there were place after that game where Cooper who's\nOne of the least outspoken guys in that locker room uh went over to your car and grew and on the sidelines that hey guys I was ... you know that's very unlike the mark Cooper to do in a mark Cooper these last couple of weeks has started to at least to us media say you know\nI I've been open you know it's not on me and dark car obviously gives the perspective of you know it's not always what you see on the surface it's not always Cooper is not the option we're going gym but obviously there's more layers to play\nIf Cooper doesn't get the ball and then grew and says you know we're calling plays were not calling someplace we probably need to call them more so a bit of a jumbled explanation for each of the three of them but I think this year it's definitely way more of a combination of greeting card in there rather than just on Cooper\nWell let's talk about Darren ... I've heard from a lot of raiders fan since we have a an affiliate in the bay area than the raiders need to move on from him is the franchise QB I Know he signed the big extension but he's got fewer touchdowns than he does have turnovers and and the fence while he goes well in spurts\nUm you know it doesn't seem to be able to put together a full game and and sometimes you don't know if it's coming are going to help her carry it for me you know what how solid is cars position as the starting quarterback or the quarterback of the future for the raiders\n[noise] yeah I Would say you know right now it's pretty safe but going forward you never know I mean Reggie McKenzie said today nobody is untouchable than John Gurdon goes and tells ESPN that uh nobody else is\nGetting traded so some mixed messages there who knows what the actual realistic internal situation is I think if the Jacksonville Jaguars let's say came to the raiders and gave them an offer they couldn't turn down\nIn Britain has been the mission of save the children for nearly a hundred years when tragedies like Hurricane Florence strike they're prepared and they're on the ground for children and their families around the world and right here at home [noise]\nWhen you partner would save the children you can send love and care and essential for children and families including baby watch cribs toys and books\nLearn more at W.

then the Packers are three two and one\nAnd they are in there by week this week\nThe lions are three and three the bears are three and three so there isn't a team below five hundred in the NFC North\nHow about the NFC South the falcons have pulled themselves to three and four\nSo there are only a half game back of the bucks they're going into their by week tactically only two and a half games back of the states who have won five consecutive games really only division that it's got a great disparity\nBetween the number one team and the second place team is the end of the west with the

again so again on our social media or on our phones eight five five to one to four to seven\nSo many of you have called in with your opinions about the Maori Cooper trade to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a first round peg in my opinion it's impossible to judge that first round pick cast a much smaller\nTeeny little shadow\nIf the cowboys extend their all things that they can go vertical if jak Prescott\nHas a target a guy who can get a jump ball down field it adds another dimension to an office at his looks tail and conservative and two safe at times if they could open things up and create more space for their other receivers as well as ... Elliott\nIt's worse not just the first round pick but more Cooper would that be worth his weight in gold if the cowboys make a playoff spot let's say they win the division they have a playoff spot and potentially when a playoff game now these are all hypothetical\nBut if they do nobody's complaining about giving up a first round\nFor a wide receiver that became your top target this is exactly what the cowboys are lacking they're lacking a number one guy now it's up to mark Cooper\nTo work his tail off\nTo get back to\nThat form and that rhythm that he had in his first two years in the NFL when he posted one thousand yard receiving seasons and was approval or twice so last year a lot of the issue was drops twelve percent of the time that he was targeted he dropped the ball\nThat was in two thousand Seventeen now in two thousand Eighteen it's a different story there have been some injuries of course but also it's it's about the the messy raiders op eds as much as it is about I'm Ari\nAs for the Oakland Raiders they now have three first round pegs in next brings draft and they are in clear rebuild mode but according to general manager Reggie McKenzie he was absolutely not going to trade I'm already Cooper and till Stephen Jones called about Monday morning and said we'll give you a first round back\nBecause he was holding out for a first round pick and finally the cowboys whether desperate whether in panic mode and some people have said or whether they just want to win now\n[laughter] and despite Jerry Jones saying lots of teams are successful in the NFL without a number one wide receiver they decided maybe they won't be one of those teams\nSo what's your reaction a five to one to four to seven and then again on Twitter a radio or on our Facebook page just look for the pictures the falcons have that one two games in a row and they've made it pretty crowded in the end of the south I think this division is so much fun\nThe falcons they're going into a ... a week now but they are the only team and the NFC South below five hundred and there are only a half game back of the buccaneers the seeds of course have won five games in a row one of those being

bit of good new in that sixty seven dollar range which uh you know we're doing a little drive in this time of year it doesn't hurt anyone's feelings saw saw gas down at two bucks a day or two fifty or from you know three which are in our neck of the woods I thought that was a good a good sign I like that\nYeah absolutely absolutely and we continue to see those\nI continue to see the price of bread for eight Fifteen each hand and regular unleaded or ... ... zero at the pump that spread keeps getting wider Clinton that\nAll only on the safety of labeling for today and the safety aspects or today and then they'll labeling marketing aspects or dress tomorrow all day long so that's kind of the matter is they have a real a comprehensive agenda for both days\nYet the safety side of things Kevin I mean at a minimum we want this product if it is economically viable in up in the consumer marketplace out there we at least wants to product to be held at the same standards as us traditionally produce meat right\nAbsolutely correct a CPA is is a trade association is not against any lab products at all we just want to make sure we have a level and fair playing field and so\nSafety for the consumer and the producers of the most concerned so we are asking that the U.S da ... great history of safety inspections and oversight we want us to be the lead agency when it comes to safety as well as the labeling and marketing aspects of any lab grown products\nYeah ... you know you said it right away and Kevin and I know that there are some cattle men out there that you know heard you say that in CPA isn't against lab grown meat and they're they're saying what why why are you not against the lab grown me\nWell very simply put if it's a protein product that can feed the world going into the future where we have\nFifty plus billion people on the planet\nOr we're going to need all the protein a Venus available to keep our future populations many decades ahead of us uh you know safely fit so uh we're not against future products we just want to make sure that they're safe and they have to follow the same rules as we do\nWe're not against future products we just want to make sure that they're safe and they have to follow the same rules as we do\nYeah Kevin if you had an opportunity to try it yet\nOr well on the cell based products are those products out or not on the market yet so no I have not had cell based I've had the opportunity several times to do the plant based uh yeah protein products but uh and uh not to any uh [noise] I I wasn't very impressed whatsoever\nWithin my taste taster aspects\nOf those that are on the cell based where several years away at best before those products were on the market where we can try him\nRight right I just I mean somebody's head you're trying to buy now I you know I just thought well gosh if anybody has tried it may be the president of the CBS [laughter] it's driving me what kind of competition we might be looking at yeah\nOne of the main companies that's doing the lab based a product research is just up the road from me in California and the silicone valley a couple of hours and uh so far I haven't had an invitation but I think in the next few months we probably will get together with those folks and uh we might have the opportunity then so it's not too far off\nDude I hey I Want to come along with you on that because I Want to be one of the first to try this\nWell see what I can do I'll let you know when it happens\nYeah yeah I think that would be awesome to to be in there and take a look at what they're doing and and and get a better understanding of it I mean it it it it just uh it's intriguing to me you've mentioned labeling as part of the discussions to de\nDo does is you'd be a ... I mean we need to make it clear when this product if the product becomes economically viable\nThe label needs to make it clear of of how that was produced is that right\nYes and so what happens what will let me back up what happened in the past\nThe student food and Drug Administration is that oversight of different products are from agriculture and they've done a very poor job\nThe oversight for enforcing existing regulations on labeling a soy milk all man Al Gore too good examples where the dairy industry so we want to make sure that we don't fall into that same\nScenario so we're asking us day also have oversight\nFor the labeling in marketing aspects because under USDA rules those labeling marketing claims to be pre approved before they hit the market FDA doesn't have that\nSo now we are really strongly pushing for us da to have that labeling inspection and oversight as well as the marketing claims and we think of the USDA could do a very good job keeping us or on the federal level playing field for that\nYeah boy it I Know that you're going to be making comments about the marketing efforts out there right Kevin\nYeah that's what I'm going to do that's tomorrow afternoon here in Washington DC uh yeah I'll be addressing the marketing and labeling or aspects of the the two day hearing\nDude I'm telling you this just seems like\nA a ... a\nVehicle that the anti animal ... groups out there are going to they're going to jump all over it they're going to ride this ... this this product with all kinds of claims that probably can't be backed up\nAll in an effort to hurt animal leg\nWell that's what exactly what we're a ... or want to make sure that that does not happen and so we're going to fight really hard tooth and nail or go to the wall to make sure that that doesn't happen because those things get started putting the genie back in the bottle is a million times harder\nYeah yeah absolutely so when it comes to marketing claims what are you looking for on the\n[noise] just to a well that's all as we work through the process in these products get closer to being put out on the market from the cell based a research we want to make sure that uh the consumer knows what those products are\nAnd have a labeling claim of some sort which recognizes that this is a lab based product as opposed to a traditionally rancher farm drone animal and so we want to make sure that the consumer doesn't get confused and that they know where they're a meat or products are coming from\nYeah yeah you know I'm Wondering like I said I Want to be one of the first taste is product because\nYou're not afraid of the competition I gotta believe one of the reasons that you're not afraid of the competition is we're starting to see the consumer taste for high high high quality beef ramp up here cabin I mean it's pretty encouraging what we're seeing\nOh absolutely and you look across the world right now our export markets are hitting all time records in August the latest figures available\nTo us beef did over seven hundred and fifty million dollars in sales across the world outside of the U.S all time record in so\nConsumers across the world recognize are are are safe and abundant a good tasting high quality products and so now the U.S consumer does too and so we just want to make sure that\nUh anti agriculture people don't use this like you're inferring to a beat us across the the head or you know make false claims and trying to take a\nA R businesses away from a mini family operations\nYeah absolutely you got a second talked about moving these animals around sure yet the hours of service give us an update on that\nWell we're right in the middle of um\nUh we've ah I was here in Washington DC uh ten days ago and ah got to talk with the federal motor carrier safety administrator or Mr Martinez administrator Martinez at a hearing and got to talk to him afterwards a one on one about hours of service and\nUh how a ... a number of ag groups here uh in in the U. S. or asking the department of transportation just to use common sense when it comes to\nThe coming up with a final regulations for hours of service as well as electronic logging device\nRequirements so we're working really hard with the department of transportation to come up with the common sense solution is not gonna unduly harm a lifestyle colors and so we're working hard to make sure that we come up with not only hours of service ... the tonic logging device requirements\nTo make sure that guys like me on the west coast in California and producers on the east coast and the southeast\nOr get is least impacted but still be safe or for lifestyle colors and safety in humane handling of animals all that put together\nA lot of come up with the best solution possible it's ... a little bit complicated and yeah but I think we're going to get there I think we're going\nTo get to heaven I Hope you're right but that's a pretty big as they are asking for some common sense legislation [laughter]\nIt's an oxymoron here in Washington D. C. F. that isn't it [laughter]\nIt really is like good luck to you on that because that is something that I Know it's a top priority for a lot of of cattle men out there not only when it comes\nIt really is but good luck to you on that because that is something that I Know it's a top priority for a lot of of cattle and now they're not only when it comes to those that are providing that air grow the cow calf operators out of the southeast are the\nOnes that I'm thinking of the most there because they got all those those camps have got to move a long ways to get to the yard out in the planes and and we need to do it as quickly and safely as we possibly can and and addressing it with the hours of service is something that we gotta do Kevin thank you so much good luck to you\nGet chip thank you very much All right that is and C B a president Kevin caster coming up next week I congressman Rodney Davis from Illinois right here on TALK\nA friend documentary combined alarm line I ... I don't I start to not out\nWith possible terrorists still remaining when it comes to trade with China but I think we'll also hear from a lot of farmers that if they want to make sure that China's held accountable when they don't trade fair with the United states and I think they'll get a thank you to the administration not just the secretary Purdue but also to a President Trump\nFor making sure the fifteenth debatable all year round that's huge to the farmers that I represent here in central Illinois so I think some thank you will go around to\nAll right you know we do have the momentum going in and I've been saying we've got momentum on trade deals ever since we got the deal done with Korea and then we had us MCA a and people are saying I'm saying we've got momentum going\nI'm saying to too much because it's been too long now we need to see progress on other issues we're talking about trade here congressmen it takes time we've got positive momentum going on these trade issues\nOh we do we certainly do you look at the new NAFTA the U.S MCA you look at the preliminary agreement coming out of the you\nYou look at preliminary agreement with Japan to by apple products from the United states of America TPP levels the same with South Korea I mean these are huge wins end up in the administration promised results\nIn by farmers see results very happy with the details it's got to be funny when we get back to Washington\nTo see if many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who used to be for terrorists and then were against him with President Trump per person and then we're for free trade when President Trump said we need to renegotiate we'll see if they're for better trade deals freer trade deals when those things come back to the house\nHow bad you know you're exactly right it will be interesting to see how they how they react to that have a word of funding that was approved last month what's your what's your read on that\nYou know this is the third word it though I Believe that we've passed since I've been elected five and a half years ago were back on schedule back on schedule yeah\nWater resources I can remember working for John shipped establishment John ship us back into six oh seven when we passed the last word a bill until we got one through er during my first term so it's a big deal and\nI here in in Illinois I'm ecstatic because this administration the Trump Administration\nHas been the first administration to invest\nIn upgrading are antiquated locks a dancer starting with La Grange on the Illinois river that's a huge a vast investment for the Midwest and these are these are these are issues that we've talked with the administration about for years long before President Trump was elected\nAnd we got no results President Trump's investing ten million dollars to upgrade the range lock and dam and moving that tire Illinois Mississippi\nWaterway system prove that project forward that's a very big deal with the people that I shirt and it's a very big deal because it's a very big deal to that country since that's the main routes\nPower through our inland waterways system out into the global marketplace\nYeah yeah congressmen how do we how do we know this the funds are being ... I did that look Grange a lock and dam very important project but how do we know that the money is being spent in the right places\n[noise] well I I wanted to make sure the assistant secretary for civil works already James knew that it was going to be a good investment so\nI cook it there are ... and I went to a Grange we cook already change secretary change and members of the core\nLike cooking a hair dye went to La Grange we cook already German secretary change member corps or to really see exactly what we needed to happen why this was a good investment and the good the key point is this projects\nNow moving forward by higher time in Congress are hurt my colleagues\nFrom both sides of the hour from the state of Illinois and clearly rooms so we've got to move this project for what we finally got it done because of the crop administrators saw that we were right we needed to happen at best and that's how I notice money's spent well why did we still got a long way to go\nBut moves if we don't make that first and best ...\nYup yup okay only about a minute congressman but I got to know what else is on your priority list\n[laughter] well you know what we look ahead\nI think we've got to look at any possible end of the year funding issues for the the last of above creation bills to pay expire before the end of the year I certainly hope\nThat we can certainly help Africa selection that we see a lot more bipartisanship return to Washington because that's what I cut my teeth on my freshman year working in a bipartisan way to get this farm bill done\nAnd that's what's going to get this far below across it that's what I'm focused on every single day even though we're not Washington to be able to go back and immediately get to work\nOkay yeah that farm bill there's no doubt that it is a is it is a a a piece of legislation that a lot of people in the middle of the country would sure like to see past All right thank you so much congressmen we'll talk with you again soon thank you\nThank you bet that is representative Rodney Davis from the thirteenth district\nIllinois you know I asked him about that word project there because it is so important\nThat we make sure that the money is going in the right direction now there is and uh [noise] some progress there at the La Grange lock and dam and I think that some evidence that we do have money going in the right direction a lot of other projects that need to be taken\nCare of us well we'll be right back with little sore from ...\nI'm Steve intent and uncouth Iran sell used ...

Peterson you can get out at all\nTo say five five ... five five for eight to five five to four or you can tweet at us has to take ship ATP and the message that will be sure to see it survived buddy let's put a little clarity into what happened what was moving the markets\nWill this month the U.S celebrate next poked out to a new high for the month and early trade then faded throughout the session on spillover pressure from equities the low rates clothes may have helped corn soybean and winter wheat futures clothes on the plus side of an changed\nYet and as the equities came back so did the dollar basically an changed after the green markets closed down for the day we'll talk more about that at the end of the show\nThe separate and certainly if you just have to support the October lows then slowly worked back to the upside the demand side of the market remained very quiet chip that allowed futures to reach early session lows\nKnow what I'm doing really find really fine so uh yeah ... you know last weekend was football this weekend for us I was the fans but boy you go back a week and that was a lot of fun wasn't it\nYeah I guess West Virginia that was a nice nice game to watch bloom house was happy\nYup yup yup and I know there's some Texas Tech fans out there right now that are taking yeah here we go Morehead north through in your own [laughter]\nThey can try they can bring it on bring it on on on a\nA R I look through it here um you know I just saw just ask Joe ... or you know what's your next sugar and and he went all the way up to November eight they really Naomi ... do we have to wait that long to find a trigger in these grades\nNow we've got a few things coming up ahead of that uh this friday's last trading day for November options so that sometimes can be a market mover and then we have\nA first noticed stay for November ... at the end of the month so those are little things and then of course we head into the elections and that is going to be the biggest market moving because we're going to finally see\nOutside markets commit to a direction we'll see the dollar commit to a direction and um then of course affects the grain markets in terms of where we will we not have the idea that we can see trade negotiations continue with China based on the outcome of election so there is\nA lot coming up I'm In the next little bit but I Would say in a very short term meaning probably for the rest of the week it's going to be quiet market just until we get into those bigger news items in the day is beyond\nAnd could yes so trade or harvest progress continues to be a focus of the market I made the argument earlier knew me the normally\nWhen we get to\nDone on corn harvest have known or being harbors you can start to expect\nThat some of those those harvest season pressures will start to subside a little bit\nBut man with with the slow harbors progress in the western ... well not just ... you've got to include a Michigan or Wisconsin in their own being harvested as well good grief it it just feels like this is going to drag on for a little while\nYeah it is definitely one of the slowest harvests and in recent memory and\nTo your first point yes usually when we get halfway done with harvest them that harvest pressure subsides and the market starts to work higher but the fact that you pointed out that this is going to drag on for weeks yet even though there was a lot of catch up ability earlier this week and late last week it still is dragging on you know when I drive 'em\nUp and down highway forty one going home to work and back\nThere's hardly any comments rolling around here and so I'm real curious I'm heading to Iowa for the weekend and so wondering if\nYou know what I'm going to be seeing my drive there so it's it's slow but I Know people are out there doing their best to get things done especially you see a lot of people really focusing on those soybeans because they're so concerned about those pods busting open they want to get that Siamese fighting crossed off before the time or in a\nReally decimate the potential that had been there\nYeah you know we've gone through a lot of that already some of the things that you're that you're mentioning we've had this those soaked pod we've had the when this weekend was it just made me cringe every time I heard the the wind blowing outside the house\nAnd it makes me wonder where we're heading in the November a crop production report if there's been Neal can didn't work work to the upside or do you think it holds mostly study does its up back some what do you think\nMy best guess is that they would keep it on change just because they're not going to be a shore what was potentially gained or lost from this late harvesting um and I I think the bigger focus for that report will be more on the experts at the USDA's has anything to tweak it\nAs far as do we actually lose exports now are they going to still do their heels in and keep that number mostly an changed\nOkay that ah that doesn't sound like a real positive outlook for this the market if we're talking about if there is an adjustment to being a sports it will be to the down side right\nThat I Would say that would be the adjustment if it happens right\nRight so let's not a real positive outlook for these beans hold your supplies study and take your demand though\nYeah that would uh creates the argument needed for those in the air camp and when you look at this being market as far as the fundamentals at the moment and if you look at the charts\nUm it's fifty fifty as far as can we go and have a re test for higher and afford to that to happen we need your production and we need a trade deal with China and we would need China to maybe cancelled some Brazil beans 'cause that would make us all a little bit happier [noise]\nUm but on the flip side if they don't do any adjustments would yield and if we don't get any exports moving to China\nThan than those who are arguing no being she'll be back down to eight dollars would have feel for their fire so the beans or it's fifty fifty you no matter which way you slice it right now so that's where\nThe conversation that we're having with producers they're they're calling to say you know for my situation I'm going to be selling beans off the combine and so for those people we look at re enter ship strategies and we caution you know this is what it's going to take for the market to go higher so let's just be realistic about looking at this\nAnd on the flip side we have those were saying you know what I'm going to store beans for whatever reason and there were saying let's just be prudent about our risk management\nAnd let's look at\nUm put strategies to help protect against those on price bushels so it's not being wishy washy this is good risk management because we really are still in a situation where we just don't know what's going to be happening going forward\nYeah absolutely you know I've had it buys I I mean most advisors that I've talked with this bowling when it comes to soybeans they're looking at the basis that thinks it's improved a little bit but it's being sucrose most of the Midwest and they're saying listen\nThis being basis has got to improve some\nGo ahead find some place to put those beans in the ... but what you're saying is if you want to do that for base just go ahead and do it but watch your price right\nAbsolutely because the futures price is if I thought I heard yesterday talking about the funds and the fun position in the marketplace and so they're really overall um they're they're not overly short they're not overly long for corner beans either way so the futures price could respond and go up or down just depending on\nThe trade on the field all those types of things so if the futures price works lower basis maybe doesn't get any wider than where it is right now but you could see the futures price drop and then you've got a double whammy with your yucky basis on top of a lower futures price so that's why we're talking about\nJust having some put protection there but again having a realistic expectation and the return and saying\nIf the trade negotiations go through a field a smaller because of this late harvest the market could go up and this is at least you had on the floor there so just you know mindful to be on on both sides of what could happen going forward with us\nBest the market could go up and this is at least you had on the floor there though just you know mindful to be on on both sides of what can happen going forward with the situation\nYeah yeah and and what do you do with a carry on the market because doggone it we're going through it again I think Naomi when you know what was it a year ago ... yeah I think it was just a year ago in ... and there was a the the Kerry was in the market and everybody just I should say everybody\nSome people just thought well heck you know we've got a that that July contracted a thirty percent premium to the beach or whatever it is all just wait until the solid but by the time you get there\nThat thirty cents is gone because you're tethered to the spot months price\nAnd I'm afraid we're going to go through the same thing can be\nAnd that could very well be so a solution and let's talk about this for your for the viewers the solution could be a hedge to arrive contract with the elevator\nUm so that's where you call the elevator and you agree on the futures price and the delivery point so that way you're capturing the Kerry by lacking that higher value there and your cash market\nBut then you're still your job as a producer to lock on the basis down the road it's your job you got to watch it so that something to be mindful of you that's a great reminder we totally monitor that last year yes yeah\nYeah and it was three fifty a spot much corn everything every contract following it just came right back down to it you know I Wonder if they fifty eight sixty isn't going to be that tether point in beans here for a while on a lot of that just comes back to the fact that we've got this big carry over that we're looking at the end of the Eighteen Nineteen marketing you're right\nYou're totally right carry out that pretty much doubled when it's ever been and so when you when you think about that in and of itself and it makes it scary for those who are they're true big bears in this market place and who are talking about those scary low numbers I mean that is their fuel for the fire um if you were only looking at carry out levels\nYeah you could argue why prices should go a lot lower but as we all know there's a lot more to marketing and just looking at a carry out numbered there's outside marketing influence says there's global impacts the trade things so a lot to be watching going\nFor yeah those trade things Naomi I Want to\nTalk about those when we come back here in the next segment because you mentioned\nTrade talks between us and China a couple of times Larry Kudlow today confirmed that [noise]\nDo long ways from it actually happening but Kudlow comes from the U.S President Trump and Chinese President Xi we'll talk at the G twenty we'll find out from Naomi what that might mean right now\nCurrent price times one thousand acres carry the one these days it's hard to make\nThe mess we're for your soybean fields and to be a chef liberty wing system with liberty herbicides makes it easier to start with the two most bushels per acre you'll to manage that in lower system input cost a more complete we can fool you get an extra thirty three dollars more and more profit potential break beard as grow Roundup Ready to extend sores\nBut there are some people out there that are pushing really really hard no on ... or on corn\nI asked you about soybean yoga earlier what do you think own own corn you mean it was a bit of a surprise to us he backed off that corn yield six cents a bushel from September to October can we see that continue\nUm again I don't think we see it get much smaller I think it'd be an change to ah just because of the producers that I talk to throughout the Midwest\nThe corn yield really seemed to be there there's a few taxing issues in parts of Iowa a bet the corn yield consistently seems to be there whereas the sleeping you know that's been a different story from that two week break that we had with all that rain\nUh the the menial seemed to be reduced for the most people that I talk to you but I'm here in pretty good deal on corn I don't think it's getting bigger though I really don't\nUm but yeah I just don't think you see any major changes to that\nOkay what do you want to do with corn right now I mean in let's say that the bins are full you've got to move some corn into the market uh what kind of a strategy do you like doing there\nSo just depending on people's risk tolerance and there's not a right or wrong answer to this ah for those who are OK with using futures contracts I Would say it would be okay to go ahead and buy a march futures or July or even up to December depending on the time that\nIs appropriate for you what your situation I mean when you're actually making your cash sale if you're looking to do something that does not involve\nA call 'em a margin call then I Would say go ahead and look at the march call options if you look at a seasonal chart of march corn futures they start to work higher I'm most years from November into late February\nNow I Will be quite honest and say twenty cents might be all you get as far as the future Israeli between\nToo late February now I Will be quite out on us to say twenty cents might be all you get as far as the futures rally between now and then because of again the fundamentals being what they are with bigger supplies um but hey twenty cents as is twenty cents\nIn this marketplace you got to try to scrape and get every little bit that you can't so in March corn or you can do\nThree eighty calls you can do the three Ninety calls and and the cost is anywhere depending on what you're looking at um ten to Fifteen cents and so that gets you until the end of February it gets you through all of this harvest it gets you through elections that gets you through crop reports the big year end report and into South American production\nSo it is okay for a time and I think when you see a return on it and you got to make sure you're grabbing it and don't be lazy about it and even have your open orders out there working as a profit order and an capitalize on any opportunity that you say for a rally 'cause we're stuck with this kind of same old news until we get\nAgain the election was done and\nOur negotiations more complete with China\nRight right Naomi how do you make the decision if that makes more sense to\nSell it and replace of what the call up and versus hey okay I may be out of storage here on the farm but I still think there's a rally common there's some commercials storage available to me how do you make that decision to either go ahead and sell it and replace it or just move it into storage in commercials so\nYeah so what I Do with my clients as I asked them to call the elevator and find out specifically what if they're going to cost you for storage per month what are the extra little fees and then we do the math as far as like let's say a class on storage for every month between now and July so\nYou're looking at what nine months of time eight months' time time's a nickel or you're looking at forty cents and you need the futures market and the cash market to rally forty cents to pay for your storage\nSo we think about what are the odds of that happening we talk about the timing of their cash sales as far as doing you know when do they need income for their farm what is their tax year all of those types of things and then we'll talk about is it realistic to see if if current rally that forty cents or not\nDepending on their thoughts my thought we'd see if it's a good idea for them or not and if they say you know what I don't think I Want to do that then that's okay make the cash down now but then we look at is it worthwhile than to bought by collapsing and sometimes the answer is yes it is and sometimes the answer is no it's not so every\nTime you do those marketing decision you have to take a half hour and sit down and think about it and and do the math all of it behind it and then you have a decision that's made on black and white information versus emotional and kicking the can down the road and you can write in your book are putting your computer this was what I did this is why we did it\nAnd we go back and think about it later it takes the emotion out\nI Love that write it down because but if you are kicking yourself later you look back at those notes and it explains the while you're doing it and you know the point that you're making Naomi\nIs if it's not I guess it's map Mm\nMhm math\nI mean it it ... it really is you just need to take the time do the research understand completely and put the numbers together one last thing I Do know Naomi what you got to say that this guy on Twitter at Dell O'Brien he says PG you coming

I'll tell it again tomorrow D'Leisha I'll be on it was really cool huge ... I think he's really talented and obviously big shoes to fill when I took over that time slot when he moved to nine in eastern section on in the morning Pacific\nThat's already never gets old for me because it's\nOne of those sort of seminal moment for me as a reporter because there's a transitional period me from writer to television person and it was just an experience about\nHow some guys understand how the camera work it was it was like you know I used to cover politics early in my career reminds me of that\nWhen the lights would go off some of those politicians were so charming and cool I'm In ... some of those guys were not also just had a revelation\nAnd Stewart and trace it probably too young for the film mean girls Lindsey low hand while you children come on\nHave you heard of the nineties cool just checking every known existed\nLiberal on cars mellow is a ...\nOf course Paul is present nobody except for mellow and LeBron and Dwayne wade\nThere the mean girls the SBA liberal tons of the queen bee or these ongoing quaint and he tries to get too involved but they're the mean girls\nChris poll being a phoney Dwayne wade bragging but you know just looking at people's elbows breaking Kobe's nose or the all star game mellow super\nIn this analogy attractive but really insecure no relationship work out there the girls on the national basketball\nAssociation it's amazing\nThe other thing and just to give you some insight on on Chris falls I was a\nI Can't I got to give out the story but I was out\nWith a sore shortly after that Chris Paul\nSince I after I reported that Chris Paul story and then told us right just told you and the source had a real strong connection to Chris ... one of the people he was representing are working with had a strong connection to his followers organization or issue label or whatever the case of a very strong connection\nAnd we're having drinks in the way sourcing works you build trust you get information you trade information and I said it's before my I was never a doors and ask you try to break destroy that story I Want to know what was going on what was real and then write columns my opinion based on was actually going on\nAnd I wanted to be right I didn't want us to be a bunch of hot air\nAnd so I Would cultivate relationship and trying to get into around the NBA and other league's most of the NBA in the NFL and this guy started just\nGiving me all this dirt on ... grade seven Chris' point like amazing stuff so like if I could fact check stuff that was incredible and finally what do you do what are you doing\nThis connection if your client thing whatever person is connected to Chris and they're going to do that I shouldn't do it but Chris balls the worst just wanted to come back to me I became this repository for Chris Paul negative information and all and I'm not trying to pile on I just\nThe ... thing I think needs to be seen through a certain context\nAnd some of you were tweeting that middle Jeremy just tweeted ... J. G. treated for trying to support or a TR love and believe your CPA three story thank you but there was a clear video Renault spit in his face you just don't do that Paul was right to react\nI watched the video and and I'm not sure I see the same way and maybe it's my personal experience to see be three shaping how I've seen it but his explanation that he had a mouse guard makes sense to me and I told her story last week I had a weird interaction with somebody who was screaming at me on the streets of New York city and they got so angry they kind of spin on my face all that but not like\nYou know so what does that affect their just you know when all sound effect just like it came you know do you ever\nPeople gets I mean I had a buddy we want to like grow you just like\nTotally just spray of my glasses on my face can you just so so again like did he actually ...\nI don't think so but you're right you don't spit on somebody's face and you don't punch somebody in the ... I'm not going to the Senate and it was awesome I did think it was awesome but it's not okay right like it's not okay I Know is that okay I just think there's a certain context that needs to be put out there as of a laser cripple\nAnd I said this earlier I'm going to be wrong I may annoy you you may wonder why can't do math I Hope you like to show you may not so have you do some of you don't but I'm not going to lie to you and this isn't a place where I'm going to be an authenticity will rule here in Sony's will have no space for this for this in this radio show\nAnd trust and that's costing me before my last radio show when I was in LA and I told the store on the radio a lot I did not anticipate ironically that CBS Sports radio LA affiliate would go away the clippers would be a free agent and they would become partners with my company and then ask if I might be fired like that but that's part and I know that's part of the deal when you tell the truth you tell the truth in my business\nThere are going to be consequences but I was told long time ago and I think is great advice in in the media business if you're gonna fail you might as well fails yourself\nBecause people who've tried to fail is phony he's usually are more likely to fail and they failed somebody else\nIn this space on this show nobody gets a free pass if they're found these especially a phony steak tough guy terrible team may fall leader bad guy bully chemistry killing hypocrite like Chris Paul it's what he is and we're going to stay here on the show\nAnd Chris if you're listening you self centered diva fake or eight five five to one to four CBS be more of a man that you've ever been and give me a call I Know you've actually you've probably is listening is Ron and using these guys tend to listen\nNot a fan of the human being that I've interacted with and it turns out I'm not alone I already knew that I didn't need right of the time I did a bunch of reporting on\nOf the cool things about being a reporter formerly investigative reporter magazine report all that regularly stuff and I learned how to collect information and so when I haven't seen some people especially at a time when I was writing\nIt was really empowering to go out and find out whether I was right or whether I was wrong are quick phone call if I Do want to for CBS quick phone call on this\n\n\n\nYou're listening to later then you don't call him through a lot of shows I've never called your show in fact I'm not sure over recalled anybody's show before but I Do enjoy your show and I listen to it in the evenings here and I love your perspective I like it that you're not afraid so that's the big reason why I listen\nTo each lighter than you would bill later\nWhat's going on welcome back thanks for being here we're going to put the ball on this cruise Paul topic at least for now we're gonna take a call or two more on CBS portrayed as toll free line it's eight by five to one to four to seven is broad you buy guy go everybody's bill here's a quick way you could say money's which the guy go do you need homeowners runners a motorcycle insurance to get it all\nThat guy go dot com will take a caller to\nFinish up the cruise Paul conversation and then we'll get to the marvelously talented Charles Davis talk a little football you can hear Charles of course on see Charles as well and in the fall and thoughts on the weekends Kevin in North Carolina appreciate you listen to the man you're on CBS Sports radio\nWriter you cannot be any more on top of the deal with this Chris Paul and I and I think what people forget is that they're documented a court\nExample that it's called them I mean this guy in college and in the pros punch several men in their private parts with a sucker punch with which is the worst punk move that you can ever make\nAnd this is not haters document this not here I mean there's something wrong with somebody does something like that and what you say fits right in with that kind of personality type and I'll I'll this more off the air thanks a lot\nOf egg buddy was the wells that man you know poll\nCorals so\nAt the loan ... on Twitter tweet sports writers for jury I T E R just a reminder there's so many member of the time Chris Paul went up to boogie\nAlthough he was a member of the kings and and put his hand on bugging them through themselves backwards in soccer and the soccer sort of phony falling move the guy is is a phony he needed it he just is a five five to one to\nFour CBS is the phone number eight by five to one to force you to be as there are so much of it get to\nThe NBA is going on the world series is you're not as the world series Dodgers Red Sox and now obviously the national football league in the throes in the middle of a really incredible season and we're always fortunate when we're trying to to get our arms around\nWhat the right perspective is on the NFL to talk to one of my favorite people every time 'cause I always bounced around on Sunday ticket every time I hear the voice of Charles Davis Fox and analysts NFL on Fox on Sundays that perk up you know I'm about to get a lot smarter just listen to him talk so it's very cool Charles again joined us right now on the show Charles what's going on man\nHey how you doing thanks for having me back I appreciate it\nThank you for being here so I I every week I Love it I Love it every week I get to ask about\nPatrick my home's [laughter]\nSeven games this season the game last year isn't isn't big enough sample size that whatever\nWe want to drop out whatever conclusions we want to drop off ... moms it's reasonable to draw them\n[noise] I think we we can say that I'm Still waiting for the bumps because that's what I find out about a quarter back\nYou know they they have to go through them and they all do every one of them who's in the hall of fame and everyone were fitting for a jacket\nHad stretches where you just wonder why what's going on\nInterceptions bad decisions couldn't get it couldn't get the team in the end zone he's really not gone through that so far I think what's wild to me is what would have cancer they six\nAnd one right now yeah is that the record six in one yeah\nHe had one started last year in the throwaway game down the stretch\nForget they start to the NFL\nIt doesn't feel like it I Know it feels like he's at you know eighty start\nBut I Want to see when that happens now I Will tell you\nI Believe he's going to be just fine I'm not worried about that I think you'll go through the bumps and come out the other side it\nIn five fashion but that's when you really truly find out that that is not just these ride I speak to so many things so well but I've just seen that too many times let's see what happens when that adversity adversity kicks in let's see what happens when\nHe's ten of twenty eight for the game and and he has to have lashed driving a cheap need\nThose sorts of things I think we saw a little bit of it earlier this year we've got a taste of it but you need more than more than this bottom line though I'm betting on this kid believe me\nDraw Davis here on CBS portrayal Charles the one and it was a big glaring weaknesses achieves entering this past weekend was\nThe chief defense that they hold the bangles to just end points Arab Barre and Justin Houston still not in the field hopefully they'll both feedback or are you buying the idea that the cheese defense can improve are you buying the idea that at the end of the year now now the end of the year the cheese are going to belong in the conversation of real Super Bowl contenders\n[noise] yeah I'm going to buy it and and here's why because in recent years you know we look\nYou don't belong in the conversation of real Super Bowl contenders\n[noise] yeah I'm going to buy it and and here's why because in recent years you know we look I grew up with the old you know often sells tickets defense wins championships right I grew up with that when the defense at the end had to be strong had to be this has to be that okay\nI think defense has to be functional now\nDoes that make sense defense has to be able to make a play when you need one or come up with a couple of\nNow nobody ... going to leave the air until seven o'clock tomorrow morning maybe within twenty five miles north of Nebraska programming continues on translator came to nine zero Eighteen Eduardo fine point nine FM\nYou remember what Atlanta went to the super bowl and really should have one is we all know yeah do you remember what their defenses right that year\nI don't actually if if it was it was like somewhere between twenty six twenty nine\nOkay overall it was a tough you know they they weren't exactly a shutdown group but they were opportunistic you know they could make some place you remember the first half what they did with New England so that they they were able to ride that you know the second one I come up with is last year a Super Bowl\nThirty eight thirty three\nTom tom Brady is in the midst of carving 'em up for five hundred plus throwing the ball Nick Boles is going to be the MVP with three Seventy plus throwing it and then catching what\nAnd what was the biggest play the game\nBrandon ground that late past rush coming from inside on it on a on a ... a a a fast rush knocks while the hands of Brady they kick a field goal to go up a and put the extreme pressure on New England they threw one in the end zone at the end it completes but you get the idea\nDrunk you make a play during that time frame ... defense do that or you in Kansas City has passed Russia's ... they'll get Justin used them back but yeah I think they'll continue to get better but they don't have to be locked down with the way their office why\nCharles the NFC North is such an interesting division the bears have the best point differential in that division they're three and three and a lion seemed to figure it out and for some bumps early on for math Patricia and the Packers delivering Rogers and the Vikings and forward to in one or Todd that division of one I think three in a row who do you like coming out of the ... the north\nI I still like Minnesota because I was really impressed with early in the season you know with the new toys was all the expectations and they get off to a what a one two in one start\nAnd he remembers him Mike Zimmer going to the podium and see if I remember correctly or two and two to start last year\nThat was his version of of Aaron Rodgers Arielle ...\nYou know and they've done it without ever seen Griffin one of the better pass Russia's in the league has given um double digit sat at least the last three seasons so they're talking about him coming back now\nHow much he will be effective\nIs that the best thing for him to be back in this environment I leave that to the experts but they've done it as you mentioned the last three games without him and they've got a monster what is the New Orleans coming to town but I still like Minnesota coming out now I Love has put a new quarterback on notice though you got that did you\nYou better clean up those levels in the pocket\nBecause that's been a problem for Kurt cousins his entire career and if there's one thing you want to get on the bad side\nKeep making plays out often put his defense\nIn a tougher situation in a bad spot\nYou will incur the wrath of them that's for\nSure but I think Minnesota's the best team in that position\nAre you buying\nThe bears nagging ... is a trio not now but are we seeing signs of a couple of ... maybe next year a couple of years I never really really good football team\nI think so and I was buying it pre season I think I talk to people in the Chicago market and you know it's real easy to be\nYou know I'll be when you know you're talking in the market of that team hey I think they're going to go to the Superbowl [laughter] no\nBut I did say and I think they would back the up in that market\nThat even before the season they were going in the way of the rams right that that model the rams gave us Sean McVeigh Matt Lauer for coming in changing you know help me off and getting Jared gas going the whole deal that's why ... they're I mean they had to get someone to get Michel ... who they drafted number two\nOverall in two thousand Seventeen they've got to get him right if you don't have him right you don't have a team\nAnd I just thought that was a great move they surrounded them with better receivers they upgraded the opposite of line you know the runners were there they did the right things I thought they had a chance to win nine going into the season and that was before the ... the\nNow they've had a taste of it they lost when they shouldn't have I think in Miami and they realized people going to take 'em for real now now max got a bad ankle but all in all I think down the road and the thing to remember just like my home's", "show_name":
