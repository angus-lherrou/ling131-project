brewers against the Dodgers will dive into that with Scott Miller from bleach report in about\nProbably Fifteen or twenty\nMinutes an hour from this moment read for grade my calls it gets to be a sports MBA right or will be on the show reads a great dude good friend of mine very connected been making the rounds LA Utah he's been everywhere so we'll get his perspective on a bunch of topics including\nThe drama unfolding in\nHis home town of Minneapolis, Minnesota Shannon's reported today over the athletic\nQuote several players spoke up\nIn players only meeting but butler let it may known as issues with management his message was similar to display Wednesday I run this he's far too competitive ... real games\nAnd as part of his reporting said that there was a heartfelt situation in which he expressed himself but then still whatsoever sometimes you've got a little uh\nA little push the little fake news I hate that term little fake news allegation\nThat is correct so as Jeff T actually came back saying um it wasn't no players meaning you just made that up bro yoga relax with this fake news\nRight at went right asked champs right ... on Twitter yep I I mean it's hard to know Shamsi\nIs a very good reporter studied was the protege of Adrian words now ski and I've heard votes talked before about ... years ago just how he was going to be a star\nAnd he was a lot like ... motors younger and at least as it relates to oh that's a guy when he writes something report something it is a hundred percent accurate chapters great I I don't know that she has earned that yet right I'm not sure if GM's has gotten to that point yet and so it's hard to know what's going on and what really happened here's a certainly though\nJimmy Butler does not mess around there is an intensity there was a ferocious nist to his competitive spirit that lends itself when necessary to a\nRemarkable level of aggression\nAnd getting in people's faces ... which I happen to respect I think\nAnd you don't I don't think the Jimmy ... of the world should be doing it just for sport because they can\nBut one of the hardest things for people to do in in group environments and work environments because ...\nWork is not a social endeavor even those the social aspects dominant right Jimmy ... there's not there to be best friends with crime and towns around your way he's not but those things usually shape one way or another what's going on it's hard for people to look other people in the eye and say you suck\nYou're a bad person you're a bad team made you don't work hard enough you're lazy you're full of crap\nIt would not shocked me of some versions of those things as it relates to the situation in Minnesota where communicated\nCross as any towns and Andrew weekends and frankly\nThey probably need to hear it but really for plus scene and confusing thing about this game by the way just a a a quick update\nVery first play the game the giants\nOn the initial kick return\nAppeared to fumble the football but I think the ruling\nThe play down that it came out after\nThe kick return or hit the ground\nWill keep you updated\nWhat the situation is what the deal is here on Thursday Night Football that's the ... everybody who gambled everybody who gamble\nOn the game which is like are you kidding me have you been on the giant or like me and said twenty months ago I should take the eagles but I think I'm going to go with the giants 'cause I've got a gut feeling yeah a gut feeling that I'm a moron is what it felt like in that moment but it's a\nIt is he lie and coke coming out and doing their thing they're going to get to this is the only thing about about the NFL right\nThe game has been going on for a second eight seconds a full boil them played and we're in now on a booth review so we're all going to do him a great big pause and wait and see the deal is what are you guys the and the guys that look like a ...\nYeah I Know it looks like he was down very clearly and this is a frustrating thing I reviews fine and get it right but you're right there eight seconds and they missed an easy caller i._d. now they're reviewing an easy miss call and they got it right so he didn't take didn't take long\nHe just left in the air came down and the base of hold the ball ball at the ground right ball close contact it's not a ground cause a formal exactly yeah I mean I and I get getting a ride to and to be fair to the NFL\nI Do think I Do think that the products been really\nNo turnovers the finals inclusion\nThe fish and he's been awful and the flags and in the ... in the past there but the actual like football when it's not being locked up and messed up\nBy the officiating cruise very inexperienced but a lot of fun to watch the game this year and we haven't talked\nHardly at all about anthem protests about the president's complaints about the left and the ride and the various perspectives and football that is a huge win for the national football league and I saw the other day that despite some of the\nTurmoil ratings have not falling off markedly things are going pretty well for the national football league\nIt's almost like and I wonder if both sides of the argument\nGot instead of having NFL fatigue ... fans got political fatigue and the run afoul of it to reverse itself a little bit out that's the case because I Do love ... I Love the NFL and we are never afraid to talk about those topics here on the show if they're\nPart of the deal part of the guys part of what's going on in the real sports but I'd much rather be talking about football itself than football as it's playing itself out Stewart how's your fancy might lead by the way you talk to la smack when you'd be me where you at what's your record there bro\n... very good I Believe I'm two and three right now I'm just a just a bit of a struggle that we have a turnover in this game by the way but yeah my ... even nearly idols struggled\nWhat what can you give us a I I did not hosting the national review I did not or\nIs it a ... is it a lot of men interception that's right that's right or he lie he lies and I want to lie to be so good because I hate it will be J give him a hard time and I hate\nWhat Matt could do did to him last year but age does catch up to everybody\nEagles with the big turnover and again those\nI'm so glad I actually when we're doing the top of the hour segment I was like I was sort of talking myself and the giants I was looking around like I Want to get a hold of my buddy who's in Vegas\nI Wonder how far is from the sports book and just get a little money down a little money down the giants looks like the eagles in a great great position eight five five two and two for CBS is the phone or I'm going to go on this old Jimmy about one thing but I think I'm not going to do any more that we haven't talked about the MBA are you looking forward to we've got to squeeze in the NBA talked pretty soon\nWe do it starts Tuesday I'm I Know if you knew that but it it starts a\nAway I I didn't quite get\nThe NBA season starts on Tuesday that's right the sixteenth Tuesday I thought that ship has sailed but I I I guess uh I guess it has and they are an MBA guy no I that's that's a great that's a great that's a great point him and think that that I should you know while says it so it starts\nIn October is when the NBA season starts and not November October October sixteenth a dramatic got really ... in fact Sammy Mack who's a a good friend of mine in a very good dude now the athletic and I think that's\nSilver sixteenth or do not it got really ... back there I mean who's a a good friend of mine in a very good dude now the athletic I think that's because every single writer in America now works at the athletic but to introduce people from just bringing a rider from we just assume that the athletic\nOther than Scott Miller who's for the moment please report right after over the Olympic in three weeks rather than to go a tent may make now work at the Atlantic and he wrote a really interesting story that's out now about Jeanie Buss\nAnd her impact and her influence on the brawn James and the role that she's taking in that organization now say I'm going to be on the show tomorrow but he got a lot of inside he's a great reporter and it really gets into Jeannie role I consider him and he had a friend but\nShe's a source that I'm friendly with I'm I'm a fan of her I think she might be the best donor in sports and certainly in the NBA and he gets into why that is why the brunt trust of her with his brand in his world his situation so\nTo get it done Avon do onto for CBS is the number of Scott Miller believes report or we're going to have a really great\nA really great a conversation was got milk because the way it works is what we do is we reach out to various gas right I I've been a guest on the radio and say hey\nWe got a four hour show we take it really seriously were very very grateful when the audience was able to to make some some time for us and Scott Miller agreed to come on the show so we're going to do a quick interview Scott who take our time and your time very very seriously a Scott\n[noise]\nCool Scott how are things are hardly check it out of bleach report\n[noise]\nSounds great just real real quick I just want to get your ... your sounds like you're real busy I'm In good run wanted to know you know Dodger brewers you let us know you're in Milwaukee and uh and you're promoting the book they want us to tell people about what um who do you like in the Dodgers a brewer series\n[noise]\nWow that's pretty edgy um I I Know you're not covering the American leagues are things got a Miller from police report but it was real quick if a if you could\nWould you mind given us a a really long in depth Scott Miller s breakdown of the red Sox astro series\n[noise]\n\nResearch [noise]\nA biologist last but not least because we're people who are worried um we say we're gonna do something we we do it Scott has a great book to promote I could promote it's got just tell us about you know this wonderful book that you've written\n[noise]\nShow for the interview or give us a couple of minutes does and not me but you the\nListener religion I don't want to waste your time and if you're looking for the interviewed re looking forward to some baseball I Apologize I'm [laughter] I'm\nTold her that those that Scott Miller good jobs got good a good job broke really really appreciate the time if I if I Do want to for CBS is the phone number one thing about the NFL that that I absolutely love is that\nAnd jokes about the name of the show I get stuff around but I Try really hard not to I Try really hard to do a ton of research\nI Am lucky to be fairly well connected from my years a newspaper reporter and a columnist and it's a I guess a lot of writers become radio or some writers become radio host but it's there's an advantage to it because at least for me I didn't play the game right I I didn't play this hall of fame level like tiki did a so for me but it sort of my\nWhat I Hope I can offer you other than guess who always show up when they when they say they're going to is being fairly connected and I feel like with certainly the NBA and and and major league baseball and USC and some of those words have covered\nI feel very connected in those things if you if you talk to the right people they play themselves out in a fairly easy to follow a pattern fairly easy you know all the different ...\nAnd I know a lot of people around the NFL these days\nI thought the giant I didn't think they were going to be amazing but I thought they were going to be a lot\nAnd then a lot of there's a lot of football the play but he looks so shaky early on\nThey really could start the season one and five that is an author and total failure\nAnd yet sometimes and we don't know I think pat ... has the potential be really good and really interesting\nAuthor and total failure\nAnd yet sometimes and we don't know I think pat ... has the potential be really good and really interesting obviously the guy's extremely frustrated and he was a very highly regarded all kinds of coordinator who came last year from Minneapolis out now in New York City he doesn't have the quarter back to the needs and I\nI like ... a person as best I sort of the little that I've been around him I like him as a quarterback and what he has done historically and I thought he got treated\nReally unfairly I thought it was agreed this last year and it's worth pointing out for those people that I got ... ... it was right the aftermath could do to win away or after he I Can't remember buckled on broad Eli back he lived through for like four hundred and some yard she had this massive game\nBut that was almost a year ago that's a long time in the life of a quarterback until I was telling the guys were talking about there's all this perception all this perspective that sake lump Barclays the wrong guy that they should not\nThat's a ridiculous play by the way there was a tip just now that\nI don't even know who caught it as a court Clemente is that who was or was it I don't know her who just picked up this duck sometimes they are going well for you or I don't support the traffic was the wrong pick I think he's a he's potentially at once in a generation telling these were remarkably impressive and the arguments going to go I could've drafted Arnold truer Rosen sure Alan true\nOr they get a certain point giants fans and I know this is a tough pill to swallow\nI think he's going to start rooting for the eagles I mean I think a certain point you got to be like\nWhoever warplanes who are rooting for because you go one in Fifteen you go to and fourteen you might just take one Berkeley Andrew quarterback of the future\nNext year and and Tom talked about a general does a a he's a great website through life analogy dot com crash quarterbacks\nAre who want to be the quarterback of the future for the giants Thomas if you are if you were making this low it's\nAn interesting year it's still kind of hard to tell but I think Justin Herbert isn't elite so far from Oregon and I actually think you'd be a great fit on this off and he's got an incredible cannon for an arms of the down field passing a concerns go away and then I just think he's a good athleticism fit in the ... with Barclay so I think that would work\nAh Ryan's family from NC State has gotten some hype also being one of the top of the draft type quarterbacks and we'll Greer was my personal favorite from West Virginia which has you know all kinds of weird question marks yet a PD suspension yet at three interception day against Kansas\nA couple of Saturdays ago this past Saturday um\nSo it's still up in the air with him I think Justin ... whereabouts for July, July is not played at this level it's unfortunate because I thought he might now as he's going to get drafted it's probably going to be second\nThird the third round he'll try to be awesome because Barry autumn doesn't what he's doing\nThis ... this he's got a great arm and I listen I think the giants hit it on Barclay and I'm as big a ... as you can find and I said it's still early or haven't even sweeter than\nNon adjustment I Can't give it all and I think the ... I was a giant metal it up and I would have picked Donald if I wasn't day Gettleman spot however I think they hit with Barclay and I think Barkley is going to become the best running back in the NFL I quickly I\nI agree and I also think you know the game as of all so much that these running backs that are dual threats as receivers and running backs and we've seen that from ... Gurley we've seen that from Alvin Kamara we've seen that to a lesser extent from ...\nI mean you get him with the right quarterback and the right off and obey Jane sick want Barclay already in place if you could just add liking alive but it doesn't matter the game catches up to be able to just you can get their ... get the ... guy\nI mean the giants can be and I thought to be honest I thought that's what they have this year I thought he had another year in the tank I thought he'd be not a top ten quarterback but not a bottom ten quarterback somewhere in the middle of the pack and good enough you can't throw the football down the field the older from junior the office isn't going to work and I dropped the said earlier I think it's amazing so far this year\nHe lie manning has attempted attempted just Thirteen total passes of twenty yards or more in the air as even as he's on the ball that for this I don't think yesterday I like some of the wall and the people one time he's look\nWay off old old back him juniors touchdown pass the reception and last week is touchdown passes sake one Barclay for sixty some yards was twenty four yards in the air that means ... junior has thrown a longer\nThis year than Eli Manning Eli Manning has not had a touchdown reception\nA touchdown pass excuse me that he threw twenty four yards in the air is it doesn't include like a bubble screen were Barclay goes for whatever just throwing a touchdown pass which he's throwing the ball twenty yards in the are more since a week five of last season\n... junior did it last week on early and totally\nIs eagles team by the way and I'm trying to kind of watch all the goal was was\nWas was often me guys are they getting to him again he's been he's been harried all year he's been set the tone of times all kinds of wine has not protected him is that is what's 'cause he's got some air and throws is he getting or they get into really just looking rusty so far\nTwo times I've actually gotten to him and hit his arm all he's been in there at least the first time was that one you commented about the Aguilar catch it was a crazy all is that what happens after they got his arm kind then it happened again later on the drive and he he's had someone in his feet basically the whole game so far including on a touchdown pass react to scramble to his right out of the pocket that was a third downplaying\nThe reds onto any any ended up obviously making it for the lead everything else has been a little rougher for him\nYeah I mean you've got you've not of you have to be able you have to be able to protect\nCarson went especially coming off of that injury so we'll we'll keep you up\nTo date on it really by the way appreciate Scott Miller's um ... won't play a clip real quick just a a real quick just cliff I asked Scott I never repeat a pull a clip from an interview and the same say was so good ad Scott who's gonna win this dog is walking series\n[noise]\nShow of the interview event like this won't happen you know are just more than a thirty second heads up a notice I find a disrespectful to the listener I find it disrespectful to Stewart I find a disrespectful to Tom and I find disrespectful to me\nYou know you watch ... actually I'm gonna promote the book it's um it's really good it's called\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut little creatures that make noises at night where he likes he likes insects as well as baseball come on dude art eight five five to one to four CBS is the phone number eight five five to one to four CBS is the phone or if you want to call in and you want to weigh in\nThe more you all the more you can say if you have at least ten thousand dollars or more in credit card bills\nThis debt forgiveness program can be very effective\nCoal for free information and find out more now eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh there was no cost her observation for the information don't wait called eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh let's see hundreds to no one six six seven to get your debt problem solved called eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh today not available in North Dakota\nCBS Sports radio we saw in northeast Nebraska on AM seven eighty five point nine FM news talk W JAG north of\nThe\nOf destruction ...

I think at this point on him\nIn terms of his history of confused and trying to ignore his history and the post season\nWhich is not something you can ignore it for a couple of runners get on base of the first inning federally park is going to be a nervous maps and who knows what happens then he he unraveled against the Yankees ...\nVery quickly in in three or four batters and pick 'em out of the game so that first couple of innings ... shows on on the and I just thought that everybody's going to be paying very close to\nA ... of the Boston Globe with us I I got to ask\nYou though that they owe him so much money or what it has that turned into in Boston that relationship because he doesn't want to die out and they all and tons of money and I you know it's weird he hasn't been bad at all attempt against the Yankees and then\nYou talk about these postseason numbers as their atrocious so have you heard any rumblings at all of their you know this taste for the deal they gain and\nWell yeah certainly there is and at this point though there's not much they can do about it on either side of it he's not going to opt out and leave a hundred and twenty seven million dollars on the table because it's not that the any getting that free agency especially on what we saw last winter was free agents and the red Sox get movement but what what team is going to take any part of a hundred and twenty some\nGuy who kept the to the playoffs so it it's the situation I think they have to figure out a way to make it work and they have the pitching coach this year we had a very good regular season they're able to straighten out a few things along the way now he has ... when he faces the Yankees last week\nIt's something else that need to try to fix they can't give up on them they can't put 'em in the open you're not going to have a thirty two million dollar reliever\nSo one way or another they have to figure out a way to make it work for the next couple of years\nDo a ... year there every day or do you sense that his teammates are are down on him\nYou know it's funny I exactly the opposite they're not and ... are being around him for the last couple of years with his teammate he's one of the few starting pitchers who I see kinda crosses all the lines and in the clubhouse he hangs out with ... players you ain't got relievers\nHe's got friends you know different parts of the team a lot of times the starting pitcher is a kind of their own group they're on their own schedule play once every five days there were also like independent contractors but David is a guy who a lot of guys on the team get along with a lot of guys ... a lot of the other ... talk about what he's\nDone for them and and the advice he's given him that's been helpful so ... and it's been that way everywhere he's been he's been a part of the team right so if anything I get the idea of the clubhouse that they're all open so good they want something could happen for them because they all feel pretty good about it\nI got to tell you a this team is awesome I Love watching 'em play or they kicked the Yankees ass\nI got a day I mean literally selling the games in the Bronx I bet on the red Sox both games and I you know on your body and then I went with a poor cello and everybody said I was crazy I think they're just flat out better than the Yankees unless it tastes really good that champagne after ...\nWell yeah especially you know given the rivalry all season and the Yankees won the red Sox were the only sees that really the first place all year long\nAnd the red Sox clinched the American league east when they were in New York a couple of weeks ago than they were able to clinch obviously the other night when every Yankee Stadium that at the feel good for them\nAnd I think the red Sox got a little tired of hearing you know yeah they won the division but you know they're they're ... they're fallible there's things that you can do the Yankees are for power the Yankees have a better bullpen for a team that was the best team in terms of the criminal record I think the kind of went into that series feeling like there were people on the outside who doubted them and they had something to prove\nHigh everybody this is W.

know how long you ran it was like thirty forty yard abroad events dot com I got baseball Blass NHL boxing and on a daily fantasy it's all there sign up that I\nBy the way uh I hit those two Red Sox games at Yankee Stadium for you and uh I'm On the eagles tonight and I laid the three south Philly to win and lay the three\nBut I'm watching Texas Tech right now just putting a beating on ... every time he gets to lead they blow it in Texas that takes the lead Texas Tech in the winter is football game it looks like may they may not win but they're going to cover the seven there up now\nThey're going to go up Seventeen ...\nMaybe ... ...\nWhat's to review here oh they're saying he fumbled the bribes already over the goal line now did you see that play mafia that guy was over the goal line\nBy five feet\nBefore he bungled your reason [noise]\nYeah that's a touchdown there's no way there are given that ball to TCU the guy was over the goal line easily so what do you think of er and let me see if I'm wrong I Want to see it again\nOh he was over man this whole body was in\nIn the end zone you can't deny that right\nOver here it is right here he is still got that ball and he's over the goal line looked at as all bodies over\nAnyway what do you think it is a eagles a performance tonight because they were two and three and people are starting to say they were the super bowl jumps including me thirty one Thirteen to beat down they're putting on the giants I'll give you this\nBarclays having a huge game for the giants you just ran another touchdown in from like forty fifty yards the guy has been unbelievable he's the only reason to watch the giants except for maybe back on but back in ... only doing so much for being you know he's made a few catches and there's an app but\nBarclays the star he's the blame acre he's the touchdown make or am I wrong I've always said\nOn this show since the day they packed them I said that ... and I'm not even trying to be right I just said that he will end up being I Believe firmly without a doubt the all time uh\nWhen it's all send on all the time giant grade he will break every record as a running back and as a receiver\nOr out of the backfield he will have more touchdowns catching a ball and running after catch yards rushing and after ... than anyone ever when it's all said and done\nMight be a set of demand goes or the other guy like tiki was awesome for like five six years awesome and this guy will be awesome her for ten years I think he's going to have a huge career with the giants\nAnd I thought it was a great draft pick everybody says never draft a running back that high\nTen years I think he's going to have a huge career with the giants and I thought it was a great draft pick everybody's has never draft a running back that high but I think they're going to love this guy he's going to be an all time great unless he gets injured or something a catastrophic happens to them\nSo that nobody has gotten away from running backs being you know you don't have a main God for the most part so for a few teams was running back by committee a lot of teams go you'll pick these low regard like the eagles have done with all their guys right part but\nWhen you get a guy like that a guy like him a guy like do you have to go with it because when you have a guy that good God put one feels much time as long as you don't run into the ground injured or what about that too much where his gas during the season\nThen you've got a group situation with a guy like that and he's got loving cars for a hundred and twenty two yards on touchdown Levin point whatever advice\nTo watch the fact you're telling me that guy didn't just put his entire body and wait on top of that quarterback when he sacked him he like piled drove him into the ground and look his entire a pick them up nailed and then landed on top of them is that not the definition of that penalty\nWould be because at first it looked like his body we were going to go to the side and then he ... he jumped on his back and drove into the ground\nI mean I just I don't believe that they can't even explain these stupid ass rules they got in this league seriously because they said if you land on top of the quarterback and blood all your weight on um it's a\nPenalty every time and that time they didn't do it\nAnd I'm I'm like betting on ... so I could care less about the giants I've never been and never will be a giants\nFan but\nI think that ah\nI was certainly a giant fan when they play the patriots than those two Super Bowls I won't deny that I was a giant fan for you know five hours\nHowever long the super bowl days then they take about five hours to ... takes forever\nI cannot believe seriously I have to say this I cannot believe what's happened to TCU football I really honestly wasn't it just yesterday they were playing Ohio State and like the biggest game of the year and they were like you know\nIt was a war they were getting a twelve and what are I think Ohio State was laying there again and they and they they didn't cover or something like that they were laying some\nOf your memory when I turned ten and a half now whatever I I didn't cover\nSo all I Know is um [noise]\nThe sense that game that they lost right they have been terrible that may not\nHow do you not like seriously when this game at home\nAgainst taxes that I can see going there may be and losing in Lubbock but do you really believe 'cause I so in that game let's let's look back at it so Ohio State it was they were getting Thirteen and they are they covered they lost forty nine twenty eight\nNumber and then they went to Texas and the last thirty one sixteen than they beat Iowa State at home by three\nThe more you all the more you can save\nIf you

thirty void there again all eagles all day All right so let's tied to Christian cable the athletic he covers the Washington Huskies how you doing Christian\nI'm doing good how are you doing man so uh I I really liked this football team and now I Know that day uh struggled in that\nA game of Jordan hair or wherever they play that game against Auburn I I thought it was down there but they lost a Twenty one sixteen but since then they have a gun on quite a role they destroyed everyone\nUh they went to Salt Lake and beat you die that that was impressive I took him in that game at rice adults and then against a Arizona State that beat him by seven BYU they blew out and then he UCLA I didn't think they looked as good but I thought to UCLA finally played a good football game for the first time for chip Kelly but the husky still one again what do you think and his role there on\nYeah you know I think um some of the problem areas that they identified coming out of that offered game which was a little bit of miscommunication up front on the offensive line and um you know not being able to get off the field a few times on third down and you know the running game was a really totally clicking the way they wanted to I think\nI'm the kind of taken steps or were they all kinds of lines Dylan a little bit they're playing without their their star left tackle tray out to to have surgery early on and hasn't been available but [noise] the ... kind of filled in for him and uh\nYou know they're communicating better that seem to be on on the pay the same page a little bit more often and uh as a result they run the ball well Jay Brown and has been able to sit back there and um have a little bit more time to throw that he did those first few games and that they made him more confident and he's been more efficient and\nYou know the defenses as talented as as everybody thought it was and you know kind of last week at UCLA was\nUh the the one time since the Auburn game where they didn't really look all that dominant but um you know for the most part they they've been um lights out so yeah I think the the fences kind of\nStarting to Jill starting to come together and maybe catch up to the level of the fact that playing out all season\nSo they lead now and then north good they're undefeated in a conference and they lead Stanford and I thought Stanford has had a couple of bad games if you ask me and then or now you're taking on Oregon who as one in one in the ... they're desperate\nI didn't get out in this football game because you know what I Believe that there anyone seven lean against Stanford they lose this game basically they're done\nYeah certainly they're they're out of a sea of contention with with a law than it would be difficult to be a tough mountain for them to climate the actual north\nBanding says well I'm In you know I I think just in terms of proving themselves as a a real a chicken tender and I I watch Oregon I really like him are like they're often it's obviously made a lot about just Herbert you look like a a real solid NFL prospect these big big army Iranians athletic moving the pocket\nBy time for himself and make every throw it all that and so\nYou know they're they they got a lot of play makers and a lot of talent um but there I I think their schedule is\nMake every throwing all that and so you know they're they they got a lot of play makers and a lot of talent um but there\nI I think their schedule is short on opportunities to really prove that they're for real in terms of you know getting a nice quality win against a ranked opponent against a highly respected opponent um had a chance to do that against Stanford and it\nSlipped through their fingers a little bit but now of course as you mentioned even Stanford is his kind of had some of their shy and removed so\nUm yeah I mean this is a chance for them to a avenge ah last last two seasons blowouts against Washington and you know prove that they're Oregon's kinda back under Mario crystal ball in his first year and I should be a great environment at the stadium is it always is\nDo you think teams would cover from a games like that then the Dodger blue that game against at Stanford because I I don't think they do\nYou know I I definitely think that can be a factor the next week um but you know they they seem to\nRegroup and in their next game and and went out and beat a a calcium that I think is probably a little bit five years a lot of people assume it had been pretty solid on defense than\nUm seemed to be coming along pretty well there and under under Justin Wilcox and uh you know they went into Berkley in and took care of them pretty well and put a bunch of points on the board and enforce it turnovers and\nYou know I went back and forth all week I I ended up picking Washington by a point which I I don't love picking against the the statue of a team playing the second of a back to back a\nRINO to two consecutive road games playing the second of those games against the team that was coming off of it by a week I usually doesn't go well for the road team and those scenarios but um you know I just think\nWashington kinda improve some certain things that week by week even though last week scored and really show and I think there were some things that\nAre offensive Lee they they kind of continued to build on against UCLA and um you know I I I think that they're running game is good enough at this point and Jake brownies look confident enough and you know that that secondaries talented enough that\nUm yeah I just I I think they take it in a close one I don't not quite there in Oregon yet in terms of their ability to to take down a lot of your own experience talented\nOpponent like washing especially one with\nUm you know I'm a top five top ten caliber defense so uh I Would not be at all surprised the Oregon when\nA might to wish I could change my mind two or three more times before kickoff but I think it's going to be a hell of a game I think this is a great match up think these two teams match up really well and um you know I think everybody's in for a treat come twelve thirty Saturday\nYeah

Corey climate was back and he had sixty nine total yards and to score and it it definitely helps that the defense was able to get pressure on the giants at either forced them into shorter\nDrives or keep them out of the end zone\nIt's after hours where they need more it's on CBS Sports radio I an ego with the calls on the west would one radio network so huge division victory for the eagles ... what could be the turning point to their season I'm going to remember this I even wrote it down in my notes weeks sex turning point for the eagles\nQuestion mark because it's the best they looked so far this see them a with ... with the authentic despite their losses they not only were able to protect their deepest the secondary I'm ... but the deep end then gave the ball right back to the off into was ready to go with it\nAnd it helps when you're playing with a lead on the road that crowd inside metlife already\nSubdued by a turnover that happened within the first couple of weeks weeks sorry first couple of minutes I don't know where they came up\nWith it in the first couple of minutes and so it it kind of lead to some confidence and a right away you feel like you've delivered the

catches that looked like a higher degree of difficulty ah we always see\nUh what we get there on the the eagles side from Zach earth he's really reliable else on Jeffrey had a couple of touchdowns as well as nearly a hundred yards\nA window small would along with Cory climate and climate was back after a couple of weeks away so it was a total team effort I'm Still hung up on the way the defense got to manning and the fact that they were able to hit him or knocking down twenty five percent of the giants snaps\nThat doesn't even count the pressure in which they actually uh we're close but didn't get him or where they forced the giants into a a player into something they didn't want to do often simply\nSo that's one game won divisional battle a and we're often running into weeks six and I'm Wondering because going into this game between the eagles and giants we talked about how both these teams are desperate for a win who else is most desperate for a win this week\nOn the NFL slate\nAnd it's easy to say the cardinals 'cause they only have one victory they last we just got off the ... and picked up their first when they're on the road at the Vikings um ... it's also easy to say\nTrying to think of who I mean would have been easy to say the giants have all the falcons it's easy to say they're desperate for a wind but what about some of the other teams uh who are kind of on the verge of either like the eagles turning this thing around or sinking farther back into pretender ville\nI Wonder if that's a real place somewhere in the United states it might be some crazy

at least for the first half of the game\nAnd then handed over to your both and the game plan that affects the cuter properly certainly could work well against the Dodgers\nAnd so far none of the starters have lasted longer than five innings seven per ... council just as someone who used to pitch in the big leagues what's your reaction to that the fact that a quality start like what we got from ... review and Clinton crew shops and games wanting to for the Dodgers and the N O D s stacked the rarity now we are the average\nThat I Know it it it's a kind of a sad I guess time but I also get it to him in the name of the game is to win and if teams are ... are OK with it\nBut the funny quotes after I guess it was the wild card game when we Severino through four innings and after the game or judges took a post game interview and he had said it was like listen for an exam erases really all you can ask and I remember thinking wow yes things have changed a little bit like this this is a\nThis is a feeling now that is resonating throughout the ... about that they're actually looking at even their best stars and big situations and say listen to that gets boring five if you're lucky you'll take it and that's because when you have a boat and like the Yankees near the bullpen like\nOther walkie roars and that's what your team is built on 'em and all this talk about facing an order a third time through a everyone is starting to gain that does it get the philosophy and it's getting a lot of traction and makes a lot of sense\nAnd I love watching including Kirsch I'll throw eight innings I think we all still like seeing those games chair of the reality is they're going to be fewer and far between\nWell I'm Glad you brought him out because he generally had success against the birds and his career including at Miller Park but Christian yell at each is porous stacked against him with a couple of home runs this year and he's nine of Seventeen against him for his career what maybe you can yell at six that's all against Clayton\nSo you know what he does so well especially in this generation which is kind of nice we talked about getting the ball the year a lot more and talk about launch angle I was a left handed hitter first of all the power guy who has a ton of home runs this year in one of the lowest launch angles\nIn baseball so without you know some too nerdy or getting technical he just doesn't hit the ball high in the air like a lot of other hitters do these days and so think about left I left my job I was left handed pitcher in one of the things that I always wanted to know about the left handed hitter that I was facing I wanted to do if he could try if he had the ability\nTo go opposite field especially early in the cat will be looking for something out over the place to maybe hit a line drops of left field is he willing to do that\nSome left handed hitters as good as they weren't even some like say using ... told me as an example hall of fame hitter they may be looking to yank early pull early right turn and burn a little bit on you and so you tell us if you have the outside part of the plate when needed it ... not one of those guys it's a left from left to look for something out over the political and he can even drive it\nOr the other way and so for Clinton curse Shaw a he's a different kind of left the he is seeing the ball well against him\nOr that nice logo swim works against them of Clinton curse all strengths which is the curve ball in the slider and so that's likely the reason is that he stays in there really well against left these uh ended up pulling off the ball and those are the toughest ... matchups\nA as a left handed pitcher when you get a guy who could command the outside part of the play really well and have the ability not just even hit the ball ... book and also a hit it out of the ballpark Gillette field\nHe joined the cow ski about to do a show on and I'll be network radio for now we've got them for a couple of minutes former big league pitcher and baseball analyst travels with the rangers that was part of their regular crew it's after hours on CBS Sports radio so let's talk about asteroids and Red Sox and\nI Am I'm fascinated you get your answer to that which pitching staff do you believe has the edge in that ALCOA as\nWell you know it's funny because it it comes down to for me of who's bringing their game to the table now the ashes of already shown that was just ... and Guerra call at the top it's just that's a really really difficult combination to beat\nThe question becomes for game one in game two ah with the red Sox is looks like ... there were some concerns there because at the end of the season the philosophy was way down\nAnd Alex court said the whole time he's fine it's fine it I'm like I always find for you to believe he's still going Ninety miles an hour and he's a guy that we used to seeing sit still Ninety six and seven when he got his full strength\nUm there might be something wrong he was perfectly fine he showed that so far all throughout the postseason that he is healthy that the good fastball velocities back but I think you're always wondering the back of your mind is is he a hundred percent okay he's proven that so far but I'm Still wondering what happened last posted the regular season start ... or anything that's bothering him\nUm I think that'll be OK the question will be an easy one to answer the big one is David Price and David prices we\nIs there anything that's bothering him um I think that'll be okay I think that question there'll be an easy one to answer the big one is David Price and David prices we well knows the two hundred million dollar pitcher\nHe's just been awful in the postseason as a starter I mean there's no there's no better way to describe it we just have to be honest about it is made ten postseason stars he's only nine with an eerie over six starts and it just it hasn't happened now\nIt's interesting that he got the game to start quite honestly and then you start looking and you look at his numbers against the show's over the last three years he's crushed up he's done a really really well against the Houston Astros\nAnd the numbers get even better than the way the Erie overall I think it's somewhere around a two for a infant away even lower than that it's up to uh get over the last three years the patrol against them this year so\nIf for some reason I don't know where David Price can show up and be that really good postseason started that he should be able to be because he's a really good picture a that'll help tip the scales a little bit of that doesn't happen\nOr they're going to be I think it a little bit of trouble because they're gonna start relying heavily on their bullpen and maybe too much and so while the pitching on paper one of those guys are at their best as a pretty good match up the consistency of the astro pitching what they've been able to do so far are certainly I think for me uh makes them a little bit of a slight favorite\nDoor the W.

late with a high temperature route fifty seven appalled probably for news talk W. J. G. A. M. seven eighty at what a five point out if I'm right now forty two [noise]\nWelcome to the campus of Iowa State university at home mother cycle on\nA farm journal gala drove Joe and in Ames, Iowa it is great to be back on campus we're right outside of Curtis hall I can see the camping Neal but I've got this strange feeling that I'm missing a class or something [noise]\nStudios will farm journal brought to\nThis this ritual\nAgriculture's national talk show since Nineteen Ninety four [noise]\nHere's your host floors [noise]\nGood morning and thank you for joining us again this morning ...\nIt's the farm journal college road show and we're on the campus of Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa man this brings back a lot of memories thank you to dekalb as grow for sponsoring the road Joe and making it possible for agar talked\nTo bring you some great information from Iowa State and we are bringing you had the good stuff today guys we're going to\nStart off talking about brain storage ingrained quality the harvest season one from a fantastic start to a row black builds out of rain\nAnd with the rain comes some deteriorating grain quality in a tough crop to store\nWe will talk with Dr Charlie Herbert ah Dr Herbert manages the Iowa State grain quality research lab and the Iowa grand quality initiative\nAnd at the bottom of the Ira our Iowa State university for management specialist Steve Johnson will join me for a conversation about the condition of the Iowa farm economy and some of the risk management strategies that you should be thinking about\nThat at the end of the show we're going to talk with the dean of the College of egg and life sciences here at Iowa State Dr Joe ... we'll hear about what Iowa State is doing to meet the needs of a very demanding egg industry out there right now let's turn it over to Clinton Griffiths get an update on the news\nWelcome to Iowa State Clinton yeah nice to be there are a sound you're reveling in some old history there ships Laurie I hear your voice I can hear your voice has just got a a little a just a little more excitement unusual\nWell it it feels good to be home and that and I asked you blame people for people that have been here and and they have spent any kind of time here central campus at Iowa State university is a magical place and here we are broadcasting from it it's awesome man how awesome how awesome yeah that's all\nVery exciting I'm excited you're there uh yeah it's yeah I Know it's been a wild weaken news hadn't it\nYes it it may have but I Need to check I I I Need to check up on something when you first have the cash crop look\nA looks pretty good looks pretty good folks at risk for they're yeah they're getting ready for their ass almost there twenty than you'll say oh this weekend so uh yeah went home last weekend spent some time help them get the club gaps ready so yeah there you remember how to run the clippers [laughter] listening there are some things dad still does himself a\nAnd\nYeah you know I like to think\nWhenever you hit your mid thirties you might be able to be good enough to run the clippers for once but no\nYeah so what are some of the issues that you're seeing out their bread because even in a year like this you can't quit scouting you can't\nWhat we're really starting to see is quite a bit of ear molds come in and the corn starting to get reports of some old and the beans showing up being pods are starting to split open\nSo a lot of our recommendations right now still go back to get out and scout be aware of what you got out in those fields if you start to see some of that ... there's some things that we can do to try and help that mitigate that from a harbors perspective\nBut we need to know where you're at yeah and we need to be looking for some of the disease so that we know what might be out there next year to write exactly be prepared for\nWhat's gonna happen next year you know we look at\nThe corn crop you can pretty much find just about anything whether it's the Syrian penicillin Iraq's mold shown up encourage the growers to think about what they can do to help mitigate some of those issues so when we think about\nA harvest we can open up the ... case a little bit we can increase the speed of you think about those multi colonels they're going to be a little bit lighter so we can get those\nColonels that are infected with those fungal pathogens out of the system so to speak and not get him into the band you know that's going to help mitigate crop quality issues in the\nEnd gotcha gotcha Brad thank you so much for sponsoring is down here we really appreciate it but if he would don't go anywhere okay All right go ahead I stay right there because we are going to bring in Dr Charlie Herbert Dr Herbert manages the Iowa State grain quality research lab and then and the Iowa\nGreen quality initiative Charlie thanks for joining us Oh thanks chip glad to be here boy what Brad was saying there was a lot of\nAgreement or that you were showing their to what Brad was saying about this ...\nOh I couldn't agree more in terms of scouting and in terms of the crop conditions I have a carbon north central Iraq will city and I I couldn't agree more your neck of the woods yet you got it bad and since a week after Labor Day\nUh basically it's gone downhill since they were bad rains on Labor Day but it looked like things are going to turn right and them down\nSo certainly one of the things that that Brad said about um a run in those fans that that's an important uh when when we go to store describe\n... absolutely first to get the ... the lower test wait we're not gonna say records for tests this year but but we want to get the lower test weight grain out because test what's the best measure star believe we have\nA them right now with this culture that we needed to get all this corn and soybeans as cold as we can as quick as we can we're probably not going to get it all try that fast but temperatures your friend at that point in terms of grain storage and protecting the shelf life\nYeah now Brad was also talking about some of the year molds that are showing up out there Charlie what uh what what are you hearing what the ... is is it a toxin\n... well it could be or maybe not there are a lot of different uh feel fungi that invades corn a couple few ... and ... will produce toxins and they will\nThose toxins will have a problem particularly with hogs and poultry uh the ethanol industry as I'm sure already aware that they need to screen incoming grain to know if the rain in their area would contain the is because it concentrates three to one\nIn the in the distillers grain so you can kind of see if you feed corn and then by distillers from the same area you have to pay attention to the situation\nYeah and and really like we were talking about before we before the show started those those ethanol facilities really need to stay on top of this and be checking that\nYes uh we're ... we're recommending that all user seed males ethanol facilities or take a sample about every half day just make a mixed up sample\nWhat's coming in about every half day and have a test that after a while you'll get a pretty good idea whether or not the grain and your trade area\nYou know has a problem or don't or doesn't but even so we have to get the the the the corn a cold as fast as possible and then when drying don't use slow drying techniques right speed it up as much as you can\nYou know and Charlie everybody is talking about storing this year's crop and I don't care if we're talking about corn and soybeans everybody wants to put the drop in the band\nThat's right uh we we it looks as though will have plenty to put in the ban uh although with the with the stock crops and so forth we're bound to lose some yup oh that's the core and by the way that will have the biggest vulnerability the corn down and uh uh near the ground\nUp but yes everyone is just talking about storage and and hopefully we'll find everybody home or in Iowa were a little bit luckier than some because we used to hundred to two hundred and fifty Bush million bushels of grain a month in the various\nFeed and processing uses so the the hope is that that will get everything in a good house before the weather warms up\nOkay in a good house I'm ... ... people are looking at alternative ways to store this this crop yes this year it feels like a dangerous idea\nWell it is without without management we're going to see piles that grain elevators or if you if there has to be outdoor piles the grain elevators place to put it it's not on the farm because it'll get managed a bit better and probably have some air Asian\nThere are other things being being talked about uh for example the silo bags uh but those don't have any ... capabilities and so with the oysters we have in the field Eighteen to twenty something like\nThat yeah and you bring up a good point one of the pieces of information we tried to get out to the guy is when you get that corn harvest and you're going to go to drive down get that right down to fourteen percent so down that respiration of those fungal pathogens in that then when you're going to store it set of a normal Fifteen or Fifteen and a half absolutely\nHit the storage life is already partially gone you know this year and so we already we know that and so getting it down well putting it in an ... plays a either a pile or a or a bag or have been that doesn't have there that's pretty much a prescription for a problem\nRight right but Charlie let's say that we do everything right we take it to fourteen percent we put it in a narrated ban you need to continue to monitor\nAbsolutely uh we hope that most people have some way\nOf ... of measuring the temperature in bands and even in the winter when everything's cold\nIf it goes up from say thirty degrees to thirty three thirty five and a two week period between your observations you got a problem that didn't happen by accident something is is is going on in there so yeah we want people to check and take the temperature of this product\nOn a very regular basis because we're going to get some hot spots I Know that\nOkay now before the crop goes into the Ben what should they be doing\nTo to make it as store of all as they possibly can\nSet set your combine to get the grain as clean as possible foreign material is the bane of grain storage especially piles up in the middle of so\nClean it on fire if you can if you have a use for cleaning according cleaning so it will pay the evidence or to run it through a rotary cleaner whatever take out the fines and chips or take the center core outta that have been others fill it up a little bit to a peak\nAnd then dropped the than than take out two or three loads and drop it down to where it's level or even inverted a little bit\nThat's the kind of a poor man's cleaning device because you'll get a lot of the trash and junk out better yeah ah and then\nUh bring the temperatures down to follow the outside air temperatures quickly as possible\nUh I'm not a big fan of warming up in the spring or until you absolutely have to uh the roof fan should be able to take the condensation out and prevent it from raining on the corn by condensation so I like to keep it as cold as possible\nAnd remember we're gonna have to have some of this corn and twenty Nineteen or even twenty twenty yeah ah so this year is going to\nPay its going to pay to pay attention okay now you heard me described that area that is most vulnerable with Johnson over to the code is Kansas back up to a northern Illinois is that the right area that we need to be watching\nYes it is and and the the rainfall patterns a show it all of those that's the area that really has to be on edge for example tonight going forward for the next two or three days every than in that area ought to be on because we're going to have cold temperatures low do points yeah watched her do points that tells you how colds you can get the great\nRight last question I've only got about Fifteen seconds can we do to four in ... in Iowa\nI don't think so uh particularly if you count for the for this stock Ross near drops and drowned out by ... and things like that I don't think so vital my own opinion\nFrom wherever I've seen harvest the the guys have got some harvest out you know where we've got good stand we've got good deals with its those spots that we lost you know\nBack in may and June the ... are on his argue that brand is going to be back with us here and just second factor Herbert thank you so much for on a farm journal college road show in Ames, Iowa Mm\nMm really\nAfter ... my channels seems more and more miles that argument\nAs probably some of his his\nCome harvest we celebrated in the\nWay of making plans for next season\nI think the marketing for celebration program payments to generate some cash and lots of interest of going to the EPA say off\nYeah absolutely one when a a is it is it a complicated process on the must be no it is the easiest EPA say form\nI have seen in Thirty years or one page\nThat needs is a date a signature daytime phone but your actual production so soon as you wrap up soybean production and you're still waiting for grounded dry and go after the corn lifts slip into EPA say make sure they got all the information if you're on the program they've got all the information\nAnd then at per se will simply ask for your actual production one number on soybeans total production across all farms\nAll counties just one number on soybeans yup and what was your production evidence it's the same information I gave my crop insurance agent maybe work with your agent early they've got some time\nMaybe get that information to your age and say help they come up with that actual production because I've got crop share farm good the rest of the arms or cash rent meant and owned farms\nCrop insurance agent help you come up with that one number one number\nA on that apple say forms you could see nine ten sign\nAt a daytime phone seven to ten days later you got money in your account middle ... percent of a dollar sixty five payment\nOkay get is ready for twenty Nineteen here Steve order some of the things that we need to be thinking about is guys are making decisions on what they're going to be put in the ground\nWhere to plant more corners there's no doubt about it I'm hearing that most every farmer I talked to about crop rotation\nA lot of farmers are really into was soiled testing us Brett invention of buying and uh I had I've got farmers have already bought fertilizer head thinking there's gotta be greater demand in the spring\nBut if we still have all this trade tariffs issues that are hanging around\nA much past march we're going to see more corn acres including Iowa we're probably gonna see farmers that one I rotate or at least leave that window open to rotate back to more corn I don't know that it'll be that noticeable but with this late harvest is going to be challenging\nTo do some tillage this show\nI Would agree\nTo be much of a real challenge there and the other thing is we've kind of lost sight of real warm\nAnd they were going to go to increase speakers that means we're going to go back corner on corn or really need to pay attention to that I've had a number of calls my counterparts at a number of calls were were starting to see some of these stand ability issues\nIt's kinda late the game to try to diagnose it but that needs to be a part of that thought process which if you're going to go additional corn acres [noise] think about what you're going to be putting out there yeah yeah no doubt about it uh conversations with landlords Steve how are those going this fall while I take a lot of\nUnderstood that are likely we're going to have a good sized crops I think what's his late harvest probably putting more financial pressure on on those tended operators I think leaving the lines of communication I predict that we're going to have more cash rents renegotiated\nBetween the middle of January and late February than we ever have there's a lot of producers\nYou talk to their lenders and I think we're going to hear from the lenders you've got to figure out a way to cut your costs yeah mad at your wrist you need to do a better job of marketing the crop and so I think that's what November December January brings\nSteve you've always been really good about the ... stressing that you can't go dark on your lenders you've got to have its it it's got to be are almost a constant conversation\nIdiots communication is going to be key open on a communications reaching out to your lenders now they know the situation with harvest but they need to know what is your plan oh how are you going to make those payments and\nNot only the lenders I think the inputs suppliers as we mentioned the cash right landlords and let's try to avoid putting some of these charges on a credit card so we know what happens when we put it on credit\nCard absolutely All right thank you Steve appreciate it so much Brad

that event yeah yeah absolutely okay so\nThis time of the year what do we need to be looking at it out in the field to get us ready for next year\nI think some of the things you need to remember it yet but you have a lot of devastating effects going on in the field right now so we've had\nWhether that is coming from all over the top of the really nice crop in some areas and we had when I made in a really nice and kept\nIt there I think we're going to look for for next year mind you rented you understand\nWhat you're doing in that field because you're not going to be high on all kinds of

that has to deal with me a lot yeah I had to have often on here with me in\nAustin it's ... it's not that hard to deal with Chad is no\nIt's not he gives them a pretty great market reports every every meeting to start off for a meeting or a club meeting\nYou know let's talk a little bit about ammo and chat jumping on this too because I Am always always been\nVery ... it's an organization down here at Iowa State and I'm very interested in uh I Try to work with the with the group as much as I can but also what he tried to accomplish with him\nWe tried to give people from all different backgrounds on there a commodity marketing a good understanding of how a commodity trading works a first check comes on and talked about our crops markets and then we have Lee who covered the livestock markets after that\nAnd the guest speaker than for meetings um yeah so we take people from all different levels of education even be a freshman or senior\nAnd if you have any sort of interest in this marketing or maybe you want to go home and farm and just want to learn a little bit more to help all your home operation we uh we take all types you\nKnow Chad the the ... meetings that I've participated in the level of enthusiasm to understand these markets it's ... it's pretty impressed is impressive\nYou know what the typical meeting for us we have you know I'd say sixty to eighty folks that you know big one for us was about a hundred and twenty five but then you combine that with her egg biz club that's up there around two hundred and fifty folks right when you're looking at blocking bridal it's up there around to two hundred and fifty votes we've got a lot of energize\nAgriculture students here I think we're up to somewhere over four thousand students here on campus there studying some sort of agricultural degree and they do tend to get involved very quickly I have a lot of student clubs I mean it's fantastic to see the energy level\nAnd on the ... the networking that you're doing what the other students here in Iowa State I mean there's putting together that peer group is something that you're going to continue to do is it and and you use these use I shouldn't say you'll stay in contact with the students are for the rest of your life\nProbably right I've already noticed that with some people graduating here this last year and just calling them on the phone once in awhile whether they're merchandisers in our home or at home and farming and you can call them up and see what they're thinking\nCool cool Chad what are you telling the guys about the rain markets right now\nWell right now we're at a rough patch let's face it we know we've got a big crop coming out of the field and we know we're having a hard time finding a home for it and so this is one of those cases where we are talking about okay what do you do as a farmer how you look forward to you know trying to lock in a better price how do you maintain that cash flow that is so crucial as you're looking out here on the farm and so\nThat's sort of the game plan we're always talking about what's happening in trade what's happening on the livestock site as far as the demand and looking at water the drivers that could if you will turn these markets around the\nCape take me from the report that we got from USDA yesterday take me from that to the November crop production report what what kind of changes might we see oil and\nThings I think we're going to watch here since this crop did get a little smaller especially on the corn side this last one I think we'll see some shrinkage again there the other thing to watch for here to me as I'm watching those export numbers\nYou know set USDA we bumped up the corn one because we're ahead on corn sales in fact I think we're up sixty percent year over year now and so that's fantastic new seat we definitely need that\nOn the soy beans I Am watching that seem to export number I what I'm worried about their as the slow down that we've seen from China we haven't been able to pick up markets on you know other markets enough to help boost that up yet I'm watching to see if we see some weakness in that come November\nYeah yeah and and the corn exports side of things like you said fantastic what's the risk that were front loading is demanding that that then we'll be disappointed with sales in the second half\nWay I I think we are front loading out of it but then again the question really becomes years okay I think a lot of these sales that we're making right now the price driven when I'm looking at who's those fires that have been stepping up they tend to be more price sensitive gets if we're still\nHow to put this I say it this way but if we're still light on price come spring I think this continues on because again that these markets that do tend to be\nA little bit but Chad I [laughter] I don't know if that's a bad thing because when once you build up that demand it's hard to turn it back around\nIt is hard to turn back around and the the thing that's driving this is a livestock industry has countries and so the idea is that as long as those animals are there I think that pent up demand is there and that helps hold that in a bit longer so what's your attitude towards corn\nMy attitude towards horns actually I'm feeling a little more bullish as I look at it in the Nineteen the ideas when we're looking at the global demand picture like say exports are very strong right now we continue to see growth in our own domestic livestock industry and so when you're looking at the demand package for corn right now is headed in the right direction\nRight okay soybeans a demand is still good I mean we cannot deny that but our supply is becoming overwhelming it is overwhelming\nAnd here I think again will be the case of do have we reached price level where we are to see this become sort of those price sensitive buys as well and I think we will as we get into the spring especially summer I think as we look here right now the ideas yeah we're filling in those markets I think we'll find more of them six months from\nNow yeah boy I sure hope so but boy is that the real answer is let's get let's get the situation settled with China and move on\nIt would help tremendously here I mean the idea is that when we look here my big concern is I look at that the longer it goes on the more you sort of set in place that know Brazil's gonna own much more of that market and we're going to\nIs that when we look here my big concern as I look at that the longer it goes on the more you sort of set in place that know Brazil's go to own much more of that market and we're going to be feeding around it like that the problem worse\nYeah absolutely you know I Hope you guys can hear the camping going up in the background but Austin that's just kind of background noise here on campus my state isn't it\nYes it is here at all the time yeah where are you from I'm from Olivia Minnesota\nOlivia Minnesota so you were up there in the area are you from a farm yes I Am okay so you're in that area where\nThey were dealing with it all year long up there too much water\nRight we're kind of the most northern I Would say that really got a bad part of all that rain that came through and uh some snow actually just coming in the last couple of days here on the ground\nYeah and Chad ... it it's one of these things that we can talk about it\nWe we know that the problem is out there with the green quality and everything but we got to take care of the crop as best we can\nWe've got to an editorial when I'm looking at students like Austin here it's good to see him here but at the same time to recognize that probably as soon as the harvest really starts thoroughly\nA lot of our says why because you've got to get that crop up and especially this year it's going to matter we need to get it in a quick as we possibly can in order to maintain as much yield in quality and ...\nYeah we were talking with Dr Herbert this morning or about storage and ... of this crop we need to be careful with Chad\nWe definitely do I mean the idea thanks or storage issue we've got going into the band just gets worse when you're trying to hold back\nYou up often what's plans after school haven't\nFully decided yet how he's like their commodities trading stuff when I tried that off the last couple of summers and all this summer I think I'm planning on going home yeah and to uh the home operation see how I like it and if it's not quite right fit for me maybe I'll get back into the green industry after that\nGotcha but you know the the demand for good students like ah Austin out in the industry it's I don't think it's ever been hired\nBy its very strong right now we just had our career to your career day and it's just as strong as ever I mean I think that's the deal here when you're looking at egg yeah while our prices have been down there continues yeah innovation to grow up with any and\nAbsolutely Austin thanks for stopping by very shared it Chad it's good to talk with you again it's always fun to talk with you about it there's always one All right at heart marketing specialist we'll be right back from Iowa State university there on a TV [noise]\nCurrent price times one thousand acres carry the won these days it's hard to make\nThe mess we're for your soybean fields to be a chef liberty links system would liberty herbicides makes it easier to start with the two plus bushels per acre yield advantage in lower system input cost more complete control you get an extra thirty three dollars for more profit potential breaks there to as grow Roundup Ready to extend sores\nAll definitely a lot to talk about um\nHonestly I think it's a lot more fun to they're not under a lot more interesting to see everything that's going on on that I was in ... at least class last semester and we talked to experts every single day um although prospective we'll see\nYeah I was going to see where it's going to go for a ... it's not that that's not a bad perspective to have on it is it leave because it is one of these situations where when it comes to the terrorists in and every we look at the U.S MCA and everybody thinks okay well that's great are we got our pork market back into Mexico\nKnow those those tariffs on us pork in Mexico are tied to the steel and aluminum tariffs that the U.S has put on and those are still in place so there's still a lot of work to do on the trade issues\nAnd I would say the uncertainty part of it still remains in place quite a bit of it when he talked about the the terrorists still being in place um we know that already\nNews of possibly negotiate with Japan a on a trade agreement and so we are in a new regime we could say when we're talking about trade and looking at bilateral trade verses multilateral um that that is added to the uncertainty in the markets because it's something we haven't face in recent times\nAnd I think that's what really the markets have been trading is really the the uncertainty and then when we do get a bit of news even with\nUs and see that was a positive sign at least movement in the markets

Jimmy ... Jimmy ... some kind of a bad guy for calling truth to power it's real it's legit I I'm not the biggest Kobe Bryant guy on the on the face of the earth I recognize it was amazing\nHe's one of the greatest players in history of the game he's an incredibly impressive guy away from the basketball court is an entrepreneur in the true sense of the war and it turns out you know maybe somewhat of an artist with what he's doing with documentaries and films\nBut I was never in the role of Kobe Bryant the way that some other people were certainly in LA or steward Kovacs over here was actually wearing like Kobe here today for some random reason I don't it's I'm I guess I heard a rumor that the NBA a regular season opens next week so maybe that's maybe that's why\nBut I always did think that Kobe's in ten snus and his\nWillingness to be on like born to go after people on his own team because that was part of his process and the culture that he created their for greatness and to win games was one of the most likeable and daring attributes that he brought to the table\nAnd everybody's different some people inspires through charm for example and some people do it through fear and anger the right answer is a situation\nBut I like next saved me is my favorite people I've interviewed and I've told this story he was really unpleasant to me for fifty five minutes of a sixty minute interview and you know what it was impressive because he was direct and he was a winner and he didn't give\nA darn ... have been the same way I'd rather have people be\nFully exposed for who they are including their faults than for the phone is out there who pretend to be one thing or something else and I'm not going to say that's what it currently has any towns is but there's a lot of evidence suggesting he's trend in that direction what you just heard earlier about I just want to play with anybody I'm tired of these questions\nNow you don't know you're not you're just about you there's a lot of guys\nIn sports and coaching in media in politics in the world of business across this world who are absolute and total phoney and a lot of them make it and I'm not rooting for those people I'm rooting for the authentic genuine people out there who really care\nJimmy Butler cares and sometimes when you care too much and you're passionate you're too angry and you're out there it's going to expose some of your fault and I'm I Love the Jimmy mother doesn't care not what he's focused on his focus on one of the basketball games\nTo me this whole Jimmy bowler thing I I actually talked to somebody that has a ... a friend of mine in the sports business was a huge\nHe's not an MBA gathered in the sports business huge timber wolves fan\nAnd he was trying to defend the whole thing it's like no man this isn't a sign that Jimmy needs to go that he's a calm down this is a sign that the timber wolves to young stars there cornerstones there is something rotten there this had happened and had to happen publicly and getting to this point\nThis isn't about Jimmy ... the question the real question isn't it Jimmy ... the right or wrong\nIs Jimmy ... or a good guy or a bad guy now the question is\nIs currently has any towns a good guy or a bad guy is Andrew weekends a good guy or a bad guy the focus on the questions about who is a good team mate who's really dedicated whether they need to go away to spite their talent should be on those two guys not on Jimmy Buffett are eight five five to one to\nFour CBS the phone number above I shouldn't graduates do because it's basically means Jimmy ... the Bronx so chooses is going to be a lake or any or would\nYou want would you want you mean by the Lakers fan to be here on your math guy next year or one of the two if they can squeeze into\nUm he wouldn't be my first choice but I Would certainly take 'em like I'd rather have Duran over ... people are obviously but if they can't get to Iran I think butler and the Bronx could be a a a good combination\nYou on a date that go down at the bar because ... I'm Still waiting I'm Brooklyn Decker but if it's not broken decker I'm definitely so you're not getting Duran Duran actually ... like between cold why butler\nTaking Duran out taking Brooklyn Decorah\nOkay we technically I shouldn't do use the Brooklyn Decker analogy since\nI sort of know her husband that feels weird having said all of\n'em now you can yeah on the ... gone yeah ... I had probably rather have collide but I Would take butler I wouldn't I wouldn't say no to butler trays boiled soon got and I'll take buses there he's\nMy last choice two years ago you would've you would've thrown praise from a window on the tenth floor of the building\nTo just have butler consider you trade I it it still gets well in one acquisition which I mean it's a fair to big acquisition by I mean now he's living in the penthouse unbelievable he gives do a little bit of a little bit of LeBron James it's\nOh ooh ...\nYou know maybe ... amazing dude he's at winter I said I Would take him he wouldn't be my first choice among some of the fridge out there but I Would gladly take him he'd be a very good\nPlayer on the Lakers trays or just a sneak preview traces case I just wanted to make a verdict parents will be the lawyer yes or no Stewart Kovacs is very spoiled now as a as a ... out of control as a as a Lakers fan yes okay we're going to expand on that\nLater on the show a violent we're talking to be able to talk anything you wanted a five five to one to foresee ... Tony West Virginia Tony facial isn't a buddy appreciate your your on CBS Sports radio\nYes sir inherently okay I Gotcha brother what's going on awesome and I'm Sorry I I got a problem that yeah that's right that's where it's like let's do it before I Will I Will say Kobe\nBryant is my favorite player fluffy little things but to me he's along obviously the first one [noise] so I looked at it fell out of your favorites fan so much for protection for the game outcome but\nRavens going down to Nashville I think tendencies just three and two I think that's actually a really good titans team and I'm I'm On the Mike variable bandwagon I'm On the train there I think the question becomes\nOn it you can see that there is this lack of defense or effort up and down the court especially with the defense of finally coach like Tom ... um so the effort that they throw up there is is just so weak that I'm I'm Glad bother set something\nUm but in regards to it's a bit on the Lakers are I Believe ... self would obviously like to have them if they're you know if they strike out on a ... or something like that but\nI'm from ... wise it'd be nice to obviously have a wing defender that you know it's a big guy like a guard a guy like ... um things that nature but\nIt's just kind of like where I see the box\nEvery year is that they don't have any outside shooting and they have you know one of the best players in a league but they just they're always limited by that because other people are putting up three point shot and you guys are breaking few pointers so you know it just every ... and I just feel like bought or on a team he can make outside shot but he's not a high volume high volume high percentage shooter\nSo no I saw a lot of your like\nWhy Leonard would be a way better better place opposite\nAnd I and I hear your new for me to beat that warriors team\nIf you have a liberal and I think the focus for me it's just it's perimeter dissenters like you said I Want guys can slow down to stop and\nDuran curry clay dream on there so many those guys and ball there was a defensive player of the year caliber guys to a player I'm In the extreme\nI Would rather load of on defense of guys and trust in the Bronx to make their often ... a lot more effective on any other team I hear you're saying I think the bronze\nI those primitive defenders for me is the direction I go I loved me bowler in that fit a long time then there'll be rider Rob dire who I Am a huge fan of is the author of the new book Powerball anatomy of a modern baseball game it's very cool Rob making some time now in this Friday Robin going on man grabs on the book\nOh thank God for that\nSilver for for ... she was not aren't familiar with the um what is the what's the premise of the book in what attracted you to the to the topic\nWell the idea is that we can\nThrough the prism of a single baseball game explore the state of the games generally and I was inspired by a couple of similar books that were written\nThirty years apart I'm Arnold ... classic a day in the bleachers published in Nineteen fifty five and then a Dan Dan Okrent book nine inning published in Nineteen eighty five and I was very\nAh gratified when when Dan who I've become friendly with over the years ah I gave my book a a a a nice endorsements are on the cover so I wanted to follow in that tradition tell the story of today's game today's baseball through through one game\nRubbed higher here on the show and Rob one of those organizations that is very much inclined toward saber metrics and there's a lot of communication that goes on between the front office and the manager in terms of decision making the Twenty years ago where those things were were were pretty clearly segregated is the Dodgers\nDo you think that will be the new normal in the years ahead front office is having a lot of say in day to day lineup decisions and endgame decisions\nWell I Would say yes but at the qualified yes um you really don't want a relationship where you are dictating\nTo the manager\nWhat you want it's a collaborative partnership\nWhere the the manager wants the information and has the the the knowledge the background to put it into the play and self because\nYou can't program every decision a baseball game it's impossible ... if they're too many variables um and what you see in the postseason now you see for managers all relatively young all friendly\nI'm all amenable to send a modern metrics I'm at work hand in glove with their front office that the model now there are every manager doesn't every relationship doesn't work like that yet but that's where we're heading that's where we are in the postseason right now\nRob dire here on the show robbed ... series begins when I guess in in in the next hour whatever the the keys that you're keeping an eye on in terms of who's going to come out on top\nWell you know you always have the copy out that anything can happen in the postseason theories such a small sample size but\nBoth of these teams\nFor the most part become hitting side they live and die with a home run 'em ... and you know the brewers we're second in the league in homers this season a tremendous at that and they also by the way I Believe they let the league in field\nBut that doesn't mean what it used to\nUh now that means you steal a base every couple of games maybe where every you know maybe one game a so it's just not a game changer I'm like it used to be Thirty years ago um the brewers are going to win if they don't hit it hit home runs in the same is true of the Dodgers\nHow much do you do for the idea of momentum to actually having an impact at this point of the end they'll be postseason 'cause the brewers before they got the cooler\nIt was for the idea of momentum to actually having an impact at this point of the ... will be postseason 'cause the brewers before they got to cool their heels for for several days were the hottest team in baseball do you believe that has any impact on what happens going for when you're a team that won a lot of baseball games in a row going into a series against a team like the Dodgers\nI I Do not ah I think historically speaking\nThere's very little evidence for the the importance of moment that now if you're playing better\nPutting excrete together because\nNow nobody ... Nebraska leaves the air until seven o'clock tomorrow morning within twenty five miles north of Nebraska programming continues on translator came to nine zero eighty one oh five point nine FM\nExcellent team that got hot\nAt the end of the season and there's there's nothing wrong with that I don't think it makes them more likely to beat the Dodgers that they have to play basically on the strength of what they did over the that their their entire body of work\nRobbed higher here on the show on Twitter ... Rob ... Roth who do you like in the series\nBoy that's a really tough one um I I think it comes down to\nMy come down to which manager is more creative or luckier when it comes to pushing the pick pitching but because these days um all the old model are sorted out the window right we might see it starting pitcher go to any uh you know on purpose\nSo it's very difficult to know what's going to happen it's a and I I think that situation is incredibly fluid um this'll be a battle battle of managers as much as the battle of pictures and hitters\nRob this is a ... organization that's won the national league last now six years in a row they were a game away from a World Series last year I spent four years in that market and working for the Dodgers radio network\nTo very rapid fan base and people can become very very impatient so this question is what should happen so much is what will happen if the Dodgers failed to win this series do you think there's going to be this perception in that market and making its way towards an organization that by some standard the season was a failure\nWell yes\nAbsolutely people will be disappointed but\nLook at their attendance this season it was off the charts again it's the Dodgers are incredibly popular and that's going to be two next year whether they get swept in this series or or when the world series now they win the world series of course they can maybe Jack up ticket prices even a little higher but basically\nThey own that city baseball wise um and I think that that's going to\nContinue regardless I'm I think maybe a different question is if they lose is Dave Robert job in danger because we've seen so many postseason managers get fired in the last few years when their team's been when\nI don't know the answer to that question I think part of that comes down to\nWhat he perceived to have lost a theory by something you did incorrectly but he seems to have a great deal of support from upper management so I think he's safe\nYeah and at that point he is not technically under contract the Dodgers have an option on him for I Believe in another year and if they pick up that option that would coincide with with Joe Madden deal being up in in Chicago\nDo you have any sense of whether or not the Dodgers would be inclined to go after a guy like men a year from now that the cubs haven't lock them up it just sounds like they're not going to do\nI don't but I also\nDon't see any and I understand there's a relationship there I frankly don't see any objective reason to believe that Joe ... is a better manager at this moment\nThan they've Robert ... if you know you could argue all sorts of different things but\nMatt and that's a great education and deserves it um\nBut if you do what does he do better than day Robert\nI I don't know what that is you know to see managing game better not that I can tell that the uh managed people better I don't know maybe a little bit not that I can tell though so I think if they work to make a change it would be due to frustration and not performing\nTalking robbed and I are here on the show the author of Powerball anatomy of a modern baseball game turn into the American league championship series AJ hinge in that organization of added some pictures to the roster for for that series how much do you think who's going to win that series they'll come down\nTo ... pitching match ups in the decisions in game between each of those managers in terms of when they go and how they go to each of those respectable then\nWell I think there's a great deal of that because again very fluid a given the the the way the game has developed just in the last twelve months or so I mean the Astros", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Norfolk", "day": "12"}
