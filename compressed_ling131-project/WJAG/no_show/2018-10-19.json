only scores\nSix points you're ... you're a loser you're never going to make it the kings did it again Marvin ... badly the third that three fans were the number of years he's going to be in the NBA\nBased on how he performed on his opening night what a crazy crazy let down of failure\nNumber two I really am digging the overreaction\nBy the way our number too much water as some of these by

he on his\nOn his last night was twenty five Eighteen and aid he's annoyed they turn out but he sure just stood\nAnd yet something about the wars was really impressive I've asked every single current NBA player that's been on the CBS Portage to show that I host most weeks it's off the air this because the cruise moving to Stanford Connecticut Avenue operation going who is the most underrated player in the NBA\nAnd I would say half the answers have been Kemba Walker from guys around the league who have been on the show Campbell was awesome last last night absolutely when offer forty one

we'll play those ... used for you here on the radio show we just we have some fun\nOverweight people react so aggressively NBA season is eighty two games at a ... a long season\nBut I Do think we saw some things in a legitimate way yesterday that are going to play themselves out\nOver the course of the season I was wrong on the rockets last year I did not think they were going to be in the class of the warriors and they obviously were remarkable last season they want a ton of games a ton of basketball games and they gave the words everything the wars could handle until Chris' point down trading\nOr at least allowed him to go allowing to have a reason to go\nCritical mistakes not not sexy name's not superstars last year and this was the thing that made the rockets a legitimate content and give more credit give give Mike and Tony credit last year\nHigh powered often ... remarkable genius all kinds of MIT and Tony who historically had terrible defense is like the chiefs of the NBA this year she's the NBA they were six and defend the defense of efficiency rate\nAnd they also had a coordinator a basically assistant coaches serves a defensive coordinator and that gentleman retired a week before training camp this year which tells you his lack of confidence his lack of belief in\nThat defense of group I think what we saw last night\nFrom the rockets\nAnd the number\nOf points they gave up to the pelicans which is what a hundred and thirty six hundred and thirty four it's the most in the den Tony era I think that's going to be a last scene reality for Houston I think they've taken a huge step backwards defense matters it just it matters you give them guys especially on on the perimeter\nWho can guard this new age athlete in the NBA typically those guys on the Golden State warriors obviously\nTo beat the war is you have to you can't shut down to rant and staff and clay and dream on my goodness he got a slow at least a few of them down hope maybe one or the other to have a bit of an off time I also think the story line that's going to continue to play itself out\nIs the rise the immediate rise of Jason Tatum as a superstar in the NBA last year and we've seen guys develop because of this last year\nGordon ever goes down Kyrie Irving eventually goes down Tatum had to step up and some of the gym and brown and a lot of times the NBA when young guys step into a role or secondary guy step into a raw seen as as the Andre Jordan and then someone returned to star returns those stars that confidence those new\nNewly minted stars don't\nRetreat from that it just makes their entire basketball team better I think we saw the\n... if you want to weigh in if you want to share your perspective on any takeaways you've seen so far early on in the NBA season love to hear from you on CBS Sports radio toll free lot\nThat number's eight by five to one to four to seven it's brought you buy guy go hey everybody what's up it's bill here's a quick way you can save money so it's a guy go\nDeal motors runners are motorcycle insurance to get it all at guy go dot com another storyline this ... this bums me out it just in life isn't fair and I know we're probably not usually in the business of feeling Hoover sorry for\nMultimillionaire athletes but I Do\nI feel so bad for mark ... this is a young man was he thought he was gonna be a star now the star was a score and the shooter at Washington\nIt's not like he's a big man who really wasn't a great shooter but then got the gaps then threatened his career he was a shooter he spent his entire life defined by his ability to take a basketball against the most athletic people around him and put it\nIn that who and he can't shoot\nHe has literally the gifts that is so painful to watch the wrong shooting go jogging Joe eleven producer Joey on the TV show credit last year I worked in the NBA for a long time working Charlotte for almost a decade was a scout was a video guy last year he saw folds his shot\nIn a clip remember the very first 'cause they came out to Houston we have a problem and joy producer joy producers of the show over on the TV show CBS poor taste who told me his career is over like he's ruined\nI Joe he said he I've seen it before but usually it happens with guys who were on drafted around ten day contracts trying to make a team or summer league and they'd go to the wrong shooting coach and it just destroys them\nAnd I hope joys wrong but he knows the inside out my heart goes out to mark ... because that's been as much money in his first contract that is that is an embarrassment it's a humiliation and we all of us right we all have dreams will have goals\nCan you imagine if there's something you'd spy or to your entire life\nAnd you're a natural at whatever it was ... and you were one of the best in the world and one day it just it just in the snap the fingers he just went away it vanished from you that's more than a sports story that's a human being story and I'm so bumper this kid because I I Want him to be good\nThe way it banished from you that's more than a sport store that's a human being story and I'm so bumper this kid because I I Want him to be good\nTo be a superstar may not be nice I just wanted to have a a career in the league I'd be able to shoot a little they'd be able to stick it out and there's time\nAnd he said it's weird 'cause he's such a good basketball player other than the fact that can't shoot but that's obviously a really important part of what you do unfortunately I think that storyline\nIs not going to be an overreaction and it's not going to go anywhere and then the other one that we had that I think is worth touching on and we've talked about it and when we've and we've discussed it because he's quiet and because he came from a market that's not New York city and not Los Angeles\nQuite Leonard was one of the best players in the NBA that we'd seen in a long time before his fantasy next slash injury situation and he was awesome and trial last night two years ago\nWill keep you updated on that\nI Do have I just joined my cousin Ryan is listen what's that Ryan some cars down in Florida they just got me into comes leagues so I'm I'm the Broncos said pick I'm not against the Scrabble together in a second also want to say there's not a lot of labor\nWhen didn't hit this early on the show because it happened twenty four hours ago and I'm sure many of you if you consume sports media throughout the day have heard people's perspectives and I have nothing really new to say other than it is worth me adding it is a travesty that the Houston Astros\nWere robbed of that home run and potentially that game\nThese are two great baseball teams Red Sox won a hundred and ... she was the one hundred and three games both of them are good enough to win not just the series but the world series this year and who gets\nThe edge who gets the advantage should not be decided on some botch ridiculous incompetent unacceptable replay call that has no bearing on reality or how the game is actually played and I'm not mad at the Astros win the series and I'm not mad at the red Sox won the series I really do you know the old\nMade the best man when made the best team win major league baseball's not supposed to get in the way of that they're supposed to facilitate that they're supposed to root for that I mean baseball wants seven games and trust me sort of the broadcast partners\nWhat an absolute joke what an absolute travesty and I know it's been revisited many many times I don't know that the theory she'll be two two but it certainly they address you've had a chance to tie that game and perhaps one that game ever in Houston\nSays three one\nBurn lander trying to\nStem the bleeding right now\nRunners on first and second\nIn what looks like I guess it's the the second inning hear of this game so we'll keep you updated on that just\nAnd I know it's hard like being an umpire's are bringing officials hard I've told this where I was in ... when I was a kid love doing it really tough I was a soccer visual at the University of Missouri for ... and ...\nI hate instant replay but you're not supposed to have as a replay the get it wrong\nSo there is a replay to get it right\nSuch a joke such an absolutely terrible call and we're not going to the labor too much work in terms of football where you go through every single game but\nIt does it it it frustrates the hell out of the main if you're a Red Sox fan you take\nIt you always think of if you're a team of your Astros fan you feel cheated and you should use and it's totally unfair and so again I don't\nReally care who wins the series because I think both are re baseball teams and both are worthy of getting to the world series but I'm now rooting for Houston to win the next two games because they certainly deserve a shot a fair shot\nAt this series by the way Broncos just went up assuming they make\nThe extra point near fourteenth and currently Thirteen nothing ending the a ... point the point after so let's see if you're if you're in Arizona Cardinals fan\nLeads to Phoenix sons are going to make the playoffs based on an overreaction Thursday at least you got at least you got that going for you about to be fourteen nothing for the two and four Broncos against the one in five cardinals aren't there is that people are talked about that all\nWeekend producer extraordinary social producer on this show\nWild wild west gambler in the sense that he takes his girlfriend and they have a against the spread of the competition\nWe found out about this but him and his girlfriend sort of very seriously doing the picks and going up against one another\nAnd we just I Want to use as part of the show\nSo we realized you know like a stroke of just you know\nA flash of light like the first time so it was like wait\nSo we realized you know like a stroke of just you know\nA flash of light like the first time so it was like wait\nAnd you know my God he put these together\nShould we do I'm sure there's been like experiments went bad like I like butter I catch up ... oh no that was terrible so this this was a good version that his last name is ... ... dead though the band the dead though\nAnd these are bad\nMaybe it's time for Tom's into that\nThese time for reduce your home to repeal bleakest games all the weekend he will be sure to win some money some more [noise]\nOh I forgot about tomorrow they got it in there that's your favorite part of the ones yet and you'll make us money tomorrow that's right and\nHopefully it's really time Sunday but not but I Will try I'm three games on her five hundred for the year so far but three games up on my girlfriend\nSo I'm In a good spot or does everybody live of this competition salaries single game for five years she's won two years I've once he or she is very good at it but we both hover around five hundred which I think is okay but it's certainly not very good but I think my logic on these picked is often very good uh [laughter]\nMost gamblers would say that I Do say they'll move on to them so I I have to deal with the line from Yahoo because that's what we that's what we used for this competition but I Will also give you\nThe real Vegas line I've never heard of course I go to the U.S was yeah I got to\nGo through this in this suit I'll just jump in and annoy you as you go\nOkay so I had Denver which is easy to say now but I was earlier I did at Denver tonight but we'll move on from that was the lead on this thing uh was plus one Denver one yet but I'm In Denver to a I'm Sorry I was on a plus one Arizona vow to got slight home dogs here I think that was pretty obvious pick for the games already started so it's water under\nThe rich are none of it where it will just skip as Denver Arizona a stew ... but we're not going to focus on that it's like\nOkay I didn't actually I'm up here in Tennessee at the chargers this is a pretty interesting game I'm getting a a minus seven for the chargers the real line in Vegas I was six and a half\nAnd I think that's critical I'm picking the chargers even with the minus seven but I really think there's going to win a touchdown game\nAnd so if you can get that six and a half you have to be on the six and a half if you can only get seven I wouldn't even that the game I just you know and bill you know I like the titans\nI just think they cannot protect Mario to right now they can't run the ball the defense is solid enough they will take the chargers maybe the whole game to build up that one or even two square is the better team and they're playing at home\nI have a I have a five and I'll leave that I've discussed that is um that is not free and Fifteen and Fifteen this year sadly I'm In the top\nThirty two other guys hundreds if I'm On the ... I'm actually of one of the five games I picked I'm On I'm On the chart I'm so confident in there you go one of my five okay Stuart\nI'm On the charges to I'm I'm big on them this year in the titans how they\nDid not protect Mary over the last week against ah the ravens that was kind of telling for me so I Would I think George is going by touchdown it makes me nervous given the fact you were so high on the Arizona okay\nOkay next same here and\nA New England in Chicago to take on your bears bill a New England is minus three point five for the bears are getting three and a half points at home\nI don't think it's crazy to think that this could be a field goal game thought I'm picking New England I on New England right now because of the player that not a lot of people are talking about that I think is the big breakout plan for that team and that is so many ... I guess a\nBroker that is Sony Michel was one of my favorite players in the draft coming out has been a perfect fit for them he's a game changing player on the ground which is what they needed and I think they'll have enough offense to win by four points but I could see it being a field all game I really couldn't\nAnd fun fact he only\nThe only was on the field for half of their office of snaps thirty eight Seventy five less when\nThey're running back rotation is basically the same as it ever was but he's just getting here that good in his opportunity I I'm\nI'm with it so you are I I'm a I'm obviously a bears fan\nAnd I feel like there's a there's a rebound coming your voice this game I tried to bet on my own team but if I were picking with the spread I think I Would go I Would go bears\nThe bears that's fair enough what do you think that I Am with Tom on this I think the pages of when I think it'd be a close game I think it will be maybe like a six seven eight points\n... like close game ... disrespecting my team well it's it can be more than a three point gave it a patriot you're going to win there you go and I'm\nAnd I'm dealing with three and a half line but you can get a two and a half line and if you can get that you have to take that because you could still win the feel go game I Would lose in the field ...\nNext game here is that he takes you know because there are bad that fat is better than met a man or the next game here\nBills hats call this is a pretty interesting game I'm getting nine points\nFor buffalo side on this dark energy is going to suffer buffalo that ended in ... a lot of them on a real Vegas line is minus seven and a half against a cult look I just watched a cult get beat by the jets last week I had a feeling about that game I pick the jets even though I'm a jets fan\nAnd I would picking again the jets against Andrew Luck is insane but I was right the Colts are Andrew Luck and a bunch of practice while players that team is a joke Gary sign it is a very good defensive player markets hunting breaking up it isn't quite healthy I'm going to take the nine point pen ride with Eric Anderson and the bills ethical [noise]\nSo I don't I don't like it either is a big number I Would avoid this game but if I were going to this game I think I Would ...\nEven to cover nine points\nYeah ... it's like Andrew Luck and his bad football team that gets another bad football team I think I'm going to bed on ... you are supposed to say that you were to like take Andrew if you'd across our colds and take Andrew Luck minus nine against colds\nAgainst buffalo buffalo\nI mean I Would change a little bit yeah he was on any kind of decent team I Would take luck but he's not he's on the calls unfortunately they can't catch the ball\nThree deflected interceptions and I came in at the jet I mean no matter even if he delivers it perfectly they still mess it up to\nTake a listen by the way I just sent me a southern Ryan of\nBears the bears that that's that's better and we've got to pick up the pace a little bit lions at Miami real slow usually Delaware\nWave can transform your home into a drier healthier environment satisfaction guaranteed ask\nAbout our indoor air package that includes the wave ventilation unit\nPlus a sixth stage portable air purifier dealer opportunities available for more information visit drawing house now dot com that's drawing house now dot com or coal eight eight eight nine seven nine wave that eight eight eight nine seven nine W.

Rodriguez of the world guys who have lawn championships and he's just he's been around them and you know I was doing a show with more shows grew and rod woods and you know rod what's in it and the goal jacket and I asked I asked NJIT the question how much\nDoes him being around champions no matter what the sport in the rye said no that's that's baseball but an M. J. D. said it doesn't really matter he saw the work ethic if these guys put in and what they brought to the table and what made them great\nAnd I think that's one of the things that he has in itself that belief in his own greatness I mean when you have a Ninety seven mile an hour fastball and high school and your dad's an eleven year major league veteran seems to be tripping over themselves to give\nYou you know some fat do and he said you know what I'm a football guy I Want to play quarterback and not to take anything away from Texas Tech but it's not like patrimony turn down you know big time you know major league signing bonus money if you go play quarterback at at\nOklahoma or at the University of Texas you went to Texas Tech and you know who who knew what was going to happen and for him to take that gambling in in itself\nI think that let you know with this kid is all about you and you see how cool years and when there's pressure around them I mean it doesn't matter that you can throw a football over those mountains but I mean there's so many things that make him a great I think everyone sees it right now\nRight here on the show speaking of a throwing a football over mountains really than an arm I remember you had a pretty mean fastball when we had a competition back in the day we got a guy on the show tons of data was a pitcher\nA throwing a ...

I think Tom just set on me trying to set him up with Jerry Harrison junior because we're all buddies do we have that can I just play me is there a way to get to me trying to so by the way I Will say this I have a distinct memory\nMaybe I'm wrong of coal right\nIntimating some kind of success exterior and junior and I know the golden eye later but I did\nIn the interest of you know the marketplace of ideas if you will just throw out there and see what rises right or thank you sound like I don't remember\nIt led me to this momentary here since ... it's an all Naperville show you're from ... writes on the show later colds going to pretend that he won struck yeah the baseball game we all know that are true never write\nCover a vocal he's my guide but come on call right stuff is an avid\n[laughter]\nUh it's really too bad coal dodge the duck ... bullet really\nReally affected me ah Jerry all the dog goes about some baseball Jerry played in the big leagues for very long time his father played and the big leagues his grandfather if memory serves played in the negro leagues is is a\nStory baseball family and I I really respect Jerry as a person and I think his baseball knowledge is it is\nAs high as anyone and I always agree with him but he's and he says what he thinks it's just such a refreshing perspective and and so I found a particularly interesting in asking about many maternal because Jerry played with the Dodgers he lives a big chunk of the year in LA and he's a Dodgers analyst over on sports in LA which is what\nBroadcast Dodgers game during the regular season and so I found Jerry's perspective on what he made a man even try to play at first base really interesting\nWell you know I was on air uh after that game are doing the post game for the Dodgers here and\nIt was probably one of the most difficult things or to express the feelings that I I really had because I was I was saddened by his actions I was angry I was disappointed I'm because he's too good of a player and I was probably the one guy clamoring for\nMany Machado when Cory Seeger went down because I came up in the Baltimore Orioles organization or just like many Machado did\nA and I've watched his career is uh friends over there and I wanted him the opportunity to play out in LA and how he would play in the postseason and kind of showcase themselves to the world\nAnd when you're on this grand stage at the end of Yasser hope for the world series everybody's watching not just fans not just um scouts or teams kids are watching\nYou know kids that look up to you and you know that's one of those places that I still can't believe he did it you know whether he was frustrated whether he's angry I I don't know I I Can't I'm not a mind reader but that ... that play can't happen in the game of baseball he could've hurt Agnew are he could've hurt himself\nUm he made no attempt to to avoid him he drug his left leg a ... ... you are and I think\nYou know once you look back at the video and saw that he was embarrassed because well I didn't realize that did that so you know I I've spoken a man who was titled quite a few times I really like him he's one of my favorite players in baseball he's unbelievable talent but stuff like that\nYou know a lot of teams don't like to see that and it's unfortunate and hopefully they'll be relaxing last time that happens and\nThe Machado conversation continued and I Jerry actually broke down\nBut it almost feels like some breaking news 'cause years really connected and you share with us as he discussed even more and more and more detail the Machado situation because it's the you know the money to the money thing and the and I don't hustle Jerry got to appoint you'll you'll hear here where he actually gave some insight into how major league teams that might have signed Machado feel about this\nThe last twenty four to forty eight hours three people three different teams organizations\nAre said to have you know what we're going to kick the tires on many Machado a there I'll be the one thing you can do with how so he's a superstar play I understand you can also all the time and because if you buy a hundred games sometimes you get a groundwater to second base\nYou're gonna be angry upset slander fat or pop up and then you've got her and then you run okay I understand that part but when you voice it\nYou know this is your free agent here uh I Wish you wouldn't I wouldn't have said those comments because guess what\nA lot of teams have to take you buy your word you said you're not that Chinese Puzzle type of guy or a lot of teams have to take you by by by your work\nUh so where are you going to invest three hundred million dollars I don't know um I Love the player I I think he's unbelievably talented I like him as a person I talked to them quite a few times I I really liked them\nBut it's unfortunate last forty eight hours\nIt hasn't been a his best\nBest forty eight hours speaking of baseball pauses Red Sox would that one to zero lead right now\nWith the three one series lead in the AFC has against the Astros the ashes of trying to get the David Price would it be fair to price and it's hard to be fair to price because he can be so remarkably on likeable is is that does actual career goal\nHas pitch pretty well in this game but it looks like a lead off no I'm Sorry I ate a double with two outs for the Astros or run or on second\nHere in the fourth\nAs Susan tries to\nEven the score the game again Boston when one nothing will will keep you updated\nHad been pretty vocal\nI like Clinton versus the picture I think he's a great pitcher and the numbers to me speak for themselves that he is not always pitched well in the postseason but Gerry has its own perspective and I respect it and I just want to\nGive him the chance and this is an hour ago this is the Dodgers use your your ears and juniors view how why perhaps people like me are being unfair and too critical of the post season so called failures of Clinton crucial\nEthic that's in the past I think they're they're just\nYou know the couple of times the struggle a ... it's been blown out of proportion you know he got beat by really good teams that are I Believe what onto the when the world series or so you know there are only a couple of struggles that if I if I say this\nYou know yesterday mark Clayton her shows eight not third not for the whole season start\nWith one ... runs a loud and three or fewer hits eight that is the most by any picture in postseason history thing about that for a second now Roger Clemens and I'm not sure you're not Pedro Martinez not just in Berlin and not found grab Greg Mac doesn't matter\nLake Coeur Shaw stands alone\nThing about eight postseason start with one or zero runs\nIncredible so all this postseason narrative you know I I think is blown outta proportion because he made a couple of ... starts but guess what\nTheir other super stars that have had bad games that's just the nature of the beef in the postseason I think your squash the narrative\nIf and when he wins or ring in order to win a ring you got to be able to have\nSuperstars and I've had bad games that's just the nature of the beach in the postseason I think your squash the narrative\nIf and when he went to ring in order to win a ring you got to be able to have\nThat complete came and you know I think that that you have that seem to the\n... and they're going to have every opportunity the ...\nAnd it's not an easy win win away from their second consecutive World Series appearance and a showdown with probably the red Sox but obviously that series ongoing at least for the moment or the ... the ... stage a pretty significant come back and I think the Dodgers are great team in the Dodgers were my back in the pre season\nTwo in the whole thing I I did the selective memory like yeah definitely took and against the ashes and Stewart being in a noxious Lee effective producer decided to go and do the fact checking then it turned out to um who did I uh I think the doubters over the Yankees in five games though is it five\nYou did say five yeah ours I can get two out of the three right I don't think I don't think that I very much doubt the Dodgers when the world series I'll be win again in five against either of the teams that they would say so I thought you never know

voice of the wall fat Gary hon I he does all the NC State\nFootball and hopes and this is a very interesting but Bob Kane Gary first of all thank you so much for taking a dime a gun on CBS Sports radio I Love this team I think they uh had their hands fall on Saturday obviously and I actually believe in ...\nI cannot even fathom that they're giving an undefeated team that's just the state that many points in that football game they're getting them no respect that all down there I think it was Seventeen when I looked at it I mean that's crazy isn't it\n[noise] well I'm not into betting but ah I Know states a lot better than the the they had qualms that on the ropes the last two years two years ago that valley they missed the chance to win a trip shot field goal in the last boy regulation game ghost overtime tigers once on it or Seventeen\nLast year in Raleigh state had qualms with on the ropes again they were winning Twenty one Seventeen and a half a ... comes back rallies or when I got a big eighty nine year touchdown run by the beast or back playing this game on a Saturday and they ended up on a thirty eight thirty one\nI think the whole thing first stated as it's obvious that states are close the town of ... I mean there was a big a few years ago and now it's not so big and more states just got through or not beat itself I think if the walk back goes down there a place to its potential\nAnd doesn't beat itself has got an excellent chance to uh to pull a big upset\nKnow that's what I mean I buy at the beginning even talking about the numbers because\nI actually that's what I'm saying I don't understand that the games that they played there that I've seen him play there and the games that they played against content of matter where they play had been really good games and they've been in those games so I find it hard to believe how they're favored by that much over this pain\nBecause I've seen them struggle against Syracuse at Death Valley they shed a lot that gained a backup kept bright came in and and won the game miraculously at the end if you remember and then I just think you know I remember the games you're talking about dance\nAt a loss and gained it back on can't bright came in and and won the game miraculously at the end if you remember and then I just think you know I remember the games you're talking about then she said they had every chance in a world the windows football games are they linking their shots\nAt the opportunity to go in there and uh take over the Atlantic if they were to win this game I they ... how excited and so does the football team to take on the challenge\nWell there are still for the for the the reasons I just mentioned I mean that that's what I'm saying in the palm of their hand and they let them go for two years and there's a lot of guys that played in those games that are back not a not so many on the fence\nBut certainly some people on off hands Ryan Stanley the quarterback or\nHe's the home run hitter along with the wide receiver for the uh the running back Reggie collapse bused played against ... and a couple of times these the are the kind of a downhill power running back and the data young freshman by the name of Reykjavik person there's there's put a joke but states got to be able to run the football and opinion but\nIt was very hard to run against them in Georgia Tech only got a hundred and forty six yards against ... and then they're they're leading Russian team in the ACC and they're on the triple option that hardly ever throw up fast so that's how hard it is ironic clumps of but states got to be balanced enough in those game\nTo a allowed Ryan's family to to do what he needs to do and this front for for ... and I'm telling you it's an NFL like from for\nThe two tackles Wilkins and Lawrence are definitely pro players Cleveland feral one of the gyms I think is going to play in the NFL as well I don't think the back seven is as good as it was last year for Clemson but that front forest very very good somehow some way that it's got to be able to uh run a enough\nTo stay balanced enough to give her own family or a time to throw in there and they obviously have to protect them in the state's been good at that states only allowed to sex all year and ... got one of the best past Russian teams in the NBA sixty I think states all kinds of line is underrated\nBut uh you know we'll see\nThat and Gary ... and she said you know they'll ask me the load age going Senate that sounds a day's going late in that game and are against the rights to seal the deal I eat out he's a pound or it'll be interesting to see how they mix it in with him how\nDoes he do you know in your view overall when they're in that red zone or inside the tent and and they just pounded with him do you think he can be effective against that crazy front\nYeah because I think in the states off into the wind is getting better there was some inconsistency earlier this year they had a big tide and carry an July and that the transferred in from USC and he was ineligible for the first two or three games\nOr he's been a a definite upgrade a tight end and one of the other tied into it winds up in the backfield sometimes that one up and read\nA was a a injured and he has a very very good ... or so the tight end position has gotten better that's made the running game better there were a couple of injuries on the off and some wine those guys are evil\nAnd you can see the last three weeks the running game has gotten a lot better for state and stopping to run has gotten a lot better for state and that's the other big issue in this game\nA Clemson runs for two hundred and eighty yards a game and that's taken a lot of pressure off the quarterback position they got a rookie quarterback who's only going to be starting this third game I use a five star recruit Trevor Lawrence but\nStates gotta given some different looks they're going to try to get him off balance and they got the slow down this running game of Travis the TNN and to be a feast or an Adam choice because these guys couldn't couldn't really really run the football\n[noise] were you surprised or add along a and how a fact in the won't pack ban and all of these games and and being where they are and and you know undefeated and and how the\nYou know that the conference is shaping up like I I don't think a lot of ... bc would be tough and you know that in Virginia would finally solve Miami in Miami be sitting three deep in the coastal\n... by the way things are playing out in the way your season started and where you stand now as as above the where the conference as\nWell I'm not real surprised at NC State has a on beating that at this point that we did have a game against West Virginia that would have shown some things early on\nUh but that game was canceled by the big hurricane\nAnd so uh that game is not going to be played and it's been a a substitute at the end of the year and he's Caroline is going to come to Raleigh and play and they're not very good season but uh I I'm I'm not all that surprising state has a five and overall to unknowns ACC they thorns about a fantastic job recruiting\nThey handle all

the last three out\nI Believe so it's going to the night there down for a run it's over involved we\nCame in and uh and blew them away last inning so\nSo I bet on the red Sox tonight against for land already like them apples not a bad bet right I mean they were a huge dogs aren't they it was a Berliner was minus a buck Ninety One eight going into the game sunlight that it was horrible\nUh yeah it was plus one Seventy with Boston Nice pay off their I've had a ton of baseball games\nOh anyway I wanted to tell you about the injury report is broad you by the audience to do let's take a look at the latest injuries to frame and the falcons running back is now and I are as they get ready for the giants on Monday Night ... in a second straight practice for the bears is questionable to face the paths we can soldier field\nEric bury the chief said they didn't apparatus today and it's doubtful to play against the bangles aside from water salt is one of the most common food ingredients we consume and that's no accident sodium is required to make every cell in your body function\nDid you know that everything is better with a little salt find out why add a little salt dot org\nEight five by doing to for CBS anyway uh\nMike in South Carolina you're on video sports radio\nHey Scott how you doing Mike my man what's up man I Love the show CBS Radio in the ... thanks to its got real request Dale Saturday Night big game can Mississippi State Winona ...\nI mean I think that uh they're going to have a hard time winning that game I think anything's possible I I think they've got a shot this is a tough football team and I believe in them so much so that I took the points uh I just think\nYou know I think I got it at at seven I could be wrong it might be seven and a half but I think I got a purely at seven touchdown look LSU\nHad you know just got done with Georgia right they played them in that valley huge game they kick their ass they were ... guy high for that football game there they played it in the afternoon bright beaming son it was a gorgeous and smoke and not everybody's drunken hammered\nThat's all they live far was that George again right I don't know how they possibly and I'm sure they will with enough booze\nBut how did they get up for this game this week\nI I just think it's a trap game if you if there's such a word that I don't think they're you know taken this one like they took that one in terms of seriousness I'm sure that they'll tell you they are\nBut I'm actually not buying that uh they're giving Mississippi State any do here I just think there are going to go through the motions\nAnd handle their business when the game but I think there's too much would involved in other words I think Mississippi state's getting too many points so I'm doing at high risk jealous when I'm In a middle it I'm going to take Mississippi State and the seven or to cover the spread I think there'll be in the game I think\nLSU a when between three and six points but\nWho knows maybe they'll beat them by twenty I don't know I I think it's going to be a better game to most thank\nAnd I'll tell you what I think Mississippi stage and top football team uh Auburn found that out a lot of teams that play 'em a particularly in stark bill they find out real fast\nOr that it's a problem and ah they have been in my view more impressive than anyone thought that they would be not this season I nobody sat there and said while Mississippi stage ... names\nDo they get on ... my bag Saturday it's all about Oregon and Washington state for me and that Michigan Michigan State game NC State Clemson all fantastic games Sunday patch bears soldier field since the and Kansas City Sunday night for on a bench dot coms got it all NBA players now NHL\nThe baseball

it's always my favorite interview of the year with the ... wash bipolar\nLegend Mike Leach head coach of Washington state they're going to be ... on Saturday when the dots come calling and not gain day's gonna be there and what a shame Doug job my God early in the morning everybody's going to be drinking bloody Mary ...\nProbably tell you what it's a wild right now um [noise] 'cause you know we we have that tradition I mean it's not an accident that it every day there's a Washington state flag from the beginning of game day there's been a traditional Washington state\n[noise] to be the first there and waves a flag in the mail it around the country and they recruited a lump stood go do it to make sure they're up front and they have and I think a hundred and sixty times or some crazy number and um so now gene days or pull them for the first time and so\nPeople are thrilled to death there's a mob the the equipment\nTruck load and stuff I mean\nThere's people screaming and yelling there's some cool signs there's a and then [noise] you know from our standpoint we noticed a lot more interviews and just general energy on campus but our guys there are guys were excited to have this chance\nWill you be going on a game day and doing a nice little feature there\nNo oh I'm happy to record something um but you know pretty much fells up my routine and then the other [laughter] I'm a little uh\nI wouldn't say superstitious but I don't know there's something to me that's a you know less focused or she didn't violate some tenets of the football jobs you know you're getting ready to play somebody you don't go up there and ah and kind of what is your ... others around\nYou know right metaphor sort of so to speak\nSo you uh I got to tell you I Love this quarterback eight years or what a game or their skin is I'll tell you what the game that are really got me going was a couple of weeks ago in palm and when he threw that Ninety yard bomb late in the game\nAnd you guys a beat the they use that as a hell of a play and then he follows it up by putting fifty six in Corvallis on the beach I didn't mention is a great quarterback\nAnd I love to see him on Saturday deeds to or a and just go to the gas where did you find him a and how to how did you get your hands on this I guess he can really play\nWell you know it was funny so we're looking for a quarterback didn't have one that played and um\nSo you know and then of course his transfer and you know you get word of transfer to these graduate transportation whatnot\nAnd he was transferred from east Carolina and then he committed to Alabama so we'd like that then ... them off and then um so we figured well what the heck one more call you know you get there you want to sit on the bench ... them or do you want to leave the nation and passing here [laughter]\n[laughter] I don't know\nWhat we liked about him was the ... office and quick he was a decisive I was not a full time starter on there\nBut we like to you know and um we're kind of curious why wasn't and then [noise] he liked are often also because he played played one at some similarities in Mississippi\nHe's from Mississippi originally and then um\nSo I don't know you know the biggest thing you didn't have spring football or nothing got here in may and integrate themselves will just with a fabulous fish and if you\nKnew his personality you see it I mean it's you know while the other boy it and then um [noise] you know it would just lift ordered and most of the other people are fired up all the time and it would kind of the Olympic electrify the room and\nJust had a real good presidents above the other thing is it's honestly is one of the smartest quarterbacks I've ever and I haven't had one\nThat I Would consider dumb but he's extremely smart [laughter]\nSo smart [laughter] and\nThen um you know because we got all these sophomores up there playing receiver and so I'm blooming and getting familiar with them as probably the biggest challenge so I honestly think\nWe've got all these sophomores up there playing receiver and so [noise] um [noise] blooming and getting familiar with them as probably the biggest challenge so I honestly think he's got better James ahead of it\nWhen you saw that play against us see when he took that had shot or how mad did that make it 'cause I didn't see you or I didn't see that a post game press or anything I didn't see any high interviews that you did about ... how did that make him\nWell it wasn't good wasn't good and of course I Can't comment on officiating unless I pay for it which I Am\n[laughter]\nBut uh so you know you're gonna have to speak for those of us are so I watched you know\nYeah so what do you think in a can or however you got to deal with ah he's\nHe's headed to the next level it would seem to me that that can lock Kennett, Missouri that the six point two thirty is seen as her kid pretty big did you watch ... you know any of his game was a film was you know a Washington or do you get into that what do you think of him\n[laughter] yeah we watch the film I mean he's been around for a while um he's been in and out of the line up for the really the last uh two years prior to this and um you know battles his way or somebody else tools and you know and um\nBut uh you know he's a big good\n[laughter] you can throw the ball quite a ways I'm and I think he's a little more accurate than as a\nAnd then I think he manages it seemed pretty well I think he's gotten better or worse experience in time\n[noise] so are your hand and uh it would appear to me a Mexican a dinner tonight what ... what do you like to eat at the Mexican place I live a tuxedo and things of this nature I can eat a lot of chips and salsa I Love guacamole what are you looking at tonight like in terms of the you know the menu\nWell I'm a cat's Lopez in Moscow, Idaho which brought across the border and they have with there's also the ah served for being due to the mix\nThat [laughter] the\nSome people like the chips these guys have the real the ones that just kind of explode when you buy them\nUm [noise] I ...

I'm up in the air and then once you have an area jumped into him right folly jumped into him and he got the file they got the whistle now when we play\nHow many times even when the other night you saw me do it I got the guy on the air in ... games first came in second game I got the guy on the air fully and then I jump up to shift\nAnd I get hammered with body if that guy in the air and you get it when it's on fat guy goes up in the air and you jump into him any NBA it's automatic you're getting the call\nAnd our leg if I Do the same or get them up in the air and jump into it and I never I've never once gotten a foul I'd never won a very true they hate me so you can't get a in a process all you have to do is jump into a guy and it's automatic you're getting a call here I'll\nDo it I mean how does that aren't even does it with the arm of ... you know he's the one that if ms you've got that completely pies you offer them pretend like you felt them and they give a call I'm going to do with all these guys\nI don't know the ... you didn't see the ... it was the worst the worst call I mean it was so bad there is no way he found him he just jumped out then land it and then he jumped into him and got the call it ... it was pathetic money as well because\nThey even have these ones that they do it like the guy is absolutely no checks and begging the Charlotte ... one of a good shot right just trying to drop out and then there's also just start cracking down there last year the year I mean it was going to start coming down or they talked about it but then still when push comes to shove the Ross Macdonald called the guy this year contract it's not about\nSo let me ask you that I'm about to Stanford won twenty there again they covered I had both of those so at the money line and spread I took him on the road in Tempe and they beat him and so\nThe story that bothers me tonight is you know but this game going on and everything did you see a there's a story of ... says that LeBron James minutes there'll be monitored\nWe want to make sure not only were playing or best in the end of the season but that he's fresh that the goal for us and that's a goal that were on a journey and it's not a one year journey and we're going to try to be our best season by season but also each one goes on and obviously he gives us the best opportunity to uh be at our best\nSo\nBottom line is is that the guy saying that we got four years\nThat was signed him and we want him to be playing at the end of the season which makes sense you know we want him to be good to go in the play offs\nAnd that's all that matters so these early season games of a home of that or whatever you want to call it they're going to monitor is minutes we want to play bass\nAnd to do that we want to get guys in and out and in and out we got to have\nA good amount of guys going out there and playing and he says that ah they're going to be very cautious when it comes to a James or any other player not rational me as always kinda you gotta take it as they can see how the season's going\nI get to those ... are there now injuries happening or not and that's when you would do it we're not just going to let somebody just arrest them only to a body or my need that in my opinion\nInjuries adding or not and that's when you would do it or not just gonna read somebody just arrest them only in the body or my needs that in my opinion\nJust got he's speaking out about that in his mouth ... and arrest them on their body needs or their mind needs it but what he's really saying is I'm a I'm not going to let this guy play too many minutes every night and then by the end of the day literally LeBron James was saying\nYou know don't monitor mind minutes I'm good to go I I Am ready to play for John on Saturday Night don't you know don't send me down because you think I Need rest so what do you do do you as the cubs are you going to send him down no matter what he thanks to save them for later in the season are you going to let LeBron do what he wants\nWell I think one was there with all the rest of our estimate you're talking about I think he said he's not going to sit in for games like they were doing a clue what our times before they made that rule last year unless he's injured but\nThey're not going to play and forty four minutes the game and you know he's smart\nThat's Marc Dolan from abroad Rosekind better abroad as the guy who wants to be out there every minute with everything you can drop U.S team win and that's what he's supposed to do but I was the coach you're supposed to protect them from self it goes back to the team was best for that team is\nHave you ever seen anything like like a dude doubt he's face of what the NHL is done to that guy's face like I mean honestly\nNot pretty he he absolutely looks like he's been carved up by the chainsaw massacre that guy I can you even I I Can't even recognize him he's got no teeth this whole face looks like it's been smashed in\nHis lips like cut off is he's got scars all over his face like have you ever seen that when he came in a lake and how he looks today I mean that guy what does he how old is he he's like twenty seven twenty eight years old and he that's it but he was fifty I mean it is unbelievable\nTwenty eight twenty eight years old but you can't tell me it doesn't look forty years old he just is I mean battered DVDs are so many stinks and box and elbows he's\nJust smashed up so what do you think of his game they gave him a a five on three now they're on another powerful I ride the one or off they scored its three do I owners will they scored or on the five on three right I was there was still a ton of time left on the second time so that's where they are right now right\nYeah\nI don't like it at all I mean you've got to like the way they're looking now they got a breakaway chance here easy goal for the islanders\nBoom there you go there's the goal you needed how 'bout that deep bench they gave it to on oh second goal tonight\nHe had a second tonight yeah ... what was wrong with that break down they gave him a due on oh\nWith quite there yet no chance\nIslanders later for two I'm watching the a Laker game as well great game it's a Ninety three Ninety One game blazers are up I just wanted to say that\nLiterally I haven't seen the Lakers get one call in this game not one I mean they are literally I don't know how they're in this game does I mean they are putting the blazers that the line they're getting every single call and I'm just being honest I have no interest in it I'm just saying I'm\nI'm just investing my time and again but I'm noticing that it's kind of one sided with the whistles oh my God it seems that way they are you watching the game Avi are you seeing what I'm saying now\nOr ... year there and watch it religiously this year recalls so they go into the lane at all the Lakers going they get hammered I mean they're ... they're going to the ram and are getting hammered underway and every single hand in the world is swat and Adam and breaking her arms and smack him in the ... the other end that get touched and they go to the line for free dress I mean literally if they get blown on\nThey go to the line but when the Lakers only burlap they getting mauled\nIt's unbelievable and I got to go back to the ... for a second I'm all over the place but it's okay it doesn't matter nothing matters anymore I wanted to say this governor I the kings are a major disappointment to me not in this game but in general\nBecause I was telling the lawyer the mighty fall and do you remember they were winning Stanley cops and now they are and they scored again the islanders\nSo uh it was that Matty Martin putting Martin are tough guy Matty Martin Lawrence them last night I got back on the line up tonight he loved it at all and the Banshee huge fan and loves violence is second goal I Love that he's playing with the islanders again that descended they will be smart enough to keep them for five years\nLook I though it was hard to Toronto gave them a lot of money a lot of money that it probably wasn't worth so I you know I understood why you had to let them go\nI'm Glad he's back when the owners you think he's\nA lot of money that he probably wasn't\nWorth so I you know I understood why he had to let him go\nI'm Glad he's back when the honors you think he's happy and then he wants to stay there and they've also\nRejuvenated this line that they had before he left which was hand with Cal quarterbacking cases IQ is so and they've you know they've looked pretty good in the early\nGoing so tell me what you think of the downfall of the LA kings remember the other night when we were talking to Randy gr didn't and I was like so much to the Olympic Games is like they suck\nYeah it gets it's been a long time since they were you know winning cops do out of three years it's been a while they've overpaid some of the guys that they had over pay from those teams did\nYou just see LeBron James ... look at his past\nHe ... this isn't the black but uh he drew a bounce past behind his back to no one he bounced it out of bounds eat through just threw it away as south now they're down seven and it gives the pill up there in big trouble here at the start of the forward they could find themselves out of this game with\nTen and a half left so\nI just threw the ball I did a balance past behind his back he died his uh his guy was there but this guy was cutting and no one was home and he just let it roll\nRight out of bounds it was terrible but he's not going to make every play in the world you know I think a lot of stuff on that team everybody's always talking about ... mine\nMine's a ball and everything else it's Josh heart scoring again this guy Josh hardy it at three at the end of the third day or bring them into and they just add another bucket seven a down from the floor Seventeen but how do you like those numbers seven to ten\nFrom the floor and Seventeen points it sounds like a ... game zeta Thirteen last night for sixteen and seven shake out\nAnyway I just want to see him come back we're getting to an ad lib Ron said Iraq are getting to an ad they're down three right now nine\nAnd a half to go on and joined this I just wanted to say uh I have brought this up to several people are tonight like you know I see these people that are and I did with ... as well like you you don't really like the NBA de yah he's like you know not really\nAnd then your boy Berman total now I'm like you like the NBA goes no like do you like college you said just the tournament look\nIt's not that I hate the NBA I think I've told you this numerous times\nI have a big problem with the league that on opening night you already know who's gonna win Ninety seven percent of the teams in the week I've absolutely no chance of winning a championship I have a problem with that and I get it's gone on forever in the eighties only two teams won in the nineties only one or two teams I get it but it's it's it's I'm not talking about just the war\nIs a lot of the ... you know as as better because it's just an eighty eight you don't know who's gonna win the Stanley Cup\nYou don't know who's going to win the Stanley Cup and honestly on opening day you know who's gonna win the world series now on on kick off of NFL week one you know who's definitely going to win the super bowl I Know in a planet [laughter]\nEvery year I mean yeah they've added a bit of a rabbit and a lot of ... that's been abroad they don't win it every year they lost last year they lost twice to the giants I mean they don't win it all the time but they're in it but\nStill on on night one NBA you knows what in the title it's over it's over so it's just ceremony around their hype is based from June twentieth to October fifteenth\nThe draft trades free agency these are the things that build the hype of the week\nBut then the seasons are wasting time wasted time but do you feel like getting up there for gambling gambling and hotbed for gambling sure what I'm saying if you're a fan and in Ninety seven percent of the week how do you start if you have no shot at winning right I'm Sorry I just it's all you can\nFind teams literally know that there's another turnover Jesus there just melting away and this game that there is there a problem there are so great they're going to go to the NBA Finals Lakers the greatest the members said they don't know how to win games they don't know how to finish\nWe'll see if they can finish the game but they just keep turning Iraq over making bad bad and throwing the ball out of bounds losing it in there you know in their\nFeet balance fast is bad but anyway\nI don't know why they don't just give them the rock Everytime down and let him go to work I really don't like it's amazing to me that they're trusting and hard and and and you know anger him in ... that it's them that are handling the the rocket and its them that are shooting the rock\nInstead of this guy he went to the line every once in a round me got filed area shooting ... that's how you win this game\nGive him the ball let him go and get contact as he gets that will uh with some respect the rest of them don't get me ever noticed that these young guys and they don't get the whistles they don't get the calls ever LeBron and get that every time same as Michael Jordan get them and so every time he touches the ball at you blow on him and he's going to the line that's it\nThat's all there is to it eight forty one left in them and and\nUh that was it than I did in Philly blew out or in their game or the bowls and then a Miami the buzzer beat the wizards one thirty one so was I not just saying last night again that uh the wizards\nHave this member I was doing them five the lineups of the woods and ... and that's where they were rated that they have that much money on that payroll and they have you know wall and bill and all that\nMoney that they spent on those two and then they're just middle of the road and they never win and they don't matter and they can finish and they can't win playoff series and they do nothing is this all true and then tonight in their home opener they lose it the ... the do they eat it because they just don't\nMatter I mean it's unbelievable to me it is it's like they've gotten this great team and all these high priced guys they don't win it's unbelievable it really is\nIt's like what's the point aren't they met on a road there Miller middle of the road they don't even it's like you could talk about that until the cows come home but they'll never matter\nThat's amazing to me I mean\nYou give all those guys that to a hundred and fifty million whatever I mean it's just like at some point you gotta when Alonzo trucking at three ball with his uh ugly Jay and nailing it they're down one\nGet the maximum loan forgiveness loan reduction or consolidation

will be an absolute travesty\nThat'll be that'll be the worst thing that's ever happened I think literally in sports what exactly is the appeal to that fight I don't understand there is none that guy

L. the accent of course the birthday party in locker rooms celebration afterwards and\nI teach in all ... the same thing I've said to my listeners this is certainly not the series that I expected considering how many wins these two teams accumulated between them when you think back on this ALCOA asked what will stand out to you\nYeah you know it's crazy because with baseball it's always like every year to find a new way of playing the game right like\nWe had different areas where the Kansas City royals just made contact and then you know last year was the big home run there and the team that the most home runs is going to win this year it it it's almost comic gone back to the contact thing with the red Sox are they just don't they don't strike out a whole lot\nThat don't give away a bat when all the two outfits that they had 'em in the ... that they had a series it to their stars hardly even showed up I mean Judy Martinez than not do anything in the series until you hit a home run in the final game who keep that offers of leaders do a whole lot obviously get the the crazy play\n'em over the right field fence two nights ago and made another nice place night obligated to do a whole lot offensively Cristo hardly pitching the theory hum and was not great but it was the the rest of the line of the from top to bottom lot unexpected guy showed up the starting pitchers\nOut of relief over and over again um I think our score to squeeze the most out of his rocker I don't think the red Sox are more talented you know he's been asked her I think court to squeeze the most of these guys and their style of baseball proved to be better well\nHow did they mark his birthday then\nAfterwards [laughter] yeah they they were pretty happy for those ... had said last night because they won so great that they're going to get to inform on his birthday a and it turns out that they did um you know they've always really liked\nPlaying for him ever since he came here in spring training they felt like there was something different where you know they've they've talked about over and over again this year that the locker room just felt more relaxed in and they felt more comfortable um for whatever reason core brought to the team and the other one says\nThat his personality became kind of took that on where he's really focused uh he's hyper competitive but his relax then he's blind he's honest a he's a great communicator\nAnd you know the players and his team will talk for hours about how much they liked playing for a and it clearly I showed on the field\nI Know that he had talked about his time with the Astros a bunch but looking back and and the time that you've covered the team this year with Alex his manager what he learned specifically from being part of bad experience with Houston winning the world series last fall\n[laughter] yeah that's a great question I I think probably a lot of things that you thought during the regular season but the one that stands out three now since we've gotten to the post season is the urgency aspect I mean if you look at the series with the Yankees for example you know here in ... and his first year as manager\nIt didn't seem like he had a lot or even like there is almost managing those games like it was regular the regular season you know trying to get the most out of his starting pitchers and\nNot going to the ball and and you know not using all of his death on the roster I'm Cora ... kinda the opposite I think he he brought these guys are to everyday and say we need to win tonight and you know from game one of the post season they were quote unquote all in every game where the starting pitchers who weren't\nAre supposed to start then I went to the book and and you know the guys who were in the last one I might not be in the wind up the next day and it they were just selling out every single day when that specific game and I think that you know something that he took from the sort of last year that\nYou can't take one inning for granted you can't have one match up that doesn't benefit your team you have a matchup advantage and the second inning take it you know and he'll pitch it the fourth and um so I I think the urgent aspect of his managerial style that kind of been on display\nJason ... from the Boston Herald is in Houston after the red Sox wrap up the A. L. C. S. three games to one and of using four games to one and get back to the world series for the fourth time in Fifteen Years it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio\nBig story a lot of course is going to be David Price she's already changed his Twitter to say Astros father after his daddy or something like that [laughter] but you have to say\nYou still worry a lot of course is going to be David Price he's already changed his Twitter to say asteroids father after his daddy or something like that [laughter] do you have to say about finally earning his first ... W in a post season starts\nA there was just so much relief on his face you know I mean you could see even moments where he didn't want to smile he would smile or you just couldn't help it I'm ... you know the biggest thing that he felt like\nA from a pitching stand point was that last night all that time he spent warming up I'm In game for when you were supposed to kind of come in in the eighth sending the maybe the night he spent almost an hour where we have to the bullpen\nAnd he actually thinks he's found something a mechanically that enabled him to fix whatever was going on he came out today he said he felt great throwing the ball this morning he said he was in in visiting himself throwing exactly the way he did today six shut out any\nUm and his wife and he was the ties with spending in three or four months and use this change of a career high percentage of the time a pitch that\nHas had a feel for and all of a sudden here to fuel for it\nIt was like everything came together perfectly for David Price and the start ... and ... those was one of the worst swings we've seen when they asked for wind up in those are some good hitters over there they just couldn't touch them um the change of the fact that he was locked in he was throwing with good command with good velocity\nA that was a different David Price than we've seen in the postseason possibly ever\nSo he's thirty three and he finally gets his first win in a stark court teach\nHad plenty of experience going back to his gays and Tampa Bay then you've got a Twenty one year old and ... who heads a three run home run it and I still not sure how that ball got out I was going to be a really loud Hi pop up I don't fly out and and yet it carried all the way the seas ... what was that like for him\nYeah though 'cause it it's a great point about that head and you know talk to the hitting coach about him and this is this team is kind of been waiting for this program from him and he's so young and you know David Ortiz had a comment and the off season where he said this guy is this good and he doesn't even know what he's doing\nBecause he hasn't learned he he doesn't play his brain is not actively\nThinking about baseball the way the other guys do when they've been in the league for a couple of years where he's just getting by on pure hell\nAnd what happened this year is you know he got into some in your ... he lost the starting job because he wasn't playing well and all of a sudden he had to make adjustments and you know his his the mental development of his game ... he had to make changes and when we we all remember that home run hit off for all the ... the hunter two mile an hour fastball\nA up an outside in the air but it's all I feel that was what ... home run was like\nTonight it was almost the same pitch not quite as far outside but a high fastball from one of the best pitchers in the game\nAnd somehow he stays inside and goes to a field and what the Red Sox thing 'cause that's just calmness that's maturity and him and you know he had a horrible season this year and let the majors and errors but\nThreats I don't think he's anything like that player they

believe\nMe with the lord [laughter]\nYears\nAgain looking forward to this weekend\nIn the NFL we set it and\nHodgepodge of of various storylines and also some odd\nMaybe they wouldn't necessarily appealed to you but because of where we are we seven where we're coming from now third of the way through the season I think again consider\nThe various fascinating ways that we seven might play out even find our poll on Twitter after\nOur CBS or on my Twitter and also on our Facebook page it's one of the questions we ask you every week that we get more responses to them pretty much any other question it's after hours on CBS Sports radio questions if you're going to\nPhil Bella jak about a path Russia you're\nNot going to get an answer about the quality of said past Russia or if you dare to put Lawrence Taylor in the same ZIP Code as\nCurrent path Russia or any pass Roger\nLast to know him up when I was so close so\nThey put a lot of those\n...\nForget whatever pass Roger you asked me about\nI don't even know what bathrobes or you asked me about we're talking about Lawrence Taylor\nLot of good paths Rogers that came to the NFL\nCome on Bella ... shining a reporter Lawrence Taylor we're talking [laughter]\nAh yeah okay so why don't we give back a few more seasons or maybe another decade or so before we start putting him in Lawrence Taylor category so he has been fantastic I certainly since he got to the NFL and definitely made a splash with the Chicago Bears\nThey will be hosting the New England patriots coming up Sunday we seven at soldier field major gauge for the bears just like it was for the chief last week in week sex patriots meanwhile look as though they settled into a nice groove I Love this idea of\nFinding consistency and now staying in that zone a lot of teams bouncing\nBack in week number six though not the bears they lost in overtime to the Miami Dolphins but for the patriots they now found this group can they stay there can they take it on the road and can they deal with the defense that wants to get to the path or ... and that's where he makes a living he said ... times he stays up right\nAs the whole idea was Brady\nYou don't get to 'em you give them ten seconds back there in the pocket and he's going to pick your part of the bears are going to want to make life miserable for Brady on Sunday after hours here on CBS Sports radio life is already miserable for the New York giants now at one end five but there are calls for\nA quarterback change there are calls for well all kinds of changes uh there's a lot of finger pointing and let's be honest the team has looked terrible\nThis is supposed to be about back year for the giants bringing in ... uh doing up\nDoing the the the money thing with the all sense of line attempting to rebuild that line bringing the likes of inmates older it just hasn't worked and what the antics of odors that Kim junior coupled with\nThis question mark them why didn't you take a quarter back in the draft\nWhich is really not fair to say well I'm Barkley but just it's been a mess they've only had one game in what two years in which they been over thirty points on and so here they are against the team in the Atlanta Falcons coming up on Monday Night\nThat can definitely put a ... billion points on the board in the blink of an eye I Hope it's on a lopsided Monday Night match up but I sure do know that for ... and the giants the time is\nNow get hot misleading and uh you know it's possible if we're going to do what we found a way to get one in ... you know this week on the road you know ... to get the land but um you know it could be ... focused and who are ready to go out there in the road ...\nThere's gonna be plenty of stuff that goes on and the noise of just kill everybody else that doesn't really know or is involved in and they're always going to be looking to bring down so you know if they're going to Democrats are going to condemn on so we just take one sibling under the best that we were given a building in for what with\nNATO older I'm sure he was not comparing the giants and Jesus only the idea that pretty much everybody is up for criticism\nUh yeah the the giants have deserved a lot of it and the office of line has deserved a lot of it if you think about last week against the eagles so it was Thursday Night Football the staff that I tell that I told you was between the number of Saxon the number of quarterback hit in addition to the facts\nManning was touch not just pressure but actually had physical contact on twenty six percent of the giants snaps

reference it last night and they say wow how could you do that no one could show he was killed and he was a reporter to\nDo you know the president he's not looking at the relation between the two he's working a live audience who waited a long time to get in and he was just talking about what a local politician did there was flat out bizarre but I don't think he was supporting it that's the way

saying you're you're ... you're right about that is terrible about killing women in the show but looking in the ...\nJohn McCain was a baby killer and they were screaming about em dropping bombs on on on the Vietnamese you know everything's just shame Brian I've been on the street for Thirty years you're going to find out it show all the Paso a chair you're sitting in how you come across\nWell thanks a lot of ... what happened is of course the Vietnam War there was a draft there was a lot of resentment for that war and they started getting mad at our airmen the air force members as well as a our army they say well you're killing kids because a lot of the video images brought back\nWith that but that wasn't the reality on the ground things that happened were casualties of war and hopefully we got past that period but they work or talking about air force pilots is doing that but\nYou know we're also processing applications\nAnd increasing the rate at which you can become a U.S citizen and green card holder\nWe're actually looking at ways to reform our legal immigration system as well not just for ... base reforms\nBut also be able to get to do it the right way speed up that process so you can become a legal resident and become a US citizen the right way but I think it's just a slap in the face to those who are doing it the right way and are following or us immigration laws versus those who are openly flouting that means and our faces\nSo ah do perception is that well this is a the the president of the United states is going to set a record you is this a great\nIt's a great topic and it's a great issue for him would come the midterms but you're saying on the ground when everyone's focus on these caravans you find is relatively aggravating because don't focus on the care of and the care of it is just one issue you're dealing with that on the border on a daily basis and your view hopeless\nRight now you know we're seeing a caravan coming towards the United states\nOf about four thousand people right that's what the news is reporting we're apprehending about two thousand on the border each and every single day that's where you know the men and women have CBP and border patrol or apprehending them but there's not much recourse they can do once they apprehend then were forced to release because not only are detention centers\nFilling up but then even if we do you know keep the family unit and detention we can't do anything with them is twenty days is too short of a period to be able to adjudicate and removed from our country the best attorneys removal and we don't have that ability right\nNow do you think the word is out on these loopholes in central and South America\nOh these smugglers traffickers no our laws better than members of Congress\nI mean it is the most shocking that I've seen recently um is that you know from two thousand sixteen to now more men are coming across the border with children than ever before\nYou know and twenty sixteen it was about six thousand men came across the border with children today it's up to sixteen thousand which says that people know that if they bring a child you will be released into the United states and there's little or no chance for removal\nSo I Want you to you David to a forest said on TALK of the other night uh he's a former President Obama's State Department official\nWe're talking about illegal migrant immigration right and illegal immigration gone down for Mexico and it couldn't go down for Honduras and Guatemala and other countries in Central America have we known and improve those economies we only give a little bit of money so let's help improve those economies and you know they really are going to leave him going there and we need to pay more\nSo you heard Tucker sarcasm but that\nIs the feeling that if we just gave these people more aid they stay home\nYou know the number one and number two reasons\nYou know border patrol has found when they interview folks at the border to come to the United states you know what's driving them number one is reunification and number two and economic opportunity\nThat is not because they feel unsafe at night because the economy is not great they really want to come to the United states you know if if you're truly seeking you know ... if you're ... persecution and your fleeing no reason why you cannot remain in your home country why not stop and Mexico\nBut they don't stop and Mexico they continue on to the United states you know I was just at the border a couple of weeks ago\nHad a chance when we apprehended a family unit you ask why are you coming to the United states I'd like to meet up with my brother who's living illegally in Richmond, Virginia\nWow so we're seeing that's what you're seeing so drawn um oh good good ear as is um he's he is Mexico's ambassador to the United states he was on our general yesterday I Want you hear what he said about the Caribbean ... to\nWe have evidence that or this carbon is also very much politically motivated so we're not we all lose your sense of the humanitarian situation that we encounter\nAnd we're acting precisely but we we have also made very clear that there is no legal ground on which Mexico can issue a permit by which the ... go towards the United states\nSo but they do they let them through\nAnd the care of in some of that has been sponsored by some enemies of our state but on both those issues first off who puts his carbon together\nI mean this camera and is being put together by NGOs and others um mainly for media attention I mean as I just said we're seeing caravan side every day at the border you know we've heard reports of these folks getting on buses and then getting off and walking for the cameras\nYou know they are getting a ton of media attention and it is at least putting a spotlight on a loop hole the serious loopholes in us immigration law that once again is you know at least thanks flash on everyone's TV screen to know just what a crisis in it at the border day in and day out\nCan Mexico do more\n[noise] you know Mexican ... Mexico's definitely taking steps to address the humanitarian issue but yes you\nKnow these Mexican cartels control the entire U.S Mexico border I feel comfortable saying that you know predominantly\nYou have to pay a smuggler or traffic or about five thousand dollars as the going rate right now to get across the U.S border so there is a two point five billion dollar industry for these traffickers they smuggler these cartels to get people across the border illegally that is happening in Mexico right now\nYou know we're speaking to know a kid he's dealing with this on a regular basis or we have a duty woman here the spokesperson so Dianne\nFeinstein does not only does she not regret the two thousand new law that pushing for central and south Americans to come here and stay she says if she if she gets her party gets empower the she plan I'm fixing the law or were\nAnd bring it up [noise] you know I'd have to say that we really do need Congress to act and close these loopholes because if not if you just continue to see more of the same\nThat is four hundred thousand you know I just said that a hundred thousand people apprehended at the border last year they're all here today are going to continue to see it as an flock\nA family unit an influx of unaccompanied alien children because if you keep screaming work does emptying you from the law work exempting you from any consequences you're gonna continue to see people come in and it's up to Congress now to close loopholes\nGave you just don't understand if the if the Democrats see this happening they it's not good not a good issue for them to let people think that people can put our borders and get into our country so why don't they want to fix this I understand that they have the same for the wall they don't want to get the president a victory but why don't they want to fix catch and release\nIt seems like common sense to me but maybe it's just a fundamental misunderstanding of the way US law works I mean to me it makes perfect sense that if you have a you know a crisis going on at the southern border you'd want to fix it but that's a great question for Dianne Feinstein\nWhich she says that you would like to even make it easier for people to come here illegally right I think so yeah\nWell and you feel as though this has been defined well in this in this political process in this election season\nI think we need\nOh yeah well and do you feel as though this has been defined well in this but in this political process in this election season\nI think we need to as much as you can and much as your listeners can\nReally get out there and educate on what actually is happening at the border because it's not just four thousand people today it's two thousand people every single day and if people we can't remove and then it's either going out you know into communities and putting themselves at risk and they ... ... every day and go out there\nTo keep our community than keep drugs off the street and it really is an effort\nAnd educational effort to help everyone understand what is happening at the border and why we really do any congressman\nAnd three there were three border patrol soul to uh over the last five days so that the danger is real and last week for people listening for those who say well you know Katie well I'm In the brain to me they're talking they don't have big hearts these people have horrible lives and we should just give them a shot\nHow much of our tax dollars do you want to pay\nA ... there are people in this country who are worthy of help from the government\nHow can we possibly sustain our country if we have to pay for everybody to come here it's just not sustainable we will not be the beacon of hope and democracy because when a collapse from within were running on a angle basis a deficit of seven hundred and fifty billion dollars\nHow much more are we willing to spend for people from other countries\nThat's the question that has to be asked just tell me do we all have to work an extra day for people in other countries when there's people in this country that need so much\n\nYou know Ryan we spent thirty three thousand dollars a year per unaccompanied alien child is in this country they're Thirteen thousand unaccompanied children ha chest coffee right now that money could be going towards Pell Grants that money can be going toward inner city schools that money can be going toward\nThe Medicaid so many things in our country and closing loopholes doesn't cost a diner taxpayer dollars\nIt's frustrating I Know for you especially when when people don't understand the issue and they make it personal and they're trying to go up in the polls when you're just trying to solve a problem Katie Waldman thanks so much\nThanks for having me on you got one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine that's a comprehensive look at the reality at the border we put politics aside your next\nComing to you need to

race\nIt well for those of you who are sick of taxes and efficient running government he's your answer to leave it there but you know what you believe maybe it'll play out in this debate they're going to debate on Sunday and let's see if we're on to say at this cannot out shine him here maybe doesn't deserve to be a governor because he has not been it has\nI'm at a loss or even a has a been a instrumental in forming a little while I was told was a tiger team to conduct the covert special operations last month we learned about this and other reporting is that he is the person the Saudis are kind of a dentist buying as\nThe the the the the fall guy basically the designated corporate [noise] um he he worked closely with a with the crown prince we know that I'm about half of the uh people who the Turks say came into in this stumble\nAt the time of this killing were members of NBS as personal security detail so he's going to have to speak to the issue of his own culpability the idea of length just laying off on well my deputy did this I don't think that's gonna wash\nWell I'm I Know it's not going to wash with Republicans and Democrats in the house listen to what Lindsey Graham told us\nHow do I engage Saudi Arabia when NBS the de facto leader of the country is in spray and destroy disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for he is toxic there's no way we can move forward uh I don't I Would suspend arms sales as long as he's in charge\nSo go ahead and we all heard we all heard that\nWhen Lindsey said those words on Fox and and they went viral in the world I have Saudi friends who called me said\nEvery year of his listen to what Lindsey Graham said and we didn't we [laughter] we hear him saying you know the the ... there must be accountability uh I I think you're right that in the house and Senate um that people are angry about this I think President Trump understands that there's a lot of anger out there [noise]\nUh but but again it's it's it's not that this was a A R R guy at the Washington Post it would it's that he was living here as a as a resident and as such was entitled to certain protections\nAnd uh we need to take that seriously and get to the bottom of what happened what was the breakdown why didn't we know more as as he is he walked toward that conflict or from which he would never merge white and we know more\nAnd you in your column today go over some of the questions you want answered for example did you know you want to know if our intelligence agencies knew that he was being targeted pursued like they knew that they could so he was actually endangered like he was you up some patients don't you\n[noise] well I Do ah the ... so there there are two possibilities one is that we knew and people didn't act in a timely way of what they know and that really bothers me but the second is equally worrying and and that is that we just don't have visibility into Saudi Arabia and here's this\nGuy was powerless president loves them and and the president's son in law loves them but we don't know much about how he's operating so we we don't have that visibility so that's got to be fixed that that's just not that's not a good situation\nFor us to to walk blind and the something it was a disastrous is is so I think this is what the congressional oversight committees were were were created for his moments just like that they should that should it's it's a very secret\nI wouldn't expect that I or anybody else in the media would hear about it but I think they should review everything that was produced as we know take the psychological profile of NBS which\nCertainly is a CIA responsibility\nYou know it should be reviewed that that would that was a straight up what was the reaction of of people in the White House when they when they were told us where they caution this is a volatile personality I could go down the list of Brian of all the questions I think should be\nShould be asked again they should be asked in private and asked in a bipartisan away but this is one where we got to get it right\nYeah I don't don't people the king is not enjoy it's the prince and you say that if the prince who's going to be removed NBS he's going to be removed you say new last bullet point your column that they are that the people are rallying around prince ... bin ... are these the last remaining son of the founding king a king Saud\nSo who is he and do you think they might actually be a change in leadership because of that\nThink it's way too early to say that uh I I just think that that our intelligence agencies should be should be doing due diligence to see what's what's going on [noise] um that this is a moment where in truth ... it is king Solomon\nNot MPs who's running the show he has in under the Saturday system absolute power\nAnd he can make decisions as he sees fit and if he decides that the kingdom its future are in jeopardy or with the current leadership under him he's going to act I mean the one thing I've seen of the Saudis are over many many years watching them\nIs that they know how to play the politics of survival and you know sometimes\nOver many many years watching them is that they play the politics of survival\nAnd you know sometimes I make pretty cold blooded decisions so um you know can solve a lot of the person to focus on because I met a I have missed it there are other surviving sons three of them including some on [laughter]\nBut but prince I'm at is the one who um all the Saturdays I've been talking to us two weeks you know he's a person and we think represents the values the kingdom and so does it don't get me wrong of runners on a big movement people shot as being very careful there just watching\nThe way David but they're waiting for us\nThat's interesting and we're waiting for them to do their own investigation even though we'd probably have all the answers already\nWe'd have a lot of answers but they need they as they do on it you know for it to go forward as a country that is going to war they need to own it\nDavid if you put thought into that type of thing that would actually a sweat the type of thing they come out of this investigation is actually a ... wage Democrats and Republicans in the house she's been in Congress\nSo so I think this is a rare moment you know we've had these very partisan into intelligence ... and the house of Russia\nYou know let's just put that aside for the moment at let's say agree that we have we have a big national interest our efforts to challenge Iran which I think are good depend on Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia strength so we we we got it got it right and I think Democrats or Republicans are are going to agree on that so\nThat that writes starting point is to have a solid foundation

[noise] I Would encourage\nFarmers to remember just how much data they're cold thing on the farm when we think of data we we hear about data all the time it's a big buzz word in the media\nThey did more than just what comes off your your monitor here collecting planting dates you have the oil test you have a herbicide program that you used this year\nYou know what rate you used and the timing and now you can that's how that performed synthesize all that information together capitalize on the people around you you're ... you're fertilizer guys use their industry knowledge in your data to make better decisions going forward\nWhile and used people like you to understand that data that's coming in yeah that's exactly why we're here yeah ... good to talk with you thank you thank God that is cursed in Thomas Garrett she is a dekalb as grow technical\nAground I messed up ... let's talk more economy we've got Jim ... and Michael Langham or whether they are co authors of the egg economy barometer I'm working on another one right now Jim's also extension economists chair\nMichael is a professor in the department of economics and Jimmy probably hold the classes are too as well do I do teach commodity futures commodity futures you know at all\nA professor in the department of economics and Jimmy probably hold the clients or do as well do I do I teach commodity futures commodity futures you know at Iowa State many many moons ago that was a good con four Ninety five and a I think that it\nLong ago back in the mid eighties I think they introduce you to the futures trading a lot later in the program than what you do now when did the kids start to get involved or kids one of the students start to get involved in the futures and options class of the\nMost of my students are juniors and seniors I'm I have a few sophomores but mostly juniors yeah so\nWhen they leave for new after taking that class what do you hope that they understand of about futures and options and how to use uh\nThe first thing that I Try to teach him is that you've got two components of risk once the futures price risk and the other is the basis risk\nAnd using futures allows you to actually um [noise] separate those two components manage those two component of risk independently right and I'm In class recently we actually spent quite a bit of time I'm\nLearning about basis and more correctly how to forecast base okay\nVery cool very cool a Michael if he could move that might just a little bit closer to your mouth there so that we make sure to get in there you go that's looking good luck and get let's talk about the barometer here uh Michael what what what we were just talking with her than about data and collecting that data\nYou probably are working on the next one right now aren't ya\nWere collecting data this week I'm going to be doing some analysis a or the next week or ten days and then actually reported on the first Tuesday of November\nOkay and the barometer to date you know you think about the economy it's a slow moving machine out there but there's been some happiness and the barometer readings here recently hasn't there\nBeen a wild times in agriculture and then then the barometer as reflected that you know we saw the first big dip and the barometer this summer and took place on that July reading which was really the first opportunity we have to talk to people following the big drop in and commodity prices\nAnd then we saw a little bit of recovery in August but it took another nosedive here and uh it's in September I think it dropped twenty five points in September relative to where it was in in August and so\nUm you know it's reflective of the the downturn than we've seen and commodity prices and and in turn that tightening and margins for most farm operations across the nation\nYes so Michael when a when you see a reading like that and that kind of a debt what kind of sirens does that set off for you\nWell I think part of what's going on here there's a there's a lot of uncertainty right now particularly with with regard to trade policy and I think anytime you have a lot of uncertainty ah that's going to make the barometer move up and down a little bit more than would otherwise so I think that's very important but\nBut one of the things that we're seeing that that uh that are are red flags if you will\nIs we have questions asked people about how does this year compared to last year\nAnd people are on as a not answering that\nVery very optimistic way and so they really don't think that they're doing better this year compared to last year more over when us when you asked them whether they're going to be doing better year from now there's still quite a few people and answer that are either the same or or or or a slightly worse and\nSo we're just not seeing the uptick in confidence that their financial position is going to improve I and I and I and and that's both short term and long term when I've talked about the short term and long term we've got some signals where there's still some pessimism out there if you will along with some people that are optimistic you always have a diversity of opinion\nBut we ask a question related to whether this is a good time to invest in machinery and buildings and that question I asked that question this last month was that the lowest level\nIt's been since we started asking that question I specifically there's there's fewer percent that think this is a good time to invest in machinery and buildings than there ever has been a in the in the history of the survey uh and also we ask people about their expectations of land values I it's a real mixed bag\nA there are still quite a few people out there that think there are still some a chance for land days to decline in the next year and perhaps uh up to five years from now and so I think those are just signals that that uh the margins are tight and they expect him to remain tight or for the for the near future\nNo land values if they are expected to go down can that be kind of a self fulfilling prophecy guys back away from the market\nUh yes it could but another thing that's happening with land values is interest rates yeah high interest rates are are have increased ... increased already we've gained at at at least fifty basis points or a half percent interest rates are ready and uh and and with a future fed\nPolicy actions were probably going to see another one to one and a half percent perhaps even two percent increase in interest rates are that's going to affect the short term interest rates more than the long term interest rates but more but nevertheless ah that that will have a a depressing\nEffect on land smoking is there anything in the barometer about how former you're dealing with a a lending institutions with bank and we don't ask questions specifically\nRelated to that but we do ask questions related to their financial position now compared to last year and then and now compared to a year from now and and and and as I indicated there's there's there's still a fairly substantial group of people that don't take their situation is going to improve\nYour gym interpret that for us if if you if you've got civil effect your situation is not going to improve what does that mean for the egg economy going forward just the attitude have an impact on the economy\nWell I think it has an attitude in terms of the actions of people take typically with respect investments\nAnd you know Michael was talking about the farmland values I'm looking at the chart and um we ask people for their farmland price expectations twelve months ahead and what we saw the last three months\nWas a significant rise in the percentage of people expecting lower farm land prices and the next twelve months prior to the the the trade issues and and the big drop in commodity prices this summer\nI think only about a Fifteen to twenty percent of the people in our surveys of expected lower prices for farmland in the next twelve months\nA when prices dropped here this summer of these last three months we've not seen that as about thirty percent so that's um depending on which months you compare it to an almost doubling of the percentage of people that expect lower farmland values and the next twelve months and that just tells you that\nPeople feel like they're working capitals too tight they ask for it to make those kind of bad so I don't want to make that kind of a long term commitment um and that's probably going to be reflective of what we see take place in in some of the auctions this winter\nAnd Michael doesn't that has to have to translate at some point into some lower average rental rates\nI Do a very good questions that we were looking at a rental rates earlier this year all the way into late may it looked like cash for instance ...\nThat'd be a very good question um we were looking at a rental rates earlier this year all the way into late may it looked like cash for instance stabilize or perhaps we're going to perhaps increased a little bit or the producer land values survey which uh surveys people\nAre typically in may and June actually saw some slight increase I all cash rest for two thousand Eighteen\nBut that was largely before or the drop in soybean price so yeah I was a drop in soybean prices I I think there's a there's a lot more pressure\nA downward pressure for cash rationed we've asked the question the last ... much Jim about that and and sixty three percent sixty five percent approximately ... of the producers that we surveyed ... gonna be barometer survey I indicated the extra cash ...\nLower with Jim and Michael when we come back for her to do is one thousand acres carry the won these days it's hard to make\nThe math word for your soybean fields to be a chef liberty links system with liberty herbicides makes it easier to start with the two plus bushels per acre yield advantage in lower system input cost more complete we can fool you get an extra thirty three dollars more and more profit potential per acre there to as grow Roundup Ready to extend sores\nThere's two issues there one is how rapidly they might be lifted and then there's the second issue is um\nThere's already some evidence that were maybe starting to disrupt some longer term supply chain relationships and I think for a lot of economists that's probably what we worry about the most is if you disrupt the supply chain relationships whether it be on the soybeans side or whether it be on the pork side or even on the east side\nWants to supply chains have shifted\nThey're likely to remain in place right and so you know there was a news story earlier today I think that uh maybe came from the wall Street Journal a habits of discussions with people in Spain and Argentina and talking about the fact that the Chinese have been reaching out to them and and they were looking at making changes in their operation in expanding\nA to in an attempt to supply of pork in their case to China those kinds of changes are the things that you worry about because once that changed takes place there's a lot of inertia yeah and so if we lose some of those markets because the supply chain relationships have changed they're going to be tough to get back\nYeah and you know pork obviously but when it comes to China and us pork it was more of the growth potential that we saw there rather than actual exports but now when we saw soybeans obviously China's a hugely important markets us soybean producers how long\nHow long do you think it takes before Brazil decides you know what China in the U.S aren't getting along and we're going to take advantage of it really ramp up are being production\nI think we're going to see a bump in acreage this fall you know coming out of South America\nAnd uh you know this is we've seen some of this before if you go back in the Nineteen Seventy up and think about what our market share of a worldwide saving acreage was versus a South America um we heavily dominated the world are\nVery much so and over the last forty years we've progressively last market share the industry has gotten bigger overall so that's that's a combination of some of that but this will exacerbate that and um there's ample opportunity to expand in South America or they've got land they could bring into production\nProbably the biggest challenges transportation yeah um\nBut those issues can be resolved and I I expect to see a bump and acreage down there this this winter um and harvest acreage next to you know in twenty Nineteen\nAnd a corresponding lake we're going to see a dip and soybeans acreage in the U.S you know a lot of debate will be taken place over the course the winner with corn and soybean prices are you know bumping up and down trying to bid acres away from soybeans and then the corn but ah it would not be surprising to see saving acreage drop ten percent and the U.S\nWow that would help that I don't know if that's a cure Michael but taken ten percent off our acres longer term offer being acres that would help the corn ... or the market but then you start to wonder about what what\nMeans for court it's in the ships would probably be regional\nI if you look at the eastern core eastern corn belt I think there would be less shift shifting out of soybeans and there would be in the western corn belt and run or than planes\nAnd so I think the shifts it'd be regional but nevertheless that would that would impact all of us but I wanted to talk a little bit about the relative profitability of corn and soybeans good this is really changed after this drop in saving prices for about two thousand Thirteen to to the late\nMay of two thousand Eighteen soybeans in particular in the eastern corner\nPrices for about two thousand and Thirteen to to the late May of two thousand Eighteen soybeans in particular in eastern corn belt definitely head up an advantage from Annette return standpoint uh now that the Serbian prices declined and corn prices haven't declined as much as more even\nYeah and so in eastern Congo this not like corn has that necessarily an advantage but it's just the ... that's the advantage of soybeans had has disappeared gotcha and so on the eastern corn belt I expect us to move much more towards fifty fifty last year Indiana planted more soybeans and corn I Would be shocked\nIf it had occurred in two thousand Nineteen I think it'd be much closer to fifty fifty but as you move out of the western corner about I think you're going to see more continuous corn\nMore continuous going out there and you know really what this comes down to for the most part is where we use beans but yeah we are using a lot of beans in this country I thought we bumped up against crush capacity three months ago and what do we do we just keep crush or more beans yeah mi but to live right on what\nMichael was talking about the I think about those regional acreage as you can look at the basis levels in western corn belt for soybeans versus the eastern corner belt you know we're more negative than than average\nNationwide it adamantly basis levels but it's really been the most extreme in that western corn belt region because so many of those soybeans were targeted towards that Chinese or export market real quick talk about your basis to um\n[noise] yeah so I guess particularly for people in the eastern corn belt we have a new tool on our website\nOr the crop bases tool such go the Purdue dot edu slashed commercial egg a right there on the menu bars across basis to we've got data for um Indiana obviously but also Illinois a Michigan and Ohio and it's sorted by crop reporting district\nBut to use the tools you just pick your county and we determined Wisconsin reporting district you're in gotcha we've got fourteen years of data out there so you can look at the history look at the averages compares this year to the averages and use that as a way to forecast what's likely to have access to get on there and use that\n... and they get\nCBS Sports radio week nights at six Saturdays it for Sunday's at one\nMajor ... make

really nice start however as you know the weather has really slows down here lately we're getting into the gritty part so doc integrity is definitely going so I Need to be removed from the field as soon as possible as soon as we can get back in there it's going to be a greedy situation\nYou know and this is a time of year where everybody thinks okay I can relax what's out there is out there but this is the time of year where you need to visually take in what is out there to make plans for next year right\nAbsolutely absolutely when we think about making the most out of twenty Nineteen and putting our best foot forward next year\nIt's really important that we don't slow down at this time 'cause right now while it's fresh in our mind is a great time to Deaver he's twenty eight team about what went really well maybe some things we could have done better what her mother nature's relaxed and how likely that is already happening again and more information is always good for decision making in the future\nYeah and then work with people like us to cow to interpret all that data that you're getting in to make your decisions\nPatch deliberately I have a mental whereas it's a really good friend of mine that gave me a piece of advice that I'll never forget and that it don't get so caught up in being an achiever you forget to be a capitalize there as well farmers are do where they love to get out their dirty\nBut much as possible but it's important to recognize nobody can know it all or do it all especially in today's economy it's a complex it's ill structured there's definitely a lot to know the lead on your experts your seed people your equipment people you refer people they're there for a reason not to help you\nAbsolutely good stuff Kirsten thank you so much for having us down here yeah thank you that's cursed in Thomas Gary ... she is the\nDekalb as grow technical ... and what we did what a leader and for this conversation with ... brewer Brady is an assistant professor in the department of egg economic syrup producers university Brady welcomed ATV well thank you for having me you bet and joining us but you know again as courses Davis Michael\nMoore yeah yeah thanks for being here with us very well thank you appreciate it All right the reason I say is\nWhat the lead and I mean when we talk about partnering up and agriculture you got a partner with your lenders and maintain that relationship right yeah and what are you gotta do to do that I I I've always said you can never go dark on your lender\nThat's exactly right and when you know when I talked to lenders you know one of their biggest recommendations for me to tell farmers is just be honest with them and be have an open and honest relationship\nAnd you know keep that communication flowing especially in times like these you know we've heard a lot a today about the trade uncertainty and profit uncertainty leading into this next a harvest year\nAnd as we roll into lunar new season here starting in November a moving through the the beginning of planting next spring lenders just want farmers to be honest with them they know that your income statement may have a few teams there could be you know even that that that dreaded negative profit line from two thousand eight I'm\nHanging over your head but as long as you have a plan and kind of address it head on with the lender more than likely they're going to work with you\nKnow you do a lender survey right yes so it is what kind of information do you look for when you're doing the survey\nSo it is a national survey we survey ag lenders from all fifty states mhm and it's very similar to the Akbar Ahmed her and that we asked both a previous three months from what I lenders are seeing and moved and we also asked computer expectations in both the short term and the long term we asked about various topics such as a\nNon repayment rates a demand for loans or even interest rates of what bankers are seeing so you know the ... asking farmers kind of what they're seeing and then um our survey is asking I Wonder what they're seeing out there in the field\nOkay well there's a little apprehension and the egg barometer there's got to be a little apprehension and the lender barometer to\nYes and and that's something that I spoke to both a gym and Michael about uh the bankers are actually a little bit more negative than the farmers and had been for quite some time\nUm they were getting a little bit more positive leading up through um the in a last fall but this spring we started to see them turn negative again with especially with at that time of the year they were seeing the the trade uncertainty and\nUm we're still collecting the results from this past survey but we expect them to be a negative as well\nYeah you know what what is the number one thing that they mentioned I mean are we giving into a period where there's an increasing default rate something like that so\nThe winners in the survey we do ask about default rates are for the most part it has remained study there are a few bankers in the survey\nUm the report it increases in their lawn service territory or in their portfolio on but we saw lender saying you know that they have zero defaults in their entire loan portfolios and no farmers defaulting or one of the main things that they have been a really telling us about is that the decreasing working capital that the farmers in their portfolios have been okay experiencing\nYes well it tightens things up and then you've got to go Davis you got you got to go to the bank\nYou absolutely do your essay leader that operating loan again in the covered yeah\nSo you mentioned interest rates yes there on the way off\nIts search sure seems to me like what you hear the rhetoric coming from Powell at the fed and it's not rhetoric he's trying to telegraph\nWhat's going on and what do you do a graph in his interest rates are going to continue to go to the upsides\nYeah and that's what lenders have been reporting and and indeed I was at a conference two weeks ago at the fed and you know what they kind of set is if you look at past history the fed is in these times are going to continue increasing on and you know\nThere's already talked about well if they're start to be a downturn in the economy or something like that when does the fed plateau that history tells us that they even tend to keep increasing the rate 'em by you know a fifth year so based on point\nAfter the attorney sure army starts to plateau just because they want a little bit of cushion ... in a downturn\nYeah you know one of the things that we've always talked about on cyber talking ATP is that\nThe the whole push of money into the system we've got such a huge money supply out there we know at some point that it's going to turn into it inflation and that they're gonna have to pull back the raves end up\nDoing it right I don't know if they've ever done it right before I don't know why we didn't expect everybody knew it right this time well\nAnd the good thing there though is that um you know data tells us that you know most farmers you know farmland loans are about eighty percent fixed rate so it's not affecting those loans but what it is affecting his are short term operating capital and that's really when he talked about decreasing working capital\nA man you know that's one that we also survey or bankers about demand for loans and they've been you know the past several years they've just been indicating increasing demand which you know what so what that means that when farmers come to the bank looking property capital every year they've been asking for more gotcha um those are the ones that increasing interest rate's gonna ... has there\nBeen any changes in the way that farmers are deploying that capital once they get a hold of it or the loans ... the the loan money is\nIn the way that farmers are deploying that capital once they get a hold of it or the loan ... the the loan money is there any change in the way that they're using it\nOr not that we've seen we have seen a slight increase in spending on machinery or come in again going back to that decrease in working capital we don't know if this is just a farmer's not having the money in the bank all ready to go by the ... the the ... the new machinery\nInstead of having to go out to the bank for it or if there is actually increasing demand um\nYeah for for the machinery out there All right you're fairly new here ... I think ... I think I Am in total been here three months three\nMonths is yeah so what do you think of a place love it so far yeah and and uh the the people that you get to work with here is some of 'em are pretty hard to take you on the lips are closed their [laughter] so what do you hope to accomplish here at Purdue\nSo my main objective or my main research areas an extension areas are dealing with with the ... so you know continuing the survey working with egg lenders and doing workshops with them but also educating farmers you know the first question they asked me about what bankers are wanting to see a lot of farmers uh don't know that\nAre in terms of when you go to a bank what are they analyzing you know we all know the five sees a credit but how does each bank deployment what is their credit score a model and it and how can not game plan for but be prepared for the questions do you make it so that the bankers going to be happy when you go for that new loan\nYeah yeah is there anything changing in that application process is are they what kind of information or those lenders looking for\nWell I mean they're looking at anywhere from their own perception of your managerial ability to their outlook on\nWhatever commodity you're growing you know the the profit outlook for the upcoming year you know I think we're starting to see a little bit more emphasis put on the short term position of the farmers so you know the ... their liquidity position rather that the long term solvency\nA you know as as we go to a more\nYou know the big change in there is a lot of things are going to these automated credit score a model throw those metrics that you're you're getting from your income and balance sheets are starting to play a bigger and bigger role because it's it's being automated\nNow with that said it's not completely automated the the ... credit score credit analyst for each bank still has some say over it but\nThey're reading heavily on friday we got to go but I Want to have you on again sometime that was great thanks thanks for having me All right that we're we're going to be right back with Wylie coyote or here from ... university [noise]\n\nMight be some real\nThe final century my mortgage will make it look people bringing one living below\nWe don't need that I don't need all the extra complication you know maybe I don't understand it all that well so what's what's the use what would you say to that person\nOr a ... any kind of disruptive technology you never know what the benefits are on the other side until you see them get I'm we know that we underestimated the benefits in this study\nBecause we cannot imagine all the things that our lives are going to be changed\nWhen we all have broadband high speed broadband hum and they've been in the farm area there's for farmers rely on their own information desk speed of information a and being able to get back and forth with that information but uh it's all going to be important and if you're on the other side and don't have it you're gonna miss out\nYup yup okay let's come back to the terrorists because you've got your ... research that you're going to with its impact on prices Wiley of we've talked about it on the show before but where do you think we stand now uh\nWhat what's the update or are we going to see some relief anytime soon\nChip I Wish I knew that there they say they're going to talk and in November\nAnd if they do I think the best we can hope out of that is if they agree to continue talking cash because it's not going to be easy to resolve it's a you know China's got there\nA big plans for twenty twenty five and it depends on some protectionism us doesn't want that protectionism we won't open markets um and so it's going to be hard got both sides are dug in I kept saying earlier on and from April on if this continues\nHum and so it's going to be hard got both sides are dug in I kept saying earlier on and from April on if this continues if we continue to escalate a deeper we get the harder it's going to be to get out right and that's where we are we've gotten deeper and deeper\nOkay so harder to get out why I mean are you talking about long term changes among our competitors is that what makes it tougher to get out of the whole\nWell what makes it tougher to get is both sides are state to the ground a and and there's a big divide between them and so we got to find a way to bridge that divide\nYeah yeah we need to definitely do that because of potential long term impacts of this are pretty devastating\nOh they are all we could lose as much as nine million acres of soybeans to Brazil um it just stays on for two or three years and if that happens\nWe're not going to get it back right and that's the real danger is not what happened this year right it's what could happen next year in the year after that and and that's why it's so important to make progress resolving this\nOkay a soybeans still feeling the most impact dirty okay\nNo I mean we export half of our soybeans\nAnd sixty two percent of those exports go to China you know and that door is not completely shocked but\nLargely yeah but it is largely shuts uh yeah that I don't want to say that you're being pessimistic army you're being realistic when we talk about the potential long term implications hair but short term they talk we see some progress there could be really proud of their ... if\nUm we don't know\nBut what happens if we do get a relief rally you're probably better get taken advantage of some some of it yeah\nYeah yeah and that ah that means a couple of things and and we're we're dealing with a we talked with Jim this morning about it just briefly about how much basis pressure we're saying we're seeing the impact on the futures market but the cash marketed showing even more the impact of it in that week basis\nSo it's it's something that when we\nDo get an opportunity to to recapture here boy we want to step up and and and uh take advantage of it a impact on hogs [noise]\nUh it's not as big as as soybeans um you know our our exports to China or there but they're not huge like soybeans right the two biggest crops that are impacted or soybeans sorghum\nOkay right on right we got ... got that eighty some sent a M. S. P. payment\nCalm yeah well we export half our sorghum in Seventy percent of that goes to China I mean it's a small crop nationally not not like soybeans but still it's going to do\nWe got about a minute left here Wally let's talk some good news we got us MCA uh the agreement between the U.S Mexico and Canada that's a step in the right direction\nDefinitely to step in the right direction a dairy got some relief uh we're in the process of doing an estimate of what the what are the impacts of that and we'll have that in a few weeks but uh yeah it's a positive we know it's positive that might not be huge certainly\nCompared to the previous now because of the changes from previous NAFTA or an ag aren't that big price it's mainly autos and in other areas\nYeah on on this analysis you're gonna have to think okay with it but we didn't get the right not what might of the damage your band that's right that's right we'd go back to most favored nation tariffs and it would be a mess so lonely absolutely Vali thank you so much for making time sure really appreciate it and thanks for letting to step on your campus are glad that you're comeback anytime\nI Believe well we'll All right that is slowly tighter\nOr from the egg economics department here at Purdue University Davis\nTo wrap things up you have what we got coming up right no I have no idea you have no idea how to do is Bob Bob with us here in Canada and of course talking with that or would you want to miss writing dot com check her out from the campus of produce University in the journal college gross show [noise]\n\nFox News Sunday Sunday mornings in ten and news talk WG a G\n... football on one of the chicks die daily Cal Cal looking for all open at\nYard touchdown run this is nice coast Jeff Miller on the road at sock on friday night at seven o'clock if you can't make it to the game listen to all the action on one of six or online at one of the dot com starting with the pregame show at six thirty raunchy by members of the sportscasters clump\nThis Sunday the chiefs returned to arrowhead to take on the bangles this is a new game time\nWe kick off at seven twenty Cheech and bagels email here on the chief's radio network catch\nAll of the hard hitting action on your home but the northeast surprised that that will be the one oh five point nine at them\nAs an agricultural producer you know information is vital to the growth of your business for over forty years farmers and ranchers across the Midwest have depended on America's news source and brown field radio network to keep them in for\nListening as your daily news talk W.

by events like this or in some cases it might be someone who's fallen on hard times due to medical issues what have you and so our board got together and very quickly took an immense action to make this contribution\nMhm I mean the you think about it I mean each broadcast or they have their house and they were where they work they have their pets they have their family their their cars\nAnd so I mean it really does I mean they're they're normal people but yet I mean the other on TV radio whatever it may be but yet they really could use that money to help keep their job and keep them going right\nAbsolutely I mean if you think about how lives get turned upside down and events like this everything changes quickly and so the ability to have access to funding\nAnd by the way the BFA as recently doubled the amount of their emergency grants they used to provide a thousand dollars they've doubled that two thousand dollars because of these two hurricanes\nSo you're absolutely right these people are out there trying to cover the story steer people to safety because journalism is in their blood they really can't step away but when they try to take a break right what happened to their apartment what happened to their car what's happened to their family their pets et cetera\nSo we just felt it was very important that we make a contribution to show our support for our colleagues in this manner\nAnd things like right now I mean people there I'm sure there are turning to radio and television um as much as they can to get the latest updates about uh where can I go to eat the meal and stuff like that you know what I mean\nYou're absolutely right in fact I just read something this morning where are the chairman of the FCC is lighting a brighter flame under the wireless companies because he doesn't feel they've responded quickly enough to rebuild their networks and you know we all rely on cellular community\nThe wireless companies because he doesn't feel they've responded quickly enough to rebuild their networks\nAnd you know we all rely on cellular communication and all the data we can get to our our smartphones but typically in storms of this magnitude\nYou know those networks are quick to go down and I I'm not voting to show your companies it's their technology okay [laughter] um but at the same time it's the broadcast stations radio and TV they usually stay on the air and those that get knocked off year usually get back on the air pretty quickly so\nWhile the storm may have moved past you're absolutely right broadcasters are still on the front line\nAnd it didn't really open anything humor that Hurricane Florence came through and then Michael Caine ... to a long after that and I almost went on the head of the same path a little bit and just added to the devastation and some of those areas\nYes say you're absolutely right Cody I mean you feel bad for everyone that's impacted by this but especially those poor people who maybe we're just starting to feel like they saw path forward after Florence\nAnd then here comes Michael which as we know was not forecast it to do what it did until basically about twenty four hours before it happened\nUm so it's a very devastating time and uh I Do want to make mention that since our the announcement of our donation several other state broadcast associations are stepping up\nUh with gifts of three thousand five thousand and one is even ten ten thousand dollars so we like to feel like maybe Nebraska got the ball rolling here and and that's just what Nebraska does right where the first ones to step in and help people in need\nExactly I mean you you know like you said get the ball rolling in you help out your fellow broadcasters I mean your your fellow I I mean they're not community members but I mean you feel like you're a part with them because you do the same thing I'm maybe it is a different state but you do the same thing\nAnd you want to help him out as much as possible because like we were talking about they could be a like Michael Michael came in pretty abruptly ends do there on the station ... trying to get stuff out\nAnd and then they they don't have time to get their house ready to go or their family out of there right\nExactly and you know you think of the long hours that a broadcasters work in times like these whether they're the ones on the air or the ones behind the scenes keeping the station on the air is you know in times like this ah it it's in our blood to just stay on the air and work and so at some point\nYou know maybe the boss comes in and says Cody enough already been here for two days go home you know get some rest get something to eat a but in this case you may not have a home to go to if you've been impacted by Florence or Michael so that's what we're trying to do here is give us some relief to help these people get back on their feet\nExactly like I said we've been talking with a gym to me in the in the Bronx the broadcasters association president and executive director talking about how they donated find those indoors to broadcasters foundation of America to a broadcasters\nThe great thing about your phone or

to one to four CBS Josh Rosen Glen and Louisiana thanks for listening and buddy appreciate your your on CBS Sports radio\nI Love the show I just wanted to make a quick point sure thank you uh it seems like Josh Rosen's always been\nBeen hailed as great but it's for me it seems like if you're not a starring college how can you get started across and he was all name at UCLA it was actually ranked forty fifth you'd be our last year they can make it was first\nAnd that he's hailed as something great I'd like to see it before ... the next Joe Montana\nNo you're right it he's got approval Glen you and thank you for the kind words there's no doubt and I'm sure part of the allure\nI'm not a UCLA fan but I have a really good friend who is that on the show Greg Bergman who does a Dodgers post game show now and former producer mine and I think it may have come onto and done done a pirate voice right to do like golf pirate on the show he did go up high rate on the show yes and Greg to big UCLA fan and I used to\nHe when he produced me in this will shock you guys Ryan store you'll be shocked to I used to tease my producer on the air I used to make fun of you silly little bit and he would lose his mind\nBut it was a buddies who would take me to Bruins games I went to several with them and even in games they lost UCLA\nOr heroes and threw them picks there were moments where in a football sends it was like the clouds parted\nThe sun came out shown down upon him and there's a halo football's over his head like there's just\nThe guy has Rosen has so much talent show much talent but you're right you have to\nAs our friend in Louisiana just pointed out you have to be able to take that talent and turn it into productivity on the field and success and sometimes I think getting too much success early getting praise too much really it can break somebody it's a really fine line\nI this conversation with with some friends the other night about the idea of success and who deserves it and who doesn't deserve it and how you get there and how you don't\nAnd the reality is I and I've been very lucky I think you need the combination of talent opportunity but you also mean failure and I felt a lot of that the ability to learn from the mistakes that you make\nIt into the gentleman just called point Baker Mayfield had those mean Josh Allen's had those it's not like Josh Allen was heavily recruited indebted turned down do I go to Alabama or how state or Notre Dame no\nHe was a no offense Wyoming a secondary school not even that as it relates to if you have your choice and you want to be a quarterback in the national football league we're going to go to college\nJosh Rosen and Sam darn and had very different routes USC UCLA especially for Roseanne when when the war was there and just what they were trying to do with her into LA of their that's landing spot you choose that's a place you want to go if you're trying to become a quarterback and the national football league\nAnd I don't know that there's been a struggle for Josh Rosen however doesn't mean he's going to fail it just means he may have to experience that the NFL level and figure out how to do with their ... and I've said this on the air before but one of the ways that when I was a young reporter\nA columnist name Clarence Page I'm gay some advice to me and some some folks and I worked at the Chicago Tribune\nHe became a columnist with the first time they put them on like page twenty three right back when he favors were were thriving\nNobody read him nobody saw him if he wrote a column that was not very smart and not very well thought out or not we'll source or naive\nIt didn't matter right he wasn't the featured guy or gal and he worked his way out by the time he got to the pages where people actually pay attention the presidents and\nNational security advisors and politicians and mayors red he'd already had all this experience where he could fail where people didn't pays attention as much I loved living in our Little Rock Arkansas Des Moines Iowa in Kansas City Missouri I think they're incredible places where I'm from the mid west\nAnd I love you down south to the Little Rock but I made some big mistakes as a writer there and it didn't have the kind of ... consequences on my self confidence that would've worked as a ride with the New York times the Washington Post or not to sound too nerdy which I Am which is fine\nWhen I came out of the Missouri school of journalism the most talented guy that came out went to the New York times and he was Fifteen Years ahead of all those and everybody was jealous and he made a huge mistake the kind of mistake we all made\nWhen we were in Little Rock in Des Moines and Kansas City only heated up in New York Times and it broke him and he walked away from the business for three years\nSo the question for Rosen becomes Kenny not just handle failure can handle it at the highest level he's not going to be tested at Wyoming he's not gonna have to walk on at Oklahoma it's going to be a very different thing he's got the talent and I can't speak to the rest of it\nBut so the notion that he has been critical done anything the times now and he's got the talent we've seen lots of guys who had been a places\nThere's not a lot of success of the team who have gone on to greatness and on the NBA side I mean Ben Simmons is a perfect example and I see that team did not make the tournament it's not hard a lot of teams make the tournament and there was a\nLot of turmoil and a lot of thoughts of Simmons was a problem of them was a diva and didn't get along with people a lot of talk to even she a draft number one overall a guy who can't even make the tournament the college level\nBen Simmons is in the Magic Johnson category age wise of how many triple doubles he's racking up night after night after night and they can with Thirteen eleven eleven or whatever was in the first\nGame of the year and three quarters\nSo sometimes quote unquote success\nDoes not indicate to you what's going to happen the next level talent is often the\nThing that can indicate what's gonna happen at the next level and that Phoenix tea that Arizona team pardon me that cardinals team\nWhatever Rosen didn't he was he was awful I thought he was a dumpster fire he was an embarrassing to football it happens all of us in our careers that is not a very good football it's not like he was with the Chicago Bears and\nThat's ridiculous and they're going to have taken a Ninety six when ... diversity in that place like a hundred and three one team since they started to sixteen twenty six so if they get somebody that was something like a less than three we have to start putting an end the conversation with the best teams of all time\nMeant Snyder here on the show man how much credit in general do you get managers for this kind of success and how much credit you give out scorer specifically\nIn the regular season\n... some but not a ton like I kind of feel like in the regular season you got to stay out of the way\nIt's why ah my buddy grant Frisbee from SB Nation a few years ago wrote that the manager that you're the one vote that should happen after the postseason because that's when the managers earn their money I mean you look at look at the end they'll see us and the way that Crick councils had to finagle his pitching staff in the way they Roberts is matched those lose\n'em ... again I mentioned Korea using his stars of relief and games when there are only a few days away from starting stuff like that just a piece it together yet David Price up the day before he was going to start in game for any still price and price really I mean\nThe quarter is doing an excellent job and in the regular season again it's it's kind of just don't get in the way in the playoffs you need to get in the way sometimes and of course it's not a master plea\nMess on it I'm I'm I'm fascinated it's a great perspective it's a great tank on managers really earn their paychecks and show they're worse than the post season and so by that standard\nAnd you're a cubs fan I'm a ... and I hate to even go near by that standard is it possible Joe mad and despite having won that World Series he was not to be effective in gaming that run for our cubs is grossly overweight it\nHe did not do a good job in that World Series um so yeah he probably is a bit over it on that front but I don't think a lot of people think he's like this master tactician or strategic guy he's more like a clubhouse guy that the players want to play for him and he he keeps them loose and he knows how to\nGet to keep them in the right mindset throughout the year I think that he has great value there and that is an underrated value because he saw what happened with the nationals got rid of dusty Baker all of a sudden everything went went really poorly to start the year for a while and I think that is losing Justin from the courthouse and losing Jason ... called us was a big deal [noise]\nUm ... back to that I'd give them another year he has one more year and his contract given another year or did they want a Ninety five games and they had a lot of adversity based on injuries get the piece a lot together with the rotation and with the bullpen injuries\nSold Ninety five Ninety five ones um I think they did exactly what they should have done so far this off season which was keep mad but don't extend them and fire chilly day was\nTalking to match signer here on the show writer than you and me bill Ryder on CBS Sports radio\nMatt Craig council and the brewers organization you reference to a little bit their approach to out getters as opposed perhaps the starting pitcher just how they're building their pitching staff is this a one off from ... very smart people are we looking in any way at the future of how baseball teams will go about building rosters\nI I I don't think that that definitely went this direction on purpose I mean it's\n... it's settled out chasing Anderson fizzled out Jimmy Nelson ever came back to the season after suffering a shoulder injury last year they signed Jewish shots in now see in the same way by the way they wanted to have starting pitchers they even print for you can tell us in late August but when the dust settled and they've got to the post season they looked at everything\nThey said we have two stars we can count on that so we're gonna have to figure it out and every other game they have a Super Bowl Penn\nBut my guess is that they wouldn't want more than anything right now to have for reliable starters so they can save bullets in that Superbowl pen because\nI I mean we've seen shaking his at times from can able Jefferson has been terrible throughout the postseason they're just tired so I I I don't know if it's any kind of revolutionary thing as much as they've been forced into this so they had to get creative um I I think it's more that than the other thing\nThat's neither here on the show so and\nI got to solve place in my heart from the Dodgers just because I Lived in LA and I work in the doubters radio network you know this isn't this business if you spend the time being around certain athletes and the good guys you're informed right like and I like a lot of those Dodgers I like Andrew Freeman I liked that organization\nAnd I know freebies and hasn't been there for the whole time but the Dodgers have now won the last six years in a row they are last year again way from the world series there's currently a game away from another world series appearance\nHow do you assess successor the Dodgers starting tonight and going forward is at World Series championship or bust or do we need to have a more nuanced perspective\nNo we don't not not at this point I mean ... if it's only like two or three times okay but six chances ... and most of it and the prime I said most of it because I don't think you can say quick course I was in his prime anymore but most of them\nHey but six chances in most of it and the prime as I said most of it because I don't think you can say quick course I was in his prime anymore but most of it and the prime of the best pitcher of his generation who's an automatic hall of famer\nAnd [laughter] I don't want to say wasted because he went to the postseason six times it's not like the ... the ... his entire prime\nIt's not like the angels are wasting crowds prime but to not have at least wandering through these six\nClinton cursor has not that cause at the end of the year you just feel like it's a failure\nNow nobody ... going to leave the air until seven o'clock tomorrow morning within twenty five miles north of Nebraska programming continues on translator came to nine zero Eighteen and one of five point nine FM\nAbout what they've done it in the six years\nNow how confident Madison or do you feel if you're a Dodger fan about ... going up against my late tonight\nMary or the ... he he he's been\nUnbelievable I'm at the Dodgers getting to see my second time I think that's going to help my he's been outstanding this year and before that\nLike the previous two years he was probably the worst regular starting pitcher in major league baseball he discovered a cutter and he's become great with it I just don't know if you hold up the second time I I trust you more\nAnd I don't know how much that stunt with Miley is going to matter maybe it won't matter at all I mean price got up and got hot the day before he started prices excellent\nI'm just going to have a gut feeling that the Dodgers got close it down right now\nWhen you look at it and there's a lot of ways they had this let's just start with the play first base between Aguilar and and Machado from so many different answers on the show mine and a bunch of people who play new like you cover the sport the highest levels Manny Machado hustle finally machine and the ... in the baggage his or many Machado dirty baseball player\nAbsolutely that was dirty I I don't want to go over in ... he he's a thirty player\nBut that was absolutely dirty play I mean he looked down he had Ninety five percent of the back to work with ... uh that is absolutely a dirty play I don't think there's any way he was going to hurt ... we are after that but that that is complete Bush league nonsense there's no place for that crap um I I was very very disappointed\nSo you've got that moment from a shot a you've got his candor with I think it was Kenny Rosenthal I think it was Kennedy was to argue about\nNot only how so that's good no yo yo no thank you you've got the money sign you've also got\nSome pretty impressive baseball who the hell the baseball player how has your opinion of ... changed or not over the course of this postseason\nWell I just first off I I wrote after game for that he should just embrace that he villain and have fun with it I think he's talked more trashy celebrate more just the village of our dirty plays I Would ask but I I started assessing in\nBefore the series started I I I never had any thoughts about it but I thought that 'cause like there's a lot of things here that we've seen from Machado in the past with the times that he said that that ... that third and\nClaimed that slipped out of his hands but he threw it right Adam ... hit the spiking doesn't put droid incident it and then you know than the red Sox it him uh you know in game to those two slides and the second base they probably should have been ruled illegal where he's reached out of his fell short stop it's just\nCircumstantial evidence circumstantial evidence circumstantial evidence but at some point we've got a lot of pieces of the puzzle don't we\nYeah no I wasn't sure he is he's the villain and I'm curious your perspective Matt sorry to hear on the show how much do you think his\nAntics and shenanigans will or will not impact the market for his services come free agency\nReally low I mean can you play and he absolutely can play he's an absolute stood offensively I he's fine defensively shortstop he's incredible defensively at third base\nHe's I mean he's young for hitting free agency he's not gonna get price Harper buddy I don't think but I think it's probably going to be close\nUm it's you know ... if you're somebody like the Phillies with a whole shortstop in a ton of money to burn you care more about winning games or you care that three or four times you've done something kind of ... I think I care more about winning games\nStarted med center here on the show aren't so we're on and Wisconsin and I got\nI mean I Am I going to solve by my heart for the Dodgers also I mean they ... I Know the best of the cubs but I was wrong in the brewers\nAll year long and when I'm wrong I Want to be wrong the hallway so want me through what a breweries when the series looks like how does that play out if they're celebrating the streets in Milwaukee this weekend\n[noise] um you know tonight probably similar formula the game too it just don't choke it away at the end I mean they had the brewers on the ropes there and Jeffers just caught it up\nTo to Justin's her or you have to turn a credit but Jeffrey the terrible this game so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Norfolk", "day": "19"}
