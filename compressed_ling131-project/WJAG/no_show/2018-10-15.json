of yards put up\nAnd the like but they were bad defense of being there not a really good book beam across the board at war ended up being a wild game that came down to the end box driving\nA James

way to lose these games especially when they're in Cincinnati\nSo they go covers zero on a slant play like that those safety position\nTo make a play and the second level on around so combination of playmate there than in Brown's getting done but that also ankle stupidity late games there always seems to be something when the Steelers go to Cincinnati the bagels find a way to cough it up\nBut today I ... and you're right the Bengals have done this before I can crush the bangles today I'm going to give credit to stay on the ... because they answered right before half the ... at the end of the game to glean not a good deed Pittsburgh from going down the field\nBut even on the touch down play to me that was bleeding pick\nAnd I feel is kinda got away with one narrative Antonio's often raises and he takes it in and they weren't going to win that one's not on Cincinnati to me that's a good bit tougher when none of being in Cincinnati last\nWell\nYou know I I I definitely hear that I watch the patriots wrote that pay play a billion times network that's called but I I think if you are to evaluate that fly under the letter of the ... you could absolutely that that'll do there it it it it more or less to be a\n... is it awareness of around making sure that I owe me five hook or by crook\nSomebody else eats you not him because it's happened so many times fast and also there was a terrible the feds upholding call\nA ... several the federal building play it wasn't a less malpractice but a play that you know what to put the Steelers in Newark die fourth down and they got helped out because a bangles defensive player just that ... thing\nTo do and that that was a good call that was a defensive rolled yeah\nTo get that one right I uh I Know John fields done much needed when rain or ravens playing as well as they are Cincinnati I had the lead in the division got beat today\nOr did you feel a sense of urgency before today's game the Steelers knew this was kind of a must to get\nYeah well I felt that way because no one in one in the division and last year they went six you know and the apes the north and how many games can you afford to lose in the division you still\nAre going to know all and then we capture a all playoff game I\nUnderstand you're chasing and have you learned your two three and one and then there you know five and one in on easy street so I think that's where\nThe arc light Jody even as I said that out on\nA cab to go back to the narrative in this I Will re I guess\nThere with a lot of confidence here\nBecause there's there's this ultimate belief that when these two teams get together the Steelers are going to win the game and I think\nWatching them last week against the Atlanta put together a forty one point game and watching the defense actually uh make some place for once I'm gay most uh Pittsburgh really good feeling about this game and it was definitely a pairing the Steelers lock on this week\nNine let's talk about the small little open room by being built\nUm a couple of weeks ago you can tell me exactly when it was the report broke that he was planning on returning\nA ... just prior to the show is by week that way you could say I'm coming in and\nUh you know to give them a whole bunch of days off this started collecting his first check and then go from there um it's been a while and nothing else has been reported certainly levy on has been confirmed by any stretch of the imagination have you heard anything on or off the record as to whether that is going to transpire and a couple of weeks\n[noise] ah I I Believe that bell here are oh a ... that's my\nFeeling on it uh that's my educated guess on the situation\nI'm really\nNot sure how\nHe's going to be received by his teammates you know Ben Roethlisberger after the game ... fired shots and\nMade a snide comment about how he was so proud of Connor and he was impressed by Potter it because it was his last game\nBecause of Bell's pending return and it was just the kind of snarky thing that made me think again\nThat Ben office or probably carries is much weight is anybody in the organization a guy that helps get you off at the coordinator fired year last year\nI think that ...\nUm or they you know to an ... hair and hand washing probably part of town and he bought I thinking what on earth heaven and hear from day one\nAnd now Palestine and try to jump on\nA Mitt rain here and all the Harry and I think and\nI kind of on that and\nFeel almost like a ton hair um I think health and wind\nAbsolute feels that way we are some of their comments or season started on bell your\nBill comes back to my ... I think huh I think Tomlin a top\nTen point that I call right now\nI think your students palace cleared medically to play once you pass the nickel I feel like top whale rider him is number one back but I don't think you should I pay Connor with three one hundred yards games and sat than touched down in the first six games in the season\nI think he deserves to get the lion's share on the workload but the coaches history tells me that when ... Dallas active he gets all the work\nYou know I don't know who's going to be the lion's share but I agree with you that country shouldn't just be ranked which to the bank should never be seen or heard from again he has earned being part of the up and going forward or when I'm with you in also that a leader in battle is going to be an important part when he shows backup I think Tom when is already proven that\nI did was their announcement after the game didn't Tomlin or lose players know did they let anybody else know exactly what the schedule but there's some coming week is and how bad could or Rome may affect lately on and when he is going to show up\nOn top during the filing so I Would\nGuess that they would come in and practice you know a lot of money on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday per se the only problem we practice Tuesday Wednesday Thursday\nFriday Saturday Sunday off as my yes I'm so just to white practices\nA ballot take this call on Monday and and be part of ... a day and then he would get a vacation and the pay over eight hundred thousand dollars to basically now when he and he went on the first six weeks in six weeks and the her that's nothing [noise] ah so I think that's part of it\nUm I have not communicating with them\n... six weeks and the her that's nothing uh so I think that's part of it um I I he is not communicating with them I don't know and his opponent mean everything is kind of gone through the media here in the agent is put out a mixed messages on this one um\nSo I don't even think they know a hundred percent certainty that that was going to be here tomorrow but that's just my hunch and um\nAnd I think they could be two week roster exemption if they wanted to play hardball with Jodie they actually put him on a restricted list this week and they wouldn't get out of paying him\nSo they really wanted to get down in the sky and why not I mean he's tied him was dishonest with that and and and again and\nUh they did they wander one impression and then things changed a a former first game of the season I Would not be totally surprised if they used a roster exception just to get out of paying him during the by weaken then ratcheted things up and\nIt gave him a full of for a full practice work for the browns game and two weeks\n... is there any ongoing conversation about a potential trade I Know they chop them I Know they talked to a bunch of teams nothing got done which means nobody was willing to pay the price they were asking for is there anything that could get done along the train line as soon as he shows up\nI don't think so I think that's going to take another in three\nFor that to happen between now and October thirtieth I don't think the eagles so let's go anywhere to fold started for that and why with a B or one in five now um\nYou know do the jets want to get a head start on phones with ... that you know if you've reported Fox News and destination for him to therapy soon but might be the most willing to back up the brakes truck for him but do they want to give up a second round so when they offer\nSomething that isn't the compensation puts the Steelers would get\nUp about leaving them for you can say I don't know unlikely that this isn't a logical trade partner right now I just feel as if\nThey got off of the pope I think they trade them in a second job to be honest with you I think they would just wash their hands clean things and say I sit there and ... you're trapped\nAnd be happy with it and turn things over to Conner who won over the waffle room and the coaching staff to some extent I think it's fine with that but I I don't I don't think there's a long line of a place for it and it's for balance back\nOff the top of my head I can't come up with one that makes a whole has to have a lot of sense wiped down doesn't sound like eagles want to be the the parts with them wanted to second round pissed if they have and on top of it has to pay a premium for the rest of the\nThey catch we release resort really eight eight eight three away fifty nine fifty five ... thrill eight fifty nine fifty five or resorting release dot com call now\nDoes your water stained and damage your fixtures does it smell or taste bad are you worried about what's in your water water quality should not be painful and worrisome get hydro care water systems from wave homes illusions with the most advanced purification technologies\nCoal wave homes illusion today at one eight eight eight nine seven three wave or go to best water now dot com\nHydro care will eliminate length scale because as hundreds of dollars in damage to pipes and appliances without using sold\nWell water will no longer smell or staying your fixtures city water will be purified of harmful chlorine led arsenic and chemicals\nWave homes illusions provides the cleanest healthiest water at every faucet satisfaction guaranteed for more information coal one eight eight eight nine seven three wave one eight eight eight nine seven three W.

you're the red Sox are at the chiefs and the patriots play tonight tomorrow you got the Packers and the forty niners\nAnd before the show a ... when the show started way back in our first hour I throughout my designations for teams in the NFL as of right now\nAh I broken down into three categories\nHave is have nots and holds there's a big group and they're not all even all whole denied created equal but I couldn't come up with moving any of these twenty teams into either the have\nOr the have nots action to me I have\nI Would have to say I would be shocked if the team did not make the postseason that flat out shocked\nThat they didn't want to get a chance to play for Super Bowl for me there's only five in the NFL right now\nThe chiefs the same the rams the chargers\nAnd the patriots and I said even if the patriots lost his game unless they got crushed I didn't think that I could ride them out of the ah ab section even though they lose they while the three and three they're still the patriots they're still the best team any AFC East\nUh eh oh by the way they're up twenty four to nine more homes just to second interception into the end zone trying to force it in getting close before ap a path gets tipped\nUp and picked off a soda patriot turned very good shape I said that's the only way I take the patriots out of the ab\n... and you get beat All right and the patriots beat him pretty good ear uh I'm not taking them out 'cause it's gonna be the first was on the seat\nSo five have is an old league I Am seven the have nots means I Would be shocked\nIf these teams made the playoffs that have the the teams that I Would be shocked if they didn't make the play offs but not for the teams I Would be shocked if they did make the playoffs at this stage of the season the bills the Colts\nThe raiders the giants the bucks the niners and the cardinals sorry but you can make plans for January you're not going to be needed for postseason dancing just not happening\nThen you add this only large group of twenty which I'm going to say our whole\nNot ready to say you can't make the play offs but I'm not going to tell you just yet that oh you're close to our lock\nTo make the playoffs and there are varying degrees of a levels of these teams and what they've done so far and what your project them to do the rest of the year uh but it's a large group dolphins jets bangles ravens Steelers\nTennessee Jacksonville used in red skins eagles cowboys bears Vikings Packers lions about guns Panthers Seahawks browns and Broncos now we've got the Monday Night or tomorrow which is Green Bay and San Francisco\nThat much like tonight's game is not going to change any of my rankings the package there are whole no matter what they're supposed to win tomorrow night I think they're going to win tomorrow night but if they win fifty six but nothing would I say All right then that makes them I have no not even cause that's going to be a\nTough decision or Chicago or go off to a good start Minnesota is very good uh defending division champion a Green Bay is a gotten off to a decent stopped but not a great start as opposed to win handily to tomorrow without Jimmy G and that's a nine or line up so I'm not going to move the Packers one way or the other\nEnd of the niners find a way to winning Green Bay\nYeah sorry Nadia fans I'm Still not putting in you know holds your have not they're not making the playoffs it's not happening they're not going to be above five hundred a seven to nine isn't going to make the playoffs and yet if these wild card that ... you know they're not catching the rams\nAre who've already got six wins and I'm telling you the absolute complete upside for the forty niners is seven and nine at this point even winning tomorrow against Green Bay so ah neither one of them going to move\nNext week be a different story because they're a couple of teams have good absolutely jump into the ...\nThe bangles\nRavens\nSteelers\nWho else eagles\nCan't do what the cowboy even with the wind next week\nThe Vikings were sure\nWhen tomorrow and then when again next week I might\nThe Vikings for shore\nWhen tomorrow and then when again next week I might be willing to move him into the ad\nThere's a couple of teams that um yeah and one more laws and they could we look alike and not\nThe Broncos\nAnd\nWho else would I put the lions lions are born in line have not as of right now they lose next week I could put them in the mix I so there are some teams that can move up and down I was going to give you the chance to throw the challenge flag if you want if you disagreed\nWith a name I rankings you could do it via the telephone line eight five five to one to four to seven\nOr if you didn't like my ranking of your team twenty olds seven have not only five apps and yes\nI'm not going to take an city out even if they get bitten I buy the patriots I wanted to take the patriots patriots out unless they got crushed by Casey if they get caught by Casey\nWe're going to need to be scored thirty five to nothing in the second half but that to happen so it's highly unlikely the

I'm sure ... said some niceties because he's in the press conference every single day and you have to say that type of thing about a quarter back even though Duggan runs the guy that doesn't mince words but they've never ever truly with the exception of well we can't really get anybody else so let's pay this guy\nI mean good God they play buffalo last year in the postseason people were talking about trading direct Taylor to Jacksonville wa that all what's going on up like photos ended up playing well\nHe did play well in the post season last year but if you're Tom Coughlin ducking around right now who would make you feel a little bit more complex incompetent and a little bit more comfortable\nThe Eli the other night and I know he had to come from behind but you're throwing three ... two eighty one through the ball forty three times you Barkley who was great out of the backfield was great running the football forum is wasting his carries with that football team\nBecause they're not making any sort of a run is a terrible offensive line he if he had any bit of blocking if you had any bit of what Jacksonville offensive line is there's a difference a blow up the blow your probably still getting blown out like you got blown up today there's a time where guys wake up on the wrong side of the bad a lot of teams are going to take one on the chin\nAnd Jacksonville is not that bad of a team but they took one on the chin on the road but you're going to have people concerned you're three and three and you're playing in the AFC South Houston started off they were garbage\nThe coal started off injury Las just happened to be playing the game they're not really trying to win\nTennessee is taking on water every single time you see him you have really no idea what Tennessee is this is your decision to take\nAnd if it's weak fix like we're saying it's supposed to be weak sixth and well it's time if you take what's yours you you're in a three way tie for first and that division really gets tendency to everybody likes my ... year and a three way tie your allowing that to happen\nA team that's an AFC Championship level team\nYou're allowing that to happen and you know in Tom Coughlin knows this better than anybody else out there you have a defense that is only going to be a year to year\nIf you're completely reliant on your defense\nInjuries can take away from it\nTime takes away from it contracts take away from it your salary cap will take away from go ask Seattle ... time will it just naturally doesn't work out for a short period of time or for a long period of time if you leave it to your defense\nSo you need a quarterback in Jacksonville the windows as open as it's going to get and you're taking it on every single time you got two weeks left until the trade that like this is the most realistic scenario that you can make or you could not make a trade depending on what the offer would be\nIs everything right in the NFL only ask you this am I wrong that I'm watching I'm watching New England in Kansas City and Patrick ... homes is about as fun as it gets but I'm pulling for New England because I Want there to be some sort of order in the world I'm starting to become my father [noise]\nHere in the ballpark you're creeping up on him in a bad uh oh what kind of thought are you wearing and for me to show us with\nThe uh the suspenders and stuff I mean it it it it may be creeping up on ... ... the chiefs are doing especially really literally now as we're speaking now they're in this game after nearly ... dominating um for for the entire first half\nOught to be exciting uh everybody and that's a lot to do this right now I mean this is really kind of turning into what everybody built us up to be the old warrior hanging in there against the ah you know the up and coming a newcomer and uh it's it's turning out to be what a what everybody thought we got a pretty interesting finished Adam is I Would like to think\nLike when it was twenty four nine I'm going yeah poor at all [laughter] now they're coming back you know this is wrong I'm so sorry I'm a start\nBlaming it on millennials and things are really going to go to hell David Seal joining us on the show writer for the sporting news coauthor silent gesture with\nTommy Smith find them on to other ... David see steel or David ... when you're watching week six I I thought it was a week or it's time to take what's yours the Steelers played ... in Cincinnati played well against Pittsburgh Pittsburgh played even better Antonio Brown the difference maker\n... why it is is Pittsburgh one of those teams where I Am just not going to take you seriously unless you beat Pittsburgh because no levy on bell there seems to be in fighting and not been seems that the ship is right it again\n[noise] it does feel that way doesn't it yeah I think how do you want to talk about the the world being turned right again I think that was probably the big game for everybody to watch even more more so than this one because ... have this uh this habit probably even more so than she sat in the recent Andy Andy Reid years they'll they'll they'll teasing\nOnce in a while they had that run whether it sees me every single year and then you see what would happen to them in the uh playoffs or late in the years something like that and they were starting to build that exact same momentum and this was really an opportunity especially playing at home\nAnd they were getting some of their players back because I was the boss has perfect came back and you know that really are at least all sorts of possibilities not all of them good of course as we all know from his history\nBut I'm with an opportunity to really separate from it seem that they genuinely needed to\nBe worried about if they ever got the entire team together and everyone got on the same page and yet they let it or\nTo let it get away so now that seems more like the world turning in the proper directions so it's in the end you there's a better chance that the Steelers are going to be there and the bangles I got to be staying there scratching their heads gone running wondering what they did wrong\nDavid still joining us on the show or a branch out to other conferences rather divisions\nHere in a moment a Baltimore played very well against Tennessee Mike ... left his franchise quarterback in late in that game did you have a problem with it\nA little bit [laughter]\nHe's playing because it it got higher now on Twitter over here buddy [laughter]\nYeah I was honestly stock is you know you're flipping around and you see\nYou know what was going on and all the games and he\nSaid look it up and you see the the titans have the ball to see the Martin Marietta still in there\nHe's been fact daytime soap no no in fact I Know it's been it's ten times up off the dilemma that if it was like literally no chance for them to get back to the game is Twenty one nothing so it's not even a sense that they can get a flu scored high swing battle they they they can somehow you know gunslinger way back into it\nYou know they were just getting nasty off into nothing the game was over you know think of your quarterbacks L think of a long term future of France I think of your own job\nFirst year brand new head coach might rain fall and get your head against the French Quarter back at it I I don't understand why he would take on that kind of risk\nAnd I would like to think that he's going to explain it at some point\nBut I don't know if anyone even really thought of asking him about it and kind of a normal and says oh well we did this wrongly I take responsibility for the coach pets like now the ... the real coaches you should have done it some time in that earlier in that fourth quarter getting market Mary oughta and there's no singly fingers out of that game so he doesn't get fact eleven times\nDavid still joining us on the show who are the Redskins 'cause I I had people calling me up last Sunday night I Swear to God David I have people calling me up on Sunday night and they were going well can we think of students who have the skills to go man\nUh if they go down to New Orleans and they win okay fine I'll give them credit and I'll say they're one of their one of the ones you got to pay attention to and they were garbage and I figured that was about right and then they came back out this week and they got themselves a big win so who are the Washington Redskins right now\nThere are there you know you know their team that will show up in any\nSort of condition from week to week 'cause that's\nThat's all they've shown themselves to be 'cause there they could be the team that that\nThat deep the Packers with Aaron Rodgers or they give it a team that didn't show up at all against Andrew Luck on their home field against a a horrible coach the that's the only team to the cold to beat all year they could be the scene that got run off the field I think that absolutely humiliated\nIn that big Drew Brees moment if frozen in time because we're like ... you know putting out the worst coverage\nThe history of sports on the record breaking pet by Drew Brees\nOr they have a team that that really kind of dominated the or the Panthers all day and that we may have more questions about the Panthers now because of the way that they lost that game you know it ... this may be who they are and this may be what the NFC East is\nEven if the eagles get themselves together maybe they're not capable of pulling away from everybody it may take a walk and then they get together but\nRight now it's just a week to week I mean it's been the most unpredictable year and that division and\nThat seems kind of exemplifies it all the way they played these first six weeks of the year\nDavid Steel joining us on the show from the sporting news if you were the jaguars would you call the giants about Eli Manning\nWow that's you know\n... and edit those hanging out there that that's\nWhat I've I've always liked about the whole Tom Coughlin angle are down there I thought they should have done it last year maybe even before last season began you know they got to do something and I don't really know what their what their options are\nMaybe that has all the you lie manning needs is a fresh start with a little bit of the face it organizations that have confidence in him\nProbably has more not not necessarily more weapons obviously 'cause the weapons they have a New York just that's another topic uh\nThat of the face it organizations that have confidence in him that probably has more not not necessarily more weapons obviously 'cause the weapons they have a New York just that's another topic entirely\nSomeone has to protect them some of the kids sort of design things around him and make them not be in that I have a storm all the time you know why not and if and if it the giant get that call one I think about it honestly you know after all the stuff that went on last year and this and this year as well why not just\nSort of make a clean break and then have some sort of ceremony when he when he's all retired and have a big thing for employers to rings all that kind of stuff but for the time being just say let's just sort of in this and try to get on there right now but from the jaguars your seasons slipping away I think that the the window is closing I I'd say make that move\nWhen I ask you a serious question if you're John Bruton why stop and I'm Ari Cooper include Mac why don't you just read their car while you're at it\nI don't know that's a great question I think they're at that point now\nWhere yeah everything everything to be on the table you know what ever reason he had\nTo hang onto certain guide and think that they were going to be valuable and then they were gonna do do do be helpful to him for this year and have them on some sort of an even keel at least on a path toward success in the waning years of their Oakland era\nIt all just grab it and it's obviously it's his fault I mean this he\nBrought all this on himself so you know do those city there are no real you know a ... style or anything but yeah might as well just cut bait now you know this is this is this the disaster\nYou know I think we're much worth going to get you all at their car to get beaten into a into a spike in to the\nGrace cry when he was crying yeah we're talking about grown men playing grown men games he was crying I understand the motion you get the best to you but you cut the head off the snake right there at the beginning of the season\nHas he lost his team already had one in five and he's got a ten year contract he's making a boatload of money I don't know if you could truly lose your team but he's doing what he can David these doing everything he possibly can to do it\n... it it it really feels that way it it seems as if he just and I don't I Can't get into his head it clearly nobody really can but you have to start to take now that his plan all along was to just go to the entire thing and\nJust put it all together and it's and you know on his own in his own image and that somehow was always going to include their car and he was going to run a mad at air one way or the other and apparently he included as a as a possibility making cry\nA on national TV from the other side of the ocean I mean if it's a crazy you know\nWay to go about it but it seems to be like he's he was kind of open to anything on that and that's that seems to be the result that it's really just if they don't ... their heart you know they're caught in deserve that you know you may not be the greatest quarterback early may not lived up to what you look like the first couple of years but why why put him through what what they're putting in for now\nDavid still joining us on the show is Sean McVeigh the most dangerous guy in the NFL\nOr you or

David ... fan so I like the direction they're headed and until you know until the owner decides to screwed up to them\nI'm not trying to insult your intelligence subtle don't take this this way I Know a lot in well 'cause a lot of MBA guys they get a little bit hot and bothered about it because what I'm about to say I've heard a couple of the rumblings that he might joined the bronze in LA and my first thought is you know if you if you want your respect back\nYou don't make that MOVE Nine you respect him as a ballplayer but there still is that feeling that snake type of feeling from some of the regular basketball fans out there what say you\nI I wouldn't be very surprised if he was a Laker and largely for that reason if if he's leaving the warriors it is to get\nIt that because you know winning stocks or I don't like it with my belly and investing money like it's not it's not the food in San Francisco is that he wants his own team right now but\nHe's the best player on that and I think he's a better player than Steph Curry step courage culture\nIs Golden State he's the guy that set the tone that they they have fun playing I think they're serious but they have fun playing that hotel and starts with Cory the way that the spurs and we get top of this all this credit that started with don't get like you have to have the guy in the locker room at any sport that set the tone it's got to come from the players\nIf he's leaving it's because he wants his own team\nDon't get like you have to have the guy in Milwaukee ... any sports that set the tone it's got to come from the players if he's leaving it's because he wants his own team you don't go to the Lakers you don't go to a bronze team 'cause that's what it's all his team and I looked Kevin ... is a um I I don't like the word sensitive 'cause I just think that's the wrong\nTerminology for it but he is impact it more by what people say about him but he cares to lead on but it's kind of obvious when you watch our ... gate hey he left the Lakers ... he left the lawyers in that super team to team up with well on that you do more flack that is not where he's going to go if it happens\nI you know this current I think there's been I think there's been one guy who's never played for a little Ron I and I think it's played with LeBron and I think that that's the way everybody else and see how they played when they played for him and that takes a toll like we've seen with Kyrie Irving\nYeah in fact a dusting ... wanted out of the shadow of it in even wait by the way it takes a while to adjust a plane before going to be weighed have the ball in his hands all the time and suddenly he was having to learn to play more off the ball and make cuts and and there was some sharing their and it was when I read\nIt specially for big but you know you could ask Kevin lover or Chris Bosh about it but even for other guards who are good ball handlers and shot creators you still have to really adjust your game to play with Ron and that's going to be one of those interesting things to watch this year with the Lakers like\nHow does Brandon Ingram catch on eventually at and how old is logical balls and these other guys how does how does this all come together to them\nHow would you encourage healing joining us on the show how would you handle Jimmy Butler\n[noise] I I think I think if you just have to move him at some point and by the way that the offer on the table from\nMiami I think it's as good as it's going to get if the if the reporting is true and they ...

Jones another macho game one hundred and forty the arts but yet still reached the end of six games now has because I have a touchdown reception which is pretty crazy thing for falcon\nRole by five at home over the buccaneers\nFalcons they just need to breathe some sweet life of victory\nSo they got that today both defense is not too terribly great one because then the other ones just not too terribly great James Winston no front throwing for the amount of yards that he did the type of performance that he had a little bit you could build off there so you don't need to freak out and said that this seems a complete now up not disaster because James ... not not disaster he needs to ...\nA little bit you could build off there so you don't need to freak out and say that this seems

Night Football and also on our Facebook page it's after hours with Amy Lawrence\nOur pleased to welcome from New England Blair occurred cop who covers the chief for the Kansas City star and a lot of crazy things that we can pull from this game Blair but now the dust has settled a little bit what surprises you the most\n[noise] oh the first of all that the teacher came back in it after a was a twenty four nine at half time and a ... a couple of picks hadn't she had not been in the end zone it was a game in which I just thought okay patriots are going to assert\nTheir dominance says they often do with um in Fox borough and the ... and next thing you know um there's there's a long touchdown pass to ... months in a couple of ... to ... kill and and the chiefs of taking the lead and so\nI'm looking at it this was going to be a game that whoever had all that going to win and and uh uh this is especially with the with with Tom Brady patriots that's just a demo I think it was forty third time he's had a fourth quarter of a comeback winner or one game a fourth quarter so\nUh he is he's fantastic two hundred widows distorting quarterback tonight and most of the NFL history but um but I thought she showed me a little something like two being down big and and then coming back to take the lead it at Fox for\nWhat happened in the first half that they did fall into that whole\nWell one thing we all kind of thought about this in advance it or who the team that was going to settle for field goals was going to be in a heap of trouble because neither defence ah it has played particularly well this year and the chiefs bent just abysmal\nAlthough the offensive side so we just thought that it was going to be a game where\nBoth sides up and down the field the ones that stuck in the end zone was going to have to get in and patriots did much better job but that the first half the chiefs did three Harrison Butterfield goals was all the the chief Scott or their their trips a couple of them in in the red zone even and still couldn't get a you know couldn't get touchdown but\nAgain that that changed the way and so did the instead of the homes play I mean he\nHe's a for touchdowns in the second half and a couple of you know the the bombs to to a concert attire reach he'll ... were a just a kind of the kind of the guy that we saw the first three weeks of the season for the for the chiefs\nWhat did the ... speaks have to say after the game about almost tackling Tom Brady before he had his four yard scrambling to the end zone\nYeah it was a little odd he you know he he was one thing you mentioned was he he was in an awkward position and and Brady cut she'll come off but it speaks thought he could have had the sec\nSaid he thought rating had released the ball and you would get a rocking the pastor penalty if he didn't follow through with a\nWith a tackle so we kind of city kind of let up a little bit now there are a couple\nA couple of problems with that first of all I'm a ... you never let up I mean even if you don't know what's going on with the ball you\nYou still play through the play and the other thing there was a defensive holding penalty on on the cheeks quarterback the flag was down to the end zone show the\nWhatever happened to play wasn't going to if there had been effect you know the play wasn't going to stay in the patriots would've had the ball first and goal one right uh but they wouldn't have had to touch down like that and you never know what what might have happened but uh\nUh the the look on his face on the bench was priceless a tone did didn't know what was going on at a you know based on that uh that expression on his face\nWell certainly as any re talked about after the game a good learning experience for young guys that probably less than that ... forget absolutely\nBlair ... with us from New England following Sunday Night Football he covered the chief for the Kansas City star with us after hours on CBS Sports radio lotta guys missing for the cheese defense because of injuries how soon do you think they might get healthy\nYeah that that was an issue uh in fact it was a that they lost a trio of orders in a last week when they when they played in defeat of Jacksonville at at arrowhead too on the defensive side and then at all\nThat that they lost to a trio of orders in a last week when they when they played in defeat of Jacksonville at at arrowhead too on the defensive side and then an offensive line than in\nAnd then a third defensive guy an outside linebacker taught a passenger who uh who practice this week was ruled out today so they were down um or just in Houston who played last week and and uh did not play tonight so to outside linebackers and then the safety here Murray\nA three defensive starter so I mean the result speak for themselves the patriots had five hundred yards and\nA score forty three points but that's kind of been the ... that's been the habit chiefs deep and even when they've had healthy bodies are they're just\nUm it hasn't you know statistically it's been an abysmal defects now I I and also submit that uh the fact that in several of the games they've gotten and they've got big leach Twenty one to nothing over the Steelers thirty five seven of the forty niners you change the\nWay you play defense when you put when you're putting those circumstances and there there there's a lotta lotta yards given up the chargers had like two hundred and fifty yards and the fourth quarter and in the opener\nSo some of that was circumstantial but other but for the most part it's just not it's been an average to below average defense and it has to get better if if the chiefs are going to\nReach the goals that they've they've they set for themselves and they've actually kind of exceeded their goals and some months because Holmes has been better than than people think\n... yeah for sure I have a home does now in Eighteen touchdowns for more on Sunday

I Would make a difference in the making the playoffs federal law\nAnd the truth thousand for gene\nCarolina finish seven\nEight in one mhm\nAnd one division right they made the playoffs or\nNorway Spanish that seven and nine\nAirline has to tie breaker\nWith a better um from record so there wasn't a matter\nBut then the next time I ... thousand in the\nPhiladelphia Eagles beat the call boy last game of the season darkroom\nFinished nine sticks and won cowboy for nine and seven cowboys has a typewriter\nSo that's only one time in ten years\nDrew thousands game\nFor all the\nTime I actually made a difference in a team\nSo or before\nOh what's that going to read all the it was three and all and then I can see them going for the time\nBut when you're on June ... and the difference and woman three you're going to go for ...\nNo it is a difference you can't just because you haven't found the examples of it and you mentioned Carolina you haven't found any examples of it doesn't mean it won't make a difference this year we right now I Am dealers right now the Steelers are three two and one and they could end up winning their division because of that\nParticular time ... I mean we don't know how to play out and there's a bunch of teams that advertise\nAnd we'll see how it affects them\n... ... well he ... sweetheart\nOr ... when you only have\nOne time in ten years\nYou know male mavericks don't why\nHow many teams actually finished with ties and those ten years\nI counted\nAh there were about\nCincinnati drill\nOn okay it's really it's not important we'll see we'll see we'll see how right it's minimal exactly so now we've got a few more of them this year and we'll see how it plays out either way the NFL's not changing so I'm not sure what you're arguing\nOr your girlfriend when you're walking through the American it serves the goal for time because it's a one on one is going to see any difference then want to\nKnow it is different but you just wanted mathematics it absolutely is different it's not the same thing anyway thank you so much Michael uh we'll see how it plays out after this particular season since we have a couple of more ties in the NFL more maybe have a greater sample size\nEight five five oh never mind it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS portraying us all a lot of you are weighing in about the track me versus the defense of slug best and I\nSome of your comments and I like the fact that it's not uniform either um that there are some of you like Craig who says I find no enjoyment in watching the NFL right now because of that because of the way that it's pass happy and you expect to see team put up these ... numbers\nBut Stevens says he prefers the track meets he says watching high scoring games with a thousand totally yards is fun ... plus it's like watching NC double a football since the big twelve conference is high octane passing right well it's one of the conferences um let's see Bob\nSays considering my Steelers can't stop anyone defensively I guess the track meets will do [laughter] [laughter]\nFor now whatever suits your purposes right a Steve another Steve same thing track meets watching scoring is fun but real send us says smash mouth football is what I prefer and Mike says defense\nThe games in the seventies to the nineties were some great games\nAnd dug says today's games remind me of the old AFL lots of passing very little defense nothing against the AFL but I'd like to see a defensive struggle from time to time\nAnd so there is a different debate\nWhat makes headlines is not so much the ravens with their love and sex as amazing as that was as dominant as it was as well as the chargers played against Baker may feel and hit him over and over again uh as long as the seal off played against their car and got to him over and over again\nI it it's not necessarily going to be the guardian headlines on the front page of a your fair the front of your favorite website or you know the front page of the sports section of your newspaper because people do still read those\nUm it's it's these guarding numbers and it's a Patrick moles with an Eighteen touchdowns and it's up and down the field and its hold your breath\nTo see who has the ball laughed and and if one team can answer or what the other one just did so\nI definitely\nI definitely wish there was a balance so I appreciate what a lot of\nFormer players quarterbacks and said about the age of the NFL we're in right now which is that the often does have an unfair advantage and it's mostly because of the space that's been made possible by the rules changes um but it's also about the ways that quarterbacks are protected\nAnd so it it's just a it's a completely different era that we're in right now\nI cannot quibble with rules designed to make the game more safe and honestly there every single week instances in which I feel like a flight should have been drawing for helmet to helmet contact the hit on them are Cooper yesterday in London is a great example of that the guy did not can cost himself he gets knocked pretty much out and\nHas to leave the game with a concussion and somehow there is no flag on what was the helmet to helmet hits\nAnd so I I definitely can see the protection for quarterbacks it's not afford it elsewhere even though\nThere was a whole lot of lip service given to no one shall be leading with his helmet whether it's often whether it's the fence you see it every single game um helmet to helmet contact that's not cold and so I I Want the NFL to be safer especially when it comes to\nHead injuries um but\nRight now that's not what's changing the game it's about all these pass interference calls it allow receivers to to roam free or even back to get into the second level of the defense and it's about the quarterbacks and and how much space they're allowed to have and and they know\nOf course no it doesn't mean they're going to be flopping around I Hope let's have some integrity or but they definitely no they definitely know that they've got\nThat space and that ah\nThey've got the benefit of the doubt that's afforded to them it's after hours here on CBS Sports radio\nOkay fine I'll give it to a five but I Do want to do two seven five five to one to forward to to sit in a couple of other bounced back wins that we saw week six I think

realistic as it leaves no room for human error and we all know that humans grew up from time to time\nAlthough your definition of stewardship my very slightly for mine\nI Would guess that we are not that far heart\nMy interpretation of stewardship is personal responsibility and accountability when dealing with air water land in animals I Would guess that most of the people in this world\nWould agree or come close to that interpretation it gets a bit Sunday after that the problem is that there's a gigantic disconnect between what the majority of us in the vocation of production agriculture

I'm asking for your vote on November ... I grew up in a family farm and had been involved in agriculture my entire life I'm tired of politicians taking our tax dollars in spending name on roads and schools and we can in a long time we get our tax dollars back for ... and schools and the only candidate with a hundred percent rating from the inner a in a perfect breeding from all the right to life groups in Nebraska\nWow who have that level and achievement and and and I want to be able to um extend that I'm I'm a service to the northeast Nebraska people\nMhm um what uh what is the McKenzie method now that you brought it up\nWell thank you for asking that Billy and in the McKenzie met that basically is a system of evaluation\nA what we what we simply do is we move people it it they exercise may treatment methods trying to figure out if we move you a certain direction of certain movement can't we change your symptoms can we affect the things that you have difficulty\nThat is it it's a very thorough system of evaluation trying to sort things out and we mainly are um I Would say I'm a true investigator you want when you come in as a patient you want\nMe to figure out what is my problem and where's my palm coming from\nSo I'm as investigate and we're trying to find out\nWhat is it true source of the pain and and try to basically when you figure out where the source of the pain you can um a figure out the management a lot more effectively that's why we're getting the outcome that we're getting is because we can figure out where the source of the pain\nAnd you know we've talked about the McKenzie method here a little bit uh\nI didn't know there was multiple methods because I'm not in that field so I'm clueless or how is it obviously there's different ways of doing things with physical therapy how's the McKenzie method different\nAgain it it it's a it's a sentiment that it's just not just giving you exercises do you\nKnow ... in the physical therapy era we are known to give exercise\nNow that the difference between them because the amount that he once we figure out you have a movement that that you prefer that use mine respond to that change your pain and change the things that you have difficulty we call it directional preference movement and that's a well research\nA I'm a ... a\nThat if you have a direction of perhaps a province movement you tip you simply will respond to that one and and the difference as we go you go home with one thing and I know people usually said uh you know I don't want to go to therapy because a lot of times we get five things tempting\nNow the beauty about what I Do what we do with the McKenzie method is we look for that direction of preference you get one movement you go home and test it out at once\nYou come back and and that movement shoot it with ... that changes your symptoms and your mechanics you than you continue to apply that movement throughout the day and it because that's going to ultimately change 'em up effect you all come so\nUm is there a particular person that should be seen any McKenzie certified therapist\nUm it usually anybody that um we are in the past were known for treating spine net ... but it has extended to extremely deep I'm like if you have showed a problem um you know I'm ... ankle palm the McKenzie met that again is a method of assessment we're trying to figure out\nYou know what is going on in the joints what is a fact how the joins is a fact is a mechanical nature to the\nSupply of the joint if they're the mechanical if it if there was a mechanical forced dies in the wrong direction we gonna\nYou know figure out what is the right direction again you go home and one thing to do we show you how to manage it again you know we all know that law back um\nAnd that problem is a very expensive for them and then in fact the latest number about oh about ... is a hundred billion dollars ... ... in the United states it's a train that is bullet train that won't stop so\nWhen people coming into my clinic a lot of times I you know we don't say that we're going to kill you were going to teach you how to manage the beauty about the McKenzie met that he is a self manage methods and we're going to teach you how to manage it at work you're going to teach you how to manage our home\nBecause you need to know what the things that you need a boy you need to know what are the things that are good for you to do and plus you know addition to that movement that is correct for your for your lower back all your neck you're going to be able to apply it and continue to ease the pain\nManagement is the key and active approach to this method is the key to getting people better instead of past\nMhm [noise] and uh you get the active approach to it and that involves a lot of investigation him so McKenzie method and ah you get that a fool\nFool run down with the folks their faith regional now a lot of people have said before I've been I've been to physical therapy and it doesn't work\nAnd this this is this is commonly things that we hear in the clinic um there are different school at training out there so\nYou know I usually tell the patient is like don't you know I don't think that you fail and one method that means you're completely failing you know try a different method because if if you were responding to a different method with a better system of evaluation\nYou're going to come out of a a little bit better it's just like if you're going to have surgery\nYou don't go have surgery out of her first on the opinion go get a second opinion and and and if you if it works out it's going to save you cost\nYou know it's going to you know reduce the amount of trauma that you go through with your body um and and it's a much better way to um I'm I'm I'm sort things out instead of going straight to have anything in basic and\nYeah and that's what we want to that's what you guys are trying to do um people may look at it as well that that's another bill I got to do the therapist yeah well that's a better bill\nBeen something that you know may lead to some expensive surgery or invasive ... you've maybe not need and you know if you go see lend over their faith regional physical therapy\nYou're going to get the ... because he method to hurt her team were going to look you over evaluate you and try and come up with a with a method to try who we are one way to go instead of multiple ways to go like putting stress on your body right\nAnd we you know and if patients coming in for a second opinion they you know ... that I've been to another therapy um what I Do again we I investigated if I'm not getting any results with his patients within two to three visit\nThen it's time to move this patient on to see a pain specialist or see a surge in because\nThey have gone to you know conservative therapy the first time you know the ... mackenzie says system evaluation also indicate that they are not responding\nThen it's time to move in a more more they need more general strengthening it's time to get them moving a different a different direction and get them moving educate the patient again it's all about education it's all about teaching the patient how to manage\nNobody can cure this problem there is no expert in the wall and they said that I can cure this problem um if not we won't have the kind of billion dollar right you know\nUm and speaking of education you have a couple of seminars coming up here a year on October seventeenth October twenty fourth is the other one the both Wednesday nights\nAnd I love these kind of seminars because or an hour that's my data seminar or when did they start in the evening and they both served at the same time what time\nI'm six o'clock on um Wednesday to Seventeen um again like belief that is an hour I maybe would go a little bit more people have questions but\nUm it short as precise um it's it's a lot of education about management tool um and and people usually get it they they usually appreciated the things that I I Am able to convey to them so I'm I'm hoping to see a lot of people there um\nUh if you want to call in and um our as VP there'll be good so that we have the numbers so that we have the space but\nUm yeah and and the one on the twenty fourth is for neck pain headaches which a lot of people suffers from that and um I I Am I'm usually those are the people I see I see um my my caseload throughout the day is either a lower back pain neck pain or headaches and migraines so\nAnd they are mechanical in nature which is that the source is coming from the science find somewhere\nUh so October seventeenth will be the lower back pain seminar for October twenty four for that can headache correct and what's the costs on these free\nThat's another one of the things I Love about these kind of seminars or free [laughter] um if you mentioned about people are repeating the come in and uh you know what you know that you know they are coming in kind of ... where are you going to have the ... or what's the best way to get a hold of someone\nUm called the I think they're in the fire they is number that you can call or just\nI'm I'm\nCalled the um uh probably in the marketing department\nOK so just to give them a call their faith regional and uh just talk to them about faith regional physical therapy or you're wondering about the seminar bill direct you underwrite\nCrazy I just called the generic live even and they'll be no issue there they could go if they have a direct line of the physical therapy to the bar but I'm sure you can go there and grab guys let them know there are other wives discovered America a lot of faith regional say hey I'm interested in the the free seminar or\nBack pain on the seventeenth or that that can headache a seminar on the twenty fourth we're we're meeting at a just one way you know I'm coming a and they'll work at everything out with you on the phone so I just want to make sure you have a have a heads up

on social media after the governor declined to reply to the letter\nAnd by the way whether it went on or not or whether it was a political center not isn't that courtesy to usually respond to a letter

I Believe that's where the recordings come from they need to share those with us and they need to share that soon\nGod that is Michael morale up CBS former deputy director of the CIA and acting director he wants to know that the Saudi prince or the killing of a Washington Post columnist the ramifications or impossible to overstate as pressure builds on Trump to impose some type of sanctions for the act well the ... he said you better not\nAt stake relations with the U.S in Saudi Arabia and they are the counterbalance to around the region the president just spoke about it I'll bring you those comments numbered\nOr how can be very difficult for the Republicans maintain but I think given the last ... the president's had now not impossible and the numbers reflect that a\nGovernor Chris Christie really dive all inside because not only is he not understand politics she understands the president the midterm shifting grounds enthusiasm is high but now they're on the side of the G O P as well what's the latest numbers are showing in how Hispanics might just be helping the G O P number one\nIn terms of the three interviews he was completely different from someone that really stood out was the one three days after he won the election where it was my impression from he lives in total shock right now who was so much more confidence for truly president I mean ... I ... and this and if you\nUh in terms of in terms of where we're at right now as a a as a race I think it's a very interesting to see a lot of experts not willing to guarantee that the house is going to go to the Democrats here as well on each end of the Hoover Institute on meet the press ...\nMid term elections are a lot about convincing voters what is it you stand to lose what if you stand to lose and and for Republicans the pitches a Democratic Senate get to like if you're going to lose these judges for Democrats than if you have a Republican Senate gets elected you're going to lose Obamacare\nAnd that's why the pitch has focused in on judges and health care so thoroughly and I think the challenges in in some of these states you know Arizona Nevada you're starting to see the race creed away from Democrat and it's happened in a slow but steady fashion in Nevada jak euros and the Democrat has not been in a had had an a public pool since the end of September\nIn Arizona you got here since then and my oldest opposition research coming out on her recently being out of touch with Arizona and so these races are creeping away but the met a narrative here is really about what\nAnd I think Republicans have prosecuted that case effectively yeah I mean that's one thing they got to say and also when you saw how crazy it was going after Brett Kavanaugh is high school drinking\nYeah look I I think the\nThe the speaker there Brian is is generally right but but I think that there is a big hole here is what do the Democrats really stand for I mean I don't think they've nationalize the issue of health care successfully\nI think they are they are and they have been portrayed accurately as a mob as as\nThey're going to impeach Kavanaugh they're gonna teach Trump they're going to they want to raise taxes I mean they're going to come in and tell you what bathrooms to use and they're going to get in your face\nI mean I I don't see the Democrats coalescing around a a a platform with even water to clear ideas they seem very much scattered and they are\nYou know I mean you you you took it back to work against Ted Cruz I mean look like a shining star there are ... workers already going to run for president\nUh and now as as the race comes down the stretch he fades so what is that what are they really stands for I think that's why their voters are not as galvanized as Republicans because there is no real platform it's at the end of the day\nIt's very hard to elect people if you don't eat it too if you don't have a platform if they are running for something\nAnd I think right now the Democrats are just running against Trump and that\nI Know not proven to be their success\nAnd they're trying to rally around Obamacare something they ran from ... years to push but the Republicans made it easy by blowing repeal and replace yeah not making it clear they're not guarding against ... they are guarding against pre existing conditions because that's something all of Americans who were behind\nThey have not made that clear they just avoid the topic Michael you didn't avoid any topic with the president thanks so much\nGo to NYU post dot com and get that interview Michael thank you\nThank you Brian one eight six six eight seven six six gun Brian kill made [noise]\nYou know what's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes but you know what is smart zip recruited dot com slash Brian ... dot com slash B.

I Believe that's where the recordings come from they need to share those with us and they need to share that show and\nI'm the Saudis need to share with us what they have\nAnd then we need to collect our own intelligence so that we couldn't corroborate whatever the Turks and Saudis are telling us it's only one we have all of that information that the intelligence community will be able to tell the president with any sort of confidence in what we think happened inside that conflict which is still murky because there are two narratives and there's two competing narratives\nIs booming and the rest of the world is slowing and so I think he figured out that we've got a built in advantages right now that we can sustain\nA showdown on trade in a way that some of our trading partners trading partners are trading adversaries in the case of some of these countries can't and so you know if your economy slowing a and all of a sudden pro Trump put tariffs on you that's going to put a lot more of a squeeze on you whereas in the United states is they're going to we're doing so well right now that we could we could\nWe could absorb a some terrorists for a short period of time in order to in a showdown and they're going to in a game of chicken they're going to blink uh so\nThat's what he's doing but I mean ... you know and even in the areas\nWhere he hasn't kept his promise like building a wall or repealing Obamacare he's been trying\nA you know that that it's because of democratic obstruction that he hasn't done that and then you know in the ... the few rare instances where he has backtracked like you know he promised during the campaign to pull all our troops out of Afghanistan he actually studied the issue very carefully if you read the Woodward book it's actually very comforting the process by which he went through a really\nTough questions the salary and and he can he concluded that he was wrong and that was that's that's good or\nBad is said to him with that is said to me was Mr President matter what you accomplished in your term if there was another attack coming from Afghanistan and you pull the troops out that's all anyone ever remember and that's where it hit home with him\nYeah absolutely and then you know if you look at it you know he goes off ... when I say that he tells lies like he says\nUh our biggest tax cut in history\nWhat is worse to ... to claim that your tax cut is the biggest tax cut in history when it's really not the biggest tax cuts or to take your say or to sell your ... your main legislative achievement Obamacare on on the basis of a lie that you can keep your doctor your health care plan a I Would say that it's a lot worse to tell people they can keep their doctors and health care plan and say well I guess\nThat wasn't true ah you know he hasn't sold any any any policies on the basis of ally\nMark when did you go aboard the Bush administration ...\nI've been I was there for the whole eight years I started in the Pentagon and two thousand and one went to the White House in two thousand four and stay till two thousand a\nYear President Bush you watched his dad and Ronald Reagan up close and he was governor how much ramp up time did he need he didn't have much in nine months in nine eleven attack to really feel comfortable this is just more seasons opinion looking at the present\nIt's hard to say because I by the time I joined him and had a lot of face to face contact in two thousand four I was at the Pentagon for the first three years or so I didn't see him in those early years but by the time I I engaged for them he was you know he was fully in charge and uh you know people who I work who said he was a he was ... he said he was comfortable\nFrom the very beginning so here you're a man named Andrew I'm\nHere as lately so said about when\nShe questioned him last night about him being more comfortable as president cut in\nI think so I mean I felt comfortable at the beginning other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United states but I think that's true with everybody\nHow to now I very much for like ... I Do I feel like president you know for a little while it's like Mr President sir and it's even my friends they call me that they don't call me down on them and they called me Mr President and I say we please loosen up I've learned on the job I have and you feel comfortable I feel very comfortable here\nAre you sensing that or is it that we're we over again\nTrading that since we're talking about over exaggerating the role he's been on\nYou know I Know I don't think we're over that during the ... have\nBeen on I think he's got a roll of\nAn enormous accomplishment I mean if you just if you took the litany of accomplishment that this president had\nAnd went to every never Trump or a three years ago and said we're going to elect a Republican president who is going to pass historic tax reform huge regulatory rollback destroy the ISIS caliphate a you know down the line\nOr that most people would sign up for it um it's it's it's a a you know he's kept his promises of now you know the the difference between him and George George W. Bush or even you know to some extent is that he's he's not he's the first president we've had has never held political office before\nUh so you know he came out of the world of business he's got a learning curve of how government works versus how business works in and just you know things on foreign policy he just didn't have a lot of experience and all this stuff but he's surrounded himself with really good people he's got a great foreign policy team now with the with a bolt in ...\nUh you know and in advising him and Gina Haspel at CIA [noise]\nSo you know he's he's you know he's he's learning and he's growing in an office in in a good way\nSo I don't have any problem the one thing about him he'll walk over to the cameras and let the press talk to them with a chopper going in the background he just did it in the rain I'll be very head out to Florida to talk about Saudi Arabia so he talked to us brought a doctor Shannon Thursday talked to sixty minutes over the weekend and I'm Wondering first off from my communication standpoint\nWould you recommend did he do sixty minutes I think\nHe came off well you know from what I've been writing from beginning to end but\nYou know yeah why not I mean I think the key thing you have to worry about where the presidency and a long long period of an eight years is over exposure right\nSo eventually people started tuning presidents out but then they see too much of them it used to be you know Ronald Reagan's day and I just looked at it from the volume of speeches that we were doing in the Bush administration you know he had two or three events a day where we had to have a written text of some kind of push in the in the Reagan Administration because you didn't have twenty four hour cable news and all the rest of it\nUh presidents were much less exposed and so when they went out and spoke\nA people paid much more attention because all the president's talking we better stop and you know pay attention and now you know and it's not just him mama the George W. Bush presidents are so overexposed and they're so out there all the time\nOr that it's you know at some point after you know we're still early in his presidency but some people just get exhausted and and stopped paying attention so he's got to worry about if he's got an eight year term of that you don't want to be so over expose that people aren't listening anymore\nWhen you hear Lesley Stahl on sixty minutes over time about what went into the interview was a third cut fourteen\nWhy do you think President Trump decided on an interview with you and now at this particular time I was trying to ... ... for the Republicans are ... ... people believe morals are fair publicly the stronger the chances are for the Republicans are\nThe better for him and I think the White House has come to believe it's an insult to try to restrain them to come off television to keep them away from these rallies or who loves doing who ...\nWho who gets a lot of energy how crowds or I guess a lot of energy rustling rose would go with no\nYeah I don't think he minded I that's what people don't understand he takes questions but he doesn't really get a bill if you get them noxious gas taxes go up to them but you you actually sit down as we still\nSo here's a here's the problem is that there's exposure and there's exposure if you're ... if you're doing these interviews and you're a message discipline and your message a goal is to put out there and let people know what what you're accomplishing an office what's your agenda is that's all good\nIt's when the president goes out and completely distracts from his successes with the rants about the Mueller investigation and the Russia probe and and the sort of these these crazy asides that he does all the time\nThat make people exhausted by by the by the seeming chaos you know the fact is if you look at his set of accomplishments and then you look at there's there I think we're there was a poll now that he was like at forty one percent which is like the highest he's had one of the highest got one of the highest poll numbers of his presidency but he's still in the low forties\nWith a guy with his level of accomplishment should be in the fifties or sixties and what's so would you have to look at it and what's not happening with the Trump presidency\nIs he's not building his base beyond his base right when you come in you got your core base and then you go out and you reach out and you try and accomplish certain things and you get a get a level of accomplishment that people should be looking at this economy that this is one of the best economies we've had in in in a generation\nAnd they should be saying you know what Trump's pretty good president maybe I should give him a second shot but he keeps doing all this stuff that just makes people dislike him and now that not not as core base his core base loves everything he does but he's not persuading the persuadable\nBringing them along you know why they want you to see the president\nAnd that's one thing that you know he got a few of those questions from was we saw biggest surprise since he took over that's when you human on yourself\nWell the biggest surprise for me was when I ... you know you could just tell a story that makes you seen a humble or the magnitude of the office or the biggest you know just as soon as he does it does those who went over independence that's when people say I really like this guy\nAnd he said no I'm going to bull straight ahead not show any Boulder ability we all make mistakes I'm my mistake was not blowing up NAFTA early but that's just the way he does think there's going to change but I think if someone talk to them and say he want independence human as yourself\nYou know talk about you went to a you went to ... game and he sat in the background and you're seeing how well he's playing with the Dc United academy which he is evidently is a great soccer player and just simply corner and know what he's sacrifice to come here and seemed fitting in so well with his teammates you realize\nHow much it's so much more than just me then people go oh my goodness you forget he's a dad he really is a dad as a teenager now I think he's Thirteen twelve or Thirteen but he's being you know he's like six one that's with those people off [laughter] but but I mean those those are the moments that when asked you don't ask him to cry\nBut you just say give me that other side\nOr the end that would be fantastic but I'll I'll give you a perfect example okay so African American unemployment is the lowest on record right remember Donald Trump went to that that that African American church in Detroit during the campaign and he said to them whether you vote for me or not I'm going to fight for you\nAnd I'm going to ...

[noise]\nHere's your host floors\nGood morning and thank you for joining us again this morning welcome to aggregate talk it started showing up in northeast Iowa yesterday afternoon at about four o'clock and by the time it quit we had a white yard snow covered trucks to the fire burn up fireplace and I\nKnow a lot of you got a mid October snowing a lot of you had a lot more snow than we did not good still a lot of beans in the field in western in in the western corn belt\nOr that are not going to like the snow but it does look like a drier forecast for the next several days doesn't mean it's going to get warm but at least we shouldn't seen much rain or snow that'll get many back in the field at some point this this weekend and for some\nIt's going to be the first time this fall that they get into the field\nOut we're going to talk some trade issues today and specifically beef trade with ... ... senior vice president of government affairs for the national ... beef association and in the second half of the show you know what it is we've got machinery peak Greg Peterson will be a long to talk about the latest trends in the use machinery market\nAnd the latest hot items that

question or comment for today's show for any of us give us a call at eight by by ...\nThat said Bye bye for eight to five five to four if you'd rather let us know what you're thinking via Twitter make sure that you include hash tag ... we're talking the message right now let's turn it over to Clinton Griffiths get an update on the news how are you buddy\nPretty good pretty good we are I think we're only going to be in the forties today\nYeah forty asked were low forties Noam ... at the fast yeah we're adding mid forties but we still haven't had the snow which my gosh\nYeah middle of first of a October middle of October and snow yeah\nAfter we go in the October fourteen ... or like I said when I uh when when the sun went down last night we already had a white yard\nHow bad is this issue with the with the crops are ... out in the field what do you know we've been talking a little bit about this was some folks on Twitter about you know handling the top end off these yields I mean is this going to be widespread enough you'd think to start to ratchet those down\nYeah yeah I ... you know I um I've talked about the area that I'm most concerned about a few times now it's Wisconsin over to the Dakotas down to Kansas and then swing it back up there in northern Missouri into northern Illinois I'm at in\nIt when we look at us MCA it maintained the same beef in ... cattle trade provisions\nSo it is equally as good we're thrilled with the fact that uh we were able to maintain\nNo quota it no tariffs\nSo we truly do have free and full access to Canada and Mexico which historically have been to the top five export markets for our product so we're thrilled with that and the fact that he got done as quickly as it did a lot of people are saying well why would you say that we've been working on it for a year and a half\nWell as we got in towards the end of the spring early summer of this year a lot of folks including in CPA we didn't think that we were actually going to get\nThis done until the new Mexican president took over in December and this was looking more likely to be a two thousand a night team play but to get this done\nNow is a good thing and we're really pushing Congress to make sure that they take action as quickly as possible\nYeah I was just going to ask you have you seen any timeline on when Congress may take it up and one candidate may take it up Mexico same thing you\nWere looking for a probably a lame duck play by Congress at the earliest\nUh it it could slip into two thousand and Nineteen but what we're telling Congress's look here is a great opportunity\nTo work has been done in order to make sure that they can consider this Congress let's get it done\nAnd of course the outcome of the election on November six also good to have a significant impact on just how much motivation there is to go ahead and take a congressional action as far as Canada and Mexico we do believe that that action will be a very quick but I Would feel that United States probably will go first\nOkay ah the outcome of the election going to have an impact here uh how so how so so let's just assume\nOkay ah the outcome of the election going to have an impact here uh how so how so so let's just assume it\nFor the sake of this question Collin let's assume that uh uh the house and the Senate remain in Republican control is that good news bad news for us MCA\nIf they remain in control but I think it's good thing for us him see a and I think that you must see action to get it ratified are much much quicker or so from the the trade standpoint we do believe that a Republican House in a Republican Senate will be good for the continued trade discussion\nGot ya okay ah I got to ask you this because it there are groups out there ... that if they've got anything bad you know quote unquote bad to say about us MCA it it is does that would like country of origin labeling back\nA on a on a mandatory basis or what since he'd be a stand on that\nCountry of origin labeling was the law the land for six and a half years chip you know what it did is ultimately resulted in a WTO case that actually threatens our relationship with Canada and Mexico in fact the WTO had been\nA authorized to allow Canada and Mexico to retaliate against the United states to the tune of a billion dollars\nRight a cool discussion is no longer philosophical and it it seems like a here we are now with some of these groups coming back and saying well you know we need we need to try this\nWe tried it gets failed it cost us money at almost cost us our access to Canada and Mexico\nThere was no reason for it to have ever been a part of the discussions with Canada and Mexico and the NAFTA renegotiation we're glad that it wasn't and we continue to push back to say when it comes to marketing program which is all that yeah rule is the federal government is probably the last group that we want marketing arby's\nYeah good point good comment right there ... uh and you know I think the other thing that ... that that it shows and the willingness of the beef industry Canada us and Mexico to work together is just how integrated the ... the north American supply chain is right\nWhen you look at us producers we have in CPA members these are American citizens these are us cattle producers across the country not just in the northern terror in the southern part of the United states that utilize ah animals that they bring across from Canada and Mexico\nAnd in a lot of cases it keeps them in business so yes it is an integrated\nA program and the integrated system that really has provided a lot of benefits for us producers and that's what we have to keep in mind this is not just a situation\nWhere you've got animals that are coming up out of Mexico and flooding the market those anniversary coming up and they're going into a U.S backed granting operation and us feedlot were were being able to utilize our system to actually put some value on those animals and it's it's worked out quite well for our for our industry\nVery cool okay ... South Korea I mean is that one it wasn't a surprise that we got it done but it happened in fairly quickly and it it what a great market for us base\nWhen you talk about just how beneficial trade is\nFor the U.S beef industry there is no better\nExample than corn the south Korean free trade agreement because all you have to do is look back to when chorus was originally signed\nWe weren't doing much at all in terms of residence with South Korea but now they are number\nTo market and they continue to just be on fire as far as the amount of product they're bringing in front of the United states is going to continue to grow and could at some point in time or eclipse our number one market Japan so we're excited about that\nAnd the good news about the renegotiated chorus is much like with NAFTA\nThey did not change the beef trade provisions so we're very happy that it's been renegotiated its been signed and we have some certainty and knowing that that South Korean market is going to remain very beneficial for us an interesting point\nThe Costco stores in South Korea and no longer sell Australian product they sell exclusively us beef\nAnd that's got to be driven by quality isn't it the kennel and\nWe know that we have the best beef in the world and our consumers here no it\nBut it is further validated when we see actions like what Cosco has done in South Korea because there's just a demand for our product are flavor and the way we do business and it's something that we are proud of it is what really is given us a these great markets such as Japan South Korea Canada Mexico et cetera\nYeah yeah okay you making Japan a earlier what should the approach with Japan be as we get into a some trade negotiations\nThe approach needs to be focused on the tariffs rate that we currently have you know we're paying a tear for thirty eight and a half percent\nNow that all the other eleven countries have moved forward with the new Trans Pacific partnership they're all going to have a\nA lower tariffs then we will that's probably going to start on January one and we will start determining whether or not Australia and Canada now start to take some of our business there in Japan so we have to try to find a way to take that tear down ticket down quickly\nIn order to be able to match up with those TPP countries and hopefully accelerate A R a tariff\nA reduction quicker than the TPP countries so that way we can maintain our access over there because again we have a scenario where the Japanese consumer prefers our product but\nJapanese consumers like any other consumer out there you may want something but if you can't afford it you're going to have to go to alternatives and that's what we're concerned about with the TPP moving forward and why we need to have our bilateral agreement done as quickly as possible\nAmen amen let's bring it back uh back to the U.

I think we're going to do with that starting today now there's no spent all when you hear a good idea you know it\nThat not occur to us for it you know I see a dollar or the lower tier my brain [laughter]\nWe're ballots all and mix in the days straight ... horn moderately higher soybean sharply higher so it'd be meal sharply higher being moderately hire we was higher solid gains in life cattle feeder cattle were higher and olean hogs sharply higher in today's trade alright\nHeck of a global moving them art yeah ... well the U.S dollar next once again tested resistance at Ninety five even in early trade but was trading moderately lower as the grain trade was wrapping up for crude oil prices also helped improve attitudes in the commodity world's\nYeah no doubt and I tell you right at eight thirty when the market opened up it started to bring some strength and that that like you said we kind of expected to see in the overnight train\nYeah absolutely you know you come in here during the day section then and you know obviously we've got all our friends or a near part of the world and north you know there have an issue is the hardest and it's not just the fact that they can get\nA to a especially soybeans but you know you have some shattering you're having a a sprouting and ah you know just a lot of problems that nobody ever wants to see especially when they've gotten a little taste of what kind of harm\nThat they've got out there to to get after and then they can't go get it and that's that's just a helpless feeling and it's not good for not good for supply by any means\nRight right so tell me about harvest down there in Illinois how much if you got done\nYou know we are we're we're we're finished other than a replant beans or we've been super fortunate I hate to Haiti even I'm probably get\nSome hate tweets are written than we think whether I mean really good weather than\nVery fortunate ah you know look or corn is awfully good a lively and twenty fourteen probably a little bit better\nA better soybeans were really the stalwart for us I mean we we've never had beans or in most guys in this area um of central the more you talk to the same types of ... you know we're hearing guys having a\nHundred bushel means uh where you had several years of corn or you know so corner after corn after corn and then hey they throw beans on there and twenty Eighteen hundred bushel deans but\nYou know you're you hear some nineties and a lotta eighties and or you know a lot of seventies so awfully good being crop in this part of the world\nI tell you what hunter Bush will beans will Penn so long day\nYeah you can have a hundred Bush will beans or you know I mean stop and think about it you know ah that's eighty two bucks maker or this year [laughter] and ... bucks I mean uh I Know we probably ah based upon some of the rhetoric you know we probably don't have\nAnything after that initial payment achieve any Christmas you know a guy with a with a huge field I mean that's quite a quite a boost that they weren't really expecting and anybody who was a a look at the head and a book at nine fifty ten ... are really going to hit a home run there\nYeah yeah no doubt no doubt about that okay let's talk crime progress for the country train expectations I think I saw that their forty percent on both corn and soybeans for harvest or you like those numbers\n[noise] yeah I mean I think that's maybe pushing it the thing is is that the areas that really got I got after it and was able to get a lot done early some of those areas are starting to get done whereas you talked to folks ah you know like I said in your part of the world or\nA endorsed you know that Scott eighty percent left to go I mean that's a pretty common theme or with the folks that I've talked to an island Nebraska\nAnd the Dakotas uh hearing a lot of folks talking about having three quarters their crop wiped out in the field so it'll be very interesting to see you know regionally speaking it's certainly a huge disparity\nBetween one reach into the next but a a forty percent probably about as much as I Would think that we would come out with your this week\nYeah yeah so are you more concerned about the soybeans or the corn\nThat's left out in the ... you know if you talk to a typical producer they're going to tell you when the beans are ready I'm going to go get them\nOr you know the corn can learn to uh be less staying in the field and this year I think it's you know you're hearing a lot of folks and man that uh that that corn plant put us on a\nEnergy into that a year and uh we don't have much stock left and so I Know there's a lot of concern there is so large corn out there so to be perfectly honest with you I don't know that it's a ... at this stage of the game and every year in the middle of October it's pretty tough to say that you just want to let the corn stand but I Do think that if I was sitting here October the fifteenth and\nBoth ready to go I Do I Do catch the Danes quick as I could ah but yeah I'm a little more concerned you know whenever you start to get a lot of shattered loss and\nAh folks talking about beans are on you know sprouting ah that's just not something that you want to hear we've already heard about enough damage your shoes or soybeans way it is so we certainly don't want to throw a whole lot more and I've had people say well we're not going to be friendly but typically damage soybeans aren't currently are\nDue to the way it affects crash margins and you know getting into the system and working his way back down to the producer\nRight yeah exactly okay USDA last week Matt but the national average corn meal that a hundred and eighty point seven\nBushels per acre you liking that number or do you think maybe that we pulled it back\nA six tenths of a bushel from September\nDid that started down trend or do we hold real close to that one eighty and a half one eighty one\nYou know as you know I mean you come out with this huge increase in September typically we don't we don't scaled back in October it's kind of rare uh so I was a little bit surprised but I wasn't one that was clamoring for much higher corn you by any means now I Will tell you\nI thought that the bean increase might be a little more yet but as far as the corn going down I wasn't surprised that they would be status quo or a little bit under but I was surprised that they scaled it back as much as they did now that being said I think with some of the other issues\nThat we have a you know the concern ourselves with uh in the areas we've already talked about it it's a reasonable to think that we put the you know that we've definitely seen the high and I think we only moved lower from here and I don't know it it's going to be substantially lower just a big corn crop\nUh I don't think we get under one eighty but I can certainly see a scaling back a little bit more\nAll right and then when you throw on top of Dave like Jack was talking about you know he's he's like the story and corn because the demand picture that we've got right now but if we can pull that yelled back a little bit keep our demand strong maybe we could keep this thing pushed into the upside\nWell you know it wasn't a week ago people were thrown around a lot of two billion bushels carry out you know for the U.S and now you're sitting right back at one point oh eight one three you know that it's not like we're going to run out of the corn or any time soon but at the same time the demand is awfully good and then to add to that I think the moral glue writing the or\nA bullish factor for me is uh whenever I look at world stocks yes we are not as tight as what we were a couple of months ago talking to a one fifty nine point three is Seventy million metric tons of smaller than to your marketing years ago yeah I mean a two year draw down I guess you'd actually be one year ago from the day but\nUh you look at soybeans at one ten and so I mean that's a pretty interesting uh thing when you look at the two of those corner at one fifty nine point three on world stocks and soybeans that worn thin\nThat was suggested neither the corn especially when you look at stocks to use corns is definitely a significantly tired and was soybeans whenever we were looking at that particular ratio and I think that lends a bus to know there's gotta be some support in this market for the corner the very least probably way\nWhenever we were looking at that particular ratio and I think that lends to know there's gotta be some support in this market for corn on the very least probably a little bit of excitement ahead\nOkay All right so then we take a look the structure that we've got in this market we got the deeds today at three Seventy eight and a quarter you get out to the July it for two and a quarter or what does that mean as far as how you want a structure you're you're a pricing strategy on corn right now\nWell you know the thing for me you're a lot of different ways to look at this but for instance where whenever I'm looking at this from a producers perspective it's got corn in the band\nYou know while I think that there might be a little bit of excitement a moving ahead I'm not saying I'm while the Bush Gore but at the same time I don't mind locked in the end\nYou know that's not who carried by any stretch the imagination but there's nothing wrong with a law along with walking him for two on a quarterly basis to board member we're looking at historically wide basis is in a lot of places in the U.S and so\nUh is based is going to get better from here forward yeah believe that they will I mean typically we used to do so\nAnd so if if I got corn and the bend then I'm going to uh do the same thing yeah later does so there's going to go out they're going to sell the carry on the market now you pick your poison but uh I don't mind selling for two and a quarter of July corn doesn't mean I got to hold a toga and I'm just simply walk and in that price bases the border as soon as the basis comes back to me\nI'm going to be a you know bringing the player they register\nYeah so you want to use a straight to a hedging futures rather than an H U H E A. and locking your delivery\nTo me I think you can go either way but I like going with a straight head you know I Know some people say well gee so I'm worried about margin goals is to I mean the only thing we have to worry about\nA ... in in essence what was what we're trying to accomplish as we're just simply waiting on the base to get better I've got to pay you\nTen thousand dollar margin call on the basis improves twenty five cents between down when I sell doesn't matter I'm going to take that margin call plus twenty cents a bushel times or twenty five cents a bushel times every ... cells so personally I I I prefer a straight edge\nYup yup yeah hey I don't mind that strategy you know at ten seconds do you buy call above it\nAnd I mean that's close personal preference but I don't know that we have to get to that to me is they just\nGot ya got ya it's all about the basis I Love it for talking with Matt Bennett Bennett consulting we're going to go through the same process that we just gave her car we're going to do that for the right here on a TV [noise]\nNo matter what you do you're always raising the bar trying to do better than ever knew Laurel fungicides for corn and soybeans and help you get the edge you're looking for\n[noise] you know I thought that all along I guess the ... the what I felt like earlier last week trying showed up at the field I Know you guys felt bad for me that I had to put up with her for that day but she showed up to the field and\nI wanted to know what I thought the national being you would be and I said I thought they could get up to fifty four now\nI Will tell you I was wrong as far as the report goes in October and I'm finding admitting that as we sit today\nA given the weather and given what's going on west of the river I Can't imagine that we're going to go up from the October ... I mean personally\nI have to reverse course a little bit\nI don't I don't think that we can go up from the October estimate especially given given the weather I think it's it stands to reason that in that part of the world or there's no question some yield is going to be lost or that was not factored in as of October British But this report\nRight so we have to in my opinion we have to lend credence to that uh I personally believe that we're going to have lower I think we've seen the highest ... year\nOkay All right uh now let's go down to South America and talk about the developing supply situation down there what do you uh what are you hearing and it it sounds like they've got plenty of water in in southern Brazil and and in parts of arts and pain and not everywhere but\nPlenty of water and then some timely rains up up north is what I understand\nWell whenever you get in any situation where they can or a plan to crops or if you push too far right now you get farther north as or you're going to see more of that but uh if you push cleaning\nPlant to crops or if you push too far uh now you get farther north us or you're going to see more of that but uh if you push cleaning back too far it's certainly going to cause the same concerns we had a year ago which is how late is that for your crowd going to get put in the ground\nAnd so who knows if we get farther north whether issues is certainly going to be an issue but uh obviously anytime we push Brazil back it's going to be very closely watched her current estimates you know for a hundred and twenty million metric tons of crop\nObviously they're going to plant a lot of soybeans when it gets going to be able to Thirteen year in a row more soybean acres is what the projections or\nA I think we have to keep a close eye on it you can certainly get into the market\nThey think the market also understand that it it sure does seem like a a Brazil has been able to navigate some leather issues\nIn the past and still come to the table with an awfully big or a supply of soybeans which uh you know I personally can't imagine that they're going to uh uh be drawn down substantially uh\nEspecially given some the acreage a projections that I've seen\nYeah you know it is an interesting dynamic South America right now because we continue to hear that they're basically out of ex portable supply of soybeans\nUh it it seems to me that if they want to keep crushing beans Matt and improve their crushed margins there is a source for those beans up here that they could improve their crushed margins on right\nRight and they're pretty cheap and you know obviously Argentina's bought some beans or\nYou know I think that there's going to be more beings to be purchased I mean they don't want to burn up their supply they want to keep a whole crop on hand if they can and so you know you look at the Brazilians I mean the talked about a binds us beans who knows how many beans they might end up wanting to buy but\nI mean simple mathematics for me would tell me why not by send us beans and then resell them I mean whether you're talking Brazil you're talking Taiwan there's people out there that can make ... make money off buying us beans that Chinese\nMight say that they really don't want us beans but you know as well as idea we can make this a shell game pretty easily you know Chinese can buy cheap beans in some way shape or form they're gonna do it\nYeah absolutely okay let's look forward to twenty Nineteen what's that crop next looked like\nWell that's a great question and we've been talking to produce was about that are actually more than what some people might say but uh whenever I look at the same record for oh seven for all eight I mean a boy you know a year ago people were wanting to see turned ... we didn't see these above four dollar prices at this time of the year last year\nA decision making time ah to me I think it's a no brainer when we look at budgets for most producers now\nYou know I've had guys say well gee shop had Seventy five Bush will be three years in a row I'm going to put Seventy five or eighty and my uh you know and that makes things a little bit more complicated for a while I don't want to do something like that I'm going to take a five year average at both of my ills accordion beans plug this crisis and almost every a budget that we've looked at\nIt sure looks a corn or could pick up some acres now how many acres you're going to pick up is anybody's guess because you know they're still gonna or they're still going to be some tightness on a on a on money out there but\nPersonally I have to think that we are going to pick up at least four or five million acres of corn I just think that there's going to be in the cards and I think that this was the right time of year\nTo see a healthy corn price so if we do see might show up with new from here the producers making decisions on corn acreage based upon a prize why why don't we do something about price you\nKnow let's do a little something to hit so hard riskier because\nChip what's gonna happen if you have Ninety five million at the beans or going next year yeah they're going to be four dollar ...
