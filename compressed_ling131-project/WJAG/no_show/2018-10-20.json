the rest of the [noise]\nWell\nThe last two weeks they've shown ... force in five exactly I mean the heavily the fourth quarter for whatever reason they don't know how to drive the clock so it's almost like having a leading the fourth quarter is the worst thing possible so they play in the end of the of Iowa Iowa I mean right now it with me in Iran is a big rubber game for us again next week wears it up and say\nUm Michigan they'll have Wisconsin I mean\nIf they if they don't know how to run out the clock and had a had to play with a lead then they're not going to win another game and unfortunately law suits showing they don't know how to do that so\nThey could lose their again theoretically trace make the case that in a few weeks we'll be talking on the show about World Series champion walkie brewers like I said when\nThe the postseason for ... like the first one of those things that came in red hot we they want eight straight I'm going into the wild card game uh with the cubs or after the ball for him to come so they come in in the post is red hot they say that they struck right to the Rockies\nAnd obviously if they can get through these next two games at home but they have their best starting pitchers lined up and started weighed my late tonight they can rather met them from the home crowd that in one of those things it's been hot\nAnd on streets in one

and whatever's good for the show is good for me to read it began I Hope you get crazy kids make it\nHas undertaken one of the best podcasts out there is the official Lakers pockets will tell you about it here in a second you can find over on podcast once the official Lakers podcast is the name of the park as\nAn errand is now in bed with that Lakers organization he's crushing it he's killing it he rides on the team plane and he has now joined me on the show he is big time and I love them and I love that he's here Mr large ... how's life buddy\nWell I think I'm done with his interview I've nothing left that I I think I should just leave it at that introduction that you'd be stowed upon me and and call it good I don't know if I can do any better than that\nWell I Would let you slide out of here but we don't get in the Lakers menu I don't want to talk with Iran and Portland I Love to use that does that on Twitter\nOn Aaron large school and again if you're a ... if you're a Lakers fan or a ... to like the NBA follow airing on Twitter at Aaron large civil air and by the way they got to help me train when I played for Kevin fingers\nBasketball nothing I Believe right it was yeah it was it was\nThe anniversary just passed recently I Know you pull that up on YouTube or the or at least\nEither very kindly tweeted out me destroying this young guy who talks smack for a year on the board on my former show yes\nBut the way that you intentionally happy on just that the Dodgers game is starting so that nobody Los Angeles would listen to me\nNo people well I did it because I Need to pull some audience from LA and you're the one guy one guy you're the one guy ... what did you are so you're on that you're on the team plane you're on the liberal I'm playing ... without the menu looks amazing they don't want all of it I'm a glut and what did you go with\nA on a flight back uh I sent out a little a little story my Instagram\nA because we didn't leave we can get out Portland until I Would probably took off at about twelve forty five I guess this morning I'm at so I asked everybody if I send out the menu or I'd like Twitter and also I used to grab and asked for opinions whether I should eat or sleep\nA and the prevailing wisdom would eat so I went we eat and I had a a kind of like a reply a steak with brown butter and I and I like a potato twice baked potato tart it was a delicious\nAir and they're still living the dream so what Aaron Iran you've been doing the official Lakers podcast for a little bit now it's really great you were on the team play a few times last year ... Ron\nObviously the brown was on the plane was you going to Portland for his first game as a Laker can you give us a sense of what that felt like from the inside with LeBron James official ... as a Laker on the way to a game that actually counts\nYeah you know it was it was\nFunny strange kind of um because it seemed at times kind of overwhelming a good example when we pulled up a\nYou know as you know bill once you you fly in to a place kind of adjacent to the airport everywhere and then there's buses that take take the team and reverse the team to the hotel and there were two hundred people outside of our hotel in Portland when when we got there\nAnd my first thought was man this is like it's it's a circuit because it was it is a circus\nUm but I think it's for for a Lakers fans it's different but for people around the team it's different but not to the degree that we would expect because remember build there was all the hype surrounding lung so early in his rookie year last year so\nIt's not the same degree but there was a little bit of preparation for the kind of media circus that comes along with very high profile NBA guy however LeBron is different\nTalking to our large will hear on the show aired I I started the show just reminiscing about my first time covering the bar on his first game is member the heat he lost\nDifferent targeting are ... you're on the show aired I I started the show just reminiscing about my first time covering the brawn\nHis first game as a member of the heat he lost that game we all know we went back to Cleveland for a second act there he lost that game he lost his first game ever in the NBA and obviously the Lakers last last night it seems so obvious that it's an overreaction from people to\nTake last night's single game and suppose that it indicates something about this season but I saw a lot of it was among the team I mean did they have a sense of proportion and they have a sense of understanding had socks we didn't want to lose his game but it's game one we're fine or cause this happens all the bronze sometimes it depends on the group\nOr one right we're a little panic just because of the weight of having them run around you is different\nAh you know I think the team takes its its cues kind of emotional cues from LeBron and so they're going to kind of just a react to situation the way that LeBron reacts to situations and he has been telling us in the media those of us around the team\nOr told us on our podcast on on media day\nThat this is the process and you got to be patient and that's hard for people so I think ... is not surprised about it also uh eight of the first eleven including last night's lost to Portland but eight of the first eleven game ... playoff team last year seven or the west and then they and then the Lakers play Toronto\nSo I think Ron this didn't shock him and while we kind of expected it to be somber\nOr going back on the buses in the locker room and on the plane\nLook Ron wasn't in a bad mood particularly so I think a lot of the guy especially because a lot of the guys are you know really young guys a lot of the guys playing a lot of minutes are young guys that are looking up till abroad to trying to kind of take their cues their emotional cute so I don't think LeBron didn't seem particularly phase and and so I don't think the rest of the guys were particularly either\nAaron what's your assessment of the shooters and and the three points shooting particular on his Lakers team surrounding LeBron James\n[noise] well I think it's interesting right because a lot of the questions positive assumption that negative assumptions going into the year style of play a roster construction all those things we kinda started we didn't get answers but we got\nSort of an instructive pieces to that um the Lakers did play fast a hundred and Seventeen pay which you know with foreign away lead the league if it was if it was kept up\nSo that worked one of the questions as you said was is the three ... and that was the question everybody at\nMost LeBron rosters throughout history have always had these great shooters and uh the Lakers don't have guys without track record of shooting I think it's better than it gets credit for the first shooting but it was a question mark going into the year when you start over fifty for three\nThat's going to kind of put a microscope on that so I think more concerning to beat them to shooting because the Lakers they don't need to be a great shooting team or they just kind of need to be adequate and I think they have the guy to be adequate especially because life gets easier with ...\nUh I think the bigger concern is is the defense frankly uh so I Would more my focus would be\nA on the events I I don't care how fast you play a hundred and Seventeen as I said before it's fast paced\nBut you can't give up a hundred and twenty eight to anybody I don't care if it's Dame and the guy who didn't play that well ... was going nuts I I mean I doesn't matter who did you can't give up on her ...\nAir marshal here on the show the hosted the official Lakers podcast and one of my absolute favorite people on the face of the owners are so at some airlines talking about that that defensive and again it's game on it it's a process last year the Lakers weren't terrible ... they got what they were eleven or twelve and defensive position to\nTwelve last year after being between twenty eight and thirty is in the league the previous four years\nMine is obviously LeBron James what is the ceiling for this team defensively and it'll take some time but when they figure out who they are and how they're gonna planes you know LeBron's part of the group\nYou know I think it's probably somewhere around last year um I think that the defense improved the defense of improvement last year was kind of based on two things one\nFrankly the defense of personnel was better last year than it is this year a Julius Randall and Brooke Lopez are both kind of in my opinion underrated defenders you have to play more of a conservative style with Brooke but\nI'm under an underrated defender and I I think that was part of it I think the other part of it was a loop instilled in the Lakers you're not going to win unless you play hard and you compete every night on defense\nThere's more talent on this team so they may not it may be a process and getting them to play as hard as they played last year especially defensively but I don't think we know\nYet Lukas said that they want to switch everything\nUm and as you saw which then with the rocket last year that the process LeBron talks about everything being a process and not being noble but that's a process to because that's switching defense requires trust you have to know what the other guy's going to do you have to trust who's going to be in the right spot you communicate that\nAnd the Lakers have a bunch of new guys and a bunch of young guys so I don't think offensively or defensive you that trust is built in yet\nSo they're gonna ... if they're going to rely on that switching scheme it's going to look a lot different February January February march than it does now but to answer your question I think the feeling is probably somewhere around last year you know depending on LeBron's effort level and the regular season hopefully he has a little bit less of a burden to carry offensively so\nHe can or add more to the events lately has been the last few years if ... gauge defensively Enron is on Ron does engage defensively\n[noise] you know maybe nine ten somewhere in there\nAre still here on the show with me the runner CBS Sports radio Aaron I Love ...

know it\nAll right and speaking of a demoralizing and crushing spirits Josh Rosen was really bad yesterday it's still early in his career you I mean your your job is to protect the quarter back over the course of your career what if anything can we read from a young kid be having a really rough game early in his first season\nWhen you got to look at their team around and you have to look at the rest of the team around him\nAnd he's together you know what they need to work on of course we thought they would have a dynamic running game with Johnson coming back so that would take some pressure off of them but I mean the defenses and making it any ... of course you got pets you just phenomenal\nBut you know not having the latest Campbell for the second year the pretty much the leader of that the fed no longer you have the honey badger so he says around them larger zero it was amazing but he's\nFacing the clock or he's running from the clock father time is coming\nSo it's hard to make an assessment on his talent what you want to take from this year\nIt depending on how he finishes it out if how it continues to compete bright how if we get down and he starts trend backwards in terms of progression\nThen now you have a problem but if he can continue to work on the things that he had trouble with each game then that promise you could see if we had our number ... interceptions is what you look how that turned out for\nThat point we met rather than a brother his first two games first game to his career six interceptions and a formal that was recovered by the wrong wrong by the wrong side of it happens he and I am ... leads me to this Hebrew Islam here on the show when we come offering guy veteran rookie or whatever and obviously didn't happen for Rosen yesterday\nWhat is the mood like in the huddle means the guys still protect these confidence can you tell these not to guys give up let's give us some insight into the huddle when things started to go really badly for a quarterback\nOr you can see some of the vote the loss of and ... and and confidence or when a young quarterback struggle now remember Michael Vick was refused I came in midway through the season\nAnd he didn't fully have a grasp on the complexity of off as you've gotta remember often for ... or you know upwards of\nFour or five hundred place right like literally every play has three or four different variation that can happen depending on what the French are going to get so having those nuances and and and the complexity and understanding of an NFL often\nRight off the back is difficult for any quarterback or at any level now some offered the coordinator from coast to try to simplify it we simplified it for Michael Vick but sometimes when he made the wrong reasons or he couldn't get to play out in the ... it was up the veteran presence is\nIn that are in that huddle license Harris masses and the Bob ... pills to help guide him and to help because confidence up\nEven slum here on the show can new now I I Want your perspective on this ... from Kim Newton said the other day it was really looking forward to ... and come back\n'cause his tied in helps him with play calling you were in those hurdles what is the right\nAssessment judgment nonjudgmental perspective or whatever it is on here and a veteran quarterback who's one of them BP say I can't wait to my talents Becky help to the play calling\nUm but I I mean I don't know if he met per se with the lake calling a cab who'd been in and the league long enough to understand him he should have a graph on the place I think he probably meant it helped him\nWhen he's in the thick of it and the heat of uplift is coming up pressure coming he knows he can rely on ... and they have a chemistry together much like most quarterbacks in there tight in you lived in ... when\nYou look at John Elway Senate shark these guys you get um a as Tony ... gates and full of rivers\nHide ins are there could be a security blanket when all else fails I Know he's your hand it I Know he can get the yard and I know I can trust them to be where he needs to be\nAnd you can see\nTime there were like that you have gone out and you asked a Tom Brady you know X number of the ... not only is he a physical specimen but he relies on if he'll he'll roll your if he's double covered because he has that truck or a good example of not

you're looking at Rogers and you look at demographic\nOr their last game we saw them not on the same page and Roger ... grams of fat in his own he kept vote in a little bit\nA little off argue with that type of connecting chemistry is important when he says he helped with the place is literally like if I get myself in trouble or if I Want this for sure for now I Know I can trust them I'll know he'll be in the fight he needs to be\n... have you seen enough yet\nFrom Patrick my homes to believe that this is a guy who's going to be great for a long time or is it still doesn't\nKnow it's not so um\nYou look at how he formed in ... ah I Know they lost that game but if they had any effect it would have been a different story and his ability to never see\nMy face no matter what's going on in the case you have to drive this thing down labor for for its course that's how he did that it seems like ... and his mobility though its accuracy when he's on the run\nYou can't coach that like you can't take the quarterback and make them be able to do that but when you look at those erasures have built the\nRight Ben Roethlisberger has those gifts\nTo be extremely accurate on the run and we saw that from those who quarterbacks I just mentioned who are hall of famers we saw that early on in their career but when you look at a person like my home\nHis samples rise has been big enough he's done things and in game this year so far for you to say he's well on his way being one of the top if not the top quarter back in the league and the next five years\nTalking to even salon here on the show he already got you know these guys these these ... guys who work on the show already pointed out I got your kids wrong earlier so I might get this wrong too but if memory serves where you're born in

I think that\nI mean\nIt's not the craziest thing I've ever heard because they are all going to be in ...\nCity or another in a position to have a shot at it I think they are the red Sox are you know they're going to win the world series and then\nI think that uh because that's what I you know now that I've seen them just kick everyone's ass I'm given more than ever does not matter who wins vis a an algae as they are going to get there as bait and then the patriots um\nYou know I changed now like usual garb awry and I've been on this or that they turn it on and and you know October and then they go and and I think that we're seeing that now or no matter what mom's dead on Sunday night it still didn't matter biggest damn ready to get the ball lap any wins so if you do not have\nA the ball lashed against the New England patriots you're going to lose if he had the ... or do manage lab or a minute twenty or even forty five seconds I Believe in forty five seconds Tom Brady can move the ball down deal did he do it in the super bowl do he had like twenty seconds then he moved it up to build an eye on Mary\nSo this guy is the most dangerous human being on a planet\nAh I think he could probably be Lewis Hamilton and a formula one race\nOr he's ... he's just a you know God's Gift to the world and I didn't kill or be in it I think they're going to be in you know uh obviously the division of semi and if they win at the title game again but like twelve straight years or whatever it is and then they go back to the super bowl I'm going to shoot\nA but it's a ... look to me uh they look to be you know\nIt is and then if they go back to the super bowl I'm going to shoot\nA but if uh the Celtics I think look to me\nUh they look to be you know eastern conference finalists in basketball here at the jump but a stranger things have happened I think you know all these people guaranteeing the Celtics are gonna be in the finals and then it's ... some people think they're going to win at all\nUh and there's a lot of people betting on I'm doing it all in Vegas\nAnd in Jersey which is the only two bases on the uh on earth that matter now when it comes to sports betting I think that ah\nYou know they I don't think they're going to win it I really don't I I think that ... I I you know I saw that I get there has to be and I you know uh I I thought they look good and and the guard and the other night\nAgainst Philly but I think Philly Toronto in our dog and I you know eat each other and you know a stranger things have happened where you lose a seven game series so I think that they're the favorites to go to the finals but even if they go to the finals which I think it'd be very impressive I I don't think they're beating\nThe warriors I Do not believe\nThat the Celtics are better than the warriors in fact uh I don't even think they are close I really don't so but that would be that would be insane if if all of your teams uh went to championship games and I guess there is a a probability that it could happen because they're all\nYou know obviously one's already there and then you know the other two days after a play it out and see if they get there but good luck\n[noise] we'll see if that happens it just sounds too perfect for me you know what I mean\nThat this story book day you're talking about is just to perfect the debt every game in Boston wins championships in the same season but I've seen it before with two teams the pirates in Steelers are and you know uh they've done it um I'll never forget Seventy nine or so\nAs long as I live I'll never forget that year that was the craziest thing ever to see him both winning I no one ever thought the pirates and when the world series right how about this they beat the Orioles right and they beat him in Seventy one the same team\nThey want it in both ears in the seventies against the Orioles\nAnd if you think back to it they all at both teams at all the pitchers right they add like candle area\nAnd all these guys and then they are to Colby closing and then uh wasn't Palmer on that team these are all the best pitchers in baseball at the time that's why they were and if you go back to Seventy one at every blasted all these guys bitch in great\nUm so\nIt's happened before it's not like I Do they get out and I I Do think Boston is going to win the world series at this point like tonight I'll say that and a fairly confidently and I'm sure that the patients have on edge\nThe best time to get to the super bowl and then a but in Boston to the NBA Finals but I don't think they're all winning it we'll see we'll see if they if they can pull it off ... do you believe that that they can pull

not there right now it's got him in it it's\nIt's difficult for a team coming off as much hockey as they played last year as emotional is that Ron was\nAh October games against the Panthers in a kind of two thirds full stadium without much juice I'm you know that's not the ideal situation so the cat's gotta gotta figure that out maybe got to get through October and November here and and turn it on at some point um but but for now they're they're looking a little flat especially early in these games\nShe sang like cab this family got to hang over and they're just not like they're so like ... from that that they just don't seem to look like daycare right now when they're going through the motions\nYeah I mean for the ... down four to one you know to the Panthers and at first\nI Hope the actually I didn't think played that badly and they kind of left him out to dry ... got a bunch of second chance go early um you know we kind of ran with the narrative early study that um you know the crush the Bruins on opening night seven or seven nothing\nThey came back the next night against Pittsburgh or with the crazy seven six game they lost in overtime is a really good game or the next week they played Vegas in the rematch with a cup final or look\nGood that night as well so we all thought oh well there's no hanging over their good you're starting to see a creep in here though you're starting to see the uh the emotional level though the leaf looked better than they did last Saturday that kind of used that as\nA measuring stick and I think that's something the cats have to get used to is a\nIs teams are always looked at a good for a decade right seems always pointed that game and say we want to play well against Washington but\nWhen you're the Stanley Cup chance it raises the bar a little bit you saw it and the Toronto game last weekend um you even thought tonight against the Panthers they came ready to play the cat didn't and they got a point out of it but probably we're lucky to even do that\nSo do you think the ah three game western swing to Vancouver and then I you know I haven't been in Calgary Alberto help the capital's a little road trip to get them to maybe realize this isn't going to be a joke\nIt could I mean that it it kind of a pivot point because it's that trip can go to ways I've seen the cats have that trip where you know they come out of it with a point or they get shelled a couple of times\nUm they generally play pretty well out there I mean for a lot of the especially the western Canada guys it's a\nIt's a homecoming at the chance for their families to come out and see them play so um I think there'll be All right I think those are winnable games or the ... they'll go out to our Sunday night Vancouver you getting off night that can be troublesome times out there but um I I think\nI think that is a good chance for them to kind of get things back together um and you know that's not an easy road trip by any means but I think they can come out of that one with three points so they'll feel pretty good about it and uh and feel are going into November So\nAre you surprised that during the first game really in a the nation's capital to finally really you know do anything huge that they're the ones that won a championship and not the\nReally in a the nation's capital to finally really you know do anything huge that they're the ones that won a championship and not the a match or the Redskins I mean the Redskins won Super Bowls but it's been a long time\nIt was a was a twenty five years Scott without without a title here in DC I mean people were it wasn't just that they didn't win either it was that the cats were always almost always good other than a a couple of your bad stretch when they won the lottery and got Ovechkin\nCatherine it every year and then certainly with ... and they came you know they were a second round seem every year they always seem to lose to the penguins\nYou know the Redskins will differences their glory days you know they they throw a parade when they make the playoffs\nThe cat's it wasn't like that to cast it was always Stanley Cup or bust the last ten years and and they finally broke through so I wasn't I was surprised I guess it took them that long I wasn't surprised they were the team that did it um and then the ... were a similar story where they just\nThe play offs just weren't kind to them they're they're almost a new caps at this point where they I think they won for division titles is twenty twelve and um have had a couple of other disappointing seasons and haven't even want a playoff series so you know the the the ... now that kind of has the the fan Hanks with them the cats at this point or are playing with house money\nUh Brian McNally senior writer for the sports capital in DC what if I was talking about the Redskins now are on this game that they have a FedEx with their division rival Dallas Cowboys coming in on um Sunday so the Redskins\nOr they got some ... Jamison Crowder Richardson Thompson Peter ... back field they're receivers all\nAre in doubt I mean at least a downpour questionable all of those guys what's the problem\nYeah this is not a good situation for them Scott I'm In a wide receiver especially you know you're trying to get the passing game going with Alex Smith here in his first year it's been a little hit or miss 'em you know to not have to not have docks and Richardson's been\nAppalled Richard ... you know Richard send the guy that that actually has been ... reasonably productive here early in the season and he's playing through a shoulder injury that probably will not be healed until the season's over and maybe he gets a some surgery done he's got a bad knee to\nThat's not a good situation that had to bring Michael Floyd in off the street just to\nJust to kind of have an extra veteran body a Josh toxin has missed some time you missed the saints game\nOr with a with a heel injury that's plagued him before it got it pretty much his whole career fulltime in Washington at this point\nUh in Crowder is the is the really bad when I saw him walking around the locker room or two days ago not walking around the locker and he was actually on a scooter with his right ankle in a booth so\nYou know it doesn't bode well he's doubtful the play you know then then you're down a lot of weapons and you're you're Alex Smith what are you guys got Vernon Davidson Jordan read 'em and you hope that Adrian Peterson is a and Chris Thompson should should be back he's obviously a weapon for them but\nAdrian Peterson is a big one I mean he's a he's been obese for them early this year and a\nGuy that I I Would expect Scott that he'll play he'd be popped his shoulder back into place in the\nIn the saints game he's a tough dude I'm and I I think he'll he'll play this weekend and be a reasonably effective against the cowboys but he's certainly in some pain as well\nThey got everything Quinn Dunbar a ... but I got to ask you about that deep and swearing and a norm interests cocky is any do guys in the NFL yet I they're always involved in something on the field with talking smack to somebody or getting into you know back and forth and everything\nDo you like to add about 'em or do you think they do too much of that and and don't back it up\nA you know I I think that's a that's a fair criticism to say they they don't necessarily back it up and I you know Josh is being paid like a a number one corner and there are some around the legal question if he if he is that any more he's obviously not playing in the same system didn't Carolina where it was more zone based and\nYou know based on anticipation and reads in breaking on the ball and all that um you know it's not not quite the same I thought he was pretty good his first year here he's he's been up and down a little bit I'm not saying it's a ... player but you know he's he's not maybe the Seventy five million dollar guy that that they were\nHoping they would get um he's still good enough to to he's better than what they've got um at least at the time when they signed him up quitting Dunbar good young guy who's coming up and I think pretty talented football player that they've\nDeveloped and and done a good job with your rights wearing ... the same way that was said he was a black hole for them Scott releasing Sean Taylor passed away a over a decade ago and so short swearing just brought some talent and some swagger to that spot\nI'm but they've got some communication issues on the back and they've been burned a couple of times by Aaron Rodgers by Drew Brees on just easy kind of mental breakdown so long touchdown passes\nNorth of\nYour local volunteer fire department routinely answers the call whether it be a fire traffic accident or a cat stuck in a tree but because of declined and memberships departments have become understaffed\nYour local volunteer fire department desperately need you can you direct traffic it's all a smoke alarm help at a fundraiser no matter what skills you have you can make a difference you don't have to fight fire to be a volunteer and will you answer the call for more information on how you can help visits a volunteer firefighter alliance have support the F.

the series did they can handle it in game seven\nI think tomorrow is going to be a really I'm kinda torn I I think that the game could be like one nothing and I think the game could be Thirteen twelve like that's\nHonestly where I'm at tomorrow night I ... that's how crazy I think the game could be I have no idea what how these two teams use their pictures and how long ago and and they have the officers to break out I could see either type of game tomorrow night\nIn this situation where the Dodgers are getting spanked by five runs possibly more heroin\nIf you'd see either type of game tomorrow night\nSo in this situation where the Dodgers are getting spanked by five runs possibly more here when the stock is that these already at an army I double do you think that um this affects the Dodgers in any capacity at all losing tonight or they just wash it off and start fresh\nThese guys have been here so much over the last few years they're not going to have a problem tomorrow night just showing up and playing a game they're not\nWow mommy are you buying that do you think this will affect the Dodgers at all\nI don't think so because they know they go in there it's not like the urban dominated also I'm a bit of Milwaukee in order to get a winner they know they're gonna have to pitch and when they need to\nThey just haven't done it on this game or the other wild game one but I think there are so called them like you said this seem been there through some Romeo don't see us two years ... years possibly in the world series they know what they're doing there are parts players this isn't the scribe routine but you're just happy to be there which was the brewers are\nVery much on but even even the brewers are some guys that are on the big names but it's still but in this position before because like who stock is that or you know been on other teams or been in the world series and know how to win\nSo any way or the bottom line is is is that now there's no ... a cushion for losing so the game that they had to play around with was tonight and they are going to lose this game it would appear to me unless they have some miraculous rally in the ninth\nWhich could happen but I don't think it will and then or now they have no room for error tomorrow night neither team has room for error and\nDoes this benefit Garber either Red Sox in any capacity at all between ah it would it would start at Fenway Tuesday either way so they would play Saturday and then have to go to Boston Sunday\nYeah I don't think that it makes any difference today or tomorrow they're starting Tuesday no matter what either way after the game there ... there\nHas to do it on Sunday and Monday off it's it's no no difference for me All right\nSo anyway I'm watching airborne they're

going at it it would be the Steelers and ravens for me some people would say it's Pittsburg Cleveland because it's been going on forever but Pittsburgh is\nFor the most part I Would think own match series but\nAs far as your question or are we supposed to believe in the ravens or not I would say yes\nUm I have not seen a ... eleven facts in a football game now blame the titans are fenced in line for that that that's something I've never seen so if you pull that off that is in itself a story and and so much respect I was there to me just see a football team dominated another game so\nYou know officially that they're able to have eleven facts on the phone back I never in my life I've seen that in a football game I don't know anyone that has\nSo I Believe in the defense or certainly after I saw that so and I certainly believe in the event after I go to Pittsburgh and kicked the Steelers asked\nOn a Sunday night game twenty six fourteen so I don't know what more you need to uh no they beat the titans twenty one's ... eleven dimes and you'd be good teams you lost in a bank that was it a you lost that around those were two really bad losses for them but they're still\nWith the bangles for first in the division so yes\nI Would believe in the ravens and I know everyone's on uh Drew Brees and the saints in this football game or in charm city I'm not I'm On the ravens\nI don't think it's going to be so easy for the saints uh in Baltimore on Sunday as everybody else does Garber I\nI Do not think it's going to be easy for the saints I Do think that they'll find a way to win the game I'm interested in seeing them a out outside playing a really good team like this because this is the type of game that they might have to play\nWhen we get into January 'cause I'm not sure if they're going to have home field or even have a by or anything like that or even if the when the NFC South they might have to go to a place like Philadelphia\nAh I I Want to see them perform outside

so we don't usually take those games right but when you do have oh pat myself\nOn the back and take my victory lap with that so ah no doubt about it happy about that\nAnd hopefully we get some good picks coming up later college football and then also the NFL as well also joining us as the ... the bears this week we'll talk they've Andrew's about that also joining us to for forty eight and eastern one forty and Pacific\nThe cowboys and the Redskins play this weekend on Sunday so we'll talk to a red skins tight end a man that has been around the league for a long time with San Francisco that won the super bowl with the Denver Broncos now is with the Redskins in his third year for his hometown team\nVernon Davis will join us so we'll talk the Vernon Davis says\nThe Redskins take care of the Panthers and I'm Still trying to figure out what the Redskins are this year and they keep on vacillating good team batting good team bad team\nBut they try to get another when and they'll have Dallas come into town this upcoming weekend\nSo a lot to do but we're reduced start of course I'm also sprinkling some MBA as well but\nWe do a start with the baseball playoffs\nAle cs already in the books the Boston Red Sox and impressive fashion they take care of the Houston Astros and the red Sox are going back\nTo the world series there for the world series of parents since two thousand and four eighty six years for them to break the curse and one of the world series and they went to two thousand and four\nTo down to the seven two thousand and Thirteen and have a chance to do so to cap off what was that one hundred and eight regular season when year for the Boston Red Sox so just looking at dominance there hasn't been with the same manager it's been four different managers\nAre throughout the time or three different managers would Tito what they're able to do two thousand four thousand seven and then two dollars and Thirteen and then uh we have a two thousand eighty now with Alex course so you have three different managers\nAlong the way so all over the board there are some different names obviously are in the early years you had to Johnny Damon you add Manny Ramirez yet page or your car showing now it's a completely different look\nWith what they've been able to do and no more big Papi obviously as well as the poppy was such a big name for them for so many years but now the red Sox team that all start to the outfield and their outfield but the killer bees embed attendee and bats and also Jackie Bradley junior and he didn't have the best regular season already done the post season this year\nHas been remarkable it's been phenomenal\nWith what he was able to do than he was there a else yes MVP pay but if you look at what impresses me the most Boston it's really what they've been able to do on the road in this postseason you're going up against a hundred plus when teams and the Yankees and the Houston Astros and what the Red Sox were able to do\nAgainst the Yankees and then the actress on the road to be five in oh against to really great game it's just stupid good without good it is and the red socks on those five road games games three and four Yankee Stadium and then games three four five\nUp against the Astros and used in ... park they score both those teams\nBy forty to Thirteen I thought it taking two games Yankee Stadium was impressive\nWhen you're tied at one one with the actress is defending champ\nAnd you win games three four and five that just top that and the difference in this series was the ... going on because of the six sending it on and all these games the red Sox scored the Astros Fifteen to seven and give credit to David Price too how about David Price\nNo one could have predicted that David Price would have ... just in Berlin and or\nThe other night\nBut David Price with his future postseason record as a starting pitcher was able to do that and Boston get a bunch of big hits and better than the makes the great catch at the end and the red Sox go on to take\nGet this and for the entire drew never anything hidden absolutely wonderful\nEither one that got away before twenty Nineteen maintenance

C. at it wasn't as long as what people would have thought by those games were good games not all of them\nBut that game for it was great\nAnd it was the game\nFor which there's tremendous it really was [laughter] yeah that really wanted a game for\n... yeah it's a controversial play right in the beginning with a two by\nThen you have the ashes take the lead the red Sox come back\nTo make the big catch\n... tend to make the even bigger catch at the end of the game so you had a which was the reason why I'm not going to knock them healthy\nAnd I bet I tend to make the even bigger catch at the end of the game\nSo you had to watch was the reason why I I'm not going to knock down the U.S is because it was the element of surprise\n... who could have predicted\nThat the Boston Red Sox\nWould've taken three straight games\nAnd used it\nYou would have never thought the Boston Red Sox ... even though they were a hundred and eight games this year we're the one in the Houston game three or four or five they won it and it's it's ridiculous it really is\nI ... you're a huge baseball fan and you were in a brewers which is ridiculous because you're not a Milwaukee Brewers fan you must a hundred and fifty to Yankee games this year and all of a sudden they lose that you're you're on the brewers bandwagon or is this a fashion they manage to wear a hat\nOn because I went to Milwaukee this summer so now you write loved it and I'm not no one cares that you went on a chip on his team that amount of bandwagon fan who do you think of the better match up for the red Sox\nFor the red Sox I think the Dodgers are the better match up I think they they match up better against the red Sox I again I Want to see the brewer there but I think the Dodgers team winds of matching up better and I I think it comes down how is ... gonna be able to come back and he had a hospital didn't last week if you're going to be he has a huge key 'cause\nI Know price when they want to pitch game six though I don't ... rate but\nAre you really trust him to have that again\nWhile I'm really good question so what price could that be the breakthrough where it was the game before where he's throwing in the bullpen and he had to get into the game and then they're celebrating after\nBen intend to make the catch and he's going nuts in the bullpen and it was weird going into that game five I had no reason to feel confident and David Price and you get to I didn't take it to social media like oh my goodness gracious David Price no doubt about it is going to pitch a great game\nBut just the way that this guy was getting lambasted as he shouldn't be there was no object and picking David Price to win the game you\nJust got that feeling in your stomach\nWhere it's very diverse price dismayed zero cents to price out pictures ... or last longer and pitches a better game in Berlin there but I said I like to ... percent every three percent of me just said it\nI don't think that's necessarily fair because I think we as baseball fans we tend to react to what happened immediately and price has not had a good postseason career but\nLet's not forget the he is not look at is one of the top pitchers in the game so he has its in him it's not like the regular season but in the postseason he's been a business and I agree that that's and that's been the story of his entire career but and that's what made the L. C. S.\nEven though it was a short series if there were so many storylines you could take away from that how that ends with David Price put you in the way he did which is fascinating out of a dog in the fight in that one with the Astros and the red Sox I didn't actually you know I picked the red Sox you for the year to go to the world series\nI thought you so much going on in the series started I and the way Boston just quickly took advantage of them on their home turf\nHouston and then what they did in New York after that series is one one Yankees win game too and they take the red Sox take care of the Yankees and the Bronx there was nothing\nThey in a huge statement and I'll I'll keep the same point that I've made going into the policies and the red Sox bullpen does scare me I I don't there's no shut down pieces now here's my question do you guys have been good though that's my question to you what what's your fear level with Kimber because I think if the brewers one gang through their book they have to guide Nicholson they're just so a\nLot of things that kimbro bounces back\nYou have to think that just with what he's been about his career but to get back and he's been this way his whole career but to get back to your price question though because I think it's just more of an interesting question\nPrice I Can't say I'm overly confident with him going into the world series but maybe that's the breakthrough game that doesn't mean he's a dominant postseason pitcher but it starts to\nTurn it around and the floodgates just get open for him or he has the a ha moment now I Know what it takes and the starting role now my team\nGot a victory and I was a big reason because of the big three and I did it up against rural and there may be that gets them just going in the right\nDirection because if you look at price very sensitive with the actors we stop and you know with the whole night incident there's things that you could look at it and you could just last night with David Price and say\nI'm Nick Stephenson and I'm ...

your question game seven of them taking the brewers are just too much both ... and the Dodgers I don't think there are bats are consistent enough to win it\nAnd that same thing with the world series the brewers just poll I posed a different threat compared to the Dodgers the Dodgers do have bigger bat but when it comes to consistency I just don't think the Dodgers could do it against the red Sox especially with their bullpen\nAnd ... to give it up against the red Sox is what you're saying\nI I think the brewers have a better chance um with the consistency with their bats and they're both pit\nBull pen is depicting the bullpen me I mean that when you were a series of ... and also ...\nNow now I I wouldn't pick against the red Sox just goes with the red Sox did the first two rounds it's just it's remarkable to me but\nI I Would have to go the bullpen is what is the real enticing option with the brewers right just with the Dodgers their experience they were there last year\nAnd it's the team that the ad Machado where if he's not spiking guys at first base that's the biggest problem for them but really he ... this is this in either one of these teen that when I'm not saying there's no chance they can but I don't feel great pick in either of these teams but I Would just go with the Dodgers just because\nThey're to me the team that's been there they've done it before at least getting to the world series and if you get to the world series twice in a row hey yeah you could lose both of them are there's no doubt about it but maybe this one will go your way\nNo that's true but then again the brewers also as Kate and most doctors who've been there your\nOwn strip point he's with the royal it better to bronze has been in the league for a long time pay a show in there to not in the world series but he's been in playoffs so it's not like the brewers are just ... ... that are going into it you know what I\nKnow I don't really fair at this though this\nGame coming up later tonight like you were saying\nIf you look at this match up I lean I it's a toss up it's going for his game seven we do that when I we are toward the brewers because of what happened the night before where what they got the bullpen and they still have hater and hate or did not go in the game and so he could go for for three innings\nAnd an haters I mean they got nasty everyone knows he's he's nasty nobody I mean he's on hit of all pretty much\nYeah they did in what game for five but it was he's he's one of these pictures that like he just does not get hit very often this brewers bullpen reminds me of that royals bullpen that made it to the world series\nWhich was started yes it's a good point Bobby appreciate the phone call so we'll see you in the game but the most compelling thing\nTo me going into this game seven is not even the two stars it's one of the state or get into the game and when does she'll get into the game and how long do they go\nAnd can anyone get to them and that's what I think\nWill decide this game seven we go to Chris in Boston next up CBS Sports radio what's up Chris\nSame Zach I'm hey I'm the red Sox outfield but I think was\nNot underrated at all I think it was well spoken for but um I think they're set up quite well for the national league ballparks um especially with their speed and our town although that's going to be tested with ... you know in in the world series um also the red Sox I think the\nMore that they play the ... of the um crap their pants\n... you know in in the world series um also the red Sox I think the more that they play the less of the um crap their pants factor that goes into some of these players like price who just you know just to cure a panic attack on them or they can just see that in ...\nI'm just hoping that some of these guys just you know to take\nDown a little bit yeah temporal I had to think he would bounce back but man he's looked terrible he's nervous on the mound\nIt is a cause for concern but just with the way that he's been as a pitcher throughout his career you have to think of eventually just like with price a bench leads to punch through right\nRight right and as a question for you um there's two different ways of looking at it but who do things better for baseball or the red Sox versus a big market team like LA or is it a smaller market teams like like Boston and Minnesota are giving more hope to ah you know town so\nYeah I Would always go with the two big markets with Boston in LA I think that for baseball they would rather see that but with the brewers if if you get the brewers it's a tremendous store\n'cause the brewers going to the world series you for the store and you want somebody playoffs like yeah I Would have listened to it but to go to the world series before the started no one had the privilege going to the world series\nRight right and I'm Alex corps he never took his foot off the gas constantly on the attack never waited for things that happen totally came out people um the the the Yankees and the Astros were always\nThink of a bad mood that core has made so far in this postseason I really I wanted to move that guy [laughter] what did you say I Want to go to Vegas [laughter]\nSit down at the blackjack table give you some winters no doubt about it there's no doubt about that and he seems like you said in every single bought in

outfield everyone knew bats was and if you didn't have a better ... he was going in this era shame on you but not you know who ... and Jackie Bradley junior\n... during the regular season big ... in a game too with the three R B eyes and neither grand slam as well sketch has been an R B machine in the post season now so the killer bees have been phenomenal but then yes also another good\nPoint when

radio the NBA season is underway and it got me thinking\nStorylines entering this season now I Know if you're listening in your car right now or on serious or on the app or whatever it may be saying that big storylines\nOf the NBA they share come on\nWe all know the story is going to be the Golden State warriors won the championship again\nAnd they they want to lash out at one of the year before that\nHave ... they have staff they have clay stab drain monitor yeah by the way even though he's hurt right now they added a bogus\nCousins the markets ... than the off season ... why the hype up the NBA going into this year\nI'll tell you why even though I don't have a great\nInterest for early on right now just because you are football fully underway with the NFL and college you also got the M O B. postseason\nYeah no doubt about the NBA and hockey to me take a little bit of a seat on on the back burner right now they do but but the NBA\nThe off season always dominate and there was a lot of juicy story lines this off season that yes it does make you raise a few\nYou know may make you raise both your eyebrows and saying okay even like the warriors are going to win the championship this year there's still some storylines and that was proved true last year everyone could talk about and I ...\nYears ago we need to see a little bit different chains you know this and that and that's and that and the products boring it's so predictable brown versus wherever the warriors have\nBut you know what last year's record cities and what's a good regular season so yeah the warriors will win the championship this year\nSomething crazy but there's still a way for the NBA to have a good season there is 'cause you could still have some really good story line entering the postseason or some good storylines it develops throughout the regular season\nSo let's get some of the storylines right now let's start with the\nApprehension Golden State warriors who by the way what might happen\nAnd it wasn't that there was a ... month to take day it was there was a remarkable was detected with ...\nWho was the plan that the tipping is you could say it on the air go ... bank you were watching the news room ... oh my goodness gracious crazy a tip and it wasn't one of the big players or does that worry that the way that you would've designed it up\nFor for it to happen but let's start Golden State warriors you just wonder when that team turns it up\nIs it going to be a year where they go for Seventy something wins or is it going to be one of those years of their okay we'll get in sixty two sixty three sixty four sixty bucks you just wonder when they turn it up and when they go all out for it\nAnd all the I Can't deal with the pending free agency\nAlready got some news going in on that with his brother and everything and and all and all that\nCraziness and the speculation that this could be his last year was the Golden State warriors which I Believe it when I said I'm not going to start to speculate on that but it is something that you look at it and we all know how much the MBA all seasons is dominant so you could ever get\nToo much NBL season talk even this time of the year\nThe next from abroad in LA now what brought it out why what's intriguing to me is\nI don't think that the team but the ... they have right now that wins the brown a championship I don't\nAnd I think there was better alternative than our way to go to for LeBron James if he wanted to one another championship as soon as possible\nWith a lot of younger players right now ... ball crews are\nHard et cetera et cetera et cetera you just want to see that dynamic those gel throughout the year now and the west the two teams that are clearly better right off the top of your head they're going to say words are used to rocket\n... where do the LA Lakers fall in that pecking order in the western conference with now adding LeBron James\nBut where do the LA Lakers fall in that pecking order and the western conference with now adding LeBron James\nAnd as an east coast than and there'll be plenty of LeBron James games\nThat are going to be on that will be a good time but it kind of hit me the other night when you're seeing a tip off at ten Thirty years they used to seeing the broad and with the cabs\nAre the heat and the prime time getting paid eight PM tip off but now when he's out in LA there's good at the babies they have to watch a few of those ten thirty in the way that he threw that dumb down on the roads open things up\nI was pregnant at pretty neat to see as well but LeBron obviously get the dominant sport and get a dominant these storylines and how that situation with LA does play out especially if a bar ball opens up his big mouth and starts talking as well\nSpurs difference first you may know dunk has been retired but no more Tony Parker no more manage noble a an outcry letters the longer there\nSo how will the spurs look this year can they still be a playoff

I think they X factor is going to be interim he's going to be relied upon to be that that\nThat side kicked that LeBron is going to rely on and he's got the tools in settings that we've seen it but it's a matter if you can keep that up for a season and obviously I think who is gonna be next factor and then you got a\nA ball Alonzo he's got to step is game up if not then a ... not going to be hesitant to go to a Rondo who's proven he can still play out of high level when when the ... those those are the main factor is like I said I could see 'em right around fifty if not a little less but\nI think Houston maybe it's going to end up number one at the Golden State probably second and then\nI think I think Utah man look for Utah I think that can that be the X factor who nobody wants to play you gluten Golden State too you know they they have a lot of problems with but as far as your other point I think there can be exciting fun season\nI think a lot of a new brand new teams are going to break out and I don't agree with you I don't think all the states with just your\nYour day in states won the championship down here ... things\nI hate to as much as I hate to say it I think Boston is going to win at this year up until you're I because\nI think I think they're going to get home court and you saw last year is of course part and get her goals they didn't get past that I think they're just going to be gas in the end of this is going to be the fourth straight run to the end and if you've seen all great team from the Lakers with Shaq and Coby to the spurs and\nWell yeah but how do you beat ... Patty a beat that's how you beat them go ahead you have to have you have to have the eat that you\nHave to Boston Celtics happen also scoring debt which Boston has\nAn aunt that do home court I think those are the main keys that you have to have\nIn Golden State hasn't had to have because in the final they've always had home court so and you sing Boston and nobody plays in tougher than them so I think Brad Stevens is going to get them over the hump and they have the depth to like you said that that the coaching\nAnd in the number one important thing is ... ... they can slow down coal to state and beat them up and get them into a dark mentioned Golden State does a lecture they like to play that or a temple style so\nThat's why I see the Celtics when the season I just think Golden State comes up short\nLast hey going out on a limb there because everyone is going to the Golden State and I'm not going to be the person to pick against Golden State I'm just not going to do it\nAnd I think they will get the one seed this year I Know they didn't have it last year but I think they will make that a little bit of a appointed emphasis but even if they don't want no one in the west is beaten up and ask for the Lakers as you mentioned the Lakers but the thing is I'm really curious with the Lakers\nWhen you know just thinking about a little bit more how young players a matched with LeBron and also at the bronze in the final seconds of the game and likes to pass up the shot what she's done before\nYou seem to make a few big shots but when you pass up the shot the ball knock it down\nDoes a cruise but knock down the shot does a Ingram knocked down a shot\nYou just want to see how the younger players now and we know they played on big stages before but with every game paying a bigger stage when you have the Brian James\nHow that does that play out as well and the first year ... in Georgia next on CBS course radio hey what's going on in the trunk\nOr rather than doing Greg go ahead my man\nHey that story or if there's here says la ... west ...

New England patriots in Kansas City chiefs the patch take\nA twenty four to nine lead into happy for the cheap to make a comeback and a half number two but then the patriots prevail at the end led by Tom Brady Rob Gronkowski and also the kicker and Stephen ... gets when at the end to fall through\nForty three to forty the patch take down the Kansas City chiefs undefeated no more for Casey the patch coming up on Sunday at the Chicago Bears one PM eastern in the windy city slots walk them in the starting Center for the New England patriots also a team captain and that's David Andrews David ... thanks for the time how are you\nI'm doing great how are you know\nWhat I'm doing great and we appreciate your coming on that was one heck of a victory last week and just how about the roller coaster ride of emotions that you went through in that one\nYou know it was a great team when oh there are some good where football you're playing that game and uh you know it came down their right to the end and um yeah we were able to execute\nI saw Tom Brady at the end was saying that he believes this off ... could be even better how do you guys get better we always know build find July of Josh finds a way in Tom finds a way how do you look to get better after putting up forty three on the streets\nYeah you know what I mean there's always things are going to prove on me and we had to turn over so you never want to do that or something we can prove or um you know and especially off environment can always improve our past bucking around barking and uh you know even try to get it better than it is\nI'll tell you I think the biggest difference from the wanting to start where now you're able to put three in a row together is obviously you get some teammates back in some new players into the fold but really the patriots have been able to run the football the alliance dominating and you're able to run the football it's a lot of success\nYeah you know we've just been putting in the work and um you know we got coming in working hard every practice you know going out there and are trying to prove and really bought it and um you know hopefully we can keep that turn roll\nIt has to be tough for a rookie to come in right away and have six at the New England just with all the pressure and the dominance they've had over the years\nSony Michel do after the first few games was hearing it from the fans but ever since he's really been role in these last three just what is impressed you know most with a former college team made a viewers out of Georgia and Sony Michel\nYeah you know I got to see him come in as a freshman at Georgia same thing the great work the work ethic I'm really doesn't say much discount then he'll put the work and then now he's been off in a bar or\nAnd we know there's two big sayings and Fox borrow it ignored the noise and do your job just how was Sony Michel been able to do his job so far and also how was he able to ignore the noise when he got some criticism early on in the season\nYou know what I mean this has told me up and down the hill and the NFL and a week a week you know a year to year or whatever it is and uh yeah so I think he's learned valuable lessons early or the and you just gotta keep going out each week to keep improving improving now you'll see the fruits of labor\nTalking to David Andrews right now patriots starting center and a team captain you were in two thousand and Fifteen and and drafted free agent you walked in and you ended up winning the battle in a starting for the patch\nRight away and you haven't looked back ever since just what is that like walking into New England where all they've done is one and you have Brady and ballot check just two giants in the annals of NFL history what does that like when you're walking as a rookie to Fox borrow\nIt was definitely a challenge it was on I was born I wanted to be a part of the best and you know there's been no\nBetter organization over the last you know Twenty years in the NFL and uh yeah I was fortunate enough to make a payment contribute and um [noise] yeah but you know I think it's been ... percent promise than easier expectations are clear ah yeah you know what you're supposed\nYou then um [noise] yeah but to me that you know I think it's been tough but at the same time it's been easier expectations are clear a you know what you're supposed to do and how you do it you just got to go there and execute it\nIs it at all intimidating\nUh I'm a I guess you'd say intimidating I think um yeah but at the end of the day is just football as what you've been doing for however long you been playing and um they at the end of the day just got to go out there and play you know do what you know what ...\nWhat do you remember about your first interaction with Tom Brady\nA person interact you actually knew my name which ah [laughter]\nAh [laughter]\nYeah to me you know going into a sixteen Fifteen year old and what it was exactly now to know and I'm drafted book you know God probably blog shots like football too 'cause I don't mind named the first time I saw you know definitely not a lot and you know made me a little bit more comfortable\nObviously you're a professional and you're respected being there for a few years and now being a team captain did you call your family once when you got home that first time he didn't Tom and just say Tom Brady knew who I was like what was the one of those moments\nI don't know 'cause I probably messed up now later practice\nThat say [noise] [laughter] probably overshadows that moment though are probably more concerned about that than you know actually meeting him\nWhat's it like when you had the bad snap and practice the time or what his bill like when it's time like when that happened\nHonestly I guess I'm more concerned with Tom than bill uh\nNo I mean bill is definitely going to let you have it but at the end of the day\nYou know Tom guy you're working with back there and um you know tough my ... year times uh kinda gotta fill each other out and learn you know where he lives and how you operate things like that so that was definitely a little bit of a challenge but uh you know where the guy's been doing it for\nYou no longer than you've been playing football I guess you you do it he says\nI'm going to David ages right down CBS Sports radio so we talked about the success of the wrong game you look at the fence overall you guys have been role in the last three weeks what else did change with this team after that wanted to start\nYou know I I think we just try to come a week in a group you know if we're gonna know wanted to follow in whatever\nOr you just got ... coming in each week even proven throughout the year ... bring your fundamental um [noise]\nYou know we weren't playing good enough the bottom line and um you know when you had to really kind of ... and\nYou know so we got to pick up the slack and do better and I'm the only guy I've bought in a you know when we responded well and um I just got to keep doing that\nAlso helps when you're able to ask Julian Edelman coming off the suspension and then a bill makes the trade to bring in Josh Gordon just how about the importance of jewels and also Josh according to what they meant to this policy\nDaring than a great team right um yeah for the for years I've been here he's he's a heck of a competitor\nAnd he's a great ballplayer so you know getting him back you know it's always good to get ill when he was he makes back and you know job has done a great job or a no we've had a great girl go guys that you know when you got to give them a chance that can make\nIt seems like there's a lot of respect in that locker room all ready for Josh ... it seems like there's some good synergy between him and and the teammates or you could see it a few weeks ago when he got the touchdown up against the colds and how you guys celebrate it as a group and uh you know exchange some high fives there\nYeah you know Josh than a great teammate home now to me and everyone here and I'm no and it's always\nGreat you know and the guy comes in like that you go to the and work and I fell off the you know and then when all that hard work and humiliate touchdown every one that you know\nI'll tell you as well because obviously idle men and Gordon they're going to be the people that a lot of people talk about nationally\nBut let's show some lump to the old line I lose in nature soldier it was going to be a a big task to replace them but Trump brand is that a nice job for you guys\n[noise] yeah

coming up on Sunday also recap\nThe Redskins victory up against Carolina last week so will touch on a whole lot about the NFL and the Washington Redskins with Vernon David coming up in about thirty five to forty minutes but first we got to get two week eight and the college football season so it's time to play a little ... and the college football season what's it to me [noise]\n\nAll right let's get to go and we got three games for you\nThis first game I don't feel great about it\nAt Michigan at Michigan State\nThe Spartans coming off the victory in happy valley last weekend Michigan at home just completely took care of\nWisconsin and I was very impressed by Michigan team as we know that season started with going down in South bend against Notre Dame and it was the often looking terrible horrible ... when the big game and last week they\nFind a way to continue their win streak and they clearly take care of Wisconsin Michigan the better football team\nBut a seven point spread is very big in Michigan Michigan State game [noise]\nSo you\nThink your point the point you take Michigan State at home and you bought the seven and Michigan will probably still win the game that's what would be the easy pick that's what I Would lean towards\nBut man something with as much as you get off and the way they're playing right now doesn't make me feel great influence in the seven points I think this is a close game most of the way a field goal game\nThat Michigan's leading but at the end they get a light touch down Michigan goes on to win the game\nAnd roll what did Ali I Will take Michigan ally in the seven point don't love it could go either way but I'll just go with the hot hot team right now and that's Michigan ... what you got\nKnow Mia Love taking the easy way out so I'm taking the Spartans a so history you know it's been on the side as far as here in the last uh it's not a joke at your work ethic just wander\nEasy what it can be a joke but I think that history has been on the spartan side in this in this match up their tenant want against the spreading a lot of meetings including five and it would only can spread against Michigan and it's a Big Jim a horrible\nSo history has been on the spartan side in this in this match up their ten and won against the spread in the last eleven meetings including five and it would only can spread against Michigan and it's a Big Jim a horrible games you know those usually go\nTo parties okay what are you got for McCain in ... so how many of these big time Wednesday Jim horrible really has a college\nListen he's been Austin the here in Michigan it's been awesome to share but in a rivalry game like this the home team getting seven points that a lot of ... a lot a lot of points to act on it I think Michigan State plus seven points\nNot necessarily to win the Michigan may come out like a slight number but Michigan state's gonna keep the same clothes that do that first looked at it I said it seems too good to be true in a rivalry and it seems to be true\nThat is what scares me about this one and then we found is rolling was that again you can lock your pick and you can walk out are you going to\nTell you what would the Michigan lie in the south you're\nBorn I Hope I don't get\nUp here I'll put you on your plate you'll never work here again I'm just [noise]\nWhen's that makes a pick locks it and I said maybe\nSaying this is a difficult one to lock it a week [noise]\nJeeze McCain mad guy look at it blocks the\nIt's like a little a little dog [noise] I guess for the corner of the ... just contain himself from break it out [noise] I calmed down a kid trying to jump and step on things and some of my role\nLack of\nThe bar ball would sail writes gave number two by the way how do you think that would go by what the management and said I never watch it again they're probably looking at me and say we're paying them like six bucks an hour so be\nQuiet it'd be like loom [laughter] they'd like you don't want who they'd be like the guy that yelled at worst a Yankee hat one week and then it first happened actually we don't we don't know who that is\nAll right let's go game number two all burn at old men\nAll burn who I Am four points off and it's been such a disappointment this year especially they started off here [noise] taken down Washington they all gets flat as black could be over the last few weeks but here are some numbers\n... spirits within Seventy six point one yard for getting a Sunday third in the country they're deep at twenty nine total defunds in the country all men very sneaky often you aren't they going to be a top\nHundred and fifty point nine yards pretty much stick to the country but they're deep and allows almost five hundred yards per game I have no\nReason why should feel confident and picking all birds because Auburn has just last wife slapped seltzer over the last few weeks but you gotta thank God Vern jumps back and they find a way to get a victory just how bad the almost the parents is high scoring affair\nJuicy as you would expect for a college football we that's happens from time to time but\nYou never know what could happen and what moves could happen inside the top twenty five and last\nWeek it was absolutely crazy with it was four teams going down in the top ten and this is a college football season that you never know how it's going to play out but Alabama still seemed to me that\nI don't see how\nI I Want to pick them to go down but it that way and I don't know who is going to take them down this upcoming season not impossible but the way that it goes right now extremely extremely tough so here's your new last top ten was last week you have four teams go down\nAt the forties that went down to the top ten three ... out of the top ten one sit in that of course was Georgia\nA Penn State that of course ... Washington did fall out and West Virginia Deval watching south Thirteen I should be West Virginia now Thirteen washing now Fifteen and Penn State goes down to a tea so you're near the top ten Alabama won Ohio State to come to three Notre Dame for\nLSU by Michigan sex tax is seven Georgia eight Oklahoma nine\nAnd you see at ten so the right ten teams are in the top ten if you want to complain about the order you could do that\nI'm sure if you're UCF bend you're going to be saying well we were ten last week we should've went up but you know that you're not going to get the respect their Oklahoma nine I think he's right\nGeorgia falling to eight I don't know if there are several other teams rather than Georgia in college football but finally had a a a ...\nLast week a tough task and LSU just spanked you\nTaxes going up to seven the way the season started off protect us losing to Maryland no one would have seen that one common Michigan going to have you ever told me after they Michigan will be six I would've said probably not LSU at five how else\nThan to Maryland no one would have seen that one come in Michigan and going to have you ever told me after they Michigan will be six I would've said probably not LSU at five how else you\nMay lose\nToo you know that they lose they lose the game\nTo Florida in the swamp\nParty I have an impressive wins against Miami at Auburn\nThey moved to Florida twenty seven to Nineteen\nAnd then they bounce back and only bounce back\nThey just roll over Georgia I Want to get my twenty points\nOr Notre Dame set for here's an even though today whether you believe in Notre Dame or not\nThey're seven or no\nIf Notre Dame runs the table are going to get into college football playoff\nWhether you like that or not and\nTheir schedules only five games or mating and they just survive pet last week in Nineteen forty navy northwestern Florida State Syracuse USC they wouldn't have backed by game doesn't matter\nIf they're all by one point or girl by twenty points they're going to college football playoff if they were on the table that's the biggest concern they do play NC State later today that game though is that\nColumbus and it's a three sixty match up\n... percent like Seventeen Seventeen and a half points it's a big number but you'd come sit at home I don't know what to make the NC State I don't know respect to them for being the sixteenth given they shouldn't be in five and all\nBut are you going to come to that game are you I'm not a big tests are already been for them was West Virginia and she said to get a more film if they would have been canceled earlier this year\nSo the Windsor NC State this year is James Madison twenty four and a Thirteen they'd be Georgia State the Panthers forty one to seven\nWest Virginia game cancelled they beat Marshall they beat\nVirginia the b._b._c.\nNot playing the best teams there this is their first big test in our life big test of the year they have constant because after they play Syracuse which give credit to you know maybe it's a nice job this year Florida State Wake Forest Louisville UNC any CEO to kill a schedule but they could send a big statement today\nThey go into confidence find a way to pull off the victory\nNow Mississippi State LSU\nThis is the battle of\nWhat Mississippi State team's going to show up I it's been tough\nTo get a read on Mississippi State for this year and then tells you you would expect them to keep this thing rolling right you lose the Florida then you're bounce back and you get the victory against Georgia you you would you would anticipate then the cheapest thing rolling\nBut may be and I don't expect this when you have a a twenty second team in the country coming in one of these LSU players look\nAhead what's next on the scheduled Alabama somebody ask I don't think they will but this is a Mississippi State team\nThey beat over twenty turn it on they lose the foreign Thirteen to stick to this Kentucky twenty seven\nI'm Still trying to figure out what team on the seesaw from Mississippi states going to show up is that the team more like a Florida in Kentucky or the team that took care of Auburn who is a pretender but not as good as people thought they were so let's see um Mississippi State a few plays out\nI Would lean towards LSU getting the victory though just because anytime you know she's not going to win one this year they find them in it when when the when and when one convincingly and it's a nice little American athletic conference match up but I'm not just saying this because I went to Temple University but Cincinnati undefeated and you get a temple team that\nIs starting to search temple let me ask you this McKeon let's see how good of a gambling guy you are because uber claimed to be like the best gambling guy there is and you make all this money and and all that stuff\nAnd McCain shakes his head 'cause you can never play along with the joker have any ... let's get a little personality McKee inherent trying to make yeah I'm a little more entertaining you understand that correct shore okay you didn't like that joke do you think you're pretty good the bad in college\nSo I think I'm gonna ... I'm not I'm not no change after dark but I'm going to be some better yeah to\nCincinnati at temple where do you think the line is on this in Cincinnati undefeated there I think it was like twenty it's in the country\nI Would say Cincinnati is favored\nBy six and a half one wrong\nWow the temple animals are favor or a three point favorite\nWhy is that jak I I have to ask you that I don't understand I don't know temple lost\nTo Villanova this year in Buffalo they've also taken down Maryland and the other ones are Tulsa ECU and navy\nAnd it's not like they have some impossible home field advantage that we know hey don't they don't come that's made a link is great but I met a cabbage will be now oh okay so now that that definitely couples right I mean they should be a ten point favorite at that point\n[laughter] each ... [laughter] ah Cincinnati yeah they should be fair\nBut I saw that line I said if I was betting on this one which I won't be I Would say I'd plus the three points with since they are by what I Would have thought they would have been a four point ... yeah that's about right I'd say\nAt first I just thought I was reading the line Ron that's what I thought because the the line is\nThree three point do you think OK yeah Cincinnati and then I thought temple report favorite this'll be the game you see\nAnd you're like oh now I got to throw money on the line that great and then it winds up in ...\nWhich would be great fight fight fight for the chair and the way it would be very happy yeah sure whatever but I'd be extremely happy jumping up and down\nTemple get the when the protests\nThe

or you've got a problem yeah saying true yeah broadcasting didn't work out I Would not be a ... you would not okay [laughter] after I'd be a drunk student in the uh in the stands\nAs opposed to a drunk broadcaster in the precedent if you were drunk or you know\nIt'd be in a better position that there's somebody up in there\nAnd so they so maybe you never know I\nMean you get hidden talents when you drink\n[laughter] would you ever be a cheerleader gr says oh look at me [laughter] I Would have [laughter]\nI don't want to do that ... one of the skin tight shirts joined the jets flight

what's this little colored green green light\nYourself on the green and white I'll tell you I have a lot of respect though for the guys that do that I I'm actually from\nAnd doing that no color green green light ...\nYourself on the green and white I tell you I respect them for the guys that do that I I've actually probably with someone in the temple ... wrong men\nIt's ridiculous I always wonder how do you see the girl's sport in the palm of your hand and looked or above your head it's ridiculous it's crazy absolutely crazy high\nFinal one Alabama versus a Tennessee the bit questionnaires how long does to a time go by low apply for really get into the fourth quarter and then you have the injury and all that mix tape it's been downplaying\nThe Salt Lake ... practice and he would have went into the game and tells you what about the game I think we needed to go into the game or two is going to play there was the dominant typically do well and I don't think Alabama is going to be scared so ever had a bad performance against that it's easy but they do have it that performance against Tennessee they do with the game by\nIt was like hey we we didn't really miss a beat 'em I'm Still I'm Still I'm\nA understand this guy and yeah I Know\nHow he throws the ball I Know when when he's going to let it go\nGotta gotta get get the ball out quickly you have to be cognizant of that and I'm always on alert\nWhat was that like for you obviously you know and Alex for a long time but you guys are getting comfortable with Kirk and we know ... was on a year to year deal in was probably on his way out and then you're scrambling for quarterback and you're from wind up with the Alex Smith how 'bout that\nWe're familiar with surreal because I you know like I said before I started out with Alex back in two thousand and six of them joined Washington Redskins I'm like a ... really like a dream come true um I wouldn't trade it for anything and having him in and watching here\nAnd I have to have success over the years is truly a a great to watch as well and now our here together same rock and roll cranking and are are ready to play football when ...\nWhen you look at your team this year you guys have been up and down your when one week then you lose the next and it just is like a seesaw going back and forth what do you think this team can accomplish is your what are the Washington Redskins\nWere so young but were talented we have a bunch of great guys on this team has a ... and I'm Talking as people and its players so\nTo us we just have to stay together and make sure the camaraderie there and ah continue to work together to be a team players one and always\nHold each other accountable because uh you you know how it is in in a team atmosphere team setting you have to be able to rely on that next man and and trust that they'll always have your back and come through for you so as we can tell you to move forward we must\nMake sure that we have those key component or in line or before we can even take a step further\nYou know what it's like to take those steps further adds a professional how do you try to encourage those teammates in what do you try to teach some of those younger teammates on how to do with the right way and the NFL\nWar just a a some guy's a verbal some guy lead by example but most importantly the actions speak louder than words you want to make sure you're always I'm aware because you never know who's watching and if you're if you're leading if you're a good leader and\nYou're doing the right thing at all times than those young guys I Want to see that they're going to follow um even when you think they're not so are the biggest thing is just a leading by leading by example and making sure your accent are always and compliant with or what you say\nFor you when you look back at your career and especially early on you had the Singletary moment where you choose you out in front of the media you also had some early injuries to get off to the start of your career picked early in the first round just for you what was that turning point in your career where everything started cooking for you and the NFL both on and off the field\nFor like the that after that I had with coke Singletary when he said because the locker room that was the moment the Cadillac me to be more of a leader more of a team team player and I'm just turning my career around in general\nAnd it goes back to just doing the right thing like I said earlier if you do the right thing you\nYou treat everyone the way he wants to be treated with respect\nHonesty then you have nothing to worry about and just take it one day at a car\nDo the right thing you you treat everyone the way he wants to be treated with respect and honesty then you have nothing to worry about and just take one day at a time\nNow we look so much in the social media climate if a coach is critical the player to ends up right on Twitter and everyone sees it so\nSometimes coaches are careful with what they said to the media knowing how sensitive some players maybe you don't want to lose the player and a young age how did you deal with the the Singletary criticism because I don't know if we would see that I now a days as we did a few years ago when he did\n[noise] um I don't I because I knew it was coming from a good place he just you know he said what he said and I didn't I didn't take it to heart I just used it as good and I learned from it not only that I learned from it uh\nI I looked at it as a as a as a positive in so many ways and once I started to understand what he was doing and why it it it helps it helped me helped me to just move forward move forward and\nAnd a good way and that's why I said at that moment I I grew up with the player who was a man and every moment every moment I look back on that time when we caught me out and that because the locker room I cherish it because it wasn't for that time I wouldn't be who I Am today\nBurning Davis is my guest right now in the ... show on CBS Sports radio getting back to the office and I've been really impressed with Adrian Peterson we know he's a hall of fame running back but it's been a few years since he's been dominant you know he was going to have a good year but you're wondering how good he\nWould be and he's playing hurt right now in a big way with the dislocated shoulders just how about the effort Adrian Peterson given your right now\nHe's um I'm I'm I'm not surprised because I Know I Know his work ethic I Know what he's done in his career or to get to where he is today so when I see them out there\nFighting for pain battling working extremely hard he's one of those guys they easily is a difference maker he just wants to go out there and went in and help help this team or become successful\nYou're thirty four now and you've been planning this leagues in two thousand and six so a lot of wear and tear on an NFL body how do you take care of your body now a little bit differently than what you did earlier on in your career Vernon\nI Try to think of this if you deliver it to the craft and taking care of your body that's the biggest that's the biggest um I think that's the big if that's the biggest key when it comes to longevity and I tried to kill a lot of the young guys start now because when you try to catch up later on\nYeah trouble trouble trouble but so if you start now with two sides of the week than the ... factor at least once a week you will be okay but you have to continue to carry those things go over to the coffee\nAlso found that a lot of guys that their routine when the off season hit\nCan't do that you have to pay this type of thing and and treat it as a as if it's a business\nWhen you look back and I hear your being a veteran voice like we're talking about what Vernon Davis right now and CBS Sports radio but when you look back to your days in San Francisco who was one of those veterans voices that you really had a good connection with some good synergy went that time to show you the right way and the national football league\nA guy like Brian Jennings Bryant Young uh Larry Allen killing his\nStanding I'm Frank Gore or he was there he rather hear the for me but\nHe was a veteran I mean he was always a pro still\nThere and take my head off to him and I respect and honor hand because uh uh I don't know who the enthusiasm and his approach to the game so I I lean on boats guy to to really show me the way\nUh they were the quintessential leaders are you need and a lot wrong in order to make a team go um and it's key to have those kind of ...\nSo I you know I I I had goes off to those guys were showing me the way and showing me to vote\nAnd whenever you play in the NFL like you have for so long you're going to encounter some really good team may but then when you get to the opposition just at your position or when you played Tony Gonzales\nOr outside Antonio Gates and then later on ... comes into the league Travis Kelsey just how about the development through the years of the tight end position and how many great titans are on the national football league\nOh it's so it's often to see that there's so many great paintings in the late right now are you gonna run kind of it you have a Kelsey a and not to forget Jordan read who these guys are incredible athletes I mean\nThe I mean the game has just evolved in so many areas especially when it comes to that position are you seeing guys who are who who can who can really get the ball in the hands and they run out there to catch\nA guy who can beat the corner so awesome just to see a hotel where it's going to be\nAbout ten Fifteen Years ago but um it's it's a good deal good deal and I mean related to be a part of um just such a a good class of guys if people an athlete\nBurning let's get to the Dallas Cowboys that come on in Sunday at four twenty five pm eastern everyone talks about the cowboys often with the development of jak Prescott and also see Kelly but that defense continue not to get the credit than it deserves just how about the challenges the cowboys present you guys defensively\nOh this game it's going to definitely definitely going to be a challenge for the every week is going to be a challenge because we're not prepared mentally or physically then we're going to lose this game but the biggest\nI think that after like the biggest thing is just being prepared and that's because if you believe\nYou can do something and then you will achieve it and if we all believe together and we're on the same page we're going to be successful in the amount of what but\nBe passively yeah these guys are as good as any team in the NFL so we have to approach it that way and we have to know what we're getting a getting getting ourselves into\nAnd I feel like if they're like where we are going to be ready or come Sunday because if we have a good coach with that I'm a good group of leader and some awesome um

them we'll see what side of the fence I Do lie on live beyond sides with the question or why\nI was asking me five questions in the sports world them we'll see what side of the fence I Do lie on live beyond sides with the question or while I disagree and be all sides with the question but before we get to that we got to take your phone calls to we also have to talk\nAbout the exciting time in the end all be postseason now with the Arabs see as that's already in the books as the CIA was surprising as the Boston Red Sox to split the first two games what to use them and we know the red Sox won a hundred and eight games this year and used them on one of those three\nI would've never predicted going back to use that the Boston Red Sox would have took all three games were taken all three games and used you just want to start with the ashes line up\nAnd what they're pitching too and I know now to base banged up but you just would have thought they would have at least one one game and use them to send it back to Boston but that wasn't the case at Boston's outfield was spectacular\nIn the series but Ben intending making big catch up to big catch especially to catch that he made in game for and I thought it was very fitting that he caught the final out in game five ... bat so why he's one of the best players in baseball and Jackie\nBradley every year in the postseason you have someone that did not have a good regular season\nHas a massive moment or moments in the post season and Jackie rather junior has done that the three are ... and came to the to home runs after that one of them being a grand slam and he wins the else yes MVP so Boston's going back to the world series\nFor the fourth time since two thousand and four and look at the way that they have done it put aside the one oh it was put aside what they've done in the regular season\nBut when you look at the post season they had the Yankees over a hundred games they had the actress who won one of three they go to Yankees stadium when games three and four\nThey go to minute maid part they win games three four and five so they're fighting to do on the road in the postseason out scoring the Yankees and the Astros\nForty third just remarkable incredible\n\nAnd then also against the Astros in five games from the ... and then get on to dominate the baseball game the red Sox then that Fifteen seven they'll scored the stroke so congratulations to Boston they are going to the world series\nDavid Price even pitches well in the culture and the al ... or just in Berlin which would have ever seen that one coming\nAnd also who would have seen the right tact taken all three and used it to David Price finally get the job done as a starter in a post season game and dominant now you get to the other series the I don't see how it will come to a close tonight hopefully it's not an half\nOr game of it you know and as a talk show host I wouldn't mind that but if you're a fan and a a viewer yeah you don't want to stay up for a nine hour game and some of these postseason games have been way too long\nAnd fortunately I don't have to complain about part time because they'd have to go to work the next day but here's someone has to go to work back there of young kids with some of these games are played out yeah it's difficult\nEspecially when you get some really good game or like that and I'll see a game for or the end all cs thirtysomething affair before Ballenger had to walk off\nYou just start to think\nHow many of the younger generation are watching this Amazon\nWorking are actually watching us and there's been some good postseason games in the championship series\nBut last night we had a game six between the ... and the Dodgers Dodgers one went away going into last night\nFrom going back to the world series and back to back years they're still one went away but now it's the final game of the season for one of these teams and the Dodgers and the brewers and the birds he had a victory and if you're ... you're being honest with yourself\nAfter freeze Mr game six cents a home run on the first step out of the game you're probably not feeling too hot but then the bottom of the first the ... crew they step up with two outs Aguilar gets the double to run a double than most most stock is gets a double as well to make it through wanted and crap gets the single\nFour to one and then from there it was all they're both by can able on only twenty five pitches goes and then two thirds no heads Jeffords goes nowhere Thirteen pitches and burns the rookie know hit the Dodgers for two innings and the biggest part of that performance as they tacked\nWho comes out of the ... now take the red Sox or another when the world series yeah\nI have to what they did just plain too well in your opinion who gives a better chance to take down Boston ... uh\nLA I Want to see my I Want us to Milwaukee get it done but it's Los Angeles and that and the more talented team I think baseball would rather see LA firsthand around oxide I don't know if that gets ... no\nThey don't want they don't want the Milwaukee Brewers are a better story of course the brewers are much better stare a great story and I would love to see them get their first champion you'd think the Dodgers have a better chance of take down the ... what's the reasoning behind that\nAll you would think because an experienced the big thing but you would think because of the brewers bullpen that condense is the game it gives them a better ... I\nI Do think the red Sox face a challenge in going into a National League park having to help her laugh because you're going to lose ... Bradley junior hottest hitter has an ad in the lineup\nWhich is really tough for them but I have a self Bennett pending you still have a big ... bass got Bradley's your hottest hitter you knew him and your line up and I think I just think\nHere's the problem I think Milwaukee has a good chance against Boston is Christian yellowish gets going Christian ... which has like two hits in the series and this is going from a guy who was nationally nationally ... he is planning this way so if he can get it going\n... because I get large now starting to get hitting a little bit they have a chance in our city has been unbelievable but they need to get Yellowstone and if they somehow when this game tomorrow and yell at you so my hitting they don't stand a chance in ... as you mentioned\nAguilar I Will say the the home run early by freeze\nYou would think the crowd with a faded away but the minute Machado comes up because what happened with Aguilar out in LA the fans got back into it and then it also helps when you put up a force spot in the bottom of the first but I thought that was an interesting moment\nWhere you'd think the building would have been dead for the rest of the top of the first but they were not because the child came up to the play where ... yourself Boston or the field depending on who gets in from the else yeah\nI Know the red Sox have a lot of questions specifically sale specifically David Price I Want to see David Price do that again\nIn a situation where he doesn't have concerned\nAbout sale at the hospital visit yeah\nI mean just look at it this way he didn't he didn't really\nYou know throw he hasn't really throwing a whole lot lately\nFor whatever you know and I would love to see David Price do this with us regained cushion like your life is on the line now David Price has to put you into you know into the promised land I don't you know the jury's still out pretty of press was\nThat when did\nWas it gives them some ...\nSome people off his back for a minute it's all really does\nIt opens up a little moment for him okay I could finally pitching the postseason I'm grading the regular season I could pictures of starting pitcher in the postseason I could pitch very well\nAnd I could out do Berlin under which he did in that game but yes I Am I going to be putting all my shackles on David Price in a big game he has to show it to me one more time and have the opportunity to show it to him and the game too\nAnd then if you could go back to back starts then it's tough\nNot say you go all live with the guy but it's tough to doubt and you feel a lot better I feel good about David Price right now but I wouldn't be going on with the poker chips after just one star\nI Want to see the brewers both and have the shot\nTo do this I Want to see them win the pennant I Want to see if they can\nDo what they've done here basically for the last month\nYou know kind of getting by with smoking mirrors with the pitching staff and have it work\nThat was interesting that's what's so interesting to me here\nAnd it would be fascinating to see that\nBrewers bullpen and go up against this Red Sox lineup which if you look at the red Sox line up\nThe killer bees in the outfield they're tremendous we know that\nOn paper going to be or that sort of World Series in fields and and I picked him the other World Series for the year started\nBut they just have guys that produce that was a heck of a planet but there's so much that was isn't planning to go to new yes and Bogart says Bogart\nWanted to be home one night it could be ... and then at first\nPeers out here in moral inside a good year too from he has\nA pure ... has been extremely underrated in my opinion and you get no production out of the catch him in his early owning Vasquez you nothing for you every night but that doesn't want to get to the ANC yeah but they don't they don't do anything I ever for them I mean that you can get through the bottom three that Red Sox line up at the top six that are just relentless\n... but they just produce like you've got to check your brother Jews and not have a good regular season\nThe shots why I said to you it poses the question of when they go to a nationally park how\nIt's gonna be hard to take him out of all I Know you can't take bets are J. D. I Will do you have no on line up Katie Bradley junior is going to be a pinch hitter can you do anything in the in field now right he who you gonna move around yeah and you can't move back at second base no he did for him to see what well you're not you're not moving ... exactly\nWell look at what movie did in that series against the brewers put aside the the interference call which to me it should have been a home run he went into the stands\nI was a hundred percent going out but he robs it the guy sensational from any ... throwing down to second base the guy is one of the more entertaining pliers to watch um baseball he could impact the game in so many different ways and the base pass through contact through power\nWith his dog he covers so much ranged tool\nAnd not outfield\nTend to be on the other side and a lot field or Tina system the outfit on this year that game in game for\nIt's back and forth\nWhat I think the bags were full may the diving catch to prevent any ... any roads are coming across the play makes it to run game the bet attendee\nNo fear whatsoever if he does not build that falls cleanly it goes slow wall reruns come in the red Sox lose\nThen there's the game six regardless of what happened to get by the whatever the game six because they are sort of got one that attendee makes a tremendous catch\nOnly problem is\nThat like one big in the morning and I think if you're a seven year old or an eight year old if you have school via work the next day and luckily for me what do they say was go to the gym and take some interviews\nSo I could afford to stay on the one Fifteen\nAnd the same thing the other night with the ah game four in the U.S yes\nWe need the boundary Walker\nI was in my bed at the computer up I said I'm not sit on the sofa I go I'll I'll get the TV through the computer but at the game and they go right to sleep\nThat can hurt the brewers more because you use all your bullpen and you had the afternoon gain the next day to die I Can't hurt the brewers\nTo lose and also the momentum at the time the momentum was big and then the Dodgers sees the momentum with her on the mound pitch in the way he did in game five\nBut didn't look out goes to go back home game six allow for sending home run didn't matter you end up winning the game and then you set yourself up very nicely for a game seven with this pope and a five five two on two for CBS let's go out to\nDidn't matter you end up winning the game and then you set yourself up very nicely for a game seven with this pope and a five

that is correct\nSo it'd be kind of a forum were [noise] oh boy that that I got to think about that for a second I think a lot of uh\nYou know there's Consumer Reports than they used to have a\nA I Believe they had a Consumer Reports reported by actual drivers type thing\nThey did that with a fuel economy sites ... go for a while it said here's what the government sticker or you know manufacture sticker set on the window and here's what drivers actually reported and they get you know twenty people said well I got sixteen miles per gallon average\nUh out of all of them and the manufacturers that I got an Eighteen or got fourteen so sometimes it's better sometimes is\nWhen you when you talk about the well this is always a a slippery slope because if you put in a\nGuinea company any type of car anything and you say Branson raves about this or whatever might happen to be or\nI mean there's a website dedicated to people cramming about stuff right and guess what people do their they kind of crap about stuff that to me it's not an indication of what really happens with that saying or that car or that company\nUh you got to be able to dissect that data\nAnd look for some common themes are because I'll tell you that people that have vehicles\nCan have a bad experience with any vehicle based on their used or their care right and it really can so I mean it would be hard to make the results be consistent 'cause none of the problems are happening under the same the same circumstances\nIf you know if you have a certain type of engine if they fail quicker under poor maintenance than if you did good maintenance where it would last much longer and people rarely\nGo out and how how well something works occasionally you'll see something on a on a former website but it's it's\nRare in this kind of it's very dangerous but I got to say it that\nBased on the type of car and the demographic of the consumer that it would end up in Ohio the type of comic could be different I totally agree yeah the experience factor um\nYou know certain demographics might have more experience with automobiles than others and they could give you a completely different reports than a first time car
