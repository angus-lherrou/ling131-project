said so far not a great surf but two malls are pitching David Price\nWho the Yankees have statistically own there's I mean they have a spot in his head for whatever reason just can't get over the Yankees so that should be in a good spot to have cameras that you should be David Price tomorrow go home and the Yankees were undefeated home last year in the playoffs that crowd will be wild and truly be thrown beers either one of the red Sox fan just like uh it seems\nTo be a Yankee Stadium tradition or the ... the crowd of Iraq is Yankees behind their energy the fans will beat the red Sox Red Sox will sluggish after winning a hundred and eight games possibly maybe you know still trying to flip the switch and struggling a little bit Yankees got him right there and then\nWhat you mean the red Sox and do you have all the mentioned again great home crowd they played Britain home you use that much and fly through that can go to the world series and I think the American leagues and

a Yankee things will be at home the center crowd behind him encouraging them the red Sox and use that will make them\nGet through the Yankees game too and then you have to go to Yankee Stadium put the

show broadcast there from from the side of that fighting the build up to it and are wonderful affiliate\nGay access to eleven forty on AM dial house me put me up not how's me but put me in Studio is great and talking to a bunch of fighters to your teeth came through a bunch of guys in the conclusion was and something about perspective but it was a really tough fight to call\nReally difficult fight to figure out\nAnd one of the nice things about having a fight this big is everybody who's anybody in the U.S the world\nMake themselves available kind of comes out of the woodwork and so we had the chance to talk to a guy that have had on the CBS Sports age to show which CBS mortgage cue if you're not familiar CBS Sports launched a brand new twenty four hour streaming sports network OTC devices like Apple TV Roku on your app\nKind of like Netflix in the sense that you can't get it on cable but it's a legitimate twenty four hour sports network type of show over there and we've had the bay on the show two or three times I think especially in front of the shows that isn't meant to do this yesterday to play you some of\nThe interview I think the news broke if memory serves\nWas Kyrie Irving making the announcing the decision is probably gonna stick around someone to circle back to a thinks the base really interesting Steve ... a former U.S the heavyweight champion\nAnd that division fascinating Daniel ... D.C who I really like as a person\nAnd it's a great fighter but he's not an interesting fighter so he doesn't get the same level of enthusiasm the same level of paper ... unless you find John John ... D season that division obviously John Jones has been reinstated or he'll be back officially soon\nAnd so I asked ... because I think the assumption is the Jones is going to fight D.C Joan just fought him twice he beat him the last time around John Jones when he ... and it was a pretty good I was there so it was a really good fight\nDaniel ... D.C obviously can cause basically cried and so he was going to retire\nAnd then it came out the Jones had failed a drug test in terms of banned substances and the whole situation and really the division got thrown under some chaos so you would think that ... would deserve another shot a DC but\nThe thinking is that may not happen so we asked ... whether there's any discussions with the U.S see on a rematch with Daniel gourmet\nOr to try to match\nOr different words or anyone else we're going to go over every batch\nFrom go ashore\nRecently DC was talking about dimitrius Johnson and he said if dimitrius Johnson doesn't get a rematch there was no hope for any of us in the entire world because that means nothing you could ever do will warrant intermediate rematch you had the most out at that doesn't heavyweight history what was your reaction to those kinda\nIt's ever what you say [laughter] [noise]\nOr marriage or groups for every\nBut what you say [noise] from British friends mouth so\nThat we\nWere there fighting current shot or have you ever\nHad a great job either ... or ... or a ...\nSo what went into the decision to take that fight with D.C he came up and wait your title was on the line it seemed like he had a lot more to gain from that match than you did\n... has a great site supervisor or the first is that were lost in every way you're going to be\n... I think there are no where I Would have been great but you know very much like it that way back\nListen to ride of the news media writer here on CBS Sports radio my conversation with ... which I also and we'll get to ... we also you know\nThe idea of Grange right and how we define and D.C Dana ... won every fight that's mattered except for when he stepped in the octagon against John Jones and I asked me oh just whether or not he believes damn Colombia a is an old timer in terms of his ranking as a USC fighter\nMan in the atmosphere at a bar you know oh I better fighters no question\nAbout it you start your fighter know wherever they are why was that was better fighter I knew I knew that um\nOr whatever so so he's like the right things are usually so we're getting bad um but that's a lot to\nDo a lot ... where I mean but I you know we've got remarried again I I see that\nAre so here's the real here's a question of the week unknown USC will Conor McGregor who has not step through knocked on two years he did\nFight may weather and a boxing match a year ago will Conor McGregor against an undefeated fighter like to be come out on top and candy when and just macgregor whether he wins or loses have several fight he just signed a multi if I deal with Yossi\nKenny carries a sport and be headliner for years to come I mean one thing they have in the bank the USC and McGregor is whatever becomes of his career which is why they have done it yet whenever the trilogy happens again snake Diaz that third fight\nIt's going to be must watch sporting event must watch television I mean I'll go all actually wanted to Vegas for it\nBut the guy in front of them is to be and the question becomes Willie when an CPA who's as we mentioned a former heavyweight UFC champion really astute really plugged in on this born so I wanted his perspective as a fighter as a champion a former champion whether he thinks ring Ross is going to affect counter this weekend\nBut I don't think it will be I think he's ready to phrase a fire or the guy raise that every time and now he's been trained in two years and I know he's been training so I think it would be fine I think\nWe are ... or ... or ... lives up to a regular regular ... situation\nAfter everything that went down at USC two twenty three were you surprised and do you think Conor McGregor deserves to be back in the octagon and in the title picture so quickly\nBut you know it was really dirty arguments for\nMen do from a priority to your to your bank robber probably care about\nIn the past three years we've seen six interim champs in USC do you think the titles changing hands so often is starting to paint the titles or does it make what you accomplished in your rain that much more impressive\nThere's more pressure on [noise] I think than whites and your chest groups using somebody new\nOr you know I think I'm\nA mother or I think if you want to get ahead or are we so we were voting on earth and the guy is a very good for sale for ... or ... one of the new chair and you're All right I think a\nChair\nOr relative Ron let's let's get some of your your predictions what do you see happening on Saturday main event McGregor hoping\nLike I'll never predict who's going to win I just uh I'll get my two cents when I'm terribly sorry will gamble or with Barry like sports [laughter]\nOh have you got the animal is that what you do for a reason regularly I saw the show is that how we are turning it off you know if he does that count on a nice return to be shorter\nThan our regretted or the guys are inside ...\nWould you down and there will be ... or ... or ... straight or are we went into it and start\nManaging fired the first time in ... our our nose where\nIt definitely should have been McGregor I don't know what I was thinking hedge until it was too late\nI guess there's legal gambling in Jersey too is that right is that if you have you um because I'm not I'm not a guy that's going to have a book came out I got it's going to bed illegally so Vegas was my move and I just didn't close I should have done that have you gone to the to the sports books in in Jersey yet\nI have I went to the one in ... park in a place to be a few bats are beginning it'd be a college football season\nIs it a pretty legit sports books like the real deal yeah oh yeah definitely I Wonder I Wonder what the line is on McGregor there in the fourth round and whether you're going to go there tomorrow morning I don't know I might have to now advice for you and I don't I'm kind of know what I'm thinking you know I should I should absolutely better\nThan us he's interested in this respect I think about this as a as a thought experiment\nBecause and I'm not saying the answer you're supposed to give your radio host your of your you know one of the guys like if you were just a rank the five sports that you personally enjoyed the most right not the most just cause for me I have to do NFL abdomen be able to

conference play will bail it'll heat up here\nIn a week or so uh but you know what I like to think\nWhen you look at some slates on paper and you go you know not a whole lot going on that's what I like to think in chaos prevails a little bit here way when you sort of think you can grant path something that's usually when things get a little bit upside down so I I maybe we'll get that tomorrow we'll see but\nCertainly at the very least about four to six games to kind of what your appetite\nWhen we'd be entertained by Texas Oklahoma\nI like to think so but you know if people\nThink about you know pick twelve games and and high octane often I don't necessarily think you're going to get a with this one certainly Oklahoma can score\nAnd if and if Oklahoma starts raining points on taxes I think that one over pretty quick and taxes is not really built to windows high powered shootouts they're they're really going to be more run the ball with same Ellen gr and then go over the top with colon Johnson well on through Jordan\nUh let's see if it will join Humphrey and job so actually the over under on this I think it's like sixty and a half\nCollin Johnston little Humphrey Jordan are receiving it will join Humphrey and job so actually the over under on this I think is like sixty and a half or maybe sixty one I really wouldn't be surprised tasty under on that side hotter landers\nTexas's defensive coordinator you've done a very good job kind of rallying the troops after that we can walk to Maryland\nAnd they've really been getting getting better as the years gone on\nSo I think they're gonna have to obviously find some answers are in terms of spying pilot Murray and he's just a human she'd code so I I really think this is going to be more of a defensive dial both teams kind of settling in a town Herman is actually really good when he was an underdog a non and for\nA straight up in those situations twelve and one against the spread it's only seven and a half point\nA lion coming into Saturday So I think it's on the low scoring side think Texas can keep it close enough with that defense to cover and and I like Oklahoma's firepower wide receiver if you guys don't new CD lamb or Hollywood brown yet get to know\nThose guys are lethal ... a route runners with the quickness I think that's just going to be a little bit too much for Texas overcome but I liked that one is a tight game\nAll right how about a Virginia Tech um with Notre Dame what what kind of what kind of game plan to expect in that game how big a game is that for Notre Dame when you look at their schedule\nThe hardest thing for a new name was probably last week against Stanford and boy they passed that one foot with flying colors thirty eight Seventeen and I'll tell you that the moved in books quarterback has just paint all kinds of dividends fat off since uh\nGoing from Brennan Winbush shoes more of a run first guy and then you try to set up the path later on the book who more throw first but he can run he can scramble when the situation calls for it and they're just playing a much higher level right now they're stealing is way higher with book in there so\nI you know I actually think that we didn't cover is on the road Virginia Tech man they still have some concerns along the defense of side with their linebacker they're they're just brutally young\nOr on that side of the ball and when you come in with a guy who can really give you that that the path in the rye and that's just putting a lot of stress on the middle of that descent also brought breaking into new quarterback with Josh Jackson's ankle injury so\nThis is a situation where normally there's a let down for Notre Dame find Kelly on the road historically isn't all that great but I I tell you I think we're book\nI I think this is going to be a win for them there\nEnough and speaking of of ah games were looking forward to\nLSU Florida I you know I I Know the Florida has a lot to prove to people um [noise] but but I'm a you know I think it'll be pretty good game and and we make at some point you\nMade the right for you too might be the final one you know\nOver the over under a like a touchdown I Know a lot of defense for sure I think the key for Florida is going to be can they give Joe borough that first bad game for LSU he's been doing it we pretty good for LSU or through the first several games\nSix touchdown passes zero interception not great on paper stats wise you know kind of middle of the road completion percentage not great\nYards per attempt but you know he makes very good third down throws he's very good and it was in a very a decisive passing situations he's a good at moving the change when they need him to be\nA Florida very good with the pass rushed very good at creating havoc with their defenses front I think that's gonna be the difference they gotta get burrow into these situations where he's making bad decisions he's under duress all the time\nVery small line here even though she was number five and the country about two and a half in favor of the pie bangles actually like Florida Strait Up in this game I think\nThere are now playing pretty well or early last to Kentucky obviously that doesn't look so bad right now with the Wildcats role and so\nI think they're going to get a little bit of mo Jo going in the swamp still expecting low scoring not a lot of a very pretty things going on often but I think Dan ... doing a pretty good job really wrong with that for Rahm is going to be ugly but I think Florida's got enough juice to get it done\nAll right I mean that's that's a very good then I mean if that is as competitive as the line indicates even though it is not what we're used to from the FCC with all the fence and not as much off as a it's still should be pretty good entertaining\nBattle and and one that you know that that kind of typified college football at the level of real uh\nFox is Jared happen in Chicago a jury

once again a night game I Believe starting a little later\nThan a Friday nights game started\nYeah something like a ... between eight Fifteen eight thirty eastern time tomorrow for that one we told you earlier about the college football to get into it too much uh in terms of times et cetera\nBut the uh I Know Notre Dame is at night um\nI Know that LSU Florida is at three thirty that Oklahoma Texas the red river rivalry a Red River shootout depending on\nOn how it's played each year a is a new game it's an early game or maybe even eleven maybe eleven local time their noon eastern so it's an early game\nFor a Oklahoma Texas and look I it's been awhile since Texas matter you know I mean they really gone through a lot of transition you know you talk about we were talking earlier about the Steelers\nTexas found a way to screw it up then they may Texas was a perennial power and you watch now it's very interesting in college how um you know I was just talking to Jay Berman about Utah State you know Brigham Young one into Wisconsin\nWisconsin's not a top\nTen team in my mind but they're close to that and they went into Wisconsin beat Wisconsin\nFirst last year I think only last year for the badgers\nAnd I'm Utah State\nWhat to BYU tonight and beat him by twenty five and forty five twenty so Brigham Young beat Wisconsin that Wisconsin lost that home to Utah State by twenty five\nSo\nMy point is teams sneak up the central Florida is the Utah states they come out of nowhere meanwhile Nebraska is one of the worst teams in the country and most of you\nAre a lot of you anyway remember one Nebraska was a power and a power every year that's what they do there and the ... not a lot going on not allowing other teams uh to take away the universal love for the whole college team\nI mean as a kid I thought in Nebraska it'd be great forever\nBecause they have the stage to themselves\nAnd it really matters to them but it is all falling apart they're you know and and Notre\nDame is made its way back and play in a couple of big games but we never thought Notre Dame would be a team that struggled and ran through coaches and couldn't find a quarterback that they loved and\nYou know became just another teen and they're not that because they are way too popular like the cowboys aren't that because of their way to popular\nThe cowboys deserve to be that 'cause they don't ever win and Notre Dame hasn't done that\nMuch wedding in the scheme of college football they're not in the conversations that Alabama allows state or in\nMaybe they will be again but they're not now\nAnd the cowboys you know aren't New England in any way shape or form there not a team you talk about every year their team you don't talk about most years yet they maintain that limelight so it's interesting to watch Oklahoma has stayed relevant Texas in Nebraska I have\nNot they have not\nEnd up ... building from from a dead floor\nAll the tradition that the brass got fat is gone look what when what Miami went through what Florida state's going through right now to some extent\nI mean it is an automatic is my point you don't\nGet to keep it without earning it so when you

between ... and Patrick read and every what went on over there\nAre a good question and how did it become so fragmented and fractured um you would think\nI don't know you just would think that those guys would embrace the opportunity to represent their country the opportunity to play on a team I mean let's face it\nWhen you're\nWhen you're a kid playing the most fun is being a team like\nI told my kids when they were younger so yeah you want to play golf you don't play tennis going to put all of us great play team sports as long as you can\nBe on a team as long as you can be on a team because that opportunity kind of drifts away from you once you get out of college you know your chances to be on a team I mean yeah you could play wreck softball or whatever and\nThat's still fun and I enjoyed it I played softball and I enjoyed it but it's not quite the same thing and um\nFor these guys who are elite athletes and kind of gave up team sports as a kid to focus on an individual sport in this case golf\nTo be able to come back and playing a team environment you would think and I think all listeners the sports talk radio would think would be so much fun\nAnd\nTo have an us to be against them instead of me against you would be so much fun and yet\nThey haven't been able to embrace it and we all\nKnow there are different personalities that's fine that's what makes the world go round we don't want everybody to be the same\nBut\nYou know the greater good there is very clear the top of the pyramid is very clear we want to win these matches and and when the Ryder Cup\nThat's what we want to do so we're going to try to put ourselves the best position to do that that's the top of the pyramid\nHow it got to a point where it became so petty and the jealousy and it really matter who you played with like I don't want to play with him I Want to play with him I don't want to play let me just stop\nPlaying golf\nAlternate shot and he hits the ball you hit it from wherever you get it to you know what he intends to hit it out of bounds or in a poor spot or lay up into a poor spot and put you in a bad spot no one's trying to do that so I don't know garves desk enter your question how it got\nSo bitter but it clearly you know there's I mean you read so many conflicting reports that it's hard to say anything definitive about\nWhat actually went on but there were there were certainly a lot written that Jim fury to team captain was already uncomfortable on the flight over so if that's true then detention ran\nClose enough to the top that it was palpable but he could feel it and\nGot to fix that 'cause it's supposed to be fun I mean they should be under pressure but having fun\nAnd\nThey got to fix that 'cause it's supposed to be fun I mean they should be\nUnder pressure but having fun you know it's like you know it's\nLike as we like it wasn't Minnesota two years ago yeah that was fun yeah that was a little much fun yeah that there were people like me who actually turned away from Sunday NFL for a couple of minutes at a time to watch how much fun that was what age what age ...\nAnd all that yeah yeah that was fun that was a fun Ryder Cup and that's and the Ryder Cup she'll be about fun yeah and that's it and it looked like they were intimidated over there and it looked like they\nYou know it almost looked like they decided let's pretend that we don't care because if we do care and now we're being embarrassed so let's pretend it's no big deal to us\nAnd you know good for you guys and uh we'll just act like you know it's as much bigger deal for you than it is for us so good for you\nWhich is not true you know it's a way to lessen the pain of getting something you didn't\nThat you really wanted that you then tried to pretend you didn't really want because it's clear you weren't going to get\n'em but Mickelson really punishing\nYou can never do this right I mean ever you can never blame throw out blame in spots where you did not perform\nAnd the person you played against played exactly the same conditions and did perform you can never ever ever ever ever\nCome off looking good\nComplaining were you and your opponent played under the same conditions and they thrive in you suck and basically that's what it came down to Mickelson was terrible over there\nAnd that's that you don't need to add to it the guy who played against was playing the same conditions your he had no advantage except for you may have played the costs more than you did\nBut that's it and it was\nDisconcerting to hear him whining about how unfair the course was two weeks after a week after the embarrassment\nAnd\nYou know pretending that that his opponent didn't play the same course didn't play under the same conditions it just made him look really petty and\nCouldn't have won him many fans and probably change some people's mind about him who might have liked him a little bit more before\n\nNo huge age sky watch whether the whether

it's about the\nOf their careers and then how they had to cut the movie and how it really became like Bill Murray every line and catty shocked that Bill Murray offered what was that lived\nHe didn't read any script they told him what it was what the premise was and that was it and the movie was supposed to be a lot more about the relationship between Maggie\nAnd Danny and it all got swallowed up

where in the end alley have two theories that two hour and ... nothing with both those theories\nJust getting starting yesterday I understand sometimes you have to play a little bit ... you know more games than you would like on a given day where you have to throw up or matchup yesterday but as a baseball fan it's just so tough to watch it really is\nI like it more when and how it's set up for today and also Sunday where you got the ... games with the Indians and they asked shows the Yankees at the red Sox and on Sunday you got Milwaukee at Colorado Los Angeles at Atlanta when you have to ask a baseball fan\nAnd it's just when you can maybe when some of the younger generation over\nWhen you ask gay young fan or even maybe an older fan I get it there's baseball traditionally that we're going to watch every game\nGonna watch every pitch sit there with the beer the peanuts their cracker Jack and ...\nAnd I love the ... will be policies that when you ask a ban yesterday and I'm coming from a Mets fan perspective let's say someone with with the dog that don't have a dog in a fight this is not\nBeing Indian than actual Santa Rockies fan brewers fan Yankees Red Sox that lantern Dodgers\nWhere you're going to watch your team ply and maybe some of the other match ups as well but if you're talking to someone like myself that doesn't have a dog in this race and you just want to\nWatch these game to ask a band to make a\nBoard game commitment in one day it's just too much baseball\nI don't watch to baseball games a day but when you asked me to watch what you might use than than Colorado Milwaukee Yankees Red Sox and Atlanta\nAt all I it's just too much and one day and all the odds are listening audience\nColorado Milwaukee Yankees Red Sox and Atlanta\nAt all I it's just too much and one day and all the odds are listening\nAudience I watched a little bit of Cleveland I used to I caught maybe a few at bats at Colorado Milwaukee I watch the entire Yankees Red Sox game and maybe I saw happening\nOf Atlanta at a law but if you would have put on a schedule and we don't want the season going into mid November but if you put out a schedule like you did today and tomorrow\nObviously wants to some college football but obviously they're not using up the whole way on a computer when the Yankees for the red socks off it up the whole way don't mix of my college football there but when you ask a band to make that commitment for four games and you're not going to do that especially when you're trying to win over a younger generation\nWe're baseball I've been fading in some parts and what what's the problem with people my age and younger we all have short attention spans our\nAttention spans thank Charles Barkley was terrible\nMan they are but\nFans to make that commitment for four games they're not doing that come on you agree or\nDisagree well like when he was a very anymore written really ... did you watch all these four games that I\nKnow because I had work but\nIf you're a fan you're going to watch regardless and you just mentioned they're trying to market to a younger generation well what better time than on a friday when nothing else is going on and you still the spotlight you know for the entire day\nYou're complaining about four games in one day I don't know how to handle an NFL Sunday or better yet how you're going to handle a college football Saturday tomorrow when you got wall to wall games greater intrigued more excitement\nNot saying baseball postseason as an exciting because it is very much but NFL that's to me\nI'm used to and that's all I'm program that's my religion on Sunday I get out the chip I get out the food I sit on the couch I make my small bats I lose my money and I watch football from start to finish some lock them up my fantasy team locked him with my team and that's\nWhat I Am accustomed to and that's what I Do all the time in baseball and I get\nDuring the regular the job on seven eight nine ten eleven twelve Thirteen game tonight but in the regular semi watch it all the games I watch my team and then maybe what the big national matchup is on Sunday night or but what's a Fox game on a Sunday afternoon\nBut in a post season and it's only one day we had the foreign and for in a row and usually they do a good job at two piece but to add that than to make that commitment for four games I'm curious what the numbers were for those for game I really am I didn't get a chance to see him I don't know if they're out yet because the games just ended\nBut for four games that commitment that's just too many when they're not going out\nEvery than to sit there for all four games they're not\nThe goal is to make every market be able to tune into their teams game without being distracted by something else\nSo if I'm a Yankee fan yeah I'm getting jacked up for seven thirty ... Yankees Red Sox and prime time all the time right to no brainer regardless if another teams a fan of another team up on the end of the Astros let's say I'm locked into my teams game and then maybe I'm In ... later at the seven thirty\nThey're not trying to get everyone to watch every single game they're trying to get each team's market locked in onto their game where they don't have to be distracted and you don't have multiple games going simultaneously sue the baseball fan that isn't working and the baseball fan that cares and watch multiple\nLet me ask you this though let's say if they would've just scheduled two games apiece\nYou're more likely to watch Colorado at Milwaukee if you were available to watch that if you were in a four game stretch what is the entry to make the commitment to Colorado Milwaukee for Ben Horwitz an east coast guy\nOut when you have to you have the ... also available Yankees Red Sox lamp that the Dodgers in the same given day what the industry and\nFor the right to LA series still at the same question he might have been given day intrigues\nI'm a baseball fan and I want to watch the sport if they're on at the same time I have no interest unlocked in on my\nAnkle you're telling me what to say that the bosses gave your off yesterday they said you don't have to come into work sending home do whatever you want you know maybe take a girlfriend out for dinner who knows you're telling me you watch all four of those games yesterday\nLocked in for ten hours probably not but I Would have been invested in all four and I'm going to be told especially now that you can lay a few shackles on in New Jersey yeah I'm going to be a lie and that\nI'm In New York so I wasn't able to do a little uh in game live betting herself but let me ask you this how many of the games that you watch yesterday I watched the piece of all four of them really yeah I did okay how how long is a piece\nAgain eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine\nThis is John Green and if your teeth are staying from coffee tea or smoking power swabs as the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shapes even better there is no messy strip show trees that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just wipe your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try and power swabs call one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night\nYou're white white smile will have your friends talking about how great you look\nTry at risk free one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night that's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\nThat that'd be a JAG take you to see them easing legend share live in concert in Omaha Beach I help center I may have serious concerns are constantly\nOver the top costume changes and high energy choreography all of our greatest hits ... price of one hundred and eighty one dollars per person and for this great seats infection wind plenty and the Motown\nDoor the W.

I was just\nIt was terrible laughing I was a good deal yeah\nNo it's it's a no brainer for what you gave up or the lack of what you gave up and it's a no brainer and he's going to get criticized for it and the way that he's played is going to get criticized but here's the beauty baseball you play again you play today and you're better show up but you're not going to play out in the wild card game when you have a home run\nYour it shouldn't be complaining about it for most of the regular season there's been some stretches where he was called\nBut John Carlos ... baseball player one it'd be big drag them would want him on a different team from Yankee fan I Would still watch I'm going to stand on my team but you got to be better you can strike out four times\nIt just Canada postseason game

game and you're waiting for chemical to come on last night they got three runs but they could have got more\nAnd because they did not get more is the reason they lost the game not you know Jacob the

face the bills coming up Sunday at one PM eastern in Buffalo and that of course is Logan Ryan is kind enough to join us right now on CBS Sports radio Logan thanks for the time and how are ya\nI'm good how about your mom doing fantastic and that was some football game last Sunday when you guys are down Seventeen just three I did count chatted a football game and I was the one that ended up looking stupid for that how did you guys turnaround up against ... which was a great effort by your football team\nI don't think you're the only one that uh looks better [laughter] out is out\nOf the good thing as we did it and then you know the players and coaches all that matters when it comes to Sundays\nAnd uh we just stuck to it man we got a little more aggressive and we started getting some stops on defense and obviously a lot of quarterback mark has played a great game and core Davis and off and were able to make those costs time plays in fourth quarter and then over time to um you know cars to victory we just try to stop\nWe just play better eventually was kept there and we did but we just did a better life when the pressure was on\nYou mentioned your quarterback I saw a statistic yesterday seven game winning drives in his last sixteen games you guys convert fourteen Fifteen for instance for and\nThen obviously the forced into on a way to a touchdown for victory just watch it on the sideline what is it like to watch a market scenario the operator fence especially in collection\nI mean it's it's awesome you kind of practice ... up and he's able to do some of that two minute he's able to put someone\nIn jobs together and we know he's a later this team and it was the way it off and see you know he's one of our best players and or any of the parents are Quebec or reason and you know very well made a good point you know three weeks ago I Will say markets there's no good and\nAnd you know where no good and now he says the player of the week you know that's how this week works got to try to ignore the noise that you can and I believe in yourself which markets always does and I and I do personally and stick with the process and you know those opportunities coming out there and make a place\nYou gotta love what channel on how to say after the game how he thinks the titans deserve more respect especially with you guys taking down the Superbowl champs in the jaguars and back to back\nWeeks do you feel that a lack of respect that you guys get nationally and and how much does that motivate you guys\nI think everybody has some type of chip on his show I'm personally or wherever they were drafted whoever whatever team skipped them\nUm national media\nPicked again you know everyone picked against us I mean there's\nThere's definitely motivational factors you could definitely use that uh but you know respect has earned and I think we're starting to earn it uh with you know all this you know new media attention I Would say but um you know we've got to keep it doesn't matter if we don't win this we gotta we gotta keep her role and we've got to take a take on buffalo we saw they did the Minnesota\nI'm so we've got to keep her own and all that stuff will come and do time\nYou have to challenge though is the team makes you can be four games running around after games with the titans flag and you must be some character inside that locker room\nIs my passion that's what makes them the best one of the best in the game is as passionate as well for the game he believes it all out there and and people know who he is and and he talks began but he backs that up too so uh you know that that just saying that you know generally Hammond is great ... great TV I'm sure I have a podcast or show one day\nLogan rhyme with this right now and CBS Sports radio so you got to start off year up against the dolphins in a game that\nI've literally like never ending with all the lightening delays and all that you guys end up losing that game especially with all that was being said about you and the off season then you lose tackles left and right a quarterback goes down with an injury for a little bit how did you blackout all the noise to get this team to where they have to be on a three game winning streak\nStuck with it man stuck with it were blue collar two weeks later a lot of close game Miami game was a close game for seven hours um we we just we just stick

I did they have to give up the ... now junior and that's a nice little boy in production in a very good surprise by a Kentucky so far been five an hour to big wins\nWhat they're able to do up against Florida and what they were able to do up against them is to be standing you've got to another big game coming up with an M later today so that should be a bomb on but let's take a look look at that Kentucky and I'm getting also look at a few other games will go through five games right now also get picked in in this hour as well and we'll start things off just in the preview\nWith Alice you at Florida a little five twenty to match up in the swamp\nLSU has been one of those other surprises this year everyone Canada mouth people saying it or is Rhonda and make it through a few weeks of the season they beat Miami or LSU also had a big went up against Auburn when they were traveling in the fourth quarter they come back they win the game eh let's use the top team this year\nThey enter a top stretch starting this week with Florida\nThen you have Georgia Mississippi State and in Alabama but it's now it's you know they are very fundamentally sound that strong on defense they know how to create turnovers and change the field position\nBut then there are parents have been a whole lot better than what people thought they could run the football birth set it does a very nice job picking up the top yard but then jump borough has been this\nIt's been a whole lot better than most people thought they could run the football birth set it does a very nice job picking up some tough yard but then Joe borough has been a surprise for them and we all know his background and what the state or Mr Ohio and all that\nBut no interceptions on the year for Joe borough and that's what it's going to need to do later today because they are better she was better than Florida and Florida and big games this year I I just you know I don't love them\nBecause they lost to Kentucky and they they lost their thirty one game win streak up against Kentucky\nAnd I know Florida got the went up against Mississippi State last week but Mississippi State when they go up against legitimate come a competition and the good this year we stay on the Kentucky twenty seven inch sharp in that case they're not have point favorite\nFlorida last week Mississippi State only score six points\nIt was Thirteen to say so you get a better answer on what Florida is today\nAnd that game the way they want it is by turnovers and also taking advantage of that home crowd\nLet's get to FSU at Miami\nReally tag or needs to victory in the worst why but this game at Miami Miami seventeenth of the nation and I'm Still trying to figure out what Miami is this year as a football team as they go to a poor start with the only one start where you know they lose the the first game of the season\nWhich was your discouraging see Alice you thirty three to Seventeen now on a a four game win streak debate UNC forty seven to ten last week\nAnd it's the game the three thirty pm eastern ABC Willie ... and the worst why I just think that this Miami team is better right now and ESPN they have an any point five percent chance when the game to spread is that\nA fourteen points\nI Will not surprise me it's a little bit lower scoring a little bit tighter than most people think but at the end of the day he got like this Miami team had to take down Florida State who's three and two on the air and Florida State yeah lost the Virginia tech to open it up and moved to Syracuse thirty seven\nFeet Louisville last week twenty eight to twenty four and why I and I use thirty seven through Nineteen\n... got by er Sanford by ten points that the Miami a little bit better and obviously a lot better than Florida State of Miami should uh be able to get another victory up against foreign stated by me did win the football game and throwing fashioned last year\nOr maybe a little bit closer expected by so like Miami and when the football game and when they are going away in the in you know the cuts drives late in the game they'll probably that this is themselves but virus that they got to show the pulse early on Emily ... could use this victory at once again 'cause I've been a great start his tenure but I tend to forget not down to panic had to get the coach like that a little bit of patience\n\nHe's glad you're still here no back to the sec guild show\nThat's right and CBS Sports radio toll free line of eight by by two on two forty two twenty seven as broad as you bike I go great news there is a quick way you could say money switch to a guy go get a guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could save ten percent\nOr more on car insurance spending now junior going to join us in about Fifteen minutes the junior running back from Kentucky and our picks this week we will pick the Kentucky game and we will do our picks for college football right now or three games right now it's up to ... percent them [noise]\n\n\nWay of getting a college football season all states standing at the end of the segment 'cause I have to do some quick math and sometimes that takes a whole lot longer than I think but I Do believe ... Horowitz is still in the lead and has a little bit of room to\nBut you know and feel a little bit comfortable but we shall see as we continue this ... in the college football season let's get to the\nGames will start things off with Texas Oklahoma Oklahoma is a seven\nPoint favorite hairs and interesting nugget\nUp who is the D.C at taxes have found a lot of success up against Lincoln Riley in two thousand and six years on the east and that that did shut down\nAnd got the victory and then last year the only team in the nation's a hold of a home or\nA hundred and sixty was not used in that that did shut down Oklahoma and got the victory and then last year they only see him in the nation's hold Oklahoma to under thirty points just at twenty nine but so under thirty\nThis is a game where\nI'm probably going to hate myself for land the seven points with Oklahoma promotes away because I think Texas is a little bit competitive and it's competitive and maybe they could even take the lead and this ball game but right now I just have a tough time\nPicking again calamari and what he's been able to do for this Oklahoma teamed up fun match up\nSeven versus Nineteen and Oklahoma and Texas and give credit to Tom Hartmann who got off to start this year was hearing a lot of noise and the the the way that his team as bounce back is a good effort and a nice job after what happened in Maryland there on a little bit of a wins drink four straight games they beat us see they beat TCU\nI just think Oklahoma's the different animal and do have some fun but at the end of the day Lincoln Riley encounter Mary have more fun give me Oklahoma laying the seven points horror with what you got\nLove that you took Oklahoma because I'm going to go the other way jackass\nThe sooner had been just fine without making me feel this year thanks as you pointed out to the red hot started ...\nWith the talent the centers have enough and there should be some big place to be hot however the long horn defense has surprised this year holding us the TCU and Kansas State all and shy\nLittle nugget for ya oh how about that\nOver the chicken ... over the last four meetings between these two teams every time it's been decided by seven or fewer points and with Oklahoma State playoff inside expect taxes to leading the time the possession which would allow them to mitigate some of what Oklahoma dolphins is capable\nFormer wins they can protect us keeps a close enough I'll take the long horn plus seven figure twenty eight twenty three\nJust broke my heart out right now ... I Know you're taking Oklahoma\nYou're wrong jak taking taxes\nOne of us are going to be one of us are going to be right that's true one of us will be wrong to as well more likely to be you and me a gimme gimme Texas or like Ben said history is on the long horn side a week when you take a spreading into account and the sooner we just had a history of us even people in game so far this year so you mean the only one\nVery go getting number one in the book scan number two there are a little curve ball here and try to get some good mojo going and maybe just trying to break a street could get a little superstitious year LSU at Florida\nLSU a to point pay for it that hard with\nLet's say if you you know show us what your will react I Love how you're like I'm going to throw a little wrinkle what that means is I don't know where I'm going I'm no no no no I'm going to react on that anywhere I'm going to have the uh the Picard you've written that right oh I see a write anything with your pet I'm going to call yeah I'm doing some mental map right we all know how\nFilthy Florida as defense is and that's really the only way to put their third and turnover margin and sit in takeaways in the nation but we know that Florida is often isn't going to explode against the LSU defense who helped a couple of guys that are going to be playing in the NFL very short\nThat means that joke rural won't have to take too many chances and he still has yet to throw in interception I could see borough managing a low scoring game and being able to do enough late justice squeak by so I like LSU to win violate field goal give me a list your mind is to\nBan harvest by the way with a four game lead on myself and also ... and I have\nHad the same record this year and then who got all the help from Brian jak with him but we'll credit than for the expertise so far ... from what you got\nUm taken LSU I Can't believe I'm going to say this but I'm going to depend on LSU often and it and an eight or drawn often to make more pleasing somebody else the meal is if\nI go tigers I Love LSU in this law in\nFlorida the way they win this game as the environment and the swamp and making jokes borrow turn over the football LSU just has a better defense LSU to me it's just the better team and borrow has not turned over the football with interceptions this year LSU I think that\nThey witness game I think they may be winning by ten plus\nBut this is the start of a very tough run for LSU we're we will learn a lot about this football team as you have Florida you have Georgia yeah Mississippi State whose fading when they play a big teams and you have Alabama a top four games stretch\nYou don't want to start it off with an el up against Florida\nI don't think they're looking ahead to Georgia Florida that's a tough environment if you look ahead you'll get creamed in this game\nBut I like LSU to win the game you got to go with that and that or is there on so go tigers we will take LSU alright ... number three that means we're all analysis you dip your intelligence take Florida because the three of us are probably going to be wrong\nA good number three that's one of the seven pm eastern Kentucky and then ... junior going to join us in a few moments from now we'll talk to him get his thoughts that I Am and what they were able to do the first few weeks of the college football season at five and I would open up at six and a half\nI seen it go down to four and a half the line I'm seeing right now though is that five and a half\nWill go to great set folk first Kentucky I Am College Station Kentucky is a five and a half point under dog the NFL team five and a half point favorites what you got for supper\nI'm taking the Wildcats they have to be one of the best stories of college football they're undefeated as he said they they're undefeated as underdogs against the spread give me the Wildcats\nMiss the harlot I Know that now coming on the shows that don't don't annoy him know and he's been terrific to basically put entire op eds on his back and we all know that\nBought Texas saying on is the best in the FCC against the ... and the question I asked is what does Kentucky do if they're not able to establish through or do you trust Terry Wilson to put the office on his back idol\nI Would expect them to shut a a snow down but not completely\nThey'll do just enough to be able to win the game gimme Texans saying them to cover\nTwenty four Seventy impressed by what they did up against ... and then also a little bit up against Alabama [noise]\nWriting Mississippi State when they play Kentucky I mentioned the defensive statistics we all know Benny now ended up going for a hundred and sixty five yards and not one not to not three but four rushing touchdown this'll be a close game I think it's a toss up on who wins it\nBy Kentucky as an underdog they've been disrespected the entire year and they're still five in oh I like Benny ... junior I'm not going to tell that guy no give me Kentucky to stay within the five and a half so I Will take them getting the five and a half points\nOh junior I'm not going to solve that guy no give me can talk to you to stay within five and a half so I Will take them getting a five and a half points to recap these games real quickly as we have some disagreement\nAgain which so far it's gone in the favor Mr Horwitz Alex you in Florida we're all on LSU land the to\nThe games we disagree on Kentucky I'd add on you just heard myself ... uh taken Kentucky getting a five and a half and I'm through with the are with laying the five and a half and then finally Texas and Oklahoma\nA little bit of disagreement here through verse won harmless for cell phone on Texas getting the seven points I think that's the home lighting the seven point those are the picks\nFor the college football season we could shut it down I Will take time out when we come back\nBen Horowitz man up in ... junior I'll be very ... junior though and he joins us on the show as I think he's one of the best stories in college football very much looking forward to our conversation with the next is we'll find out a little bit more about him\nWhat this team and we all saw the victory up against Florida where are you guys snap that thirty one game losing streak\nAnd then a few weeks later you're back it up against Mississippi State and to me that victory up against the Mississippi State or is the most impressive because it displayed to me that you guys weren't satisfied with the a quick start and that this group still has a whole lot of hungry football so to show to the rest of the nation\nYou're very definitely starting off with the ... you know just prior years before that\nWe were just so close you know we were just we were just they just wanted were hidden or we were beating are served ... head of the day was born in our good will come away with we're\nGoing forward we remember it with their ... and ... we we we ... we were\nThere and we were covered in her environment a big environmental exposure or were away\nWe just wanted to focus on practically football or standard pep me fair and we were able to because they're gonna they're stronger now we're going to the ... that was the ...\nYou know great competition and we were going to be war from the start of the ... or ... ...\n... ... a pretty good undergraduate or getting a bar and our her off at the murdered a great job or ... or ... or ... or we could come in at the pool that we were able to read\nAnd I caught the interview that you did with the FCC network after the Mississippi State victory and you said hey everyone's been doubting us I'm really proud of my team and I want to keep on proven people wrong it makes me wonder and ask you where did you think this team was going to be when you guys wearing camping getting ready for the season\nOr this is what I expect in order to I've written spent the good I'm Glad you're you know I could do that to this year is different\nEvery body floating on the corner of war and a bit better there there are ... are a lotta out All right and on about ... ... and um you know ... what a ... school of I we both are in the ... going to run over\nOr under the career could have ... guard we're critter around here that that's not the case\nYou know going going over to conceive that clearly ... is that we're going to be a ... were were making a turnaround now and what we don't want to be underground or more because on the game and we would folk quote I'm going to get so close and we would make a mistake to\n... and the game so aren't being able to say that I happened to ... ... that'd be it'd be a good thing to cook us where we knew degree so I'm excited\nWhen you look from your freshman year and you've always had success personally act Kentucky to see where this program is grown in the way that you've grown out what's different from when you came in two thousand and sixteen to where we currently sit in the year two thousand and eighty in with you know what you've learned and what you've seen from this program\nI think the war I could I could see their ... their their grind out of a lot more player when they're not have lost person more ... than me mom I'm ... years no ah we used to hurt the girls' team now requires you know that they would they would think\nIt would take the part of it can go into the practice or going in the gang and you know it would bring it would bring some of the dog down for the team now now I'm going into this year after Lehman Whitey\nAnd you know it was bringing it would bring some of the guys\nNow sort of a team down now going going into this year they've got their Lyndon eighty or especially with the um the ...\nHere right now with these guys always wanted to get better guy who spend extra time in ... outside of ...\nI'm I'm I have questions for ... for the protests question experiments on often so we're constantly getting better when making\nEach other better every single day because we can get work when you get better everyday\nAnd around here because he was starting to get better every day so it's a great thing um how we've grown we've grown so much especially with um our old facility students got the million dollars could have looked for Seventy so things will just on the on the upper hand for\nTalking advantage no junior right now the Kentucky Wildcats running back on CBS Sports radio why did you go to Kentucky I understand that you were someone that were overlooked in the recruiting process but why was Kentucky the right school for you\nThat the Kentucky was perfectly because I I Know I Know what it feels like to talk of overlooked and\nUm when when looking at Kentucky where and when I was getting recruited there wasn't they weren't they weren't off the top level that they could be you know I could see that were given better each year but we're not we're not ... ... a good

coming up on Sunday we will talk to Eric ... who will join us since we've already had on Logan rhino in Tennessee titans play buffalo and also Benny cell junior was born in the last segment so we will talk to Eric what'll and thirty five minutes\nAnd we've already had on Logan rhino his Tennessee Titans play buffalo and also Benny cell junior was fun in the last segment so we will talk to Eric what'll and thirty five minutes from now and get all of his thoughts on the very surprising start\nBy the Baltimore Ravens at three in one and they're on the conversation to win the AFC North but the struggles of the Pittsburgh Steelers either like Baltimore going into this year with their backs up against the wall to get a wildcard spot there not envisioned them winning the division of only a quarter or way through the season\nSo that AMC north is clearly something we're going to track\nThe rest of the way but you heard him Peters update a lot about baseball as it this time of the year I think October is the best sports month\nOut of the twelve on the calendar because he had the baseball playoffs yet the NHL just getting started you got the NBA right around the corner you gotta NFL football already a quarter of the way in as we're now in week five so you start to get a feel\nAnd get a sense of who is and who are the teams that are really starting to look like contenders and who are the teams that are still trying to show themselves in the teams that are in the gutter right now that weren't supposed to be the gutter how will they play out the rest of the way\nAnd then we also have college football with a good play the game not great\nBut a good play the games are coming up later today with jealousy Florida a little FSU Miami rivalry Kentucky had a and M. Notre Dame Virginia tacky get Trevor Lawrence coming back\nFor Clemson up against Wake Forest so\nYou got some okay games on the schedule a lake forest clubs and shouldn't be close but there's some\nIntrigued there with Lawrence coming back and the other games you want to see like a team of LSU that's been very good this year and then going to Florida and get a victory or Kentucky go into College Station and get a victory continue their ways and then can Notre Dame what they knew quarterback who's played well\nGo take down Virginia Tech who didn't lose the Old Dominion by Virginia Tech is better than the team that they did but on out of the football field when they did lose the Old Dominion so that can can be a little bit closer than what people could thing but for Notre Dame you've gotta went out to get into the college football playoff in each and every week the pressure is going to be on them because they're going to be favorite\nThe rest of the ... but we do have baseball I mean for games yesterday which for me it's way too much for games\nAnd I have to pay attention to all these games I didn't watch all of these games for a full nine innings yesterday I watched the entire Yankees Red Sox game I watch most of the used in Cleveland Indians game\nThe Dodgers game up against the Braves and it gets that much of it's all a little bit of it the brewers and Colorado watched a few innings but for me it's just too much baseball and I'm someone that\nI don't have a dog in this fight\nAnd I want to tune in I Want to watch\nGames like later today where you had that bizarre start timing for thirty seven pm eastern and then if a team which is fine but I don't know why at the center for thirty seven just start thinking for thirty for crying out loud\nI'm by those two games on Saturday I watch them in of course watch both those games with the college football on Sunday when you got to games more than fun to watch both of them but when you ask the baseball fan\nTo watch for games at a day it's just way too many it's too much baseball especially when you're trying to get the attention and garner the attention of the younger fans who have short attention span that doesn't make a four game commitment\nAnd it's just too many games are ... seats that when you would love love to watch all of them but you just can't\nGet lots of nine innings another ... another nine innings\nAnd then another line and just too many games but we did have some good baseball yesterday and well that's a bad baseball in the national league it's been too disappointing series\nYou look at the Dodgers and the Braves the brace haven't shown up offensively and the Dodgers they've shown up with pitching and also what their back there were three oh winter's yesterday they go to on the series ... Shaw a strong good luck with him jets that comes in the game only allowed one hit three hits combined between Chris Ron Johnson\nAnd Johnson and are they find a way to win the game or three nothing and they go to all Machado gets a home run ... gets a home run as well\nAnd now they are one went away from going back\nTo the NFC I Swear a year ago they did go to the world series before losing\nTo the faster so the Dodgers look like they're well on their way to get back down and so yes I don't give the Braves especially the young roster and they've been a fun story this year much of a chance to come back and this one but we'll see if they could show some fight and maybe get one more industry for a game for example to one game three in the series coming up on Sunday brewers and Rocky's\nYou over ten thousand dollars in back taxes you called every ... were mailed there\nThey all said the same thing making promises they never keep and your sick of it what you really need is a new start on your bank Texas\nIf your face would garnishment celebrities audits were years of ... tax returns will fight\nTo get you to a new start you deserve call one eight hundred three one two Ninety nine Seventy\nOur new start program could stop collection efforts remove any leans the IRS has employees and help you reduce your back taxes by as much as eighty percent that's right eighty percent don't wait until another tax season ends at another year penalties in interest or editor your balance you oh at least ten thousand dollars to the IRS\nAnd need a new start on your back taxes call one eight hundred three one two Ninety nine Seventy ... three one two Ninety nine Seventy live they'll professionals they post one financial group fight to get you a new start\nYou deserve again that's one eight hundred three one two Ninety nine Seventy\nYour home or Kansas City chiefs football is W. J. G. [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\nSo bleak to hang with you ... [noise]\nHard top of my real quickly welcome back in the military is self reliant bought five to one to forty two twenty seven is brought to you by guy go great news is a quick way you can save money such the guy 'cause it a Geico dot com\nAnd in Fifteen minutes you'd say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance what says Twitter beef I'm getting nine hundred notifications you arguing with this guy what are you arguing about I'm not reading this all the arguments\nDone he was finally like yeah you're right okay well what was it about not then he started off about ... ... it was your tweet in response to somebody was somehow I got thrown into it the ... about the giants and you know I Can't resist [laughter] so he ...\nSo he says\nThe way the giants are playing now make that a pot on the board a little bit louder next time you play us out dropped Rousseff All right [laughter] right where it needs to be geez I just got woken up for not loudness I\nHe said the way the giants are playing now and with the NFC East being a competitive division early early being the key word I don't see them turning it around anytime soon that was in her apply to you but I guess I was in the threat and I just said back I don't understand what you mean by the NFC East being competitive early\nYou have one team in the division over five hundred\nYeah and you've got the eagles at two and two and the cowboys at doing All right ... which\nAgain the giants are winning the analyses but this notion that giants are making the playoffs nine and seven can't make the playoffs\nYou think the giants are going to nine games you're still riding the strain I don't think it\nI think it's possible\nI understand they got a little bit easier schedule you know ... years ear bud schedule but if ... back to them as questioning their heart\nYou think that this heart will be there after they go through a little bit of losing stretch which it I don't see them turn it you think they're going to be Carolina this week\nI don't but let me ask you what happens if they do\nAnd they do they have to show me two weeks in her eyes to the same thing after the Texans game and they'd be Carolina\nGive them around to applause nice job because I don't think it's going to happen but then you better back it up the next week they beat the taxes and they didn't even show up in the ... at the bar you beat\nCarolina and now you're looking at a home game against the Philadelphia Eagles who we can all admit\nOr not living up to and playing up to expectations right now either I I Know you're on I I Know you do you and I sometimes I say that I think that you're a little too overconfident eagles because I'm just looking at what they put on on the field I think they're the best team in the NFC St period or not\nBut what they put on the field and what they put on tape so far ... has not been good\nBut there's there's no salary the secondary it's been a problem and the Pentagon has been a problem and you won't want a whole lot of games and your second there is a problem and often the lines of problem telling me about I think the ... yeah I Know 'cause I'm preaching the choir for you because you're you're secondary stinks you're up into line terrible\nUm by with the eagles I think they get the offensive line going the secondaries a problem and you need you need a good pass Russian eagles Africa pass rush but I already talked about and that was ruled out for the game up against Minnesota and then a in a way not as questionable for the game but that could be a tough one biking is an eagles is a tough tough tough\nGame I I Would stay away from that actually right now I lean towards the bike and\nUnless they lean towards the Vikings two and three there are two and three the giants went on Sunday there are two and three and now you've got two teams going at each other on prime time at metlife stadium on Thursday\nBoth teams season then kind of hangs in the balance but like I mentioned the giants second half gets easier you set it on the air I've said it all the prognosticators have said it at the giants can get through the first half of their season at five hundred ... they're in good shape\nHeads during ... and I understand that we don't look too far ahead 'cause we didn't get to the games you know coming up yet for this weekend\nIf that was it eagle giant game right now I take the eagles just because two things eagles doing I shall up against the wrong and I think they're going to get some success but you didn't have to go off to win in my opinion and then\nHow did the giants blocked the eagles front which you would assume would be healthy\nBy that and he does not help this on a lot of names are not defensive front they don't but as you mentioned the eagles offensive line is struggling by that point they should\nHave a giants get a pass Rochelle Olivier Vernon who hasn't played yet back by that Thursday game and that changes a lot of things because I don't think the eagles will be able to run the ball and the ...\nNow I just got a tweet from I guess he's your friend I vote gee uh he says Eli Manning over the hill agree disagree where you add on your you lie manning radar\nOver the hill is ridiculous [noise]\nI think that he lied played\nVery poorly last Sunday against the seats and it was evident even from the stands for normally you don't see everything that he was missing opportunities down the field my fear is that as the season goes on he's going to get beaten and battered and turn into what happened to a\nA David Carr\n... which is happening to the show I'm watching right now by the right where you just get so beaten and battered you have the ability to play but\nYour first instinct is I Need to go to the check down rather than look for my guys down the field that's what I worry but can you make the throws yes is he still ... more than capable of doing all this pre snap reads reading the defense absolutely that\nThat's what I worry but can you make the throws yet is he still ... more than capable of doing all this pre snap breeds reading the defense absolutely that's my concern with him over the hill is ridiculous before I Will ever believe and the giants this year they've got to show me to an around mostly\nIt's able to do that you gotta you gotta start off with one and we'll see what happens after that are coming up tonight you got Carlos ... go and gather coal that's all Indians are going up against the Astros that's for thirty seven pm eastern I'm hoping the Indians win the game the square things up at one piece\nThis used in team though is tough to pick against right now of very tough I think this is a toss up and you got to knock him price sure the numbers on ... seven fifty eight year a verse Boston this year he struggled as late as last you start lashing the post season in ... point nine zero\nAnd three starts twenty innings pitched last year\nSo I trust the knocking the postseason but there are some questions with them\nAnd then David Price by both three ... right and the Yankees as Pedro Martinez would say are David prices daddy\nHas the Yankees had dominated David Price and his career eventually prices due to beat the Yankees right you have to think ... is your daddy aim it'd be tough to\nDepict again the Yankees is one and\nIt'd be tough even feel greatly competed in the Yankees in this one the Yankees missed an opportunity last night and the six and seven productive upon towards Finicum through John Carlos ...\nDidn't couldn't come through but we just see what happens at the Yankees go down to I don't think they'll come back this time around Peter Schwartz is here to morning Peter how are ya I'm doing well how are you sir Yankees win tonight\nYeah I think so I think they'll so no level of concern for me oh I don't consider myself I've seen that when a lot of my life and your ... your ... your islanders right what's that looking forward to your island yeah I'm looked out that he sees that you know let's just forget about the October baseball uh Indians in ... city like\nThe Astros are going to sweep this or why\nNow our bosses are more churn off you know that right it's I Am aware of that yet [laughter]\nSo how about that I I'm real quickly I got about twenty seconds and it gets ...\nToo much baseball yesterday was four games yeah forest too much when they could spread it out a little yeah I didn't like that either just too much that baseball fans your kids aren't going to sit through for games and they didn't they didn't sit\nThrough any of them out of their ... their ... their teams out in the playoffs so they could go there were probably ... probably swallowing a pop tart there'll be swirling when they wake up this morning and daddy was [laughter]\nI forgot to get the Arab well he's going to join us when we come back we'll preview of the ravens and browns with them all to talk about the ravens three and one star book\nEver likes to pick out especially after a big football victory when you go home is it just to say hello to the family then go right to the fridge and just had been there and to scramble\nWell usually on the way home I stopped by the store and I'll go to the local grocery store and get a bunch of items and\nAdd ons and different ice creams and then we'll come home as a family and the kids get to get a a big in as well they make their little balls and in their toppings and\nI never really know what I Want a so after the game in until I get a good feel walking through the aisles of what I'm feeling a ice cream why isn't topping so it's it's always a changing week to week\nTalking well right now in the ... show on CBS Sports radio the last two weeks you've said that these aren't the same ravens and you guys have backed it up what makes it seem different this year\nI just this is a resilient tough group and it starts with our head coach and\nYou know why he preaches and the weight pushes us and the way we compete and this is a unique group ah we're very close we push each other and then and it's one single ... single minded and that's when each week a win the day when the play\nAnd those struggles we've had over the last few years really have molded our character in our in our toughness that virtually ... and and had to go through\nAs a built this team up to where we are now that we feel we can get three in a situation and you know we're going to make it tough on teams that face us is going to be sixty minutes and ... and we're going to grind out burned out wins and in play racket ball\nThe year started I thought you guys were\nBasis is going to be sixty minutes and and we're going to grind out burned out wins and in play racket ball\nBefore the year started I thought you guys were playoff team but I was curious to see how some of the players and coaches would respond with a lot of those guys back up against the wall you mentioned your coach in a coach ... you know Joe Flaco to these are big years for both these fliers it's the attitude they bring a little bit contagious or in your facility right now\nI think it's just a steady\nA confident a blue collar work hard ah type attitude I think it's for everyone I mean it means quoted like look if we if we don't play well individually and collect the teams and then everyone isn't going to be back so it's\nIt's not just those two guys it's it's everyone that you play a lot of years and this lady you have to play well and you have to win games for to stick around so\nI think everyone just came in with the right attitude of of\nOne looking at yourself to get better to learn from our mistakes over the years and then three push each other that that have we've never been pushed\nA as far as as we can in and look what look what you can get and shoot him in Joe's healthy or off into the weapons that we've added dolphins coordinator being here for the third year for Joe I mean a lot of things that have happened\nThat the reasons why we're playing well that a lot of people have taken notice but it's definitely been a team effort in or are the first quarter the season\nI don't know if you ever get over it but how long did it take to put aside how last year finished up against the bangles and that tough week Seventeen lost that kept you guys out of the post season and did you sense a little bit of a some extra motivation in training camp a leading up to start the season\nAh I mean I I look at myself as one of the you know I'm motivated each\nYear I don't need what people say or think or plays I Want to be the best and the and I want to win so\nRegardless of what happened my motivation is always clear and you know as you get older you tend to deal with losses differently per se is as a young bug that they the hangs on to each game\nI got a wife and four kids that that I Love dearly and and they need that at home can't be moping around and and not doing my job at home so uh I'll always remember the play ah the held us out but it doesn't affect who I Am and how I live my daily life um I'm going to go out and be me and and play my best and live with the result\nYou mentioned the family component of it you had to totally just changed coast when you went from San Diego yeah or to Baltimore and it was you know he's not a tough\nUh you know it's very tough and to to your situation and a franchise that you played so many years for just how 'bout the adjustment now be in your number three going from San Diego to Baltimore and still hadn't success on the football field does well after the charges basically told you you weren't good enough\nYeah yeah it's been it's been a great ah three years here I mean we moved here we got up sold our house in San Diego and moved here fulltime and our our kids have enjoyed it living on the east coast this ah\nThis is a great city it's a football town the city the people are amazing ah different diversity different a cultural so living here the last two years have been have been amazing for us and it's nothing nothing\nA means more than being happy and being part of a organization that that uh once you and and believe in you know so it's it makes me go the extra mile to to do my best for them\nAnd we look at so many situations now around the league players in the final year of their contract I Love the battle is won in ... that is right and center you see the unfortunate injury to Earl Thomas who elected to come back and play I you know that situation being in it in your last year in San Diego and they didn't treat your right with\nYou and I are when you said you were healthy with what McQueen at the at the end of the year and then of course what happened with the fine which was just in my opinion not really a ridiculous just take us through a little bit of that perspective the business side of it and what may be the ... Thomas had been through this year\nYeah I mean every everyone wants to look at look at the situations that the player is always the bad guy in these situations and it's it's just it's it's disappointing for me to hear that 'cause how many times every year hundreds of guys get cut before their contract is up so\nUh when the guy is playing at such a high level like those guys are and want to be\nGet an extension look Earl just won an extension I don't know the numbers I don't know anything about that but talking to him and being there for him he just wanted to retire the odd like me\nOne of the retired charger and when you don't feel that they want that and they just want to use you and get you out of there how you supposed to go to work every day\nAre you supposed to go into that building knowing that they don't want you around they just want to use you in in a movie it move on so I feel bad for those guys man and I feel bad for all of the situation is put in a going back looking back in my situation I Wish\nI Would ask for a trade or just not come until the end of the season 'cause it was miserable every day and I'm sure it was miserable for him and and they'll come out and say those things and it's just hard on the players are they give everything for the team the team the team and then comes down to it and\nYou don't feel the same knowledge went back from the organization so stuff man and stuff as players but you live you learn and move on and hopefully those guys are going on their feet and and he ended up in a spot where there are appreciated\nExcellent stopped talking Eric why do right now and CBS Sports radio let's get back to last weekend that second half Pittsburgh right before the end of the first half gets to score they type things up and then the second\nHalf you make them ... four times they turn the ball over on down and then you guys get a pack or they only had six plays max on that given drive or for the Pittsburgh Steelers and the second half just what clicks so well defensively out for you guys unit in that second ...\nWell I think combination of of a lot of things are calls from our\nOur defense coordinator wink or call it a great game uh kept them kept the Steelers off balance and then you know bend missed a couple of throws whether it's from our looks the pressure uh you know the timing being off whatever the case may be\nYou know those those accumulate to you know a few three now and then you get the momentum and are often on the ball and the and they're often just sitting there waiting to get back on the field and uh it was a great team team effort in all three phases to get that job done on the road and the\nOne of the toughest places to play so uh\nWe uh obviously it was a huge win for us and now we've got to build off that and get ready for tough really good Cleveland's team that you know the records show and they could easily have three or four winds right now\nHow is wink ... Don Martin Dale made the defense even better and you're one is at the defensive coordinator\nI you know his personality he's very open these honest I mean throughout training camp or once or twice a week he would he would put on the board\nOf the players numbers in where they stood on the debt chart where they stood as a ... on our defense what we needed to get better individually and when you know where you stand in you have a defense cornea that\nIs about the defense it's about us\nWhat we needed to get better individually and when you know where you stand and you have a defense corner that is about the defense it's about us a as a group it's not about individual you just have a good core belief and core group to to your defense so\nI just think guys that really gravitated towards that and and we work for we worked as one we worked\nFor the ultimate goal of just trying to win games and being the best defense possible not about any individual so when your defense coordinators like that in and expresses his love and honesty to you as a player you can appreciate that as a player and know what you need to work on and know what you need to do to get on the field\nBut we'll get to the sea north match up coming up this weekend in just a bed or let me ask you this though just from last week\nWhen people looked at the end see north ... this year and the off season a lot of people including myself thought it was going to be the Steelers division\nTo win just what they've been over the last few years this dealers teen there's been a lot of drama and confusion did you sense that all on tape or or maybe leading up to the game or even during the game about some of the problems that the Steelers are having with being a little bit more than just football personnel\nOur

and the emissions are reduced by about twenty percent\nAnd they explained that the way they get the computer to time the opening and closing of the valves is they place a sensor up some kind on the Korean shaft\nAnd from reading that article it just really interesting it seems like just when you think the gas engine really cannot be improved the very much\nSomebody comes up with this new system to control the opening and closing all the valves and\nIt just looked super cool I just hope that they can continue to develop this engine and get it into a vehicle some day because it's just a a huge embarrassment in terms of using computers to make engines more efficient\nThey've already got some similar to that in America or in in our cars now they've taken the throttle body off the car completely\nAnd what they've done is they use the they're using oil pressure to power the valve and then electronic solemn wide open and close it and they open the valve they open up more or less to control the Airflow so they open up more than its like opening his rival buddies open at less\nTo cut down those those are still using timing change the one you're describing is I've looked at too and it's it's one step more advanced than that but these these cars that you're talking about they don't even have a throttle body on them anymore they just have a whole like a diesel does the intake with an air filter\nOr a turbo chargers but there's no there's no blade in there to control the the Airflow at all anymore which moves out the Airflow changed everything just changes on them and\nIt's like

Texas it's never going to be easy\nNow you're exactly right you know this is different you know you think of the great like Jordan hair is Oliver and in between the head you George implanted Alabama Tuscaloosa and fantasy when they were going through it they got a hundred five hundred seven thousand whatever it is but this is a different place here because it's it's wealthy man because of the debt to this is a show and the you know really get\nOff the road for a night game and it's going to allow the what the ... the they go on a silent town on the fence anyway so it shouldn't bothered there but just the atmosphere will be like nothing these guys just ever encountered before\n... ...

where they are right now are they ahead of schedule or riding around where they would be what he thought they would be\nNo I think that's the only way or the old judgment on her younger season I I Know here so I Know that the investment and her colleague that aspect of the game in terms of how I got a line of scrimmage so in terms of\nHow we approach the game and clean up the penalties situation we have last year the discipline standpoint I Know that we're we're definitely have a ton of ground to where we want to be but in terms of the entire thing that I was waiting for the under the season and go I'm going to take a look at the process and what resulted from\nYou know guilty talk about changing and fixing the of the discipline issue and ... and that's just that's the lack of focus at times for guys they get tired of get lazy and they start doing things that are detrimental to the program how to change that ... is this like 'cause you don't strike me as the yelling type I changed that of amongst your group\nIt's got to be the off season program I think I think talking about it is absolutely nothing I got to be honest I don't think it has any kind of effect whatsoever the culture of the entire organization has to be different and everyone's got to be held to a standard were\nWell what's there to the point where the entire team has to have the mindset or they will not tolerate anyone or anything that goes in a full ... took the culture so\nIt's sort of by by hiring you know a strength coach that um you know I Believe in a certain offseason program that we had at the place I was out of Alabama and I I felt there was one guy that you run it\nAnd we brought him in here and there was an immediate just I Want to talk about ... of a difference maker in terms of how you approach you're really responsibilities activities and bell\nExcept for its own man in on you know what they're meant up you're going to stop the off season program where you blow a whistle you cross cultural on this and this one pushes back and demands and most of your and if\nYou're not prepared for it if you don't want a big part of it um it'll it'll it'll take care of you\nYeah that's a good description very vivid talking to marry oh Christ of all I coach of Oregon seeking Tierney CBS Sports radio you use the word culture a few times there and as you were running through that I'm thinking of a few\nTough jobs in America not that I Would expect you to comment directly on these schools whether it's Illinois or\nI got a tough it's a tough job we'll that or ... near us coach Rutgers or at the shuttle life it's really hard to get to go as much as you want to reinforce and redevelop of cultures someplace like Oregon where it's been so wrong for so long\nHeisman Trophy winner is where we get all Harrington in you know top five picks quarterback it's a little easier to get it going when there was a culture rather than trying to be getting culture correct\nWhat you

right away and rebuilding is make sure everyone is fully aware and recognize it isn't an auditor solve those camps for you because there was done at such a high level by some great ones in the past\nAnd the worst thing you could do is kind of shut that down and push it away and try to reinvent the wheel you have to rely on that you know you have to rely on some of the former coaches at work

ones I've\nBeen fortunate to be around town and playing and coach and twenty five plus years like I haven't been around forever but I've been around some really good ones and lucky enough to be around for a really good ones and\nIt's one I Believe you said there for now at this level and I think we all think he's just scratching the surface describes a driven dude that\nHe's just relentless about being a ... about increasing because like you about being an unbelievable I mean this guy a ice where he's the type of God if you want to pass but we want to gain ... be just as happy or more happy because what he is he's made the right stuff now\nYeah no those are the type of winners ... that you need now because you got to get real with you because you're you're you're older than I Am forty or forty eight I Believe a but your previous life\nUh you are national champion with Miami and and and I know your your reputation is as of an unbelievable recruiter so when you go in and you're talking to kids what did they know when you say yeah I would've never national championship or are you completely just selling Oregon what's the pitch\nOf from close first of all you get when you're on the
