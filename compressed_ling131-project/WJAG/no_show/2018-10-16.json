that guy in Rogers continues to recover from an injury who suffered and we won the Packers are currently nine and a half points favorites in this game to buy or sell the Packers winning by at least ten points and\nSuch a big number\nAnd I I was two and three of my ... league this past weekend so not exactly ... and the world on fire so far this year but like Fifteen Fifteen\nTwenty nine that of a hundred and sixty three people should not be good enough to be twenty nine that underneath\nThat many people but it is people are very bad at it I guess like me so take them with a grain of salt but I um I tend to a lot of points but in terms of the Packers meal to\nCover the ten by [noise]\nBeen both those teams are banged up in a big way but for me the final conclusion is Aaron [noise]\nThe raiders took on the sea hawks in London yesterday and it wasn't even closest John let me just robbers you said raiders I raiders had to\nSo and others more sorry not sure we could end the right they're regarded\nAs they lost by score twenty seven to three Steve our careers and this one is going out getting three hundred and sixty nine to one eighty five\nAn hour of the matter is that a lot

Fifteen Percent or more in car insurance was just talking to one of the guys good dude works here at CBS Sports radio him a scholarship\nAnd he was trying to tell me\nThat he's going to change my mind on the White House and that people change because I didn't Dwight Howard is a remarkable waste of of town\nAnd I said to ship\nPeople do change and the white has changed a year after year for the worst and it made me think about just we talk so much about these storylines and these athletes homes\nAaron Rodgers Tom Brady LeBron James guy after guy Devin Booker who maximize their abilities or maybe even overcome not being as talented as some of their competition what\nSport has also feel like with life so many people\nWho squandered their opportunities and it's a reminder that no matter how good you are it's on the matter how hard you work at something around talented you are\nIf you lose sight of what got you there if you lose your ability to remember that the world doesn't revolve around you it catches up to you in life doesn't my business it doesn't your business it certainly does in professional sports\nHow many talented guys I mean going all the way back how many incredibly talented guys had been wildly underwhelming not because they don't have the talent or the ability or sometimes even the drive\nBut the humility to understand that you have to evolve and change that you have to be able to bend somewhat your own desires to the reality around you or they Carmelo Anthony I think that applies to him absolutely\nAnd I'll be darned if used in everyone's so high on Houston all this talk about the western conference getting better how to the western conference get better this year\nHouston Rockets to me got worse they lost their two most important defense of stoppers and they add and Carmelo Anthony a guy who is\nClearly on the decline of his career and not a good locker room guy\nI I suppose the thunder arm prove because Milo was gone and that's an interesting team with Russell Westbrook and PG paired together But West Brooks injury throws a great big ranch in those plants clearly the Lakers got better because they had to LeBron James\nPortland's exactly the same team that they were you taught at the same team and I like Utah a lot\nI guess one Arizona John ... minority things Arizona's really going to be this massive massive challenge of act will probably do still wouldn't want to join you know an MBA previewed tomorrow I sources tell me close to the situation that tomorrow is the opening night for the NBA season\nIs it really already the tomorrow yeah that ship that shift in a sale real soon\nYeah so yeah I think a a preview tomorrow would be it would be a great idea would love to get your your picks on some of the awards and end result of the this uh this upcoming season\nGood news Stewart\nThere'll be no writers talk and we talk NBA that is great for you\nOr a five to one to four CBS if you want to give your take away from the opening of the NFL season by the way blown covered by the niners the Packers well into forty niners territory\nStewart and trace we were talking about main takeaways from\nThis weekend my main takeaway when we started the show with it a couple of hours ago I think that we saw on the patriots and in the chiefs the two best teams and they have seen the two teams and a lot can happen between now and then but if I had to put money down are most likely to represent the AFC in the AC championship get\nAnd vie for a ticket to Atlanta and Super Bowl fifty three on CBS Sports\nWhat do you guys what is your one sort of overriding big take away from the week we'll start with a more more smoother isolated it\nStill has a lot more smoothly\nI'm Sorry I'm quite quite a lot more smoother\nMm more smoothly retrace what was the big takeaway\nUm if they're sick and the coverage that my team the culture than the division two how about the tightened just laying an egg at home against the ravens dang shut up for the first time since I moved back to Tennessee which is pretty crazy to think about when you look back\nOr are they just would you believe was Nineteen Ninety nine um they just looked so an ethanol plants that's two games in a row now the officer has not scored a touchdown that great feel good when overtime win over it was at home they moved to three and one we think okay they could challenge jaguars maybe that even for real and the sea and they've laid an egg the last two weeks last the last two games\nI mean I still don't know which way to go on the titans and our base that he's never had talked about him again to make a Super Bowl but I mean are they\nLike for adults too I yeah and I also are we here for the Mario to Winston\nWhen they were drafted one too so Jay miss Winston has definitely been renamed Jamieson losers in here on the show\nI feel like I'm Still reserving judgment on mark is more a no no but that will be his name if or if he doesn't turn things around\nIt just ten or Fifteen hundred and Seventeen yards did not have a passing touched down as the trace eliminated I it's weird because I I I'm On the ... I'm a fan of very very well from what I've heard from people I really trust in the NFL but you got to be able to score points that's a good\nIt's a good take on who's doing that division\nActually the jaguars right they looked so in that though I agree you trust the Texans as bill Brian in Tucson was an opposite is known to man I don't know what's going to walk and I will say this though\nI thought we were pass the bill O'Brian goes eight and eight nine and seven oh one says division and keeps his job situation what happens if bill Brian goes eight eight or nine and seven and the jazz clubs are some kind of weird disaster and they win that division just build Brian keep his job I\nMean if you make the playoffs three or four years of two hundred three years or whatever at can you get fired even if you keep during nine wins I guess you can\nThis job I mean if you make the playoffs three or four years of two or three years or whatever at can you get fired even if you keep during nine wins I guess you can\nIt can be tough to fire him that's the only division with every team in that division having a negative scored differential it really is just right now we just an awful division\nBut every team is three and three except for one team's too which is the team that is that actually one of the five and I'm having trouble keeping track of it all oh it's it's the whole all all traces coal team that's Barbara Stewart what is your take away from the NFL weekend\nMy takeaway is also from my division I'm as a raiders fan or the chargers I just think they played so well lately they've won three straight\nThey uh they I think the third highest score in differential in the AFC um they just look really good to have rivers who's playing really well it's Fifteen touchdowns third in the league Melvin Gordon looks great running the ball so really a team that's been cursed all these years I think\nYou know is in the prime position to make the playoffs probably not winning the division but could win ten or eleven games\nMarks the ball down the field\nFor a touchdown sports writer on Twitter by the way they can reach me there\nSports in my last name REI TR\nAppreciate your list emerging hanging out if I if I have to want to for CBS there's so many TV shows\nSo many TV shows out there that it's hard to focus in on what you should be watching I watched a show a couple of years ago I think and noticed in the subway the other day a poster proceeding three hadn't seen season due to circle back this weekend to the man in the high castle\n... TV show on Amazon Amazon we'll circle back to it in a moment but I Do want to talk some baseball now the gentleman who's been on the show several times you can catch 'em over time it'll be\nIt'll be network analyst former big league pitcher Ryan ... what's going on man\nHey how are ya I'm doing great thanks for making some some time for us so we are and then there were four four teams left what have you made so far the AOL see ads as it's not a one one any sense of who you think has an advantage of this series plays itself out the rest of the way\nUm [noise] no I mean they're both so talented both teams\nReally well put together and um you know great great lineup top to bottom guys that can do damage um they they play good defense they catch the ball they pitched very well um you know the\nThe ... and for the red Sox which people don't go in and been terrific the guys that have had to get in there you know working out a tough outing but um he's he gets the job done if you have experience in it it's a lot of fun to watch these these teams go out there [noise] to me the mayor exciting is watching the world through these watch these scenes but\nRyan Dempster here on the show Ryan used and obviously the defending champions they won a hundred and three games and the Boston won a hundred and eight and such a\nA guarding number if you're a part of that Red Sox team how do you try to distance yourself from the the thought or the perspective out there that having one that many baseball games if you'd only make the world see see series the the season is a failure\nWell yeah you know it's not a failure season was great but\nYou just have to trust in the process but the one that many games you're you're you're the best team in the league all your top to bottom you guys\nYou guys did it so you know how to do it and then it's just going out there and just take it at one time in the play offs just worried about that\nAnd you know in Thirteen when we won the world series that was kind of the whole thing was\nYou know asking guys how many when you do you have in somebody's say fifty it's like no you get your oh\nIt starts now like it's like being being here we go this this is all that matters and it doesn't discount a great season that you have it on and but they're good enough to go to the world series and the good enough to win the world series and but so are the defending champs they're pretty\nThey're pretty tough line up the faith or top to bottom versus oh so it's a it's going to be fun to watch this thing goes seven games\nIn the rye and there's a there's a disagreement that's out there among baseball media and certainly play itself out\nOn this show here on CBS Sports radio ... we have a lot of folks a lot of friends with the show who are very much into saver metrics and there's a lot of great data and insight that that that offers but some of the folks who come on the show a lot don't believe that there's such a thing as as being caught in the postseason as pressure impacting people in the postseason they're\nSome of the guys that come on their world view their philosophy is it's just a sample size situation and guys but at the same way in the regular season as a postseason having never played professional baseball having never play let alone in the postseason I thought I'd ask you what is the difference if there is one\nYou've been having ever played professional baseball having never play let alone in the postseason I thought I'd ask you what is the difference if there is one for guys playing in the postseason versus the regular season just in terms of performance\nYeah I think sometimes\nYou can make the game bigger than it has to be\nUm this at the moment ... has to be so big and when it doesn't it's just still the same simple thing and roots some guys really can do that all the time it can slow it down in those moments and other guys speed it up and um\nAnd ... maybe put too much stock into what that moment is sort of just enjoying that moment for being a baseball game in a really big\nAnd and then struggle in the postseason in some guys want it too bad they want it so much and they struggle and some guys just you know don't do well all your or they had to sixty eight of the crew hitter but they rake in the postseason for some reason there's something about that that unlocks something in them\nThat allows them to go out there and do that so um you know I don't have all the answers to that I Know for me sometimes I I put too much stock into it like this meant so much to me this postseason when meant so much that\nYou know sometimes you've got to just relax and just\nLive live in that moment me against the batter and get that bad or whatever that situation is\nFormer big leader Ryan dumpster here on the show and there'll be network analyst Ryan one of the guys who\nWho has had at least vastly different numbers over the course of his career as Clayton ... Shaw incredible regular season pitcher is E. R. A. mushrooms from two seven three to four to six and I give you all have their stance but just for you what do you make of Clinton curse all the regular season pitcher versus Clinton curse all the postseason pitcher\nUm wall hey man Clinton's out of a lot of really good postseason games too with um you know somebody\nSomebody put it I saw something next player or something and they were quoted as saying you know like the you know you're down to the last four teams and you're a league and those are all really good lineups and I think that's you know not that he's not facing good lined up during the year he dominates ... year and um it starts to get you know\nThey find things they find any little thing they can those guys on the bench where that the guy tipping a pitch or you know maybe noticing a certain pitches and work in especially the technology today and finding out what a pitch is you can eliminate and different things like that I'm ... and it becomes cover it just help her it's not easy like\nYou can have a great season and then go into the post season and all of a sudden you're just face in the team\nIs really really hot maybe you're just you're not he goes all your nonstop\nYou know eight innings aiding Seventy is a horse sets the tone and so um I don't know to judge them on\nYou know why he can or can't patrol in the postseason I think you know I just think it's a really tough thing to see very few special you know John smalls Justin Berliner guys are just crushed in the postseason that's that's a hard thing to do I think sometimes that's not appreciated it up\nAnd and the Dodgers team they've now won their division amazing six years in a row their their game away last year from winning the world series and having worked for the Dodgers radio network I I I Know firsthand just the amount of pressure and expectations of that rather than really loyal fan base\nIt's a really interesting series as you look at Milwaukee versus the Dodgers in this and I'll see as try and do you see a team with a clear advantage\nUm [noise] you\nKnow you went on paper you want to see the Dodgers you know the Milwaukee doesn't have starting pitching they're managing to get it done I mean um they got something there\nAnd they're playing good baseball really good baseball I mean I mean she has a team is just getting the hottest going into the\nInto the playoffs sometimes a good team that's getting really hot and they got learns with canes on the world series might miss talk as one want a World Series like these guys know what it takes and and um\nYou know LA's got a great team too and um but as far as it could anybody could win that's there's no no doubt about it with the and having a weapon like Josh hater in the bullpen that guy's his filthy as can be and um it's going to be it's going to be a really tough series I can I can you ask\nMe over and over I couldn't tell you they don't win that that's it's going to be a lot of fun to watch out because these are two great health yes is going on right now in America nationally I think it's a lot of fun\nYeah it's really exciting and I'm a cubs fan so I guess I'm theoretically supposed be mad at the ... but I got family there\nAnd the brewers earned every bit of where they're at it's been fun watching them play there there is so hot I mean they were on a ... game win streak going back to the regular season before I guess wild game it the more that loss of the Dodgers game to how much does momentum manner Ryan in a postseason how much does coming on the hot streak impact what happens going forward this time of year\nI think it's it's super important um I think especially given such a long season but you can come out of the gates and and then face down the stretch and to be going into the end of the season ends of the playoffs that way when you have the\nYou know the players to do it now you start to feel invincible and you start to feel that you can win no matter what the situation and you find out the tough went oh they almost came back against it so what they didn't we won the game and that's\nYou know that's a really important thing to kind of hold onto and know that you win no matter what it takes and and when you start to do that over and over and over it's like you just everybody walks to the field like with a smile on their face because there really were winning today so we did yesterday in the day before we were there for two weeks have been great [laughter]\nAnd it just keeps rolling and rolling it goes like that I'm telling you it's contagious winning is still contagious\nAnd and you know starting pitching when one of your starting pitchers pitches really well and the next ... which is really well starts to become contagious and both times don't twelve runs and it's like I'm not going to be the get it gets tougher run so and then you see the four teams as it gets closer and closer to more talented deeper lineups and\nThey're out there you know just a playing really good baseball right now the market brewers playing really good baseball\nYeah and the fun to watch and that that that bullpen your reference ... is just so good and so do you and the Dodgers were able to get to it in in that game to game to win for Los Angeles but ... it's been so\nAlmost impenetrable you were closer for for a good chunk of your career very successful one was there a trick they like how just mentally\nHow did you get yourself out there especially in big moments every single time and approach the situation was it different was there a mental trick they use that was ... when you were starting pitcher\nThe sooner you call the faster you can get relief get the maximum loan forgiveness loan reduction or consolidation available plus

I technically there that would probably be the move because then you'd have you can't leave them out with one loss and then you have to live in clubs and out I think they've earned assuming they went out yeah you can't leave comes out and how state if they went out there have to get help if that's the case then yeah you're right\nI don't really know damning them on but I just wanted to put that fear into you know I I didn't pose as a Penn State Penn State um\nAre they still in the U.S on the hunt trace trace I'm not I'm not quite well sorry about\nThat isn't to CNN the lowest Alabama by twenty nine I was a good job guys go to work on almost covered I my football team\nNumber two on another top ten in undefeated team fell on Saturday is number six West Virginia last\nTo Iowa State on the road and it wasn't even close the cycling got off to eight twenty seven lead\nEarly in the second quarter and they never looked back if they want thirty to fourteen they out gained the mountaineers four hundred and Ninety eight yards to one hundred and fifty two and two hundred and forty four of those yards came on the ground last also dropped West Virginia out of the top ten all the way the thirteenth\nAnd quarterback will Greer wet Heisman hose coming into the season has only only completed eleven passes for a grand total of one hundred yards\n... this is why you have to expand the college football playoff because\nI don't want conferences would be utterly un totally unlimited I guess technically Michigan's not eliminated that the team and the Big Ten that the by the way another team I'm just going to throw it out there super biased and I'm from there I didn't go to school that my parents did\nQuietly say attorneys quietly\nTrade she knows a currently five and one and ranked just one spot behind your pen state team but says it has to losses this team do you want to go so I guess it is would they happen to be from the Hawkeye State the Iowa park guys but they\nYeah they yeah buddy Big Ten now editor in talking about that right now but I just I got off on a a little bit of a tangent Asher West Virginia I guess who who does that leave in the mix Oklahoma represent that particular conference\nIt's gonna be ...

Tom Brady and the patriots coming up with really went over the cheese ... and the bears followed by a big enough the showdown\nBetween the cowboys and Washington wake up with the NFL today at nine am eastern six o'clock am early Pacific\nAnd start your full day of football on CBS I Love I'm In the minority I think\nI Love the notion of it I Love the idea that because I loved ones and then\nThe NFL and the NBA they are all going to try like crazy\nTo find their way into international markets that is the next growth area and like the NBA and Adam Silver believes that they can be over the next ten or Fifteen Years the biggest for the most popular sport honor is that's a hard thing to do given soccer's\nDomination internationally but there's a ton of people who play\nJust play basketball casually in China India huge population center\nHuge rising population center has a ton of MBA fans and what the NBA is trying to do is to create academies a lot like what soccer has around the world to spread the notion and the idea of the sport here's why it's cool grow the game find talent\nAnd wind market share internationally and so I'm not mad at the NFL for going to London I just don't think it's going to work the way it's going to work in the NBA is probably ten or Fifteen Years from now and the NBA as a lot of\nMoves to make a they're certainly going to put a team in Vegas at some point\nBut I Would not be shocked if\nMaybe it's Fifteen Years from now there are two or four teams maybe a division of its own somehow\nIn Europe some sort of London Barcelona parish rom com but I've heard different\nTheories about how that could work like maybe those four teams will just play each other for the most part and then do a U.S trip where they come over and make the rounds and the winner would make the play offs and the ... who knows that would work but it's certainly coming\nSpeaking of the NBA and regular season tips off\nTomorrow it is interesting how it feels sort of and I love ... and we'll talk about it a lot even with the bronze Laker even with the Celtics as clearly the favorite in eastern conference so normally when the Lakers and the Celtics are really relevant\nThe NBA is a huge story it feels a little anti climactic doesn't it it feels like we all know who's going to win the NBA championship\nNext year Golden State warriors and I don't think that's going to change at all whatsoever\nIn any way anytime soon in fact I've heard some people suggest that maybe the warriors are sort of take their foot off the pedal on only only win fifty six fifty seven or fifty eight games and then cruised to an MBA championship maybe they lose one deliver on and one of the Celtics on their way to the final\nThe end of that probably sounds right\nI think they can win Seventy games this year here here's why\nWe think about Golden State right and we think of this shiny\nCreation of start up billionaires who bought the team as reasons called oracle arena and applied some of their approaches and there were smarter than everybody else philosophy to the organization and if you think of that you probably thing in the San Francisco but the real\nThe real heart of the Golden State warriors is is Oakland, California that arena which is in Oakland offered the interstate right next to where the athletics play is an old arena\nAnd if you go to games and I was trying to think the other day at the top of my head talking to ship out in the newsroom who's working on Scott per hour show tonight big NBA guy I was just all the time I had trying to think how many times I've been to that arena\nAnd I mean I don't know fifty or Seventy I mean I I I've been to every postseason game for two years I've been every finals they've been to and I must have gone to twenty or thirty games and they're making their run toward what became Seventy three when\nAll of which is after all a lot of time a lot of time there and there is a\nConnection to that community and that arena to that fan base and to that team that is I think I Would argue every bit as deep as what you might find in Green Bay Wisconsin or in Oklahoma City Oklahoma\nTeam that is I think I Would argue every bit as deep as what you might find in Green Bay Wisconsin or in Oklahoma City Oklahoma or Wrigley Field in Chicago Illinois it's an incredible incredible atmosphere\nAnd the fans who are there I I think like Green Bay Wisconsin 'cause there are some places to go right and it's all just wealthy people\nWho don't really care and ... and there's I mean it's it's San Francisco there's there's ... there's a share of that but there are everyday normal people who feel of oracle arena and making one of the most difficult places to play in the country and this is the last year that oracle arena will houses team and we all assume it's all the good times are going to continue I think\nKevin ranch actually even at the end of the year but we all assume that they're going to continue to be the gold and say wars we've\nBeen watching him probably but they're gonna have a shiny brand new arena down by the water in San Francisco it's a good twenty Fifteen miles away and in terms of traffic it's it it can be two hours you're driving from downtown San Francisco to oracle eastern a playoff game 'cause the games earlier\nI Want to miss that I Want to tell my boss is I'm Sorry not the right to find this out I was missed like the first two and a half quarters of a final game who took me three hours off radio shouldn't me three hours to get to the arena\nIt can do just as long coming back with the bridge it's just going to change things and I haven't spent a lot of time their fans are worried they're going to get priced out where people are going to park it's a different drive it's a lot further\nAnd clay Thompson and dream on green and Potegal and they talked about it throughout the course of pre season the local media and the bubble up today as a sort of a national story they're aware\nThat they're saying goodbye to a very unique atmosphere a very unique perspective\nAnd a fan base that has turned that arena into a second home and has been I think one of the unsung heroes and contributors to the warriors becoming the warriors will continue in San Francisco and a gleaming new billion dollar arena paid for by very wealthy man maybe\nMaybe not I mean I used to joke and and I'm only half joking\nI mean I Would have locked myself to Wrigley Field they ever tried to tear it down and build some beautiful quote unquote new ballpark somewhere else some places even if they don't work or not fashionable and really feel is a problem for a long time they were able actually to fix it by going underground sort of expanding the clubhouse some things have\nMore meaning then how much corporate sponsorships you can sell how many luxury sweets there are and those sorts of things and\nSomeone's going to be laws for the wars when oracle arena shutters doors for the last time whenever this wrong comes so now which is probably four or five games in June and another NBA Finals championship\nAnd I think that that's an organization and those are players were gonna feel it and they're going to know it\nAnd just like LeBron scenery and beyond say every single night in LA and be motivated by that I think that that word team is going to remember and be aware of this is a goodbye tour for oracle arena and they're gonna they're not gonna take nights off like they did last year they're not going to look past teams at least it home\nGreat place to play\nVegas is the beautiful around the block but I I I Would hope and think that\nAdam Silver would direct if there was a sale sell that organization to someone who wants to keep it locally and it's not like Portland, Oregon does not have the kind of wealth and interest in his wealth I wouldn't want to keep that team\nIs the shoe barrel cattle ... starting with Nike but not just like there are people there there are so inclined who could buy it and who could keep it there\nFor for me the NBA is going to go to Vegas\nIt's an expansion in his Vegas plus another community and I think that's probably the inclination I Hope that the inclination that Adam Silver is on her plus\nI Can't imagine the MBA wants to entirely relinquish and allow\nThe entire northwest to be\nDevoid of any MBA teams because the thunder I'm not match Oklahoma City but Seattle should be I mean the thunder are in Oklahoma City because they don't and went there for the team stole the team was it seemed Oklahoma City Seattle deserves its own NBA team\nTo me what makes more sense as you keep a team in Portland you do an expansion to Seattle and Vegas\nYou recalibrate probably a team that goes to the eastern conference maybe it's a team like Minnesota the timber wolves 'cause in the mid west and then you have a little bit more of a regional pull their but yeah the pollen thing is you know obviously awful to hear that he passed\nTim rules 'cause it's in the mid west and then you have a little bit more of a regional pull their but yeah the ... the thing is you know obviously awful to here and then he passed away it's sixty five\nOf cancer and as Mike in Portland pointed out it does create some uncertainty for that organization eight five five to one to four CBS is the phone number Eliot here in New York Thanks or listen to brother you're on CBS Sports radio\nThe body I have always at work and pow I'm Sorry that will uh will circle back in just a moment\nTrying to get back to you had Robert maize on the show earlier today covers the NFL for the ringer does a great podcast there he's a bears fan base in Chicago and Robert gave us his perspective on that bears loss yesterday\nI mean I think that yesterday was an aberration or maybe I'm just rationalizing but I mean you watched that game happened it's just such a departure from Keene washed over the first five weeks\nNow and again they really have to find that fell through tackling physicality especially in the secondary and many up rock I thought it would come in and yeah I made some Rocco jokes or kickoff yesterday and I knew instantly that I shouldn't have done that because it must do\nBut as soon as the game and it was like whoa broadcasts Arthur ... yards or did you watch the game\nHe had two hundred and Seventy four yard after the catch\n... and it was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen I I was kinda combing through\nUh passing chart today and you watch rock ... touched down every one of them is a ... yard pass for the scrimmage\nI mean this team that these things are specially jak from Adrian he must have been a pretty good players the ... the angle they took the open field tackled baffling yesterday and then you have guys just destroying them for Seventy yard touchdown traveled three are here you have ... getting hurt\nEarly in the game and that is happening there past rush a little bit\nTurn over inside the five yard line on the road\nYou can't win games that way and they still almost dead and again maybe this is rationalization maybe this is just trying to me try to talk myself in the ... but I just watching that game yesterday it it's just more frustrating than it is\nThe fleeting I I guess that if that makes sense\nI don't think that it takes away their ability to win that second wildcard or in the playoffs in the NFC just 'cause I think that's why they're there for the taking it's more so just wide as might not want to take the next that's why\nI Love everything about that Robert May Chicago Bears optimism the glass is half full and our top still could run over so I was curious whether Robert when they have a similar positive upbeat perspective on stewards Oakland Raiders\nIt's fascinating and I'm sitting here listening to people talk about the trader more stuff for the march coup or I'm Carl Joseph thing right you know she wanted her down and the previous regime that you know proceed to do that's fine one\nEffort however it was ...\nYou know and however has been ... took control the eagles each purge the rule of every single trace of chip Kelly\nAnd that was not so awkward because chip Kelly was no longer in the building Reggie McKenzie still works for the raiders\nAnd John earn just sitting there trying to trade away all the players who drafted which I'm sure is a really cool place to be at work every day at but then\nThe idea of where they're going from here so if you cook this job as John ...\nAnd you were expected to be a total ... fine that's fine but everyone said he took his job because of their car I have started to believe\nThat their car will not be the leaders quarterback is ... ... ... when you sign a contract is a hundred twenty five million dollars sixteen months ago and you think to yourself oh well how much debt money's probably left on that deal twenty thirty million\nSeven and a half million dollars if the raiders trade or cut their cars this off season based on everything we've seen with acts uprising he has systematically tried to purge this team of what it was before he got\nAnd if that's the case if this was going to be a total tear down\nHow in God's name or you signing guys like Jordan Oklahoma seven billion dollar contracts why wouldn't you be\nTotally prone to playing your young guys and figuring out what you have going forward\nIt it's just a complete lack of cohesion within the plant\nThat's Robert Mays from the ringer robbery in really good I've known Robert\nMann for ten or Fifteen Years he was a young guy in a zoo when I went back to speak once one of one of the young stars there in terms of coming out of sports writer Bill Simmons saw something he wrote Robert Rohde when he was at the Boston Globe as an intern hired in mentor to him and Roberts become a really important and really smart\nVoice on the NFL I wanted to get his take on one of the topic is the big topic of the day and that is how likely is it\nThat mobile homes is going to be going forward just totally totally I mean\nI Would bet all the money on\nHer I don't know what the answer to the ceiling you the best quarterback in the NFL\nAnd the post breeze Brady\nRogers era I I I put something on that if you gave me the right odds\nBut in terms of if you're going to be one of the bus I feel very good about it and it's about infrastructure when you watch what they're doing right now\nAnd when you watch with a team they are going to be by the end of the season\nIs there any chance to Andy Reid isn't the coach\nThere in three or four years that thing with all this and when you're watching these young quarterback who's going to prop them up\nAnd you see McVeigh during it took off and you see Andrew reviewing its homes and that's why you feel good about it for you guys are going to be really good because there are situations that they have really good looking gun pre snap\nIs fascinating and that shows the value of just sitting there and learning from reading Smith for a year I think a lot of people sit there with our first run quarterback and say what can\nGain from not quiet\nAnd maybe more homes will be a misnomer line that may be a red herring and it'll lead seemed to sit there quarterbacks on the reality show but there is value in around\nSmart people learning just sits and before you have to be drawn fire I I just think everything I've seen from him and every single moment has led to believe that he'll be one of the best quarterback says his generation\nDid not hit with Robert

ago when it first happened um but he still hasn't looked great and he hasn't quite been himself but they've taken him off the injury report at times the last two weeks so\nIf anything it should be less of an issue now than previously I mean a lot that they're they don't have a a a scheme that set the vanguard of of what the best modern offices are doing\nThe office of line there's seemingly always got banged up taxpayer too they they haven't found the feature back and God Knows how long I guess in SETI Lacey was in his very brief prime\nUh and they're down you know they don't have a great great group of pass catchers and they're down a few of them and I'm said all that I still expect a little bit more I Am very Rogers at home on a Monday Night and in limbo field uh\nI I guess we all do but I just don't think they're very good football team you know I think they're sort of patently mediocre and Mike petting them is doing them no favors with with what he's got going on there\nDefensively as well I I don't know Scotty I I just think they're they're kind of uh especially in the AFC and sorry the NFC which is tougher than the AFC I I just think they're kind of a middling team that is going to win nine games and like\nThat'll be it you know I'm with you head coach their staff and that'll be that\nYeah I'm with you uh so what do you know not Josh Allen's elbow injury a boy Peter met through it and I ... and then through just to rent they dig into the other team I mean this horrible\nWhat so what do you know about Alan's album\nHe's a he's not going to play for a little while I'm you know they don't I'd be stunned if he plays this week\nI'm probably not a few weeks after that I mean let's be real about the Buffalo Bills okay they didn't want to play him as soon as they did\nBut they had no choice because Peter Miller was an abject failure and they had traded a you know a quarter back to a already so they didn't have a third guy now they have Derrick Anderson there I suspect they tried to get there again is ready to play much sooner than anyone would have ever anticipated\nUm because Peter and can't get it done and then you know Josh Allan you're talking about throwing elbows like boy you really want to bring him back any sooner than you have to\nAct behind that offensive line with no titans right and no wide receivers and just shady McCord to try to give you a fighting chance I like what they're doing on defense but often simply they're nowhere close to being a capable NFL teams so [noise] you know [noise]\nI don't think he plays for at least a few weeks Scotty and and we'll see what what they're able to do\nBut um at least when Alan's in their his ability to scramble and break off huge plays with the run game and then throw that occasional laser on the run gives defense of something to think about Peter men is just a double agent I mean he he he's more likely to throw it to the other team that is oh\nDid you uh did you live

know what I mean at night they sacked him eleven times on Seventy five whatever sixty attempts because it was a run and gun game and it was some of these games like Andrew Luck and Ben Roethlisberger but they didn't want to throw the ball 'cause they know they really can't throw the ball to the titans just wanted to run it and they couldn't really do that and and ...\nWas I mean he was a human pilot I mean he was getting it from a guy he was getting it off the right tackle getting it off the left tackle I mean they just look like they could get them\nAnytime they wanted and that has to be incredibly troubling for the titans because you know one and conquer when they're supposed to be the the pillars of that team and if we know they don't have much on the inside but to tackle start

uh what did you think she'll kicking Georgia's asked\nThat changed the playoff picture\nOh absolutely and I think you know that was you had the game plan every single week and and that's what they want to play good defense we we know David Randall getting paid millions of dollars he's got a great\nA defense that they can rely on they want to run the football and and they just need a some some key throws at the game goes on from job where they got that\nIn that game against Georgia and yeah I think for for the bulldogs in particular that was it that was the game especially going in and a half pint down down sixty nothing wherever that leadership from last year that the Nick Chubb the rope wants to mess with the world or could it could have kind of rally that team and and gotten them back\nA in that game but uh they they don't have those guys don't have anybody kind of stepping up to fill that void and um for Herbie smart now you've got a little bit of a quarterback and undermining your hands as well uh going forward and and then in this very vital month and that costs with ... foot ...\nFields or a from\nYou know I think earlier in the year it it it looked like they kind of had a plan for Justin ... to come in there have a package of plays and really kind of understanding develop his role in and I think they went away from that and Jake Crum did play well before coming into this this game and\nUh the code is just kind of went away from it I think that was certainly a mistake you want to be able to get to give\nA defense or something else to think about and I think that was uh the whole point of in plain Justin field earlier this year and\nA I think if you're going to be smart you got to continue to develop that package because\nNo matter what what ... from that even if he's your guy under center you want to be able to have another guy just to to\nGet something you know defenses to prepare for\nSo what do you think of a and there's the a field goal that wins it\nFor the Packers thirty three dirty so after messing around with the niners all night they win a game by three thirty three dirty the niners played gray and Rogers a stole that one of the and tying it with a great touchdown bad the Adams and then moving down to be able to get in a field goal which either Bryan Fischer of NBC Sports that kind of out of college football\nA bat and our doozy or the job or that he's done it pit and big games and I've sat ... they did it again they were winning fourteen twelve against ... books are that great touchdown bass\nLate in the game to win it for the Irish but ... and ...\nYeah and I think for Notre Dame obviously ... to have a special season and it looks like there is developing one in South then you've got to be both lucky and ... and I think they they\nShow both sides of that are against pets I Am I mean book or leads the nation in completion percentage she's been really uh I I think the guy that that gives them a chance to make it to the playoffs in the end it in and run the table with the rest of the way but\nNow the Irish defense again coming up big in that game as well and I'm ... in in such a weird weekend for college football I think if you're a Notre Dame and and you look back at that school or you just go hey survive in advance and then you can keep going on because\nUh every team throughout the college football season is going to have those close calls even if it's up against a bad team and I think for the Notre Dame fans they're they're just ... comfortable a cutting out a win like that\nSo uh what did you think of West Virginia and Greer getting whacked in Ames, Iowa state\nYeah I mean you know really since big twelve play kind of started West Virginia you have to start you know they kinda just just slowly started to look not quite a hitting on all cylinders all sense of lay and and I think going in change I mean that is a difficult place\nTo play in on the road at night um you know that was really just a combination of factors there I think west to slip up and uh you know give credit to Iowa State and I can't wait to rip it coach he gets his guys ready to play really ...\nUh you know the most out of that talent in that program ... pretty ... was phenomenal again and I think for Iowa State that used to be a game that a lot of people viewed as a give me\nThat that is no longer the case for for for any big twelve coach around there um you know they they got to take the cycling steam seriously a no matter what we could is and this week it was West Virginia's term to uh to get get the upset\nI Brian picture what ... what did you think of Oregon winning and over time over Washington\nWell you know I think if you go back a couple of years even when when they were rolling under chip Kelly this is a game that they don't really when\nA ... because they they they were not stand in the trenches they were not down on decent\nUm but but that's kind of changed not only a last year kind of the the building blocks that under Willie tiger but really since Mario crystal ball is taken over full time up there and Eugene he has made it a point that they that team wants to be tough in the trenches they want to be physical with you on that\nAnd I think that paid off against a very good Washington but um you know let's face it they they miss that kick at the end they had their chances and I think for Oregon I was kind of a flip side of of what happened to get ... you know that they ... they got caught a little bit of a break and then they really made the other team punish a or make punished for their mistakes because\nUm you know this is a very good work and tea and they they've got a\nSure fire first round quarterback a in there and Justin Herbert but the other guys that off into wind the skill position players the guys on ... and that's what really is has been the area of growth over these last couple of weeks and I think that's the encouraging thing if you're you're a

Aaron Rodgers can do that but also expand the game to her she can move out of the pocket hit people on the fly with the knee brace on\n... I mean let me get this right\nSo one guy on is just a pocket passer so his game as limited as what you're suggesting to man and not so many we're likely okay slight okay okay so how is it than that he just stands in a pocket and then when spot superbowl's\nIf five and then when they ask you that show they are that's on top of that okay every single year he has given an entirely new roster I mean it's almost like every guy has been replaced they've never had the same one see just\nConstantly they just moving pieces one after the next every season he doesn't just play with the same guy and he just built it doesn't matter who they\nJust constantly they just moving pieces one after the next every season he doesn't just play with the same guy and he just still it doesn't matter who they put in there he still goes to Super Bowls and winds up\nAnd the answer to that to you for a is a system he's in a perfect system toward these guys go in and out in and out and this is\nScience so if there is so uh so in other words a Rogers is doing all of this on his own because their system is so bad in Green Bay you're making no sense to me\nAt all so I had to say this he also won the game last night by a running the ball and from five yards out so he also can't run either buddy he ran for the winnings OSHA listen you and shop should go out for some soup and talk about how great Aaron Rodgers is because he is great but he's not better than that guy\n[laughter] it's simple\n... this is not some sophisticated and it's like you're talking about the ... system no he's great and they're in a system that sound there in his system [laughter]\nSystem as well wins his arm is what when his march his vision his weeds is ah looking off receivers and then hitting guys uh it's simple to me you could argue till the cows come home and I'm Still going to say\nOne guy as five Super Bowls I don't care who he was was and the other guy has one and I don't care who he was with a double it'd be so great\nAdam he's only won once and then you're going to blame all the other players right okay well then I'm going to blame all the other players that don't matter on the patriots that he still wins with they don't even matter like he's got so many guys Hogan and all these other guys they don't even matter they don't even matter and he's still wins\nIt does not matter who they put in there 'cause he's so great\nBut it's in the last thing I Want to do today it's spent my entire day talking about Tom Brady I Want to stick my eyeballs out of my face and step on and when my tennis shoes okay I don't want to talk about this guy all night but he is that er that's it\nThere I mean there is no one on the face of the earth that works in the NFL that is a inside or any NFL like an executive if I did a survey right now I'm\nSure there'll be people that would pick Rogers but at the end of the day I think the heavy decision would be made on if every person in the NFL was asked a simple question it was about a quarterback Tom Brady would win and you know why because they would face got five Super Bowl rings that say that these guys play for two reasons really won money\nAnd allegedly rings they are judged by rings not by money\nGoes Aaron Rodgers making more money than Tom Brady by age you're judged by your rings right that said that that that's all they ever talk about when you are\nIn the NFL and you are finished playing you will be considered allegedly possibly for the can down the hall of fame right\nWhen you're judged for the uh hallowed halls and can it's all about numbers it's all about stats right and it's all about ratings and it's all about MVPs and everything else and that guy\nHas got more than any one so that that and the ... subject there's this it's to me it's like it's it's a ridiculous argument even it's I mean it's a nice day\nI mean if the guy wanted another one I'd be I'd be like thrilled for you in this argument but he's got four more too when before he catches this guy\nThis guy Brady will go down as the greatest quarterback who ever lived and he was a sex round draft pick and he was fat he had like baby blubber he was nobody no one thought anything up and when he was in\nMichigan they really didn't write known advertise going to be is a superstar no one and\nThey have somehow been able to manipulate that situation into multiple Super Bowls I mean they've won five they banned uh how many they've been through now mafia like eleven times they've end of the things I mean I just I'm so sick of it I was a\nRadio has been him specifically I think he's been there at five and\nThree by any means but but in the uh the franchise ... eleven I mean that's insane the fact that he's played in a Super Bowl is crazy it's almost like that for all bothers we've played and I think\nUh we're it's Thirteen right it's Thirteen vinyl eight nine ten eleven twelve Thirteen were uh eight and five and championships\nWho's the Tom Brady of that leak\nUh well it isn't me but ... ... ...\nBy the way I'm not disagreeing with anything you're saying you can't make an argument that Rogers breeze far me any any of those guys can hold a candle to Tom Ridge you get no arguments me or anybody with a brain they're all I think that people are trying to say is\nThat it was better rural okay for us what you're trying to say there's no other way or the question\nYea Fox dot org slash his defense pack\nYou ever wonder what you do look you couldn't just which on the heat when it got more stark your car each morning or a four point

W W or they're you know\nI write so by going back to what I was saying shop or is that I'm sure there's people out there that are going to sit there and tweet all day how great Aaron Rodgers is\nUh but I got to night was a you know that was normal business for him a lake rally a lake or come back a fourth quarter dry two of them in fact one to Taiwan to win it so that just normal a dad the office for Roger ... but\nI'm telling you that that was a sign that game was a sign that they have issues big issues if you ask me they let the San Francisco forty niners with CJ better light them up for thirty points\nOn their home field Atlanta that's all there is to it that is a concern if you ask me they're lucky they won that game is what they were lucky and there you go congratulations you'd be one of the worst teams and football and you let them put thirty Anya so but\nThat could happen any day in the NFL the NFL is insanity in a nutshell and I'm sure millions of people are tweeting how great he is and everything else and I you know he is great but you know\nI'm Still not going anywhere with this thought that Brady is better you get I compare\nIt is people apples and oranges five apples is better than one orange I'll tell you that much so you went ... that that you play in a Super Bowl is it's all over this guy's played in one and he won it God Bless him he'd be the Steelers\nRight is that about right that was awful for me I just wanted to say that but uh it was awful\nI just I Can't even continue after thinking about that person again that's like doing that ... the top ten when they\nIt was awful I just I Can't even continue after thinking about that first I guess\nThat's like doing that shall not be the top ten when they told me on the mount Rushmore of NFL teams at the Steelers are number\nFive [laughter] and I was like number five and a number five number five\nThey've won six superbowls they're number one that that\nNumber one the best franchise ever boom and then they argue with me and say they're number five so I took all my clothes off and did the entire show naked ... what did you\nYou can see it on NFL top ten on NFL Network I Do that show all the time so this da ... in\nA church thing that I did I mention Seventeen hundred a champion Des Moines tonight I think I did mention him again it's great to have the champ on Seventeen hundred am\nIn Des Moines Iowa real as far as ... as far as as welcome to CBS Sports radio if I'm not on that right now because I've already been on for a couple of hours and they went to something else that was a bad decision [noise]\nShould have just kept me on for the whole thing I mean imagine the ratings imagine the audience oh I'm just watching some guy get thrown off a horse it was awesome in a horse race a couple of banks\nTomorrow night you got the NBA season opener is what else is there in life in my opinion now that I don't have to wait till Thursday for football or you know\nSaturday and Sunday for football is there's nothing worse than waiting for football every week from\nNow I have NBA basketball every night and NHL and I think they start playing college basketball sometime in the next five months\nWhy do they wait until like mid November to play college basketball is beyond me I I just don't understand that shouldn't they start literally won the NBA start well you're going to focus on ... and they only played thirty some games right\nI'll because they're going to focus on great that's a funny one you mean a oh wait so you're saying college basketball players actually go to class and get great things don't Catholic for yeah yeah 'cause none of them do that maybe one guy on every game as good grades maybe two I'll give you two maybe three at best\nOut of a twelve I mean they got on the teams\nAre more than twelve which is sad because you don't hear from half of them how many do they add on college teams usually about Thirteen fourteen guy or you know ... walk ons you got to include them right\nBut I a lot of them go to college so that they can leave in one ear and go pro that's why they go but uh as you know there is nothing harder to do in my opinion then play college basketball and try to make it to the NBA\nThan all the time for how long you mop these top ten all the time you got a whole group of words on the phone he eats played for eleven years he had to do more to talk to me ... cum laude named me another guy who was in regular season if he was a different franchise mind you went to another franchise was a two time\nBy a lot of guys you never had the opportunity to do what he's outta opportunity to do but uh so like if you're looking at big seven voters that are good like a wilt Chamberlain and and uh [noise] Robertson guys like this uh\nYou know I wouldn't uh put him up above them\nI mean your talent manager terrain you you're telling me that you think are so using that drafts better than wilt Chamberlain\nAbsolutely will take a look and when he couldn't win for a while he was a regular statistical and I'm having to read but what's the Golden State uh you can't fall Kevin rent because he didn't have enough\nHow 'bout you hit that that is the worst thing that ever happened to the NBA is allowing guys to go to a winning team I agree but it doesn't negate greatness yes it does yes it does because when he played in Oklahoma City couldn't win jak and when he went to the warriors he finally was surrounded\nWith all stars first team all stars first team all off and Sandy mounds of all stars that twice so good on the middle East Germany ... there are no tall they're you know\nRather than they were they had no one else besides Westbrook I'm telling the hurt on it but there's also different than a Michael Jordan Scottie Pippin was the same thing as Oklahoma ... so what\nAre you know\nThe same situation as Oklahoma City what's the difference they played with two players\nTo guys sort of key to that team every time they won a championship\nRight am I wrong they one section of them but not sure really allows matter do people tell you Steve Kerr and all these guys Rodman wasn't that long lead packs and that's like saying that everybody gives all his credit to big shot Bob for you know he was a piece Rodman wasn't a piece there's a lot of peace\nIs that Langley packs and that's like ... everybody gives all his credit to big shot Bob for you know he was at peace Rodman was obese there's a lot of pieces that make up championship games but the bulls were built on two legs\nOr Mike and Scotty has that same thing in a city most teams Lowry and ... had to do good players right that the average age now today's game there's these games at five and there's teams at four in three different needs to be just to

B. horn stress from Southern California news group at game three between the Dodgers and the brewers in Los Angeles\nAnd J. P. and felt like a near flawless performance from that brewers pitching staff from start to finish she even with a couple of moments where they face of adversity they were able to rally what did they have to say about their accomplishments on the mound\nThat in the ... and really improvising almost feels like not just game to game but like getting to anything what they're pitching it almost\nHas to be a little bit hard to predict the true Dave Robert ... who's going to be on the knowledge fermenting to any today ... just in the ... and ... wrote it\nIt worked perfection on the Dodgers side you know they're wondering why they would overturn with writers scoring 'cause it's right\nI think if you're you're you're the bird you can't necessarily count on the doing that every day but you know having the or one lead was nice and it got the point where uh the Dodgers had the bases loaded and then I dating one swing could've cut it up I mean that was again in the final score but\nUm it just seemed like council pushed the right buttons again and and the Dodgers are on it now\nWell this is the second time in three games and really other than the jumped in turned her home run in the eighth inning of getting to where they struggle to come up with a hit that chai\nThat would produce with a you know it was somewhat on base with a runner and scoring condition or what are they talking about and that and you know when it comes to those moments [noise]\nI mean\nIt it depends on who you're talking to I guess Dodger fans of course are frustrated and they look at a game like this and connected to every time they can remember the Dodgers not coming through with a runner scoring position all season I think the Dodgers standpoint\nThe players stand point that it it can look back at the first two games as serious as say you know game one we were down\nI think from the Dodgers standpoint\nOr from the players standpoint that is they can look back at these first two games in a serious and say you know game one we were down\nA six nothing I think it was six to one came back I'm sixty five final score game too and we're down again to nothing and they came back to win that game and you look at those rallies and there's something to build on there I guess and\nYou know hopefully that confidence is enough to carry them through and the game for 'em and you know the fact that they won plenty of games over the course of the season I I think that confidence is there a little less confidence maybe among the fan\n[laughter] well certainly the fact that they were pushed into very brink almost forget not winning the west but almost not making the post season and then going to have one sixty three and ... and having to win the division like that too yes he thinks a lot of diversity are you surprised that there's only been a couple of home runs\nA little bit [noise] um [noise] particularly in Milwaukee I mean that's got a reputation as hitters park um your money ground all is having a tough series but I've seen him out\nCareer games at Miller Park um someone with a little bit surprised to see the ball not travel is well they're\nDodger Stadium is a pitcher's part has been since it opened in Nineteen sixty two and the way the wind was blowing today particularly\n... should be happy he even got a trip off the wall um it did not look like it was going to play remotely an editor saver today\nUm and then you know you look at the pitching I mean just seen even though he's not a man named pitcher in a pretty solid year I'm In the way that the brewers are managing to patch together innings with their bullpen\nYou know definitely getting the most out of their pitching staff um Walker dealer great pitcher ranging review probably would have been an all

championship series for the southern Californian newsgroup French off schemes three it's after hours when Lawrence here on CBS Sports radio you mentioned there catcher in the past fall there's been a lot of talk about that\nIn the fact that there have been a couple of runs scored because of the mistakes or and I think maybe not even mistakes necessarily but just not making the play to play uh what is he had to say\nYou know definitely mistakes [laughter] definitely mistake I'm\nYou know the fact that we've had to ask us money ground all about mistakes after each of these three game right in itself a little weird um and and and having to answer for things like ... ... not catching a ball that was related to home plate or\nA couple of past balls or earlier in the series today it was a wild edge\nAnd and that that was a tough curve ball ... and said that you know his fault for putting ... play 'em but it starts to add up and and to hear Dave Roberts after the games say that he's going to go to Austin Barnes is back a catcher in game for\nYou know not something that Dodger fans were expecting not something credit counseling suspecting um\nBut look the reality is that when the mistake start to add up at this time of year you can just take it for granted and the guys in a bounce back in time um you know David Roberts was pretty guarded in in what he said he didn't want to come down to heavily result speak for themselves and and I think I was nuts\nUm but it's a question I think it's an open question as to whether ... for you know all the confidence he expresses himself will have time to turn this around and and to get back starting games behind the plate I think if you were getting better I'm thinking maybe Dave would tolerate those mistakes but\nBack to the matter is going to all really isn't hitting either and and when you're not eating and you're not catching baseball\nI you're going to play your way out of the light up for a long\nI guess at Grand slam tied the game

have to tell me it's nice to hear but I'd rather we just talk\nAbout sports but with the sports not\nDon't be calling me ... there'll be calling me anything just Amy works fine and if you have to throw in um am that's okay too although\nWell I mean I I Can't say that I call everyone ma'am and sir I even on the radio sometimes but almost always in my regular walk of life and what I had to call the insurance company on friday about my car I was\nMa'am thank you ma'am uh when I spoke to the police I was all about the SARS so yeah I still do demands and deserts and when I'm In Texas I Love it when uh the guy to open the doors and call you ma'am [laughter] a Texas state and you know well it's\nI spend my time in the south in Texas now but it used to have it in Oklahoma too it's a southern thing more than it is a northern thing or other parts of the country so that's nice of you get used to that\nIs after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio eight five five to one to forward to to seven that's our number toll free line and then on Twitter Ala radio and our Facebook page or bloated up yet again the uncertainty\nIt drives you know I tell you\nUntil last week we're asking about the one word to describe your team and out this week I'm asking you for toys alert Tuesday\nWhat scares you the most about your team in honor of Halloween we have no decorations here in our studio though some of you are using a ... which is awesome\nAnd to others of you are using some fun hashtags like spooky [laughter] scariest so I read a bunch of your tweets and I'll get back to those\nThat producer Christmas retreating a bunch of your answers are but I promise that I Would get to Facebook and you are blowing it up so I Will coming up momentarily can I also just say one more thing I Am a\nHappy\nAs they're not actually having an emotion about it I Am happy that the patriots found out which fan\nThrough beer on retail\nAfter one of his touchdowns on Sunday nights and that they revoked his privileges in the stadium so banned them now I don't know whether or not charges will be pressed\nCouple of different reports uh one was that the chief we're not interested in pressing any kind of charges so tiring kill he wasn't gonna press any kind of charges a but that the patriots and the police decided to go ahead and press charges against the fan and I'm hoping that just the\nThe ... the speaking of frightening just a frightening experience of having to sit in front of police an answer questions about why you through a beer on another human being because you lost your mind at a football game I'm hoping that's enough to scare this young man into\nEither eight being able to handle his liquor or be recognizing that it's just sports\nYou do not throw beer on other people\nJust forget where they are\nAnd any type of civility or decency\nNot to mention flying objects can't\nHurt people use\nIt happens periodically\nA diatribe or a monologue on patriots fans\nCraig kimbrell had something thrown at him when he was coming out of the bullpen in the Bronx at Yankee Stadium a couple of years ago I was talking about Toronto blue jays fans throwing stuff on the field\nIt does happen every now and then and I've talked about it more than once\nThere's no excuse for it\nAnd you get caught doing it you should be banned\nSo I really hope it was worse that young kid losing his beer and his right to sit and it was pretty incredible seats\nAlong the back of the end zone\nIt's ridiculous completely ludicrous that a person could lose control themselves that much that he throws something and another human being\nA little bit like social media right\nIf you actually knew the people that you were talking to\nSending your insults and\nRude and disrespectful he actually knew those people you never say this stuff to their face\nAnd somehow sports become a cover\nAgain like social media to become a cover oh it's okay because he's a rabid fan\nHe was just really excited no\nYou don't know these athletes\nWill give you the right to endanger them more thoroughly something at them\nJust because they're playing in a stadium where your favorite team plays\nAnd in case you're wondering\nThe patriots don't think it was great either\nEven though it was\nA beer thrown at a member of the opposite team grown said that's crazy immigrant think throwing beer is crazy we can be sure then the rest of the patriots are\nOn the same vein I don't want it to happen to them and other stadiums and so this is not the chiefs or Thai retail\nWho are going for with potential charges\nIt's the patriots and the police\nAgain I Hope just having to sit down and talk to authorities I can only imagine now I've never thrown anything that anybody else oh no I take that back when I was [laughter]\nI'll tell you this is something I don't ever been to this other year before I got into an argument with a with a now ex boyfriend we gotta do to argument and uh I threw a remote across the room\nHe wasn't anywhere near him but I figure remote across the room and into the wall so I did one or something and argument\nAnyway didn't hit him and wasn't anywhere close to him but\nI can imagine as a\nAs a young kid especially if you've never been in trouble with the law before\nWith wave units there are new buckets of water or filters and they constantly pennies a day to run wave

that when we're talking about screening with mammograms a screening only is applying to women who are at average risk for breast cancer and for those who don't have any symptoms in their breath\nThere are actually many different recommendations currently available to patients in regard to win screening should begin\nUm among others organizations such as the United states preventative Services Task force the American Cancer Society and the national comprehensive cancer network all have their own specific recommendations\nAll of these organizations essentially recommend that a patient has a conversation with her physician in regard to the risks and benefits of screening and what will be best for her\nIn general though most doctors still follow the traditional guideline of beginning mammograms at age forty and getting them manually thereafter there is not a specific age in regard to win a woman should stop having mammograms\nMost of the time as someone's life expectancy is less than ten years or if they wouldn't pursue any treatment even if it cancer was found in screenings likely not to be very beneficial for her [noise]\nUm importantly there are also different screening recommendations for those who are at higher risk which I think we're going to touch on later [noise] um but that's an important conversation to have with your doctor is the screening can be different

was Abu Saudi Arabia ... germs at one leaving some judges were confirmed to so they can get out of there with Catherine Glynn Simpson arrived I understand on Capitol Hill\nGoing Simpson president the head of fusion GPS is there any doubt in your mind he's going to show up and take the fifth\nWell he already indicated through his attorneys are that he was going to take that to questions about the da da da da da da da da di in the spring and fall twenty sixteen\nAnd then after the election using a Justice Department official and what role it played in securing the surveillance war for Trump campaign aide Carter Page when Simpson had hoped\nTo avoid today's testimony on the basis that he would take the fifth but the committee insisted on having him appear under subpoena and he's now going through this very laborious process that going question by question\nAnd then taking other steps so they have a an under oath paper trail of symptoms refusing to answer these questions\nSo where is the contradiction from his original testimony who's ramping up\nOkay go bruised or is adjust department official and he was used by Simpson and former British spy Christopher Steele as a back channel to get the ... the aid to the FBI after the election November twenty sixteen and you can see and bruised\nOr emails and know that there was contact with Clinton Simpson\nAs early as August twenty sixteen by Glenn Simpson told another house panel that he didn't get involved with or until well after the election so that\nA big disconnect but Glenn Simpsons problems are much deeper than just a disconnect\nWith Bruce or what we've been able to see in our reporting is that more than a half dozen sources connected to fusion GPS out or the law firm that was working on behalf of the DNC and Clinton campaign and others\nFor shopping the ... the FBI almost creating what critics call an echo chamber so every time it came to the FBI to another source it would lend more credibility credibility pardon me to what was opposition research cry\nWhile I'm at of course a James told me basically should didn't really think the dossier played much of a role\nModel that that may be his condition but at least when you look at the surveillance applications that have been declassified you can\nSee that the ... was one of the top line item in the application and that\nIt was not the only item but it was certainly a significant item that was used to secure the original surveillance warrants in October twenty sixteen and on the way into the session today I showed a series of questions to Glenn Simpson including why was he taking the fifth\nBut also more specifically whether any parts of the da da ... ever been verified and he did not answer that question nor the final question which was as someone who has worked in a ... as a journalist in the past how was refusing our question today really consistent with his own experience\nNo but it doesn't budge on this but I guess he's hoping the Democrats get the house who ... stops right\nWell this is certainly the view of Republicans they've said very vocally that they think the goal has been to run out the clock with the hope that the Democrats take control and that's the end of the um investigation or the other issue that's\nReally up against the clock is whether that same committee will issue\nA subpoena for the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to secure his testimony over these allegations he discussed recording the president or removing him from office\nIn twenty Seventeen that something Rosenstein denies but even even more importantly what he knew about the dossier and other intelligence when he signed off on one of the surveillance weren't renewal a in October twenty Seventeen so it's not just\nUm what he said about the president but it's also his role or in the surveillance of a Trump campaign member\nOr a couple of things now I understand that any McCabe is being looked at a because he might have a he might have leaked information out about Michael Flynn's not telling us not telling the truth about whether we talked to Kislyak or not where's this story going\n[noise] well new records or have been released and what's been happening in the background and there's been\nAn inspector general's investigation that's been ongoing at the Justice Department we had\nReview about the Clinton emails earlier this year but the inspector General Michael Horowitz told reporters at that time that he was also looking I'm at political biased and text messages he was also looking at whether there were a regularity is in securing the surveillance warrants during\nThe presidential campaign\nAnd then all the specifically a leaking of classified information and based on the record that were made public even then you could see that there were multiple strands to leak investigation going get very senior people within the FBI so McCain\nReally has a lot of legal jeopardy right now it appears with the leak investigation\nBut he's also a in front of the grand jury here in Washington DC\nFor lying to federal investigators at that at least the wall Street Journal that dealt with the Clinton Clinton Foundation\nThat but yet he's still releasing a book so I don't know if that's going to help his cause they're nice\nSo that that's been a delayed review by by the FBI on but what I Would say not as offensive medicate but a contacts on one of the takeaways I have from the last six months\nI was looking at this issue is that\nIt's not the only one who may have been using leaks for Strategic reasons I mean director Comey testify publicly\nUp he specifically to mellow out\nShe the Columbia University professor to kick start a special counsel on the Russia probe and what we know from our reporting is that at least wind that does not contain classified information so the question is whether director Comey will be found guilty of mishandling classified information\nAnd by the way at least is struck in a Lisa Page and Peter Struck also going back and forth about how they put stories into the press and celebrating it\nCultures national talk show since Nineteen Ninety four [noise]\nHere's your host floors\nGood morning and thank you for joining us again this morning welcome to aggregate socks\nWe got a harvest updates from USDA yesterday afternoon in western ... very slow progress in the weekend at October fourteen guys in the eastern belt\nMade some impressive progress but\nImpressive probably is not the way to describe progress on negotiating a compromise on the two thousand and eight the farm bill it still mired in a conference committee we've got two members of the farm bill conference committee on today's show representative Collin Peterson from Minnesota\nRanking member of the house committee will join us in the next segment we'll talk farm bill was a congressman\nBut I also want to hear what a representative Peterson thinks about progress on Fifteen and the U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nAnd at the end of the show congressman Glenn GT Thompson from Pennsylvania will join us GDP is the chair of the nutrition subcommittee in the house committee or it's going to be interesting to hear what congressman Thompson thinks about the lack of progress on reaching a compromise on the farm bill\nAnd then sandwiched in between the two lawmakers were going to talk with Andrew ... with anti Lucas Andy is the information director for the Georgia Farm Bureau it was a big day in Georgia yesterday and we'll get Andy's take on the damage caused in his state\nBy hurricane Michael alright right now let's turn it over to time Oregon get an update on the news sign how are you this morning\nHey I'm good shape and that that's actually our lead today president Donald Trump to her Georgia yesterday surveying the damage from hurricane a Michael and the vice president is there today along with ... secretary Sonny Perdue so big day in Georgia that the farmers in the southeast deal with the aftermath of hurricane Michael losses are now peg at one point three billion dollar mark\nIts cotton peanuts poetry that looked to be hit the hardest only about Fifteen Percent of Georgia cotton crop is harvested before the hurricane hit now the Georgia department of agriculture is estimated more than two million chickens were also lost in the state\nNow it's more than just Georgia and there's other states that are seen impacts of this to Frank how we as a farmer in North Carolina\nTop for it he was actually top producer of the year last year does producers pummeled with severe weather this year chip hurricane Michael was the second hurricane to hit this year he says six to seven inches of rain fell on already saturated soils with that system last week saturated from Hurricane Florence that hit just a month earlier\nThere were still corn harvest at an early soy beans being harvested\nWell good good uh just to make sure that everybody is aware of this congressmen Peterson pounded the congressional biofuels cow carcass and he's co chair of the caucus and I'd say that his caucus gotta win with President Trump support\nFor year around to bail ability of e Fifteen but congressman just because the president is supporting a Fifteen doesn't mean that the process is complete what's what's the next step here\n[noise] well um you know they've got to get the rules in place [noise] ah we expect\nMy biggest concern at this point as we're going to be sued yeah I'm by the oil industry and others that are going to tie this thing up for a while but it's a you know step in the right direction um you know we've been trying to figure out if there's some way that we can\nGet a a compromise with the the opponents and see if we can move forward a logical way by this doesn't seem like as possible you know I'd\nI don't know why we're fighting so much over you know that is actually a small difference in the markets difference in the market plunged but um you know\nThat's where we're at so we're in that [noise] you know it it's going to be\nThe biggest effect will be next summer if we're able to um you don't have the Fifteen available all summer ... but we still have problems because even if the Fifteen is located we used a lot of places we don't have the infrastructure in place to deliver and also that's another issue [noise] yup\nYup it's going to take a long time to ah see an impact in the marketplace there but it's worth it's worth the fight I don't think there's any question about that is it going to take some legislation to kind of instruct GPA on what they should be doing here\nLast yeah that's what we think and we'd like to do but it's tough to get anything\nAnd it's a kind of instruct GPA on what they should be doing here\nWell that's yeah that's what we think and we'd like to do but it's tough to get anything legislatively on uh because of the opposition uh especially in the Senate [noise] so we're going to try you know and that would be the best we could get something\nSolid through the Congress and the get it in place but you know getting anything through the Senate is a difficult situation [laughter]\nYeah no question about that and and that includes the farm bill let's let's jump over their congressman Peterson is the ranking member of the house committee or obviously on the farm bill conference committee ... how much it will give us a status update congressmen is there any progress being made\n[laughter] yeah my uh our staff is working\nYou know every day on every titled\nOr we've got a three of those titles pretty much done and we're making progress but um it's slow a slower than I Would like to see it but um you know we came out of our last face to face meeting United a with a strategy and that is to get this stuff's\nWrapped up over the next few weeks so that we've got a bill drafted scored and ready to go\nThe week after we get back from a\nFrom the election which is the second week after the election so that's the plan ah we're not there yet we're still hung up on some stuff in the body title [noise] still some hung up on some of the conservation stuff\nAnd um you know obviously the uh the snap issue a rash and\nDoesn't seem to be a getting really any place a significant and you know people need to understand that whatever you think about this and I'm In I'm I'm for the people working I was in the White House\nWhen we put the work requirements Yemen in Nineteen Nineteen Ninety six [noise]\nAh the biggest problem is that um ah the waivers that have been given out including by this administration\nHas given waivers on a good part of the country since they've been in office in spite of the fact that they claim that they want people to work so [noise] um there were some changes in the house bill in waivers a buffet mixed demand with a adding people fifty to sixty end of the process so [noise]\nYou know it is what people need to understand is\nThe house\nBill ... has no chance of going anyplace in the Senate\nBecause of the snap provisions [laughter] the Senate bill you know a camp to pass the house without Democrats right and the Democrats are not going to support the most you know them the urban Democrats are not going to support the changes in the snap so\nWhat we need is\nA bill that will garner ten Fifteen Democrats in the Senate and you know Seventy two hundred Democrats in the house and that's where we need to get ... and if we're going to get a bill is going to pass [noise]\nGotcha gotcha now on the commodity title uh ... what about the proposed changes to the park and appeals see it in the house and Senate bills you support any of those changes that if you do what are they\nYeah I support 'em you know we're trying to\nIn the art program or trying to solve this problem or one county\nGets payments and the next county doesn't ah so that's relatively inexpensive and ah we want to give people the option to be able to move from a RC to the old city and vice versa or so there's a some kind of fine tuning you if you will\nAnd those programs that are I support and I think all of us support that's not really what's holding that up what's what the issue is\nIs trying to add this new a drought um prevention yeah\nWhich ah says that if you have a deep for drought for twenty weeks or more than you can updates you're a bass bass a acres [noise] um you know that in my in my part of the world ah there's no such thing as a twenty ... route\n[laughter] yeah general you know especially a deep for drought so exactly uh\nYou know so it's it's skewed is about six hundred million dollars you drew the\nTo the south basically I'm which I'm you know it's not in the whole scheme of things is not just a huge amount of money but some people are concerned about is Tim ... I think\nBut I'm more worried about now is that what's happened with hurricane yeah [noise] I think you're going to see when we get back after the election a lot of pressure from from um members\nThat are in that hurricane area too crowded and something that the farm bill or to the corporations or something and try to deal with that that could potentially give us more problems [laughter]\nThat dissolved and we already have so we'll\nWe'll just see how that plays out\nOkay would you rather have and and I I think it's well known that you're leaning more towards the Senate building towards the house bill but would you rather have the Senate bill or an extension of the current bills the congressman\n[laughter] [laughter] well I Want to\nGet a new bill that so [laughter] I don't want to talk about an extension or you know that the\nSenate bill I couldn't live with\nOkay I ...\nThe main reason is because\nThe you know and they made some ... that actually is a pretty significant changes in snap\nA in the Senate bill\nAnd they've got bipartisan support for that and and the reason that I think that a favor the Senate bill is because it's something that's pretty close to what can actually get done\nA you know with the with the house um you know passing a partisan bill passed with only Republicans\nAre because of the snap provisions and people need to understand you know I mean it and it's kind of this mess out there that nobody's working you know we've had work requirements as Nineteen Ninety six\nYou know that there are eight of the problem\nIs that the way the system has been operated it doesn't work and what people need to understand we had twenty three hearings on the house on the snap program\nOut of a hundred and ten farm bill hearings so\nA number of things were brought up in those hearings are needed the things that shouldn't be change things that they'd be improved and so forth or do you think anything that was brought up in those twenty three hearings ended up in the bill\nNo one ended up with zero so what's in the bill\nDoes that ever come up in any of those twenty two hearings know this couple hundred percent brought in from outside without anything being brought up in any of those hearings that's the problem and if you want to get this bill done you know you gotta do\nTo rat reality of what the Senate can do and Pat Roberts is just as adamant against what the house is done with snap is Debbie Stabenow saw riots\nYeah what the Senate can do and Pat Roberts is just as adamant against what the house is done with snap is Debbie Stabenow Shariah you know and they try to you know it's just not going to happen so this was a welfare reform bill that they put [noise]\nTo the house so you do you want to have a welfare reform bill or do you want to harm us really loaded [noise]\nGotcha gotcha congressmen I Wish we could have gotten this trade issues or like to get you on that we can talk about us MCA and or some other trade issues out there and we'll do that again as soon as we can okay\nThat sounds good All right that is representative Collin Peterson from Minnesota we've got any Lucas Georgia Farm Bureau of ...\nStates digging deeper with the mostly a company the show where to draw me experts take your questions about crop nutrition bureau your host cookbook folk and raw spender senior immigrant almost from the mosaic company my this is\nIt with our producers they have a spirit about them I can tell you there on the road ah they they really are a we had a session on Sunday at a farmer's market\nKind of a core deal if if if your viewers out there no I Know you've got a shift in ... and a lot of those is probably listening to your show now wars some of the three and four hundred farmers that came over there to listen to secretary per day\nAs well as our commissioner Gary Black and they were looking for a message of hope and and I think through prayer and a lot of things we realize the solutions are going to come slow\nAnd this is going to be a thing that ... there's going to be facing Georgia farmers not just today to more but as well as next year when they start making those determinations of what they go by what they're going to seat and how they're going to pay for what they got this year\nAnd the real quick what does the state need now to help that recovery process\nI think the thing that we need the most is prayer chip I you know there's ways that you can support the Georgia farmers you can go to ... feet out or\nThey've got a foundation for ... out there you can land on that the Georgia kept them and there's also if you're going to hit livestock producers here in the state you can go to Georgia cattle ... and you can make some contributions there but yeah but I take it as a country and as a state we need prayers more than we need anything\nAnd he said something early on here that really touched me farm family lives will be changed forever so you know that we're sending our prayers down into Georgia and try and lift you guys up and give you the strength to to pay this challenge head on [noise]\nThank you for your time you bet you bet that is Andy ... information director Georgia Farm Bureau my goodness gracious they are dealing with the situation down in the south part of the country right now\nAnd I'm like a representative you said there's going to\nBe a

they've just they've pretty much had a little bit shorter crop the they put a bunch of a\nSugar into ethanol earlier this year that made them a little more competitive they actually exported a little bit to the U.S and there's some other locations but now all of a sudden they run out of a a sugar they've slowed down to the the crushing over there and ah their prices are starting to grow up they they use a lot of aunts\nAnd uncles say to you know they don't have a ten percent ethanol blend they have a twenty twenty five percent ethanol blend\nYeah I think their average in like twenty seven percent on the blend great right now and I ... you know it I I don't understand why we can't get that technology that they've gotten their vehicles down there Brian up here in the United states so that we could burn an average of twenty seven percent [laughter]\nThat's a really good question there [laughter]\nHumor on that one [laughter] yeah you know the uh uh the the Fifteen as you guys\nI talked with Palin Peterson from Minnesota about it this morning I talked with Glenn Thompson\nA from Pennsylvania about it obviously they were both ... supportive of it ah ah Peterson more so than Thompson I Would say but Thompson's not against it that I could tell in the conversation but Bryan it's\nPretty good news it's it's not a cure all for the corn market but it is pretty good news\nIt yeah it definitely will take any any kind of positive news we can get it especially on the uh the demand side of things I think core and has a really good demands story right now but you're always looking to build it uh so you\nYou know it's positive news a short term probably has limited uh impact a longer term I I think\nIf it gives incentive for more stations daddy Fifteen palms a then that becomes a a definite positive and and that's really what it is it's growth into the\nFuture and and uh any time you can do that uh like I said it's a positive\nYou know ... and Brian it's good news is that it comes at this time of the year number one it gives us the chance of having a Fifteen available\nYear round and in the summer of twenty Nineteen if we can get the ball rolling on this but it's also it it the news also comes at a time when we are switching over that we we may not be there yet but the market is switching over from a focus on the supply side to the demand side and and\nThat this is a time of year where we need to throw some good demand news that corn and soybeans\nWell on corn or the exports very strong right now I'm you know the the ethanol grind I think that uh uh we went through a little bump period bumpy period there but\nThat's now are picked up again\nAnd uh so I I think that the demand side of the story for corn is positive ah that that's going to carry us I think in the months or a head here and until we start to focus more on the um you know a crutch for next year those types of things to South American crop the types of things that can uh maybe slow\nDown something a from a rally perspective but right now a corn definitely has a better stories and soybeans do 'em on the demand side\nYeah ... ... ... and we've been talking about that for a while you've mentioned it several times on the show beach and and I agree I agree completely but Jeff that big run that we saw on the market yesterday that had some demand news behind it didn't it\nI think it had spooky demand news even though it's not Halloween yet but here's a here's here's the\nThing that got things going to get the funds to cover because the weekly USDA expert inspections report showed two car goes up beans moving off shore to China one from the b._m._w. and one from the Gulf\nNow we haven't seen that happened since September ... yet early September where we had one cargo go over to China but these are basically what what happened today was people realize these for sales or may previously probably back in the springtime\nAnd it's just and then they're probably sold the sign of green or cop go now to pay the tariff which would basically be rebate it back to them since government entities and ah it's not like we're going to see a whole lotta new buying the Chinese are not gonna know private\nA crush is going to buy us beans until this trade spat is figure it out but it was enough to get us into a more positive technical situation\nAnd you know maybe there is some movement going on behind the seats we can only hope so but it just seems like\nWe we need to see some of these other nations continue to\nLoad up and just in case we do get a trade deal by the end of November yeah yeah\nAnd and Jeff ... it was the last time that you on that you were on two or three weeks ago that you mentioned that the POW was starting to bid for some beans and it wasn't just a shipment off the west coast to China I mean there wasn't Vietnam a destination and one of those boats off at the out of the peons W\nTwo of them yeah OK to two boats loaded Vietnam which is a very positive sign when we we got to get the market going I think there's other Asian nations that are may start to designate the POW as a place or that they want to go from because it's much cheaper for them to get it from there and that would really help to improve\nLogistics of the entire soybean market if we don't have those beans and North Dakota heading down to sing\nIt it from there and that would really help to improve the logistics of the entire so every market if we don't have those beans and North Dakota heading down to St Louis to get you down the river there going out to the west coast\nGoing to help the bases across the country\nYeah absolutely absolutely will and bright and there were some beans headed to Argentina and the last inspection report as well\nYeah Argentine I you know I think that we're into the the timeframe when China would normally be buying you know us being hand over fist that as an obviously going to happen this year because of the the trade circumstances or other countries are there to pick up some of the black and and I think that got us to this point now we're going into that period\nOr we're ... we would see the exceptional demand export demand\nAh probably going to live through there I just don't see it the keeping full page with everybody else but domestically we can't forget about the crush base I mean we had record crushed yeah uh you know no by that that helped out a yesterday as well\nUm and that that's there to pick up the slack or on the export side of things\nNow ... you know is it going to pick up all of it now ah but at the same time uh it does give you some hope that uh we are going to shoot through some of those supplies it isn't just a lost cause here as we go through the uh what is normally are our strongest demand period\nYeah Brian that crush pace that we're working with my gosh it it it seems like what six months ago we were already starting to question well we got to be bumping up against are crushed capacity obviously we hadn't because we continue to set the record monthly crush\nYeah and I think this is the year uh Eighteen Nineteen of the year that the crush capacity will will be fully tested a moving forward it assuming\nA that we can continue to move the product and I think that that's kind of a a lost a you know factor in this whole thing is that the oil demand is very strong ah the primary source of there being a ... D so uh we continue to ah see stronger than anticipated demand on the the oil side\nAnd then the meal with the exports um you know\nThat's still a positive story there um\nYou know domestically we've seen some of the DVDs back up a little bit\nAt the same time I think it's still a positive story [noise]\nAll right this guy we're going to talk about the supply side of the market both us and\nAmerica now we're talking with pro farmer editor rank ready pro former senior market analyst Jeff Wilson right here on a TV [noise]\nNo matter what you do you're always raising the bar trying to do better than I ever knew Laurel fungicides for corn and soybeans and help you get the edge are looking for\nWell Brazil's off to a very quick start uh both corn and soybean planting I'm running a had a normal uh well ahead of normal so uh you know the the sooner you get the soybean crop planted\nA sooner it's harvested the quicker they can get the second are suffering a um corn crop planted so I you know it it looks like it's set up at this point in time\nFor Brazil to make a huge rebound or from last year's drought ravaged crop but especially the second corn crop down there um it looks like a big production your big rebound production you're a for Brazil\nOr Argentina it's opt to about an average start ah right now are nothing more than average job but nothing less than an average either so ah you know what how's the weather grand developed El Nino um you know would actually be favorable\nUh for most of Argentina El Nino developed a large portion of Brazil it'd be neutral the northeast portion would be a potentially negative with above normal towns and below normal pretty stepping in that area\nYeah that's up where they grow about what Fifteen Percent of the crap that gets into that El Nino drought area\nAbout ten to Fifteen Percent of the soybean crop up in that northeast but keep in mind or the way that they got to record yields the past couple of years has been the northeast to his actually are not pull down or the average there and ... and after I see you need some of that or to get to those those big deals with now with that said\nA plan things are are up are probably somewhere in the range of three percent to five percent or for for soybeans or will be up and and uh\nAnd so you know you can back off a little bit a from a national perspective right and still get there with the increase\nThere will be up and and uh and so you know you can back off a little bit from a national perspective right and still get there with the increase in acreage\nOkay Jeff this one's for you it's a question of Twitter at J. liquor ma he says with these Nineteen over four dollars and Ninety two to Ninety four million acres of corn expected in twenty Nineteen how far should an operation get price\n[laughter] so you can sleep at night is probably the note\nI mean you've got to take some risk of the table look a year ago at this time December Eighteen was it four or five December nineteenth today four oh five\nWhere do we go down to we went to three a forty one or the December contract and so there's that I I think that people have to look at their own balance sheets they have to see okay can I make a profit of four or five I think I I can\nHow much do I want to you know we leave on price how much do I want to price right now\nAnd you know the thing is to shop around there might be some people look into a especially if you can harvest early there might be some people that might want to send me your corner if you can get it off in September so that might be some decent basis bits out there as well if you want to make a cash contract\nAnd all that that ah we are into that period now where the Koran demand could pull is higher still I I Do think that there's more outside in the the December Eighteen contract\nAnd if that strengthens than there's more strength in the December Nineteen as well um so ... we're into you know I don't think it's necessarily today that you have to make those Nineteen crop sales but we're into that window now where it can kind of work for you\nUm before we switch our focus to South America before was which are focused on what our twenty Nineteen acres you'll be hearing the the United States a corner makers are going to go up there um that's I think your window so we're into that now\nOkay very cool we've only got a couple of minutes left here guys but I Want to jump over to livestock beach export demand both pork and beef it it's helping these markets out\nWell record strong and especially when the beef side of things just been phenomenal um you know we we hear all the talk about the terrorists and stuff like that and the impacts and ensure there's been some but the effects more demand has been just off the charts a strong\nA fork export demand has been a little bit more up and down and stuff like that but it's still running\nA at a record pace in an expected to grow again next year on both beef and pork exports so we're into it a timeframe a war that demand is helping to chew through those access supplies that we have out there the increasing hog numbers the increasing feedlot numbers are so it it's a positive from ah the demand perspective\nYeah and the supply side of the market Jeff that it continues to kind of put some pressure on the nearby hawks but does back much contracts are offering up some opportunities\nThere getting up to areas that are are getting profitable\nNow the question is uh what's going to happen in China with the Africans fever and that that's that's such a huge I don't I don't think anybody can tell you with any certainty ... what how much more they're going to import but you know we we've had outbreaks like this in the past\nUh uh I think it was called blue here maybe like ten years ago and that resulted in the Chinese buying quite a bit of pork after that outbreak and belt isn't\nQuite as serious as as as Africans went fever is we just don't have enough information coming out of China and so I think he got to let your ah you know if we could get a\nYou know these markets up a little bit more and especially considering how much are the catch markets strengthened here this month [noise] yup\nAll right thank you so much really appreciate it that is pro farmer editor Frank grading will talk to you later beach and pro farmer senior
