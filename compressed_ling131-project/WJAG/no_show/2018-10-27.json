you can read early in the season it's because it's the wrong science look into all LeBron James ... hey LeBron James is the best player on earth\n[laughter] 'cause they're not going to miss the playoffs be it takes a while to kind of get your arms around the weight of that thing\nThe notion that one in three or an own for only three start or whatever a stumble out the gate\nIs never going to

basketball\nEven even\nWith Brad Stevens it's a little disconcerting to see a team that can't get over the hundred point pregame mark\nAnd judge of that I think reflected some of this I I'm not worried about the Celtics they are a brand new team\nThey are when you bring new guys together it's really hard to figure out roles in chemistry and as great as the Celtics were last year in as much as everybody would take\nGordon Hayward on their team the NBA and Kyrie Irving was there but then he wasn't your reintegrating both those guys are integrating hey we're into the team for the first

not worried about Boston\nBut I Am worried about the other three teams that those jobs they'll get made a really good point and I'll just reiterated\nPhilly is so far ahead of schedule even though it doesn't feel that way 'cause they have salt if two guys that are MBP caliber players at some point over the course of their career\nAnd they last for so long and they won a playoff series last year

I think search is great but the real problem is they don't shoot three pointers particularly well when ... out there that's obviously correct to bowl but when ... out there you're not giving folds the opportunity to break loose and so then this weird place where\nThey've got to play more Calif old enough to give them confidence and see what they have in him before they give up on the guy that they drafted number one overall last year they moved off to draft last year\nAnd every woman who's on the floor and I think Jeff hit on this you've got two guys on the floor who can't shoot\nThat's a really hard way to win in the NBA two thousand Eighteen and Simmons when it's him on the floor it doesn't matter he's such a remarkable point forward or however you want to label him that he'll find shooters yes this round the shooter so and some of these work on a shot\nWe haven't gotten into this because there's a lot going on but I sat in the offseason events him as well as in the gym every single day work on a shot you got a little bit of a warning sign terms of him region has potential he's already said this year I'm not word on a shower now is that where I'm at get there bro you can be LeBron James good he ... your that talented if you work on shot\nLeBron couldn't shoot the rock when he came\nOut of high school to the NBA he figured it out\nPut the free can work and\nI I like your Philly team I think we're going to finish the top for assuming that look I'm assuming that embodied is going to be healthy right ... are held in there's too much talent\nNot to be really really impressive but I think the weaknesses that were seen you're not going to be able to overcome those in a seven game series any shooters and the ... thing would be a mighty price I think what makes more sense the Lakers needs to be ... I don't think they do to the Sixers yes they do\nThey need to be able to stretch before a lot more and they need more couples to be able to shoot the ball and not be on the floor and I'm rooting for the kid I I said his life was so awful for it\nThey need to be able to stretch before a lot more and they need ... to be able to shoot the ball and not be on the floor and I'm rooting for the kid I I felt his life was so awful for\nA five to one to four CBS or Twitter sports writer sports or react ER\nEric I'm going to ...

Thompson was out at the end of the year that six of the I guess it started I don't know\nFifteen different offsets combinations up front or six of those guys are wild with offseason surgery or they threw out prior really didn't work out as a wide receiver now he's gone for the jets as well Josh Fox was really in a rookie season didn't play well\nI mean it was it was amazing work was able to do what he got the numbers but this is the type of quarterback yes he was very steady\nAnd the big thing for him is what's gonna happen in the big moment\nAs you get to the big games in the big moments are you going to be able to deliver that was the only thing that people could say about him and I think he will\nTheismann here on the show ... I'm not gonna lie you just kind of blew my mind with the running back with the running back because every one of the top teams in the NFL\nJoe Theismann here on the show ... I'm not gonna lie you just kind of blew my mind with the running back with the running back because every one of the top teams in the NFL this year has a great running back accent I\nI don't even have been great so maybe even the patriots too on that when I was\nWhite yeah right yeah no I think\nNew England has never really relied on it but then you know look what look at what he did that look at it from the Philadelphia Eagles a year ago\nLooking for New England the year before it it's it's an interesting position do because we like to focus on the quarterbacks 'cause they're getting all the big numbers but if you're able to run the football you're able to control the game a whole lot better and you know even even the job that uh it gets done in Pittsburgh taken over for ...\nYeah you know that's that's sort of pointed Pittsburgh in the right direction so it's sort of like the unsung heroes of football as a running backs\nJoe Theismann here on the showing last night as the Texans rounded off their their fifth string win last night was a pretty resounding victory in Miami the big headline was shown Watson five touchdown passes but your point Joe memorial or had a great game on the ground and he ran for a hundred and thirty yards\nHe did it and see nobody talks about it and you know I think well when the shah when you throw at night at at one point in turn like Nike passes five of them for touchdowns foreign completing [laughter] yeah that's a I mean you better talk about that but you're right\nI mean Lamar Miller's ... that they were you know they were looking for him to step up a little bit and and now you're starting to see it but I think going down the road now with the weather changing uh especially in the northeast bought outdoor stadiums you're going to have to have a running gave to be able to continue to win football games\nJoe when you look at that Texans team and started on three a bunch of people wrote them all but I did I jumped I've been on a bill O'Brian bandwagon for a while I jumped off looks like I I got off way too early after years of a morally believing he was going to figure it out because it seems are always injured\nAs best we can assess the now or the Texans are real and see\nThreat or am I getting carried away with the wind three\nOr two years ago if they had they had a quarterback that it'd be the New England patriots\nI think you could have said the same thing about the Jacksonville Jaguars I mean New England is caught teams the end of the year in championship games that haven't had very good quarterback play whether the whether they're opposite of being there because of injury or because they haven't played very well at that point um I think the Texans are for real I mean I I still think the Sean and watch it is is the next great\nA double threat in this game I yeah he's he's much more accurate than can is when it comes to throw into football a camp gotten a bit older I think the shot and has the explosive this to be able to to make plays with his legs\nA guy like Shon watching create so many problems were defensive coaches because you can't rush past him and give him escape lanes\nBecause then he puts tremendous pressure and if you don't squeeze the pocket on him he's he has the ability to to throw the ball down the field and you know Hopkins is just phenomenal I mean it's not like he doesn't have any receivers to throw the football too I Will fully couldn't run like the like the wind\nAnd you know I mean to me it defensively there are strong came I think it's a a really really solid football team right now and they're starting to hit their stride\nJoe Theismann here on the program Joe the rams undefeated we've gotten a lot of rams on the show actually last week and they just and I I had the chance to interview on the TV show and ... they just have this they liked each other they like their head coach they have a grade by when you look at the end of see\nHow many teams do you think are capable of being that rams team when when push comes to shove and we started talking about play football\nI don't think there's any of I think the rent is going to feed it\nI really do I I I think they have speed\nThey have creativity from their head that\nGoes I think here on the U.S our laws here say well you you should get it from five in the morning to go sit was was Sean\nYeah I Would I I live about a half an hour from Redskins park and I didn't want to interfere in his preparation so I looked there you know he got in about four thirty quarter to five and I go I leave the house if I get there about quarter to six weeks sit for a good half hour and forty minutes just to pick his brain\nThis to the list to ... and I've had the opportunity to sit and installation makes I'm telling you something you cannot be stupid and play for the ramp she flies through things and you have to keep up with it it's exciting it's fun and the one thing that doesn't get talked about you know we talk about the running backs already getting over looked a little bit\nThe one thing with the ramps that nobody talks about his weight Phillips Val yeah he has his ability to be able to communicate visibility to be able to put defenses together and now he has weapons to do it with I mean they sign ...\nMinnesota and the rams went all in this year to get to the Superbowl I mean they they made moves they made decisions personnel wise to try and get there and uh I think the rams are I have the ability to be undefeated it's everybody stays healthy that's always the big if in this game\nWhat I Love the Internet I'm On the ... I mean he's so young what makes him so good so quickly in in his career\nI think first of all he has the ability to be able to relate to the players very well being so young I mean he's got like four or five players on his football team that interestingly enough are older than he is\nAs soon as almost his age right yeah\nYeah pretty close and so I I mean you don't look at him I think you look at his experience you look at the way he presents himself you look at the respect that they have for him when you see things like that when you see guys and meetings respect somebody\nNot because it and say well he's young you know what does he know he has a proven record he's been in this business he he's a career football kid\nIs what he is and I'm In a cares about his got he really does and you get Bill you hit the nail on the head I I I Do present stations around the country around the world really and one of the things I talk to people about is the environment that you're working\nI could walk into a locker room in the national football league and spend a half an hour in it and tell you whether a team has a chance to be successful and not just by the by you get just by the fact that the guys like one another they like going to work they have a good time together\nThe salvation army is on the ground across the state of Florida and the Gulf Coast serving those impacted by hurricane Michael\nWith generous public support the salvation army can provide immediate relief with things like food hydration shelter hygiene\nKits and emotionally spiritually care to contribute to the salvation army hurricane disaster relief effort visit Salvation Army dot listening give dot org one hundred percent of the designated gifts will be used in support of those affected by hurricane Michael\n[noise]\nCBS Sports radio we saw in northeast Nebraska on AM seven eighty five ...

at a different level of understanding a you know cameras and\nAnd Rick cause it's very confusing or I think the mostly about what you're talking about it's at a at a different level of understanding a you know cameras and then replays and TV such I don't think most average layman fans understand what you're talking about so I'll let me ask you this question\nDo you believe that the headquarters at baseball where they do this I'm assuming in New York correct that they have fifty million angles of this uh I think more than what we're seeing on television they have the purists look at that bag\nOr now he disappeared so that he ran he ran off I don't know I was asking him a serious question\nAnd then he just left so I was he was I lost in there for a second\nAnd uh I I Want to ask him if that is that in okay ah\nSorry about that race up where was I Am what I'm saying is so baseball at the league office when they do when they look at these ...\nThey have what I Would deem more angles that we see on television they have more cameras and the ultimate angles of every single a play then then I think the normal fan does watching on television and and the replay that we see 'cause I'm with you I thought he was out but\nUh I you know despite what you're talking about all these different speeds of lenses and cameras in film or do you believe that I have a hard time believing that they can't get back\nCalled right at the league office when they have so many different angles\nYeah so when you watch the the actual broadcast that is pretty frames per second and you were to just pause it and not go frame by frame you're still going thirty frames per second whereas if you cause the actual\nLike frame rate that it was shot in whether it's two hundred and forty frames or a thousand praying for a second and you're one frame by frame you so much more you so much more that is\nRight was help you in deciding the play and I don't think they do I think they will [laughter] three when they watch it I don't think they are primarily I think they watch we watch on TV\nAnd its way harder to tell and predator stop you know and so I think don't broadcast gold frame by frame reaches stop it and you press the the right Arab ... or\nSo you're saying so you think the same they are seeing the exact same thing we are and that we're all seeing the same thing the same replace\nYeah for sure they decided that way too quick way to ...\n... what do you think it will I get what Rick you said your but here's the thing\nThey're all they're trying to do in baseball all you hear about every single day from Rob Manfred all these guys now they want to speed the game up\nIf they start going frame by frame look it up they're going to be in that thing for Fifteen minutes looking at these replay I get what you're saying Rick I I Want them to get it right too\nBut you can't just go these super slow mo frame by frame shots of every single plane that they go over there and put that dopey headset on when they do these reviews dad's already mad and I've had enough as it is I Can't have the guy over there in Chelsea for ten minutes looking at a\nYou know three thousand whatever you're talking about by a frame look it up the thing I I Can't have it Rick I just\nCan't you know you would think that with technology and in today's day and age where it's so sophisticated like these cameras and everything like I Know a guy that shoots\nA film and and whatever basketball\nSri photographer guy and and he shoots amazing pictures and I would I'd have to ask him but like the TV cameras work than they do with these TV cameras it really is remarkable I don't know what else to say I I just think that they do what I think if they do the best they can with where we are right now in technology with cameras what's that's\nAll they should have to do which is all the fish should be when there was a point that needs to be reviewed you know I don't think they should be sitting there for ten minutes looking at Fifteen angles or the play you know it should be you know All right we're taking a second look at it what did you say for the hours that this was in and\nThat maybe there's too many ... maybe there's too many people with their hands on it that's really true maybe they just have one or two guys that make that decision or three and a two and three when\nThere's too many people involved with baseball there's too many people involved with the NFL reviews there's too many people are in Toronto with the NHL reviews there's too many people involved in all of it was just too many people\nThe NBA actually might have the only one that I Do it and decide to do it right there the the ... just right there with the tea like that and about it I mean like the best for the NFL did do that remember they had the they had them go under the hood over there than everyone that arrive or to solve him\nThat's bad I think it's bad on Sundays man that the ... are bad and takes forever I Can't\nBe going frame by frame looking at the other five minute exactly you can't do it I agree\nWith you I really do a good call either way that he knows this stuff and that ah it's so advanced in ... but you know the average fan doesn't understand about those cameras and the replays and the film and everything so good good points by you made Rick Roger in Jackson, Mississippi\nYes sir how you doing hey at my man\nOh well you know your mommy of movement jak of a sports that are you on TALK over there is dying\nOf thanks brother Mike my question is uh who you are you got the for the same time\nUm I well I I'm taking the Vikings in that game now I Want to deny that I'm a little worried\nAre based on a you know Paul Allen denied telling me about all the problems that the Vikings have with injuries some of their best players are all kinds of banged up they went from being favored by one now they're getting one and a half but I'll\nTake the Vikings and one and a half at home I mean have you seen happening spreads in the NFL changed dramatically this week I mean I've been ... changes on ... on my ... gas but the numbers that I put up early in the wake are all different they're all different almost\nYours and a lot of movement I guess with all the you know the other dogs hidden all different rocky games we've had so far the season people will know worth the button they're just all over the place and changes\nRight like I don't even know I don't have it in front of me but like I just wanted to say like who do you like and the game Roger\nA sign a lot of science but they're deep and been the best in the world is a ... year\nOkay so when I started I was laying one and a half now I'm getting one\nAnd a half mafia that's a huge swing I gotta win by two now I get an you know I can lose by one and cover allow for ya I my man All right so I don't even know what he said but it was funny I'm just guessing that it was funny is it an extra innings you

and now apparently a Canfield either that should have been an easy out are you getting me I don't know about easy do you think that was an easy out\nOn a graph ... glove trying to find second I'm looking for a little bit of a different angle I Want to see where we are and why was when he threw it did he have time to maybe that himself a little bit better because he threw it off balance did he have time to set himself before throwing up that's what I mean he just through it so quickly\nWater miracle what a miracle that they just got that Ron can you believe that even if he does just stop and set himself and throw diverse even if he doesn't get tweak\nMonths he would still be a third right you know that most you only went home ... got away the wrong I Do and if he stops and starts himself and maybe we reached out its first and third with two outs and and it's still up to one game a union he was a rental anyway right he's not gonna be in Boston next year\nOr I'd have to get out the Hitler created because there's no way that\nNow he's like he's on death watch now I mean did you see that play he has done nothing what a bat right nothing on the ... he was embarrassing running the basis than I\nHave got thrown out at home member that and he should have been thrown out at first picked off then it got solver sled dirt then you've got thrown out of the play against the slow on a a ... center ram I wrong and then he makes this budget throw that was a horrible what is the question here what are they doing what is the review about\nWhat do they replaying what ... what is going on here what\nThey're saying that he shouldn't have gotten a base\nThere just you never went out to play 'cause I'm a stupid instead of just one right\nOh that oh you mean that we would go over to a set of twins at all oh so bleak would go to second but not this does not affect Munch the correct\nOh he would have been out man you gotta be kidding me that's a decent throw you would have been out by a mile he still had seven strides to get to first base on that ground or he just absolutely butchered that play he had that play down ...\nYou cannot deny that if he got that ball got to go out in a hurry and he had all the time in a world to get ... look at us he had a ball and he was leaning he likes stumbled but look how far down the line played was when he won them out by a mile\nI don't think you would have been able to talk of the ... wilderness but he's not dry why try to get rid of it before ...\nWhile he likes stumbled talk they were thought he was going to go down to get rid of

to out\nAnd I believe it's going to be no to pitch coming from either but I Will hold off because I can legally do the play by play and I'll tell you what happened after the use the bumper back of the most of the conversation from last week and the nine thirty am eastern game\nAh the the the titans and chargers which ended up being a crazy finished my ... going for two and not getting it I'm\nActually in in what we were talking about Melvin Gordon I did not play and which is good because he did not playing fantasy but that messed me up a little bit 'cause I was so focused on the fantasy I forgot to set\nWas my survivor pool which is the survivor pool here for WFAN and the CBS Sports radio\nAnd I forgot to send them to pick that on time so how did I lose my two picks and the survivor pool even though at ... pm eastern I did send in what would have been the Sunday night game in the Monday Night game they would have hit but the rules the rules of the league and I was wrong so yes I lost by survivor pool not sending the picks it on time\nNow there's two other host here at station at the same thing to bigger names than I Am that also did not do that and they did not send their picks it on time as well and they were not happy with it I\nSame thing to bigger names than I Am that also did not do that and they do not send their picks it on time as well and they were not happy with it I was accepting of it because the rules of the rules that you got to play by the rules and\nEnded up losing my two survivor picked because of that so\nThe fantasy football did okay with no Melvin Gordon however the survivor pool not so much any guesses by the way on who the to a host star here you guys on the other side the glass that did not get the survivor pull picks it on time once once from CBS Sports\nRadio ones from the fan I'm going to say somebody that works in the morning show here back on what side on the networks that that would be correct the most know would it be the other guy in the show yes pat on the other guy the human ... machine\nWell here's the thing some texting Ernie about who runs the league and he goes\nTo add to the same thing I got to be fair to everyone I go there I go cats could sue plus you through a table or something I'll just be nice about it but yes a task is one of them and then after Robert sue without scores best friend was the other so there you go with the latest on the CBS Sports rated WFAN survivor pool where three of\nThe host for ... to send their exit on I'm nobody has has and and also as Robert [laughter] All right so ... back to to come in\nAs I can give you the play by play ... pitch can't do that so uh we'll keep you up to them that it's a first and second with ...\nOn on the mountain so getting back to the speed Abraham ... which I find\nIt very very interesting where the socks and Dodgers played in a fourteen innings in game two of the Nineteen sixties World Series\nAt the Sox one to one Babe Ruth went all fourteen I went to baseball reference during the break\nIn that for the dating game six head from Brooklyn or seven for the socks and both pitchers actually when as long as they could Sherry Smith\nHe went Thirteen and a third seven head to our and runs and then Babe Ruth one fourteen six had\nOne earned run and then ended with day what was I think it was a walk up single and the bottom of the fourteenth if your scoring at home by the way yes it was a walk off single to left field by the way according to this baseball reference of its wrong blame a baseball reference\nAnd we'll keep that just went down so now he will go to the bottom of the fifteenth with the red Sox and the Dodgers it's just one long game is already well over now six hours\nAnd the big thing for me it don't matter how this game turns out once again you would if you are just stay neutral baseball fan have know rooting allegiances to either the Dodgers are the red Sox you want the Dodgers to win this game\nBecause I Want to see this World Series go as long as possible\nAs some of the dog and if I don't want to see this World Series go as long as possible and I I don't think Boston's losing the series I picked him in ... before the series did start out they Boston's\nYou'll lose the series that they don't go on to many losing streaks the Boston Red Sox this year as you may have realized they won a hundred and eight regular season games and in the postseason they'd been phenomenal only losing to one to the Yankees and one to the Houston Astros which was a game to in the Yankees series\nAnd then it was game one\nIn the series up against the Astros but it's the red Sox theme home road doesn't matter as they are undefeated\nOn the road in this postseason being five an hour they won game three and four up against the yanks and then games three four and five up against these the nachos at a minute maid park so we'll see if they do lose one right now as we are in the fifteenth but the big thing for right now the thinking of is who's going to start game for\nFor the Boston Red Sox and Palmer incessant pitch yet maybe they go him or they\nCould go Rodrigues they could for the red Sox as I think you only pitched one batter yeah you only pits one batter so they could go Rodrigues but that's a big decision for Alex Cora and I get it to the game tomorrow\nIt's not a a a one PM start so it it is still a little quick turn around and it affects your bullpen greatly and maybe the red Sox even have to go to\nAn open or type of thing we only looked at the picture go for one inning or maybe you let him go for three or four I don't know how much you can expect that Rodriguez or Palmer and coming up later if either one of them do start game for but this is going to have major implications on the series\nAs long as the Dodgers when just to see a Boston response tomorrow at Boston wins this one three oh I don't care who they it's a game for I don't think this thing gets back to Boston Boston goes up there yeah they may not when did it before but I Would definitely think they're going to win and five and\nHe doesn't seem to recognize reality he lives in a fantasy

D. Martinez had three at bat no ...\n... and his three at bats he had no hits as well\nAnd\nFor the people that started the gate and that's where you you go wow\nBet ... Bogart one of those games for Boston it's ... it's a it's a rare occasion\nThat's that's the Bogart one of those games for Boston it's ... it's\nA it's a rare occasion but it's one of those games and that's why the Dodgers have to win this one so much ... touch also let's talk about Ben intending as\nThat was a move that ended up working out because Jackie Brown the junior heads the home run but I was very compelled to see how the red Sox were going to handle is because we're the talked last week and we brought it up on Sunday when quarter was talking about they were thinking about the possibility\nOf the d._a. ... out of it and yet the bat the picture of putting maybe ... bats that second putting Bennett ten being left Jackie Bradley junior and center and JD Martinez in right now Martinez playing with the bomb angle\nThey still what would tend to start the game in life\nThey put Jackie Bradley in center and Milky bats and right and they didn't play badminton easily gotten the game later on\nBut that was a decision\nThat you were thinking maybe they do put ... second but they elected not to go that way and it's a tough decision for Alex score it really is it ended up working forum last night instill into today with the game going on so apparently to do in the top the sixteenth which by the way it's not two outs as ... still\nOn the mound for the Dodgers and you off tens or who wouldn't this be the ultimate redemption of cancer can hit a solo shot here into the writer left field bleachers even strayed away the center any any part of part just hit a home run for tens or with the the way he's been running and the way that\nHe did throw the ball away but the Ben intended decision was it difficult on and he's been just than they should know that intensity in this postseason his glove was superb up against the Houston Astros his bad has been really good\nHad the forehead thing game one of this World Series\nSo I was curious to see what was going to do it some day I jotted down and how it was a talking point going into this World Series we've got to break it down last week on how the lack of da ... where the three games in LA as it does go\nThree games in LA but gave us three or four and five how the red Sox would approach it I'm just yeah they do approach it coming up for a game for as well\nDo you not play Ben intended for all\nThree games\nOr maybe you go to bed the second maybe said Jackie rather junior down for one of these games but it's got continues to get big hits the nail CF now doing some of the world series to tie this came

and protect show right here on CBS Sports radio\n... on Twitter where ... chimes in and he says throwing why not [laughter] if you are the are rockets and the timber wolf\nUh you have let's see who else uh decided to chime in on this\nDance says rocket you jump on this deal they need butler and evolves can build around towns and ... and they offered it so it's all the timber wolves will like to jump on it so we shall see\nAnd we'll see with or maybe the rockets or several if they want something I don't know how much more you get out of four first round picks up on CBS Sports radio self reliant but by two to four twenty sevens brought you buy Geico Britain is just a quick way you could save money switch the guy go get a gecko dot com and a Fifteen minutes you'd say Fifteen Percent or more\nAnd if I Do want to forty two twenty seven is brought to buy Geico Britain used as quick way you could save money switch the guy go get a gecko dot com and Fifteen minutes you'd say Fifteen Percent or more and car insurance talking about this\nPossible trained with the timber wolves and then also they use the rockets words you'd be bought there could be on the move for for first round pick the start things off with Trey in Indiana next up is that gap on CBS Sports radio morning trait what's happening\nAs a goal and doing great going uh\nUh yeah I think that the timber wolves want\nSome sort of food in play or maybe a veteran player or I don't know four or five years in the league type of guy that can help them steal the and the playoff ... maybe ... bottom sees\nAnd the bottom of the west because I think if they trade Jimmy butter to stay\nI mean hey Jimmy butter as you say you were right about Chris Paul aging and maybe on his way out in a year or two maybe three but and Jimmy Butler still keeps you stay in the top five of the west without Chris Paul so those late Raul for those late first round pick there'll be getting\nI mean I ... caliber players that you really think they'll be able to draft with those low pay\n... maybe not for this upcoming year but down the road it could turn out to be something special I I'm not going to say it's good to be better than what happened with the nets ... and the Celtics but I remember that and that's still was made at the time and at the\nTime it wasn't this outrageous trade it now it's one of the worst trades MBA history without what turned out so here's the deal now here's the thing Jimmy Butler wants out Jimmy Butler made this public that he wants out he's a two thousand and Nineteen player option so you do not much room to negotiate\nSo if a team calls you and gives you for first round picks I think you have to take it because what proven play or\nAre you going to get for Jimmy Butler one teams do they have all the power here on the negotiating and negotiating rights in trades and obviously use that things are going to be good for many years to come up with an offer for first from picks\nUp his dad but do we do we know the players that were involved in an offer from Miami maybe they could have got some players from Miami I understand for first round picks according to what Miami can offer is a is a significant difference but I mean they they could've still got players\nBut when he goes to bed every day what does the benefit in the big picture do if you're able to\nEven get on the bones average player you may make a playoff spot but and you should make a playoff spot\nBut you're not going to win more than around you may not even when one round so what good does get an app player but maybe you can help build for the future and give for first round pick that the typical party and that's the thing I I don't agree with you it's good just getting a player do when you're selling may only be to get to the second round\nMaybe it maybe it's a way of Tom tom said without trying to save his job he figured if he gets for first round pick out the door and somebody else gets address those for first round\nYeah I don't think they're getting rid of it but I just don't appreciate the phone call the Mike in LA next stumped CBS Sports radio what's up my\n... yeah what's up man I'm to me take my mind that when you're in LA are you a Dodger fan yeah more casual casual baseball fan yeah but I found in the game right now just wander yeah okay I have it on the background you got you know what I was there and being pharmacist will theories\nYeah up to me you make that deal if you're the rockets because you\nHad the war is on the ropes and unfortunately Chris Paul\nKind of hurt and he breaks down a lot and so\nYou meet a guy like Jimmy ... who's a a a all sort of level caliber players and one of the best to eight players in the league and I think he puts them over the top I think Golden State is ripe for the picking I don't see them I think they most likely to give her final but if they if they got you mean by other I don't I think Houston would beat them because you\nKnow really not that much better than Houston yeah because I think she Jimmy Butler puts them over the top as you saw in the playoffs last year I mean they Golden State really struggled to to beat them so if you ask Jimmy ... and it's far from the timber was perspective yeah you have\nTo see how you said when the spooky cousins come back and if he's healthy you think the markets ... and ... D staff Calais is going to go down the drain mind is going to go down to that big three\nThere the favorites but I don't I don't I think I could see them are just coming up short the season ah ... whether if it's a a boss in Toronto maybe possibly even Philippe make a move and I just see a ... from the dynasty you see after a certain amount of period they just run out of gas\nAnd I could see this this year the worst team get knocked out 'cause they're not as deep as they weren't that\nThat's the main advantage they had all of a lot of teams\nOver the last couple of years they have to give up their some of the guys who to bring in ... way over the cap so that's why I see this team coming\nUp short if you're using your right there on the costs but when you travel\nYou make that you and to me Darryl more he's one of the best GM's on a league and he'll make it work and I don't see Jimmy ... leaving it comes to Houston because they've got a great culture there and Tony ... everybody for all the players rave about the system they get to play in him so what's the the downside if you're them I don't you know otherwise\nYou give us for furniture on pigs for someone you have to make sure you keep them uh but yeah I'm going to stick with my theory in Alabama with Golden State until someone takes them down I'm not going to be the idiot that picks against let's go to Mike for this year or let's go to Mike in Boston next up CBS Sports radio what's up Mike\nHow's it going yeah you're right you're mentioned something about the the nets trade and um how would I have three picks um actually I think it was three picks put one was\n... I'm a traitor pick\nYeah yeah it was a swamp so it ended up being formed pegs but yeah it does yeah\nYeah that's why now now here's an here's the thing about it you know you have Chris Paul he's age and you got James Harden blocked a you know or or or and you're betting on Jimmy Butler for one year this is one hundred percent worse than the nets trade because let me add something\nHow has this already worse than the nets straight to live to see what would come back and let me I don't think God is that is remarkable\n... who's better follow Paris or Jimmy Butler I'm Talking like\nI of sixty eight tomorrow a blend of clouds and son clear skies tomorrow night forty one year old just stare kite for news talk W.

to faith not bears Denver in Kansas City Duke it out and then they have the west match up back in Baltimore will battle the Panthers in Carolina\nAnd the coal take on the raiders in Oakland the debt kicks off\nWith the NFL today as well be ...\nOnly on CBS [noise] All right let's recap this world\nSeries game and we'll get to the implications from it and I'm very intrigued to see what Alex score and Dave Roberts will say after the game when they do get to the podium just so we could try to figure out how they're going to make this quick turn around and figure out the situation for later\nToday now as a do we have the official time on that game can we see what they I Know it was over seven hours but I didn't look at the clock when the game did end but let's see if we had the official time of that game as was over seven hours all\nOld which is the longest season game and a postseason histories is absolutely crazy but anyway let's recap it also a Peterson hits the home run to right field in the bottom of the third\nAnd you had viewer who was just a stunning the game or tires fourteen straight batters in a row they take him out in the aid\nKept the chance that comes in for what was going to be a six out saving won a game on the it was two outs in the in the top of the aid Jansen on the hill and he did and I'm allowing a home run a solo shop the Jackie Brad the junior on two out the\nWrong time on the game by the way it was seven hours at twenty minutes which by the way\nOr maybe you could if you put that on the DVR hope that did it by a few hours or if you miss that so Jackie Brown the junior he goes deep but it's still a black to right field or in the top of the aid that it goes all the way to the thirteenth the red Sox to get it wrong with that\nAnd then the bottom of the thirteenth in tenth or has a ground ball was hardly hit by ...\nIt was it was hard it bought by ... and the throw it over to first base that goes wide and that made it to two and then eventually I between there to the ... the Eighteenth ... months he almost had a home run to right field just one foul and then the bottom of the tea and\nHe does walk it off with that whole Ron too left center field to make it three to end the Dodgers get a walk up home run and now it is they choose one series lead in favor of the red Sox we'll talk about what this will mean for game for and what it will mean for the rest of the series but we do at the game winning home run\nBy um by ... months to that story just continues to grow and just more positivity as it does increase let's hear what it sounded here's the max months to a game winning walk up I'm wrong\nAll they are free to [noise]\nGot back from the same way\nHumble\nCharlie Steiner of the Dodgers radio network at first I thought it was a network call at first show a little bit more emotional on that we're talking about emotion was\nCalls this a walk home run the world series to give you some like back in the world series and\nThe Eighteenth and nonetheless a little more emotion from Charlie starter jeeze but something that won't get talked about a year\nIt should be talked about will do so right now is the monkey stories great but because it's a losing effort above the was brilliant he wants to extending say\nOnly a three hat and then obviously the wandering around which was the walk up and run but that's something that's going to be lost and all these storylines with the dollar just stop him getting picked off and then him making the place to play Machado not running\nThat's something that's going to be lost and all these storylines with the ... stuff for him getting picked off and then him making the players to play\nMachado not running which that could maybe get forgotten about these the Dodgers win the game you are just at twenty four years old being a solid\nSeven strike out seven innings just phenomenal Everytime fourteen straight batters and then you obviously have everything that happens in the thirteenth and the Jackie Brown the junior home run to the aid but the big fat exclamation point\nIs max Muncie as I'm saying it's on ESPN right now it's a fourth walk off when and Dodgers world\nSeries history the first since Nineteen eighty eight how 'bout that that it's just\nThis is the world series this is baseball this is why you gotta love at this time of the year where you would stick around and invest your time in Eighteen endings and hey if you're a dodger's fan you were smiling as much as you can be right now and if you're a Red Sox fan you're still up to one but\nYou start to wonder could this be the turning point of this series\nThat's what you start to wonder is this going to be the turning point of the series and that answer really won't be and that question really won't be answered until we see what happens in game for\nAnd we'll see what happens in game for because if you're in Boston\nAnd it's a team that has been dominant has been cooling come all year but you wonder how the press or does it affect them in this game for were let me remind you it's going to be very compelling to see\nHow they and who they elect to handle game foreign who starts to go ... they're not going to game did you do you go Rodrigues I've I Would doubt state goes sale on three days rats\nBecause he pitched a game one on Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and and they gave me on Saturday I Would doubt that David go Seattle just with this past year probably just want to save him for game ... if they're you know you know now that you know that there is going to be a game five\nBut\nWho was number one who is the red Sox go with getting number for how do they approached that\nAnd can they quickly put this in the rearview mirror\nHorrible this something that lingers and you get a series tied up at two games apiece and the Dodgers guitar that separate two games apiece is such an impressive effort especially where\nThe red Sox had him after the first two games of the series and at this series and momentum does change and it goes back to to to later on today and the series that play by kittens or is going to be looked at and remember\nNow if you're in Boston and the ... score you should just play this one a day hey it's another game we obviously want it to one it but that's why you when the first two and now it's two wind we knew they were going to get at least one\nOn there are on their home field that I like even though the red Sox have been on the feet at this point in the postseason but you've got to put that quickly behind just show up to the ballpark later today and just get ready to win\nAnd you got when this game because if you don't\nThen you're very very very much interested how the rest of the series plays out because many people thought this thing was over after it was to nothing\nAnd deep down inside I was very very skeptical of the Dodgers can make a comeback but this changes it it does it change is that right now and you're thinking of it if it was three oh you would say without a doubt the series is over Boston is not blowing the thrill lead by now with the being to warn you go into\nWhat does happen in game for and\nGame for you will look at it and you will see it the Dodgers can carry over momentum like they did in the end of the ads\nWere they were down to one\nA little bit different on the on the the the standing you know and the series but they were down to one and the I don't see as they waiting game for an actress and they take advantage of game five\nCan they put together to wins in a row like they do they I don't see it coming off an extra inning game that was Ballenger who had to walk off at this time it's backs Muncie on the walked off the lot\nCan they capitalized that and make it a way to win too in a row and we'll see what that is coming up later today but let's be on the look for that who core does go to if he announces a starter\nTonight and we'll see what ends up happening from the animals who ends up pitching for him and gave number four but that to me right now those are the two biggest takeaway from this game number one can LA carry over this momentum and to gain number four 'cause if you go down three wanted says you know good\nHer way to get to know him as a person with all these there whenever I had a question is senior living advisors at a place for mom partner

Martinez who may also be an empty pay that goes to him or ... depending on which one it goes to he was up for three\nAnd he did walk\nSo one through four for the Boston Red Sox just garbage and this ball game and that started last night and did a rap but not that long ago\nIn seven hours in twenty minutes a very quick moving seven hours of twenty minutes right so that's the big storyline right there chancellor and then also the red Sox sitters one\nThrough four going zero for twenty eight and it just shows you still how good of a team Boston ... thinking about this the red Sox one through four hitters one zero for twenty eight they still could have won the game and the thirteenth\nAnd they still could have won this game later on they didn't do\nAnd it shows you how tough it is to beat this team this year that when a hundred and ... regular season game\nShows yeah tapas ... were their hitters goes year for Twenty one through four Dodgers still find a way to get a victory so credit the Dodgers they get it done and it's a very good for the sport that they did get it done\nBut where does it go from here and once again when you look at a game for and when you have this game for you got to see how this affects and how it carries over into getting number four and you would think\nAnd not knowing who the starting pitcher is for Boston you would think that it hurts Boston 'cause there's more questions to be answer for Boston\nWe're in the cloud generation now so you're fire walls have to be engineered to fit right in reclaim your clock network trying barracuda ... generation network or application fire wall free at barracuda dot com slash fire walls the perfect diction\nIs Mayo Clinic radio tuned in Lebanon am Sunday on W.

it's great\nNow the only thing that I'm concerned about and I don't know how this really works\nSo we have direct TV here at CBS Sports radio now we're supposed to be getting a nor'easter is that correct right there are several you're plugged in with this weather report yeah man supposed to be really bad really bad\nYou can still go walk home unless well I don't walk home or what do you take a taxi ... oh you know you're over yeah ride share it\nBut that that may be expensive with the the white hats cheap especially this time okay so how much you pay for it\nYeah usually anywhere between like four and like six bucks\nWhen we may want to check out on the weather and I don't know maybe it's just because of this place is is set up because one TV right now the signal from the direct TV so maybe the weather's bad outside but the other TV is working\nSo I don't I don't get how that works yeah it depends on what channel or watching I think okay yeah the two different channels one has not every cause not everything is direct TV yeah one's Fox and another one is trying to sell you some belts right now\nThat's not to the top three has given your number to try to uh sell some workout bell so some interesting stuff\nThe guys and a lot of pain with with the workout though he [laughter] he's he's he's training\n[laughter] they're selling the belt very well so get the town's football in just a second um let me go to John in San jose next to be a sports radio what's up Johnny\nThat the bottom of search and some um my brain coach first\nOf all he has didn't need to fall into the stands but second of all what sent a runner at first when he caught the ball\nYeah she was at first they said the ball didn't go out to play though correct\nI well that's that that were never really went through the whole explanation suddenly there was a guy second then we get you know it's the ball and then there's there are guys scores like my first of all new is to not be the fall\nNo you know when you didn't oh but here's the thing\nAnd I know is momentum was taking them into the stands and it looked like yeah and he was trying he was trying to stop in South on the wall and he fell into the stands by a\nI let you on the front page of ESPN but going but Johnny either way kittens are fields that ball which he did and if he makes a clean throat which he didn't no one's talking about that\nThat that game to me it's more I Know I had another and all and they're not falling into the into the stands why\nBecause the guys still at first so there's two outs\nBut the but they didn't they didn't put the guy in second do right\nNo I just watch it four times the guys at first\nHe packed up\nWhat what what does he pack up when he caught the ball and sell them to the front row\nBut but it's an out okay but he fell in the front row\nSo what what's your point it's still alive ball\nHow is it\nFell in the front row Machado goes to second ... it's a ball it's an era and the guy scores a tie to\nGet you get one base I'm pretty sure maybe I'm wrong on that but that that that that's what I was thinking that that's right you get one base right they\nChange the rule so that now if you catch the ball in fair territory and fall into the stands or into a dead ball area\nIt's now a dead ball but the runners are awarded one base so like if you watch you know live he turned second thinking yeah and I go to third and the umpire points about the second thing no no no dead you only get this base ... so that's what it is\nJohnny's behind on the rules in terms of you know yes it's a dead ball but it doesn't mean it's it's dead and he doesn't get second gotcha he gets one base\nStill anyway tens or make the the play and no one's talking about that that's why we have this conversation in the newsroom ... now remember to fold them in the conversation newsroom uh originally someone came over and they said uh you you don't have to fall into the stands like that why do you got to fall in the sense that if you're doing is\nIt ... makes a good throw we're not talking about that\nJust in Massachusetts backs up to be a sports radio what's up just the\nBig more than guys um so I could go on for a while about this mass but even before the ... air ... supposedly gets hurt when he gets taken out by the catcher their Sandy hit the ball deep to right field I think he should've scored on if you put it's harder to it um I don't think his leg was broken he dug the third base\nAnyways were up by one next any new ideas catches the ball five feet from the stance he did not fall into this day and he jumped in trying to make his Catholic remarkable\nUm anyways after that you have kids or not set in his feet if you can't make the throat and don't make the throat keep the guy is third base he does it a mile from first base and there's two scores a you got the body language of poor after the third after the thirteenth ending\nLike he was out of it the only one that deserved to win this game was ...\nThe menu that Korea was that if the guy I get to one game that you lost at the guy really in the whole pose these you know the manager wasn't interested in the game\nI can say this I think he has made some great decisions all postseason that I'd like to have the\nThe guy's been partly and it just for a year how you get on the manager\nWith him I think he's made some great decisions I just think today judging on his post judging on his body language judging on the way our top or or to hit I think he was out of it and I don't think our players a\nShow any heart ... and what do you mean you'd think he was out of it to just explain that to me what observations you get it on your couch saying that he was out of the game just as I hear you\nKnow so I I think that he was feeding off the way at the top of the order was hitting a you know they're going over twenty or whatever it was if you look at the core it it just didn't seem it didn't seem like all the changes he made it just didn't in the\n... really into it I always had resist change that you had record in the game just want when you have an Eighteen again once he agrees this change\nUm I\nIt just made it just didn't in the ... really into\nIt I always had three just change that you have a core and the game just want when you have an Eighteen again once the agree just change\nUm I I don't know about an agreed that can\nHave an answer oh my God you think core or that\nThe or the guy is his first world series that the manager he's up to oh it's Eighteen ending his his his options are limited as\nOh he's out of the game just hate with baseball we second guessed so much right now we said get second get second guess\nDecision this\nManager he just won a hundred ... regular\nSeason

polite and we had some fun at the expense of the car from Massachusetts who was complaining about Alex Cora which I just think it's ridiculous but he did bring up a fair question which is confusing and a lot of people probably have the same questions\nAbout that so Cody Ballenger popped up to the third baseman new and yet in ... territory Munoz whether you liked it or not one into the stands and months the advanced the second\nBen go through once again why that is allowed in baseball\nBecause the rule states that have you catch the ball unfair to hurt\nGo through once again why that is allowed in\nBaseball because the rule states that if you catch the ball in fair territory and fall into the stand\nOr it gets a little trickier in the dugout but we can get to that later\nIt's an out and the players rule debt\nHowever any runner that his on based at that point is advanced one base so it's incumbent on the field or just like hypothetically playing an Oakland at the coliseum and they got a thousand feet a foul ball territory whether or not it's worth it to just let it dropped foul\nOr make the out and trade it for the runners getting one base but in that situation again if you watch the play Muncie rounded second I think initially he was trying to tie up\nHe probably didn't know the rule either but he rounded second like he was going to third and the umpire put his hands up in point in the ... second just saying hey you're only allowed one base here because of the ...\nAnd then the next at bat\nWas squeak right we got to play that goes to Ken Ken's or throws the ball away some people are saying why does and we go to second it's the ball never left the the the playing field correct\nCorrect now and then the Dodgers are doing a plug right the Dodgers were trying to find out whether or not wanting to the camera area right in which case if it hits in the camera Whelan bounced out he died awarded second gotcha\nAlright because when that first that but I thought I was talking about a week but then yes the Belgium play was was right before so we got the clarification on that we think my ... a gay or Mr Ben Horowitz who we may call them Joe ... who knows is a he clarified some of the rules\nFor us better than call means will Hernandez that is true well you would get it wrong then we'd have to review it and then we'd have to make a correction about it fair so there you go anywhere without further ado let's set the music time for bed [noise]\n\nAnother week\nOf college football we will start things off we have three games to pick as always we'll start off with a twelve pm eastern check it's the Spartans of Michigan State going up against per do let's get to this one will start things off with just the trend\nHow these teams had been flying as of late\nFor the Purdue boiler makers they started out their seasons one through just getting by the way I miss you can say let me just say that but produced started out there your own three and they won their last four games has a big upset last week at home\nAgainst Ohio State forty nine to one of the off the feed it'd be the third at Thirteen sandwiched in between those two games were Nebraska noise not ads impressive\nBut this is the produce the in the boiler makers after a slow start at one point or other foreign three\nMichigan State on the other hand they've been cold that as of late\nYes they did beat Penn State but they've also had two other losses and their last three games northwestern and then Michigan where they could not move the ball at all and they lost the football games what he wants to seven I look at this line Michigan State if they one point home favorite\nI just look at the way these two teams are playing right now for do\nBeen consistent Michigan State has been inconsistent I'll roll with the team that's been consistent gimme Purdue plus the one at Michigan State they'll take care of the sport is bad but you got this\nGame sneaky tough it seems like Vegas is begging us take Purdue here and there's reason to do so Jeff from systems work to perfection as of late and you saw that last week against Ohio State was supporting often hasn't really been anything to write home about [noise] but sometimes you have to go with your gut and your instinct when making these best\nAnd I think the Vegas has the line right I think Purdue may be feeling themselves a little bit\nAfter they're upset when last weekend and I think being at home in that environment help them a lot in that game against the buckeyes heading into Michigan State now\nIt's by far the toughest road game that they have this season the sporting events has done a good job of controlling the clock this year and I think it helps them today it will be close game from Michigan State comes out on top I'll take the Spartans minus one\nFigure twenty seven twenty four\nAnd by the way ESPN has Michigan State is a fifty six point eight percent chance when the game's something interesting here to look at when you look at those percentages what whether they mean or how their calculator you take that for what it's worth alright herself but what you got\nI'm taking the Spartans or they haven't lost back to back games is twenty sixteen that's an nuggets that need to be ... uh it seems like\nIt seems like a ... game for Perdue are just coming off the upset and I think it's like you said the Spartans have been inconsistent but I think it's an up a week from Michigan State\nFan he likes to make a comment [laughter] no I'm just like oh James really dug the nuggets their expertise [laughter] All right let's get to write so what's your picture stuff was sorry you have to be all lost I think it was part okay so Ben\nAnd James on the part is getting number two seven pm eastern Texas and Mississippi State if you want to look at trends once again it's the Mississippi\nState team that last week next Fitzgerald when eight and twenty four fifty nine\nYards and for interceptions\nIs a game at Mississippi State MySpace one point favorite up against taxes saying them this\nIs another one that I look at this game and I look at the line and I go really like that but the spreading I understand what you make Michigan State the favorite because they're the home team I miss it would be states they have been ranked at times throughout the year but Texas and I must\nHave been wrong this year I get off the consumed by to get their last Alabama forty five point if you're ever was Alabama other than that they have all victories took care of Kentucky and overtime wanting to fourteen just got by South Carolina\nYou know I I like this team right now in Texas and um I think Jimmy Buffett sure is building something that the parents is going to have fun at

and that's how we love to do it here on CBS Sports radio ... on sides on all sides coming out and about thirty five minutes I'll tell you what side of the line I Am lying on when it comes to\nFive topics have conversations in sports but we do have to start with the baseball which is dominated the majority\nOf this radio program on a Saturday morning because the baseball game was something that we have never seen and that's a seven hour and twenty minute a baseball game in the world series the longest postseason game that there has been and this is one that you will remember\nFor right now\nBut will you remember it for a long time all that really is going to be determined on how the rest of the series does play out so let's read cat\nThe crazy game from last night just in case if you're a bill to only watched it a little bit of it or if you watch the entire thing or if you fell asleep and many people fell asleep with their hands on the remote or maybe their hands in the popcorn and bag\nAnd fell asleep watching this game just because your body had enough from the long day of work that you had a few hours before that it's also something to wonder about how many kids even though it was in a school and I have any kids ended up missing this\nGame regardless there's times to complain there's time to be annoyed\nWith the length of a baseball game even though friday and Saturday game three which if you pay the ticket it ended up by you basically got two games for one but it only counts as one game because when they did anything so technically that's to baseball games but\nIt only counts for one because you got to have a result and there was a result after nine there wasn't a result after ten eleven twelve thirty forty fifty sixty Seventy but that was the result after the walk off by max Muncie so what if you watched a little bit of it or if you watch the entire thing\nLet's recap it for you right now so in the third inning\nYou had Peterson hit the homerun\nShop Dodgers up one nothing Walker Beeler was fantastic as the one thirty seven innings retired last fourteen batter see face on his final pitch\nHe threw the ball Ninety eight miles per hour\nNow some people wanted to second guess they've Roberts why'd you pull him out of the game and even part of me says even though he's one of seven he just do not did and this last pitch in the seven maybe put them out there\nBut the alternative that they went to was not a bad move you went to college and sending a must win game down to oh to try to get your six out\nHe got the first to that in the top of the aid with two outs to out magic continues for the Boston Red Sox Jackie Bradley junior had say moon shot to right field ties it up at once\nYou move on in this game and in the ninth Ballenger gets picked off with one out on first it was three to pet she gets picked off got an a run down they got 'em out that in the tent Salinger gets to redemption\nAs\nBeing kittens are was on third fly ball at the center field to balance your cancer tags gunned down at the plate then you move into the thirteenth Boston gets a run on an error\nAnd then in the fourteen under the bottom of the thirteenth you get the Dodgers getting a ... a run on an error as in cancer with two outs gets about to him it was ... very quickly it was nice hard at ball kittens are stumbles a little bit can't make the throw\nIt gets past the first base when it was off\nNext thing you know Dodgers get the run across the play from that play and we get to to to\nIn between the fourteenth the seventies max Muncie\nForget what I think it was exactly but he adds one down the right field line it goes foul just midst of a home run but then\nEven though they have all the was brilliant and the game for the red Sox who's supposed to be the game for started out won't because he won six settings\nMuncie it's locked up for a run 'til I failed the home crowd goes home very happy and now all of a sudden a series that looked dead a series that did not have a lot of juice even though you had two big markets go over there in Boston was up to nothing after being able to get more and then the price

I don't think it was only when we're playing them all don't make\nYou rub it in the Yankees fans faces obviously greatest ... ever you can't knock that but\n\nEnough that about ...\nAt each other what kind of throw it out you know what to do it that way but I definitely think they need and so on the Iraq thing where they were mad at you know Boston that's all\nWell no I have no problem with the Iran Iraq thing is fun and I know there's some people that\nActually care what the product is on TV and they're going to be like all you can understand what the announcers saying because the fans are so loud I think it's very entertaining and I think it's great but I just did chuckle the other night when I heard the Yankees sucks chance I think it was in I ... wandered game too when you're playing the world series and just took care of\nThe Yankees like let's say Yankees worry about it in the Gulf ball right now right\nAfter you get up there on the broadcast and so I guess well no\nAfter the game but I don't agree with it\nI I don't I don't think we should go in a way it's just one of those things that we're all going to be dead and it's got to the African [laughter] but\nLike I said go Red Sox LA they ain't going to have enough to come back to one game the red Sox fans to celebrate in LA and it's all\nRight appreciate the phone call Rick thank you he obviously did not get my point I Try to make it two or three times but\nAlex Rodriguez is not calling the games on Fox that would be John ah that'd be John ... and Joe Buck\nIran does call them on ESPN for something that baseball with a mad and also Jess but ESPN doesn't have the rights to the world series from a television standpoint so it's after the game and you have ... the big hurt you also have a ride and\nBig Papi where a ride\nGets to hear a lot of those same chance but\nI did a here on the broadcast it was either getting one are getting to the chance of Yankees suck during the game that's what I was going on and I just like like I I get it Boston and\nThe Yankees was happening during the Yankees game up against the red Sox I Would get it but there I just didn't really understand it but I've also been to a patriot games are randomly the Yankees suck chant will break out as well\nSo just something that crossed my mind and I get its funding the rivalry and everything and it's not like I might write about it and yelling\nAt the super ridiculous\nNo just if I'm In the world\nSeries and I already beat the New York Yankees not thinking about the New York Yankees anymore maybe when you when the world series ya you rub it in their faces and have some fun at the parade but so I got one more game but I Do tend\nTo lean more towards the color not that it's impossible for the Dodgers to come back there only down one game and there's so many uncertainties we'll have the red Sox are going to approach game number for some time possible for the Dodgers the when the\nSeries by just in a series like this and I know the\nDodgers got their last year and they're returning and we'll see how that this\nPlay out what was the way Boston is played this year they don't go on many losing streak when you went on during the regular season games you're the best team\nFor a reason and the red Sox are the are displayed more consistency compared to the Dodgers now that doesn't mean they're going to win the series how many time in sports have we seen a team with day Thirteen and three record or a great record or a team that can be like a hundred and six hundred seven wins and they don't\nThey don't win the whole thing that happens it definitely happens and this Red Sox season is ultimately going to be determined on if they win the world series or not\n'cause if you want a hundred and ... regular season games sure that's great but when you're in a market like Boston or when you're in a market like New York\nWhen you were not amount of games you're expected to win the world series that if you don't win the world series\nIt's a season that you looked at it and you say wow\nI'm not going to remember the hundred and eight regular season when I'm going to remember the games that we lost in the postseason wherever you get maybe into a smaller market\nWhere you don't have that much success\nAnd you're not used to this much success in Boston\nSince two thousand and four\nThey've won three titles\nSo when you have a team that's been a successful\nAnd yet this many regular season wins yeah\nWhen you get into the postseason if he were lost the Yankees\nAre cc look back at what the bad taste in your mouth even though I had a great regular season\nIf they would have not\nDone what they did up against the Astros yet to see if you look back and he said he\nOne that should have been a whole lot better\nAnd now when she goes to all your bedroom\nOne that should have been a whole lot better\nAnd now once you go to oh you better when the world series\nI still lean towards Boston 'cause I think\nTo the better team I think from top to bottom throughout the entire rotation of the better starting pitching I think that the better line up\nBullpen yeah I Do like the Dodgers bullpen\nA little bit more but look out of all these been used as a bull pen in this postseason\nAnd I know it gets lost but\nI was a heck of a a goody goody performance out of him\nBut if you're a Boston fan\nYou shouldn't be confident right now\nYou should still feel\nYou lost this when you're up to one but that momentum pink quickly shift and you could quickly add that\nNo problem no one in five\nThat could turn very quickly\nAnd the way that turns it should not turn after game three have you ever read suck bad and you're pressing the panic button after game number three ...\nDon't over analyze this one\nOne through four could and they\nDon't put in the manager like someone else they want to put a hat\nAnd kids are going to feel the ball and even with one\nThrough four going there for twenty eight you still had a chance to win the game you still have chances to win the game and that just shows you how tough it out\nYour team is this year\nSo you shouldn't be freaking out after game number three but where you may start to freak out is getting number four is if you lose getting them before then it goes to two two\nAnd yes you still would have the possibility of two games in Boston but of course a skirt on getting number five which isn't it\nAnd it's a big if but if he's car so then you go down three two and then the story of the ... the road warriors or the red socks that narrative quickly changes react when both six and seven at home so once\nAgain to be crystal clear on this matter\nDon't panic after game three you got to quickly put this behind yourself and you need to bounce back and that's the great part of these games being back to back to that you don't have time to sit there and feel sorry for yourself and sit there and cry\nOr tens or through the ball

settling down period like a time out a timeout Tesla time since I went to visit them yeah right I Will you know I was loading little call it a T\nT well the a Tesla model three it was\nBut if you wanted wanted was long awaited but you couldn't really get one right away and then they started making deliveries on and will now they are ramping up delivers the deliveries and actually the biggest thing I hear from people\nWhenever I hear a Tesla mentioned even if I'm not in the conversation I listen to him talk and say well they're just going to go bankrupt one day they keep losing all this money and lose and all this money\nAnd I don't know what the\nWhole deal behind the story is all I Know is that the guy that owns that company has a ton of money and I see a lot of business owners when they build a business it costs the money to get the business going and then once they get going they're ready to make a profit because they've put all that money in the building and even if they lose money to get started a lot of them do it\nWell Tesla as of the quarter three of this year a turn a profit of three hundred and twelve million dollars\nThey ramped up production on the model three and they're making you twenty percent profit per model three sold right now and they even had such a demand on it they're delivering enough that they raise the price of the car a thousand bucks so\nI'm pretty cool and there uh it says they have a a stockpile of three billion dollars in cash in the company that's pretty good right now\nBut in the dates then times that we live in now with everybody wanting to sue everybody over the dangers and things that can happen in including insurance companies and things when there was of a failure at a tire\nUh there's like no we're going to follow the rules and and do it I'm the same thing is going on with a lot of a mission stuff a lot of shops back in the eighties would take it catalytic converter off a car and just put dual exhaust on and then when they crack down on that a little bit\nMore people stop doing that will now it's come to the point where if somebody comes in and\nHas a small emissions control devices on a car and they say well it's not working all just just get around it or try to defeat it they won't do that anymore or used to be you know you could do in the nineties people all the time said well I just want you to unplug my passenger airbag 'cause I don't want to you don't hurt somebody that's in the front seat\nWith no that's not going to happen now it hit us and the thing that's the thing that makes it even more curious\nAbout this pat and I I'm with you a little bit when we when they first started talking to us about we'd have company tires no we can't fix it like oh come on we gotta be able to fix that and you got to know your tire because well I was just what I was gonna say though is the the the patching\nTechnology has actually gotten better oh yeah you know now they had her to the plug you pull through with the tribe backside\nAnd I know one of my friends in Sioux Falls claimed he invented that but he never did quite get on the royalties for that one of the guys over at our teammates or to falls but uh they uh are definitely a there's better patches out there that you can get now and there was a long time I think where it didn't help the situation when the plugs first came out\nPeople are using those plugs is more of a permanent solution the actual plug itself\nAnd while they will last a long long time you know that they were never intended to be the final two or three and a whole no don't do that yeah those are all bad decisions that led to people having to be more cautious but\nYou got to be careful and you got to know your entire if you look at that\nDiagram on the Internet and see what's going on that will that that's where we're here to educate you to the ... you know our listeners to help them because if somebody says ... not ... but you know because you looked it up that it is\nGo to another shop and then explain to that show hey uh this here I understand we can't patch on the edge but that's not on the edge what do you think and you know the shop the it's up to them and the final decision but still\nIf you know you're one step\nFurther to preventing a bat\nThan helping out there ... this is really really helpful because of all I Love being a professional is Yuri I had no idea that certain areas are no fictional surgeries or fiction so that's really made me of or a understand the situation better ... appreciated\nYou bet and they are that are just on lucky Sunday is the they may puncture something right through a belt\nI had an elderly gentleman come in this week and I felt bad my first thought was this guy's getting scanned because he said the the shop I just came from told me I had three tires that we're not ... but my tires were only six months old and\nHe says I Can't really believe that but if they need to be replaced whatever so he was coming in for new tires\nAnd we looked at the ... will check and find out in our guy looked as nice as well that was not repair all had a screw right in the side right right through it and the other two were within a quarter inch of the far outside edge how does somebody pick up\nThe guy said he drives through a lot of construction areas with houses and stuff that are being built so well that can happen but none of the tires had a puncture in the actual flat part of the trend that we're all ... of the tire that's about as unlucky is you can and they were new tires to they were

I mean he's the guy that come in and injected a a mock swagger on this team that is a you know they really are attached\nPrevent gardener Mitch you I mean he's the guy that's come in and injected a

kind of came linked to the party but he's had such great success what his enabled him to have that success this year with the cougars\nI truly believe there are two things that go into a one which you you mentioned right it is Michael each day intake ... they're passing it and that's because of the air raid the style of off and it's I think this off and it's obviously lens to you know success at the quarterback position um but there's also a great group of guys around and that so he's able to\nLiving advisors at a place for mom partner with thousands of families every month listening and

today but\nWith the defending Super Bowl champs in the same town they are the hottest seem right now in Philadelphia with three straight wins coming off a win over and beaten or previously and beat in Cincinnati they still have us up and you see it but I asked their head coach Jeff calling out to get that first one\nYeah it was awesome I just thought that the guys kept competing kept battling against a really good sense an addict green and just wait until the last ... overtime and I got to win and overtime great character when great culture when\nUntil last week there were eight on beating teams the nation's three of them were in the American athletic conference this conference get enough printed up there\nYeah it's a good confidence from top to bottom every ... you got to bring great game or even the last you know four or five years that I was in the SEC a tube and respected this conference and then now that I'm In it or you just realize how great the athletes on the news conference and how could the coaching is across the board\nYour in your second years head coach with the ... and it has mirrored in many ways you're first season but that first year could be tough because of the transition after three straight wins now you you feel it's coming together and uh certainly uh first placed showdown coming up with you see a\nYeah I think the guise of bought into the culture and our ... were very young team we had a lot of engineering and this year things or clicking pretty good and uh you know we did have some key injuries the last two games but\nThe guy's battled through it and then you know I think we'll get most of our roster back healthy a perfect match up with your state great UCF team\nI mentioned this is your second season but you do have some knowledge about this program coming in knowing the previous coach Matt rule there was there for a while how much that ease that transition for you and how much this factor into taking this job\nYeah it was huge and I knew a lot of the guys are on this previous coaching staff and it follows the triple program from afar um you know being an FCC coordinator for seven years you uh you know get approached by opportunities to be a coach is a different places\nThis one was the perfect fit for me and my family and I was so glad I made the decision to come here other culture the young men of the city of Philadelphia or has been a great experience\nAnd tumble head coach Jeff college who joined us an eye on college football off to a terrific started and you come from a defensive back run obviously but this defense has been terrific one of the better unit in the nation what is it about this bunch that stands out currently\nOr the big thing I mean obviously we've got some elite players you know up front and you know like a second level\nIn what is it about this bunch that stands out currently\nOr the big thing I mean obviously we've got some elite players you know up front and you know that the second level on but we rotate about probably twenty eight players on defense throughout the course again\nA mean meaningful snaps very few teams in college football do that\nA match in depth reporting related or the quality you know from top to bottom monarchy roster um especially once you get into some explosive often says that play with a lot of tempo you got to be able to vote in a lot of guys and without having a drop off in talent\nOr that helps us play at a really lead level up from start to finish\nAnd speaking of rotations you know you rotate guys in at every physician weather is often some guys playing a defense or the other way around what what is it about that versatility that you'll like it especially in this type of level that can get guys to the to the next level\nYeah and we're talking about are starting tell back we'll play outside basketball third downs are starting the sense of tackled placed tight and ensure charging Golan situations are news guard\nA escort two touchdowns as a pullback uncle on situations we've got guys playing both ways are starting middle linebacker took wraps it tell back up this past Saturday at Cincinnati and I just think the thing that my job is head football coach\nIs to get these guys are ready for life after college and so a lot of 'em it's obviously going to the NFL and more versatility that they can have the more attractive they are to the NFL last or um especially with limited space is on those ... are game day\nThe more they can do the more attractive than more valuable or they are so we\nThat um it's good for the football team is good for the culture\nBut it's also great for these guys development I'd be able to play the next level\nAnd it keeps the announcers on their toes [laughter] that's always [laughter] you ... a lot of big names that have gone on to the NFL flex er Cox scanner Neal burning heartburn just name a few\nTalks at Mississippi State where you don't get those five star recruits the ladder to what your lawyer to you know when you've been in places where development is important in another way you can get five star recruits and you're now doing it at temple as well with with several players that you develop nicely what's the common theme behind getting the most out of those players\nAbsolutely but you know I've been blessed to coax them great players up at the colon down there just a character of the work ethic\nA but a dire to want to get better every single day and every single week and I said you know we're a developmental program here temple\nAnd uh you

down by six with three and a half minutes left and\nI'm thinking All right I was going to run the ball right here take some time off the clock if they don't score Penn State of going to like two and a half minutes left and then it's going to see if ... can can just do the two minute drill and set up a game winning field goal instead Iowa decides to pass and they had intercepted\nNow if ... regular producer Ryan Early was here I Would understand your outward rooting for Iowa in this game just to try and stay in the rye and early ... Mr Penn State himself where's there's a colors on his sleeve\nI knew were not only rooting Iowa down the field you are ticked off 'cause that was a poor play selection a poor pads\nThe tight end who he was throwing to didn't even realize the ball was coming is way Ah yes just absolutely a shoot yourself but if one moment for Iowa I didn't realize she was such a big guy well\nNo I just wanted to see good finishing and as soon as a a game that I think is is been you know has had a lot featured in it and I think both teams have played well and there's been a lot of you know ebbs and flows to it and I just wanted to see it come down the stretch and say you know what\nHere's where we go but uh it didn't work out that way but that's okay but in the meantime speaking on the game that's had a lot of ebbs and flows USC and Arizona State and Arizona State has had some some tremendous plays by their receivers and we saw another one today let's get more on that one right now here's Chuck case\nMaybe I don't think so much it's the final here a memorial coliseum at ASU thirty eight USC thirty five and I see a\nReally a response or the last thirty five seconds the game\nThey went five

while 'cause we have people waiting on line is a you know a few things number one is one one of the fans at USC expecting I Know the answer is but the answer comes there's a reason why they were winning all those years and\nThe reason why is because he had great talent but it came with a very steep prices and that was NC double a sanction\nUnderstood and clay held news the guy who's got to try and a scale that tricare held at the NCAA as put in front of them are self earned I'm not saying that the sanctions were unfair\nOn merit aid but yes he's he's got to deal with uh what others who

first quarter Washington in front of cow seven six six and\nA half left in the first half their and Mississippi State with a quick touchdown leading Texas saying them by a score of seven and nothing\nAnd uh as you said a little early early scoring we've had it's been a intriguing introducing day ac into some of the games I'm Bad outrageous numbers appoint scored\nAnd others have been closer to the best and I like the majority getting adjusted to Kentucky when uh they they win with Fifteen points Wendy when in college football with Fifteen points one of the wild cats just spin\nYeah doesn't doesn't happen often but uh hey can give it to Kentucky they pull it out in the last play Iowa loses in the last play and what a day for army another victory their fourth in a row they get the ball eligibility and after they're thirty three uh\nTwenty or thirty seven twenty to win over eastern Michigan earlier today I had a chance to catch up with their head coach Jeff monk and I mentioned the fact that they're both eligible for a third straight year what does it mean to the players themselves and the program\nI'm excited for the guys and they've worked hard to really work hard to build a winning culture here or are they any time you're you have a chance to go to a ball game that's the measure uh\nPlaying football this level so it's something I think everybody that that that plays a ball wants to do and our guys do too so that we're worried about that down the road obviously those those things don't happen for a while and\nWe got uh the biggest game of the year we played all all season coming up this this coming Saturday So we're gonna we're gonna enjoy this one for the ride home and get ready for the next one\nAbsolutely Airforce coming up next weekend but today Ford strayed win over in eastern Michigan deem that you'll be by just one point last year\nYou got off to the big start and then it almost fell apart in the first couple of minutes in the third quarter I'll take me through the swing of emotions that you had because not only did it almost collapsed but you came right back which I thought was more important than\nThe first half or defense that such a great job they they didn't have a up or down in the ... ... ... ... were were completely control on on that and the fact that we were getting in a red zone and happened to settle for ... you'll go very uncharacteristic\nDrawing on that and a offensively we're getting into red zone and having to settle for great victory field goal\nThat very uncharacteristic how far off that but that credit to eastern Michigan they did a really nice job of guesses what only got down there close kept them in the game and we went to bring it out twice to start the second half and a and they score to touch downs and all of a sudden it's a to point game and\nStart thinking holy smokes here we go again just like last year but uh I I was really proud of our team how they responded and\nDon't feel like we ever lost ... are\nNow ... gene or building a brand new leaves the air until seven o'clock tomorrow morning gave you within twenty five miles north of Nebraska programming continues on translator ... nine zero Eighteen and one of five point nine ...\nCouple of things stood out to me about this one uh Kelvin Hopkins your quarterback had been bang dumped the returns today he really looked very very smooth throwing the ball and and really hadn't had a great rapport with his receivers making some big place how much of that week off kind of give them a chance to reset and get healthy for today\nOh I ... he uh he's he's been over ... here for weeks and he just re aggravated it\nTwo weeks ago a against San jose state and and I don't know if the rest help we would love to have had them in the game last week I think the more he plays the better he gets he didn't really good job today we'll ask him to throw it a lot but we have a lot of confidence in him as a ... where I think he's the best\nRowing quarterback that we've ever had a sauce obviously we don't we don't do it much but I have confidence that he can make every throw that we ask your\nDefensively this team has been terrific in in part and help by long drives by the ...\nYou had another forty five minutes on the field today or in time of position a eastern Michigan held the ball for just fourteen minutes an Eighteen seconds but you kind of a great season holding teams are way onto their season average and today you held eastern Michigan just three four yards rushing why is this team been so good against the run\nI think he does a great job putting our guys in place I ever got to get stuff for our kids\nReally uh really take\nA pride in in stopping Iran it's one of the things that has a program\nWe talk about and we feel is important if we're going to be a a championship level seems to be able to run the ball effectively\nAnd stop the run so we really build our fence around doing that first and uh and and then the the nice job today and it helped us when the game for sure to force them to the just the one dimensional\nYou know you've recovered eight ... age ... opponent so far if I'm correct you haven't fumbled since the opening lost to do you know how much is that being a part of this would in culture that you've established in army\nI think current overs turnover margin as a as a really important that\nIn in a game and if if we're going to be a winning team we've got to win the turnover battle and I've been really proud of our guys on off that's we have a lot of balls that exchange hands whether it's the hand off for a pitcher a fast whatever it may be\nWe parents to hang onto it we work really hard at it black\nAnd uh as far east as you get some key turnovers and get it back we got one today James nautical make made a great play it and uh it turned into a score for so those are those are big place and\nIt's just another one of those things that we talk about like running the ball and stop the run one of the turnover battle is is one of those those factors for us your\nOffice has been terrific this year you've you've had multiple games where you've had over forty minutes a position time the offensive line has led the way how much has that been a a key cog in in this team's success\nBrent famous off that's a coordinators also outlined coach she does a great job coach and those guys he's got he's got the perfect temperament a he's a just a great\nTechnical teacher gets those guys to play with great fundamentals at that level and that's a that's a new group but besides price Holland who's our center and it has been the last couple years he's a great leader and does a great job in that room and with our chains team captain\nWe've got four new starters they're well they played some and they started here and there are the last year or so but we had we had four guys on at all so that's a line that really we're we're a I guess steady starters the last season and some of them the last two seasons that they graduated so\nTo have a new off line to get the production out of them that that we are there are those kids are doing a great job they're tough group and and uh and pressed on a really good job with them\nAnd I know I mentioned the or the time of position as that has been such a common theme throughout the season but the by product is the defense which has been terrific hasn't been hasn't had to be on the field that much as you enter the final month of the season how much will ... will help to have a a defense that is relatively fresh", "show_name":
