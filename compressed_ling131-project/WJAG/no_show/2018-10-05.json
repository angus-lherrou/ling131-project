I I guess it's a ... for each of you for Tom for students for all day five five to want to force you to be as if you want to weigh in when I Try to measure\nWhen I Try to measure like what the most\nAttention isn't a sporting event\nI think for me baseball playoffs is up there\nLike I find obviously the NFL's really exciting but I rarely feel a ton of tension it happens but it ... it seems like it's just night after night after night in the postseason NBA there's a lot of tension or the end of the game but I feel stress intention sometimes when I'm watching\nBaseball playoff games in the second or third or fourth inning and then just you might guys if there's a or am I just am I just more into baseball than other people\nKnow you're totally right I think I think the not having a clock kind of helps baseball in the sense because at any point in the game again could be out of hand true you know it to one game could become a three to game basketball football too little differences you still have you know it depends it was the third quarter fourth quarter but I think the not having a clock kind of helps baseball in that regard\nI Love the like the nod in my stomach that I Can't like the nerves I get and obviously for me that is exponentially increased ... when it's been seen before which is the cubs and I'm sure it's the same for each of you when it's your team but again and watching the game and like there's there's attention there's an energy right now\nWarning one as the big game\nThat survives series cholera winds his game and all of a sudden that momentum trained becomes really really powerful I take the Yankees I mean the Yankees are not as good a team is the red Sox but they did win a hundred games and the red Sox ace the guy that\nReally a

guys\nAnd where it is it seems like a really big problem\nBy the way the brewers just blew\nMy God this is the other guys were just who was that two and a and Mr a ... for the brewers are short star shortstop\nI think part of the reason baseball's such a a cool hold for people and attention maybe I'm wrong I think most of us played it right like I did not play high school football but I just played I played baseball most of my life and I can remember boot and balls and in big moments or or teammate doing it\nAgain we're just like that's the pressure that is just to\nSee it just totally boxes of bases loaded\nOne out\nWorks through the score two to one\nOn believe what an incredible gang excuse me ... nobody out\n... ... right now\nTony alternative third string catcher comes up with

about three more times that I worked at the time of year that sleep is for the debt\nBest selling author CBS Sports writer CBS for days you analysts among other things fantasy dominated Jonah Keri\nHere on the show Jonah you um you wrote a book about Tampa Bay memory serves when Madden was their write your book overlapped with his time there\nWhat do you use them as someone who has spent a lot of time focusing on an organization that man was the the manager for what do you make of this notion or this this pushback or this\nFan response to that mad and for some reason should not be the cubs manager of the future\nI mean everybody\nYou know has a hard case now at this point and any tactical error God Forbid and it doesn't even need to be an error and process it could be something that you know by the percentages look right but it didn't work while the hounds of our coming for you because we've all got square and we've all got you know run expectancy charts and all that stuff and you can't get away with stuff\nYou know does not make tactical mistakes of course he does does every manager and the history of baseball make tactical mistake\nYou bet they do to me the job of managers to keep your team from killing each other you hear in the carpet for hundreds of games mighty Seventy degrees in St Louis they came after a night game nobody wants to be there that's when you have to manage and that could be that you have the team not take BP or it could be that you\nKnow give them something fun or or or whatever leave 'em alone or ... whatever is going to get it done just figure out a way\nAnd that becomes very difficult to qualify to give us a parallel here I this is the fighting force you're on the road that vote for an hour manager of the year I haven't been my Colorado chapter that will be there next you're going to move to Canada but\nWe're not Colorado chapter and that's what's been five to four years in your heart into voted for management here is a manager of the year to me even on the south guy does not come down to that it comes down leadership and I cannot quantify it\nAnd even if I asked down the road it though and caught on drinks and everybody else that they thought I'd get twenty five different answers and there'd be no answer so really nobody knows anything about hiring managers\nNobody knows anything about firing manager is the only good thing that I've heard recently is that the Toronto blue jays are looking for a new manager and they said that they want something by legal because they feel very important first new and fresh idea ever every managers pilots bilingual in my mind\nBecause Latin players make up a giant part of the game that'd be nice if you can communicate with\nJonah Keri here on the show showed up so it looks like and I'm a cubs fan so I'm I'm not able to look at these things\nJust passionately I Love that and he's forever my good graces out just because I think he's great at what he does but obviously he was the guy when they won that World Series he's going to operate under his current deal not get extended through next year in a parallel David Roberts doesn't have a contract extension right now but the Dodgers have an option on him\nGay Roberts in LA the manager of the Dodgers his boss Andrew Freeman Andrew Freedman was the Boston in a close relation with mad and in Tampa Bay is there a scenario you that you see where if the cubs do not extend mad and he could become a Dodgers manager\nKilling I mean they definitely had a good relationship and you know speaking of as a book called the extra two percent of the garbage and not just that it's about ... ... and it's about the organizational culture more than anything and that organizational culture this years after Friedman and madness what's the most innovative thing that happened in baseball this year\nIt's the Tampa Bay rays this idea of up bullpen game yet we see I'm watching the Rockies\nThe most innovative thing that happened in baseball this year it's a Tampa Bay rays this idea of a bullpen game yet we see I'm watching the Rockies game as speaking the brewers went through a bunch of relievers overseeing was other teams the rate didn't even pretend they put in a closer Sergio Romano to start games kind of go warning and then they bring in like\n... there was a long grand who pitch four or five innings then they go to five other ... and they did this for about five days because all their starters except Chris I'm Sorry uh except now\nWhere are you going to hurt or got treated or whatever they had their wedding I mean that's pretty interesting and so going back to freedom in at night and they both connected not White Mountain isn't necessarily Justin analytics got there's lots of analytical inclined managers now especially now that there are guys\nWhat our age being hired but what makes it interesting is that they see eye to eye on so many other things about how to do the organizational culture how to motivate players Freeman isn't just a number crunching and he was mad and they got along really well and I think that'd be great send an frankly a lot of fun if it were to go and that's where it should be get\nJonah Keri what kind of odds are you're given the Yankees against the red Sox and the series\nI got a good shot I wrote about it at the CBS Sports today that piece I buy like check on my stuff every day CBS all month long 'cause I'm gonna be writing class was dual credit Yankees Red Sox preview as we speak so you're right on point here but this was a separate piece which was more about relief pitchers than the red Sox per se or the Yankees per se although it did it like ... cards and\nAnd what I said was teams like the Yankees in ... and these are the two clubs with the best tens of any remaining team can potentially over achieve because they're not going to go through the motions of oh my stars in the game he's getting tired and it's a sixth inning but I always think about how many times\nHow Clinton of best picture on the planet the doctor tried to ride it but that didn't work that does it occurred shot and he's not capable or whatever it's just set a fresh picture is better usually the non fresh pitcher even if the other guy Clinton gr saw\nAnd so by the Yankees employers doing this it sets up an interesting scenario where maybe the Yankees can be willing to take a Jack of leaving a Yankee fan would say the better team records have been a personnel\nBut at the red Sox were trying to squeeze us extending our court fail let's say an salesman interest that year it'd be a little rusty or whatever and the Yankees are say working with a fresh Chad renewed the third inning or wishing that Chris Hill is better than ... green of one guy's tired once I fresh\nI sure about that so I think if the Yankees are doing a series and I think they're not as good a team on paper but if they're going to win it's gonna be Aaron Boone just using the hell out of that old time being as aggressive as possible not even bothering with old dissension remember one we used to care about the wind oh let's leave a guy in except for instance there's going to cost around six five\nFour gonna leave meant that's the dumbest thing ever pointy headed nerds like even saying it's it's I don't know the happiness ration and now managers are the managing that way\nThat's exciting stuff for baseball and oppose while for it seemed like the Yankees\nAnd you hit on that in your column a CBS board dot com about the ... the Yankees and the brewers as the strength of the ... not living up to that today but if the brewers advance how do you see a magic ... against presumably I guess presumably we think is the Dodgers how seriously do you take the Dodgers this ...\nThis well first of all I'm gonna play we disagree with you and I know what you're saying we're watching his game and the brewers give it up in the ninth inning that night the ending is bold pennies to get\nThere were all those other things that happen first president would start at the game\nHe could loosely be described as a starter but really he's a reliever pushed into starting role so that's reading the released to start the game even if you want to call the starter though they had given up I Believe it was either one hit or to get for the next five innings know Raj and one hit for five days a week\nBefore a couple of the singles in the ninth traded a tie so I think that it is working and that you're going to have to ask the question again because like I really so excited about what you said that I had to contradict you right away and literally for God's going\nThat direction on the brewers great bold than just might not be able to close out in the night how seriously do you take the brewers in this series and against the Dodgers what's your assessment of them as a World Series contender\nI have a friend who asked me for a for gambling advice on baseball and of course you know and try to steer clear of myself but I said well if I were hypothetically wage ring dumping bears\nAren't even favorites the birth of the best record during the number one seed in the national league but they're not considered the favorite to independent that would be the Dodgers detours we're on opposite nine to Florida was at Penn it's nice that you could do a lot worse than that hypothetically if people or to talk about these things\nAnd not necessarily move on that but talk to their friends about it because this team has a lot going for them if you look at the bullpen it's monstrous yes Jeffers gave it up in this case but Josh haters obese and you look at ... he's been fantastic since late August\nAnd they have a monster often yell at you probably know when the NBC even though I vote for chicken um\nThey have watch shark Kane a whole bunch of hitters and by advance metrics they had the second that he's had said all of baseball too so you got a dominant defund the dominant off and it's a monster bullpen\nThe only thing that they don't have starting pitching and going back to that column in today's day and age when teens are more and more going to the bullpen do we even care if we have starting pitching if Clinton freaking Kirk shop\nThe God of God cold facts reincarnate is not ... in the postseason who is reliable the postseason and why are we even bothering try to separate relievers game and be done with it\nJonah Keri who just told us that I Believe he just said you voted were you will vote for the ground from BP would you elaborate for us in a while that was your choice\nWater on the ballot on that my ... my ballot as long as you're actually can't tell you what I voted for her management Europe I could tell you about that and\nHe doesn't really you're not you're not allowed to talk about in advance really\nNo no I don't know why you have an NFL voters that write\nThe NBA ... and you are listening to talk\nAbout it after you vote before it's really\nYeah I mean they don't love it so do you want to vote next year you should do it but it's not a rule against it\nKnow baseball's really really they don't love and the fuzzy on that I Love it they they really strongly encourage us not to uh but that's a fun one too I mean I just I just when we were talking about before how difficult it is over manager Andy ... comes down to this and it's different in basketball and baseball in the preface this by saying that if I were an MBA voter act differently but\nI Would consider team's success in basketball\nWhy do I consider team's success in basketball because if you're the brawn James you influenced everything that's happening on the court you add the ball at the end of the game you draw doubled team you can

how's welcome to the regular season for the NBA I keep asking guys there's\nAre you thrilled and it's almost a year or do you uh do you wish you had six more months\n[laughter] I mean listen to the NBA is great but you know I I like summer I like I mean do you give me the option for more vacation I'm going to take it but yeah it's great to see back\nThat's a very good answer on that judge you I I I Love the job I did get yours vacation they gave it to me ah Howard back here on the show our um when you look at\nThis breaking news today Kyrie Irving reportedly expressing to Boston ownership interest than separately he wants to be a Celtic how how seriously do you take the idea in October that a guy knows whether he's going to stick around in a place come July\nOh I think it very seriously um listen\nWhen somebody equipment case if they say you know listen uh this is a great team but I'm going to make that decision when I get to the end of the season or me and my guys have to discuss it or whatever I'm not going to answer that or\nYou know hey this is who I'm with right now when people do all that stuff when they stay ambiguous and they give those kind of like\nSemi commitments where it sounds like you know you're leaving your option that's when you worry about things that are set in October when somebody says very noncommittal or just ambiguous things about why like where I Am or we're just we're not going to talk about it right now that's when the warning flags should go up\nKyrie Irving this news today I don't think should surprise anyone now I Know carries a in a unique individual um I've got a story coming up about that very thing or in a couple of weeks here um if you ain't guy he's hard to read\nHe sometimes says things that are a little hard to unpack\nBut he has given every indication over the last couple of weeks including in conversation with me a week ago up in Boston including on media day with all of the Boston media including them in various other places\nThat he is happy there that he has all the regarding the world for Danny Ainge for Brad Stevens that he knows how good he cut it with as much talented he's got around him\nHe's given every indication short of what he said today which was the actual you know more formal commitment\nUm verbally he's given every indication before that that there was no reason to think he was going to college and everything else was more just you know the usual NBA gossip and speculation and hey he he's from New Jersey so maybe wants to play for the next the next up cap room and all that stuff I don't know why anybody would want to leave the situation and he's in in Boston\nHoward back without giving too much away maybe a sneak peak of your Kyrie Irving story that will be out of police report the next few weeks I'm just curious as a as a writer whether you were interested in and tried to get into his um Perry's comments about a flat earth versus not altogether\n[laughter] you know it's funny because this is how these things go right like I'm up there a last week Monday Tuesday Wednesday\nAnd um I got him I think it was Tuesday night we chatted for a while and so we talked about the letter thing and he he he said two things that indicated that he had some regret\nAbout that and it's okay I got some really good stuff there and then of course yesterday he's he's at the ... under thirty thing and he he he stills all thing I'm like All right Carrie just scooped me on that part and then there were some things he said about his happiness in Boston everything am I going to miss some pretty good stuff\nAnd you know today there's there's this oh yeah this is how these things go this story is broader than any of that is it's more about\nI'm just kind of ... you know unique makeup hum\nAs a person and and as a as a as a player\nAnd um we did talk about the flat or stuff and you know my you know there there is any number of ways of of of um interpreting his various statements about this over the last Eighteen months or whatever it's been you first read it out there my belief is that\nHe didn't necessarily believe that the moment he said it and then you know once you get the backlash you know depending on your personality there's a bunch of ways you can go and I think his personality is just such that he likes messing with people everybody I talked to for this story\nTells you he likes messing with people in one on one basis doesn't have to be flatter stuff doesn't have to be public he just he's a provocateur toured that's what he does and so I think he just I think it got away from him frankly and then\nYou know maybe he just didn't realize how how you know it would be interpreted or didn't know how to walk it back whatever\nI think it got away from him frankly and then you know maybe he just didn't realize how how you know it would be interpreted or didn't know how to walk it back whatever I'm Glad he gave me a full throated apology um yesterday because um\nHe's a really really smart guy and he put himself in a in an unfortunate light I think you I think he made the right decision by by finally just decided to just kind of a disavow all of that\nHow it back here on the show excellent it'd be a writer for bleach report and the man who I mean I don't know this but I'm just gonna zoom understands that the world is round here on on the show on [laughter] to be a sports radio is rather than you are you brought up the the the head gene perhaps that perspective regions due in October as we tournament is maybe what they're going to do in July\nWhat is your interpretation of the things Kevin Iran has said about his upcoming free agency in what is the level of concern you think warriors mans where executives might rightfully ads about the possibility of Katy going somewhere else next year\nYeah that one is much much tougher to ascertain just because he's not an easy guy to read either I mean we've seen this you know over and over with Kevin Duran that um he's he's got to kind of a complicated makeup\nUm he you know I saw it coming when he left Oklahoma really um and you know there's I think the most interesting thing he has said period and this isn't about free agency but I think it's an insight into to his his his ah thought process or his emotional process\nWas that when you are after winning the championship but I think it was in the story with me Jenkins were inside where he said some of the affected by you know I thought I Would have this like they're the biggest like lasting feeling of like joy or satisfaction or whatever and then ... and ... and I didn't have it like it like he realized how fleeting\nLike the the payoff is of a championship and the reason I bring it up now bill is just that I feel like\nIf he's still looking for that other things you know every player every athlete does it they're looking for some\nSort of a you know saddest level of satisfaction that I think it's kind of elusive and for some guy's a championship is it and some guys need three and somebody has some guys need six and in his case he's won a couple and he's one to envy piece finals MVPs\nAnd there's still the sense that maybe there's something else out there for him and and now he's feeling\nUnappreciated in postseason award voting and he's saying that out loud and it makes you think will you chose to join a team with three all stars and in in a in a current MVP that that's that's what happened that the whole point of the sacrifice to win the titles but it makes me think that he might want to go back the other direction okay now I have my championships and I have my rings and\nYou know I Want to go back and do the other thing again we're I'm I'm the main guy and I get all the accolades and maybe I can lead another team somewhere so with him\nThis is that more home sweet expensive home home affordability has dropped to its lowest level in ten years or report from Adam data solutions says

uh and I had the rams come out of the NFC when they weren't the favorite to start to see them they are the favorite now as they should be\nAnd the price is getting short\nDown to tend to three which is a little bit more than three to one last week they were nine to two\nSo the odds keep dropping on Ramsay I've been impressive the blowout by weather and blah when but the ice going when that they have against the Vikings last week as a upgraded that their odds or little downgraded if you're ... you're batting them\nA two three and a third to one the patriots at seven to one word ate the

now kind of like the eagles going backwards a little bit and those two teams meet\nSunday a showdown between those two teams return to the scene of crime for the Vikings or got pummeled last year in

drop from twelve down to twenty and that's my other Super Bowl team and I'll be honest I'm getting a little worried about the Steelers to\nUh supposedly like maybe I'm bells going to men don't know about that yet it's just a report until he shows up you don't know if he's got to show up but the bigger problem has been the steel and defense which has not been good\nAnd that's why they dropped the

not bad a short morass you may recognize the name to produce or the d._a. show\nA I talk about talk to all the time here at CBS Sports radio he took a flyer on tendency to make the super bowl before

say what are you nuts how can you take that as they got no shot I told him I thought it was the nerve to pick at titans world playoff team last year\nOr whether you thought their coach should or shouldn't have been fired and uh when you make the playoffs and went around I don't think that's the time to fire your coach but I guess there was some serious internal\nDisregard between the coach

Sports radio\nI was going on my friend ally but\nI so I was calling about college football uh I was wondering I was going to get your idea of what you thought about three solid egg you know maybe an Alabama fan and all\nYou know as ... you know bam out with a probably a thirty plus you know a spread especially when they're only go to a a quarter and a half two orders and they don't know what you're going to get out of or ... or so you know\nI'm just trying to look for three solid solid kicks in college football\nI kinda I kinda liked that Kansas City over onto the I'd like to go over on that\nOkay uh that's why I'm Out there you can make your own call the nose or I'll give you a bubble and I'll I'll tell you what\nI go to the SEC for you because there's a couple of games I'm looking at a ... game I'd stay away from the Alabama game 'cause right do you really want to late thirty five points to not know how long they're going to play their started they're going to be dark until you know they're going to be Arkansas we all know they're going to be Arkansas but yes what happens if Arkansas gets an old by the way touched down\nTo cut it to forty two to four team in the last game you're going to be ticked off could you lose your wages [laughter] stay away from Alabama but there are two ah SEC game so that I like\nAll burns on the road against Mississippi say is a ... game for me it last week or two weeks ago when can cocky really handle Mississippi State\n... beat them or at ... at home twenty eight to seven I said to me that told me that uh Kentucky is for real and Mississippi State was a little overrated so often goes into Mississippi State because they're on the road there the favorite\nThree and a half for someplace evidence or for others have it at three and a half\nI go runs a touchdown better than they are so I'm going to take all burn against Mississippi State even though we're on the road and I told ya Kentucky made me a believer there on the road this week uh they're undefeated\nAnd I'm sure is that going to take six points from Texas saying them\nThe egg is a good\nAre they unbeatable I don't know about that\nI get a bit Kentucky is always an also ran in the FCC and have been for years\nBut they haven't been so far this year and they did handle a Mississippi State pretty damn easily a couple of weeks ago so we're using that as a game I'm going to go with getting ... plus points\nAt Texas A M I'll go against all burn a script me against Mississippi State with Auburn even though they're on the road a three and a half or I Hope it stays at three and a half games do and on the\nThe four number quite often but even if it goes to or I think I'd go take a ... as long as didn't get up to to fix that might be enough for me to reverse building come the other way but uh there's two SEC games I'll give you another couch game that I liked and three pro games when we come back as well Kyle Nick\nBut I Want to know what are your thoughts on the growers and I would say probably the Dodgers right now and the national day\nTwo favorites I expect them to play next week in the NFC yes\nAnd one or two in a way to make the world series that if you're asking me right now who am I going to take out take the brewers\nI think it was good in a place for the championship but uh the Web or comes out of the American league be at the ... of the Yankees Red Sox will ever already proven their mental by beaten to dynamite teams and be ready in prep for the world series so that's why I'm leaning toward America like date\nI feel like the the brewers themselves are very not talked about enough I think they were all surprised a lot of people I think they will win the world series\nPhone call that an animal and the guys who are going to give him outstanding starting pitching performances are\nOr you got the scene and then all like a rookie friday for all the stuff\nYeah I I'm not a thank God I'm going to take the Astros and the Yankees and or the red Sox to be able to beat friday Peralta ... here I don't want to take away from the guy yet a surprisingly dominant season\nHe's still a sheet\nLet's not get crazy here a Milwaukee wind is going to be on the power of their batch we all know that Christian ... out a phenomenal year and it was as good an acquisition as the red Sox reaching out and get J. D. Martinez\nHe means is much Milwaukee is Martinez means to Boston or so the two MVPs and I think ... probably going to win it but\nI think more a J. D. Martinez shot could both be guys in their first year on new teams\nWhich means you got to think about those two are executives were executive of the year or you go out and you find a way to get it MVP beat either by paying J. D. Martinez or picking the pocket of the Florida Marlins\nA yes or Stearns in Nebraska could absolutely when executive of the year in their respective uh leagues and I may face off the world trade wouldn't be shocked of the red Sox ... World Series a but sorry I'm I'm not picking a blue eyes now maybe the boys rip off seven in a row\nMaybe they sweep out the Rockies they've already got one in W. column\nThey just pound the Dodgers and they look like they're a team on a mission and somebody wins the American league but suffers of big injury yeah our reserve the right to change my mind right before the series starts but as we sit here tonight\nWhoever comes out of the American league is going to be the favorite for the world series and that steam I'm going to lean toward NASCAR NASCAR George checking in from Caroline is on CBS Sports radio\nVery low there Mike how you doing join you stop\nThem if I ain't got dumped ... but one time this year I got shipped back this July got blood clots\nOoh you and I thought you want to know port painted on a Sunday afternoon the only time I ever thought okay no\nMatter what I Do to catch the last year was the price of NASCAR and you said aren't aren't doing or what made you got into an argument\nThat used to buy the replay of the crowd you reply Marco and they are so four years ago look it up over the last year and the parents get bored they want the southern part I'm honored about that one that break out on my bed one by gosh good I didn't let one went to go back that got burned out\nThey met a lot more to go with one of the rubble here and I wonder if they want to come over and they weren't going to pay because they already had printed up on the up and putting up their products and\nSo I stayed out back fired the gun I bet crash at the end of the race or the cap on how they're going to have more of the way they look at their seven board or the parents bought up for it\nAll right and the mayor for hours about how well they said to myself so that part of the company or whatever I write\nYou're going to have a stroke\nYou'd just called me and told me they had a heart issues or blood clots I don't want to be getting another one\nAlready\nI'm Sorry I was really afraid I\nThought he might kill himself on that call he was ripping through those NASCAR stats and wind and poured one on one of the ... oh my God he taught fast it in ... and I didn't know that would you mentally possible and if you didn't stop him he probably would have went for like another\nThree or four men and reform where they have a whole hell why he\nWould've we could have gotten to the end of the show but I didn't want to do that to the caller's cause yeah there are a percentage of the callers that age I didn't understand what he was saying may be one of them are and yeah just aren't into the NASCAR the way that he is\nBut that was very legitimate on my part I feared for his health I thought he was going to work himself into a frenzy and potentially clock another artery\nAnd that's the last thing I Want to do is fill in Port Scotty and have a debt by my aunt so do do we have George deep drink water or whatever else you got handy and if it's got a potency do it so be it um but take a deep drink of whatever you got to Andy in a big breath too\nAnd then get back to me over the weekend and tell me who's gonna win this weekend's NASCAR race or Mike\nFrom Pennsylvania is up on CBS Sports radio I might\nI'm fine but I'm a little worried about George to I Hope we are that the federal later and\nHandy yeah clean up but somebody's up late with them or keeping an eye on them\nYeah that's exactly how I felt in July ... Leonard was traded from the spurs but yeah you just have to take a deep breath tell you what I call it on the Tampa Bay rays fan so I was in ... and ... and when they went to the short term starter trend with mixed results for a while and uh\nNow it's come back again and the post season with I guess the brewers and da da and my grandfather always have to say there was never anything new in baseball I don't know if I always agreed with him but I'd like some historical perspective from utility is this thing was short term starter\nIs this something that's being recycled from earlier times in baseball and you have any thoughts on not\nWell loved let me answer your question first and I'll give you a thoughts over on it I I've been following for sneaking up on fifty years and certainly I may baseball historian and prior to that I got a pretty good grasp on the way that the game has been played\nOh there's this new ah ... this has not been tried before to the extent that other teams have\nWhen teams have done that you'll get teams almost every team at some point during the year uh ... gets forced into having a quote unquote bullpen game but it's because they get um rain out and then they get games puts together and get a double ladder and\nGetting a roster crunch and they say listen we just don't want to throw a starter on short rest so going to go with the guy in the pan that we can go the longest\nThree four really we'd be ecstatic of we got five innings out of them and then we'll come in with the rest of our book than there after and it was forever called the bullpen game\nThe raised it on purpose they didn't do so and we're forced to do so or situation and circumstances\nDictated they move away from the norm which is using five guys start with four days in between uh they did it by design and they thought it would work for them and as you correctly said it's mixed results\nI think the rays of probably tell you more good than bad certainly their season was more good\nThan bad much more good than bad I didn't do good at a prayer to be a five hundred team and they were well above where I bought it so I give Kevin Cash yeah and a lot of the players down there a lot of credit and smell had an unbelievable year he would actually get my vote for ...\nOr others are talking about uh either sale and overland are because ... says many innings he did smell had some Andrea shoes and ally so his innings numbers came up a little short but everything else was phenomenal and I think he was a big reason why the raise that as good a season to stay dead\nBut this is this has never been done to the level of Hollywood's been done now and yes the fact that it is still continuing here in the postseason worries me\nI don't believe I don't believe it I don't buy it I don't think that it's the best way to do it and if you're going to do it and you're going to do it right\nYou need to commit to it you need to get all your pictures in the minor leagues and oh by the way in the minor leagues\nThey they really keep an eye on ... counts of number ... and the like it they shut down guys in the middle of the seasons\nAnd just because they're fearful of injury not necessarily because they're trying to set 'em up for a major league career as a guy who's going to be a contributor in openers on a day in day out basis\nI don't like it I don't agree with it I don't think it makes sense\nOf going to not completely disregard the rays had some success with it but I think over time uh it it lessens the effectiveness of your overall pitching staff because you're going to you to be using that many guys that much more often\nUh it'll be interesting to see if it's all about pitch counts and innings pitched and their disregarding numbers of appearances I get it that they here's another reason why I don't like it it used to be fun to watch a baseball game and second guessing manager\nBe the one that got away calling now for a free consultation eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five or resorts release dot com very\nSatisfied with the results for half reserve released achieved\nThank you very very nice they catch we release resort release eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five or resource release dot com call now [noise]\nCBS Sports radio we saw in northeast Nebraska ... am Seventy eighty one oh five ...

media also on our Facebook page after hours when Amy Lawrence and our phone number is eight five five to one to four to seven and St ... to one to four to seven for those of you who have been listening this week or following me on social media you know that I was asking you\nQuestions would you posed to an NFL referee if you could I done my own research but I wanted to hear from you to kind of take the pulse of football fans out there because the Thursday was my first opportunity\nTo spend time with an NFL referee never happened before in my career and it was awesome\nGenes territory was the head referee in the super bowl in February and then he retired after nearly two decades at the highest level on his sport he's now part of the CBS family as a rules analyst and specialist and experts\nAnd we were really excited to have a few minutes with him and he was so generous with his time I cannot wait for you to hear this conversation when genes territory we're breaking up and a two part this is part number one\nGene and so good to talk to you on the first thing I have\nAbout is really what's been a topic around the NFL for the first month without fail refusing to pass or rules and protecting quarterbacks and the new emphasis that the league has put on this particular area of the game I understand the league is trying to make it more\nSafe it's trying to preserve the life of its quarterbacks who of course our faces a franchise is the most marketable commodities but for you as a referee and for the guys are out there trying to implement this emphasis how\nDifficult is it for a raft to make that type of a call to throw that flag when it's all about the judgment\nYou know the the rough posture and the and and and you're so right with with how many different rules have been implemented over the recent history you know the target area for a defender is\nIs very minimal if you really think about it because anything happened to Europe below or toward that had her neck area a limit the scope when the area that they can contact the pastor\nI Will say from officiating standpoint if I'm a lover of football but I think every rule that they've implemented has been a wonderful role because there is a lot of safety or that kind of a quarterback or a pastor\nShould have some special protection because he really is the only player on the field for for the most part it's standing still and getting hit by someone that's moving so fast that him um so so I you know I'm all for all of the safety or\nYou know the the new EP limitations and new rules that they've they've put in over the years for the quarter back this one\nAh what it appears is happening and what what felt like happened here and and the first few weeks is that they've kind of put a direct you about\nThat is saying you know that the majority of body weight a ... and some black and white issues on what\nI always felt like as a referee in the NFL I wanted to have a little bit of\nA play and and allow myself to use my officiating experience or officiating argument to apply some judgment as to whether I felt like\nYou know the majority of body weight started quarterback but is it just a good football play and its physics because this guy just got their clean and and ruptured quarter back up and these guys are so big so fast and expanding person naturally their bodies are going to fall right on top of each other very quickly\nUh with that said I always felt like if I thought he gave him a little more has been dry said you know giving him the business as he was taking him down\nOr or a little something actually just to punish show necessarily\nUh then then I Believe that I Would I Would call that ... you know and allow myself to make that judgment although it happens in a fraction of a second I'm you know when you're screwed up there you you feel the difference I think and I I Would hope that that scope opens the little when a lousy officials to apply some about\nSomething else that was new this year is the emphasis on not leading with your helmet so it's being called the helmet rule it's brand new and they're all sense of player defensive player you cannot lead and you certainly can't target and now we've seen a couple of guys getting tossed out\nOn their first personal fouls the game that we haven't seen that rule applied as

back in the NFL history\nBrains as far\nAs the NFL\nThat's just one record that is ... is not not only\nDrew Brees is he possesses it\nBut there could be more coming up over the course of this season is is a guy who got a couple of different records in his sight and the next one is most passing yards in NFL history\nA first on Westwood One with Kevin Harlan then on the St radio network he was a just a couple of weekends ago that drew was responsible for six\nTouchdowns for through the air to on the ground there was a spin move that his kids could not wait to recreate when he got home\nI saw an interview with him maybe you guys did too and which team\nGot home from the game he said he got home from the game and his sons already had it all set up in the backyard and all they wanted to do is recreate the spin move on which he had scored down low or near the goal line and they were all excited about doing that it's been moved over and over and over again\nSo it thirty nine years old man can still fire off a spin move over to a and he's so much fun to watch that quick release the accuracy\nOf the ... he he has an incredible report with Michael Thomas what he's a lot like a Tom Brady or a Peyton Manning or a Brett Farr a name any of the greats\nThey put the ball where you can get it\nWhich means they turn you into a better receiver then you were even if you weren't great these guys raise the level of play but everyone around them because of how they can deliver the ball\nAnd the way that they see the field I mean think about the the brainy touchdown pass to Josh Gordon which turned out to be five hundred\nYes he needs to credit dolphins have lied I Will critic the office of blind he had so much time back there in the pocket there wasn't even a guy who was rushing him and in the the off into blind gives him time to stand up and look and wait\nFor the play to develop down field of course that puts a lot of pressure on the defensive backs\nBecause they're trying to keep up with a receiver slide Josh court and or course Hogan who actually was in the back of the end zone or behind Gordon\nAnd it allows time or any time to wind up and Chuck that ball down the field but the idea is that\nYes you got receivers\nWho are making place but you've also got these quarterbacks who can deliver it in such a way that it makes these receivers look good\nAnd they do they do [laughter] that's a that's the beauty of having a quarterback of this caliber it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio\nTwo hundred one yards that's what Drew Brees needs to set the NFL's all time passing record there actually still two guys ahead of him well Brent Barbee and Peyton Manning but with two hundred and one yard he could pass them both both and become king in terms of that particular record\nBut I mean I think we're also known a figure just the girl Jody\nI'm very very says a lot about the teams are on record of where we're from the players and everybody has a hoping to\nKind of like what breed he said after passing five hundred touched him a lot of different guys have been on the receiving a lot of different guys who have made that possible\nAlright

finds me on Twitter and says Baker mania had the gun oh yeah it has in fact I'd say that a thousand extra gear even a following the overtime affair with the Oakland Raiders runs as I Know they fell short this past weekend if they clean up some of the mistakes they can open some eyes this weekend around the league\nIn a word that huge accent I'm tired of preparing to when I'm tired of ah getting close and not coming away with a W I Know they finally got that monkey off their backs\nWhen they were able to pick up their first when of course that was the the entrance of Baker mania or the the entrance of Baker Mayfield and the birth of Baker mania on a Thursday night against the New York jets\nAre now it's full height mode but yes\nOne guy\nCan certainly set a city on fire\nAnd he's all ready to face the franchise and people are thrilled about it but if the winds don't follow\nYou could only go so far\nI Will say this about the browns they'd been competitive in every game\nSeason opener against the Steelers they were down fourteen points in the fourth quarter\nThey came back to force overtime now I get it\nThey didn't win it everybody was fun fun fun fun\nOr any overtime but still\nThey forced the O T\nSaints week number two in New Orleans superdome there were most of the game\nWith the adventures and kicking\nThat really doomed to them and now of course they may change a kicker\nThen weeks three is the game against the jets\nAnd then we for going into overtime again\nAnd so they're close I Know coach Jackson's tired of being close but\nThey've got to be able to string a couple of wins together\nSo what's the game that you're most looking forward to John says on Twitter the most important and intriguing game is one and three Atlanta\nVersus one two and one

forward to that we've got to pull up what's the game that you're most looking forward to in the NFL this weekend you could always send us your own admission or you can find us on Facebook so Ala radio or you know where I think the pages named after the show we're inside the Quicken Loans studios\nNational mortgage lender Quicken Loans supply simply understand fully mortgage competently\nI see some of your tweets already about the first half of my conversation with a long time NFL referee genes territory and I'm Glad\nThat you are in the light and to add a little more informed about what happens on the field when these guys are in the heat of the moment is attempting to make decisions at light speed is what it seems like and Jean was so accommodating gave me nearly a half an hour on Thursday to answer to all of my questions\nAnswered some of your questions but want to jump into the second half here and I promise you you're going to be blown away\nIf you listen to nothing else on my show listening to these next few minutes when genes territory\nGene thank you so much for your time your stories your incite I've already learned so much if you wouldn't mind\nWould you tell us what goes into\nInside I've already learned so much you wouldn't mind\nWatch what goes into\nThe weekend the NFL is they show the preparation the grain process I Know a lot of people ask me about that and I don't really have a whole lot of insight cell [laughter]\nIf you don't lie what is the typical workweek like for an NFL referee and an NFL official\nProbably one of the best kept secrets in the legs to be honest with you and then as a referee I can tell you I did document that personally I did a few\nUh a few news articles and things of that nature throughout the course of the season when the NFL would permit it to allow that window or the curtain to be pulled back a little but\nIt is between twenty five and thirty hours a week of preparation you know again when on Sunday you would get your hard drive and that locker room of the game as it played the television you know depending on how long your flight was back home that night that you got out usually on a one o'clock and you're on your way home by eight o'clock that evening\nYou sit in the plane and you put that are driving and you watch I always watch my game coming home that night because I wanted to see the most important part initially\nWas how did this entire three hour a fair play to television did did we moved the game along efficiently to the game play well to the TV and the viewing audience that's the first thought is that so I Would get home that would be finished more than a light would always be finished before I went to bed Sunday evening so then you would wake up one day\nA kind of revisit most of everything get all of your paperwork and reports filed on on a computer program that the that the league provides a penalty reports game comes all of these things that a referee do on Monday [noise] get all the paperwork signed a last Tuesday morning\nAt five thirty every Tuesday Morning UPS or FedEx dropped off a hard drive on my front porch that had all Seventeen games that were played the Sunday that day before Monday Night on a hard drive and there would be three angles of those games on that hard drive sidelined view end zone view and then the television do\nUh and then we would start breaking that game down and Tuesday you would get what would be called a preliminary grade from your game\nAnd people fail to understand this is well every there are seven officials on the field in the NFL\nEvery official is graded on every single play of every game whether there was a file or not there are thousands of decisions being made in a in a football game by every official throughout that entire game\nHe is graded on or she is graded on every single play and not all curse Tuesday a greater from New York who was assigned to your game\nHad done that send a preliminary report out which list every play and what their thoughts were on each play and then there would be what we would call potential downgrades that would occur throughout that series up between a hundred in a hundred and sixty five hundred and fifty a hundred and sixty five play\nRap pass on the bad and all my goodness so he gets in the car leave early the police from Pittsburgh meat but children on interstate Seventy nine year old I'm over they thought they were getting an escort to the game no dyes give us a rough patch get back in late it's still going to take you four hours to get to the game [laughter]\nUnbelievable Monday Night game it's eleven fifty eight PM and end with the game is almost over there's ten seconds left one official thinks that he has a follow that it's a ten second run off which is going to end the game\nI announce that the game was ended on at ten second run off we we collaborated again that was an attempt second run off play we had to put time back on the clock they've taken the now we're walking to do it's over time it's hard first time I've ever announce overtime rules in my life\nI'm a panic in a little walking from twenty to admit\nField 'cause I Know they're going to film the coin toss in overtime my older brothers over my shoulder you know what they're going to say I'm trying to push them away leave me alone I'm trying to script us I go to flip the coin the coin doesn't slip end over end it goes out of my time I left on it the coin is in the air like a pizza shell\nStraight in the air it lands in roles ... war cotton ferrier on Pittsburgh side Ray Lewis I think Doug on the Baltimore Sun the coin hits the ground and roles twice Baltimore\nWhen the law you can't catch the coroner's it just is what it is the filler players one box because Tom and I punched out for TV I see them talk and coach Tomlin beckoning to me to the sideline I run over egos gene\nYour day and I said coach he goes Jean the coin that as a coach the coin world when it hit the ground so it it it's a legitimate tossed he's suggesting the game ended the game and the coin flip and he goes you know gene that make matters worse\nYou left your hat on the bed this morning and I can draw\nHe likes the coach you said Jane when you're a head coach in the NFL they tell you so many\nYou left your hat on the bed there's more and I will do\nIt I think coach Jane when your head coach in the NFL they tell you so many things you don't even want to do what you know do what he said that to me that was something that we ... you know God every ... every time we went out this week but that was a memory that I'll never forget\nAnd now I Will never forget it gene [laughter]\nThat's so great you are so generous to spend so much time with us and to answer so many of my question\nAs well as those of my listeners this has been such a treat for me a long time NFL referee and Big Ten hoops official genes territory you can see hat and on the CBS family of networks now he's part of our cast and crew gene thank you so much I look forward to the next time\nOh thank you any time I really enjoyed it I Hope we do it again\nOh we're going to do it again\nMaybe thirty minutes next time because [laughter]\nThat might have been one of the longest interviews I've ever done now but tell me it was it worth it\nOh my gosh I still I've I've now heard him in multiple times talking about a typical work week in the NFL or as we've we've\nGone through and listen to the interview and made sure it was right for you guys to hear in a while blown away by that every time the grading process their grade on every single moment of every single game even if there is no\nFlag I mean it's a lot more intensive than you think and Ninety seven percent success rate so I Know we get mad about the three percent but come on Ninety seven percent that's an a plus\nI'd be like the interview it will be part of our pod cast after hours Amy Lawrence dot com eventually will throw it up on

being over and\nI'm not exaggerating I Do exaggerate sometimes I'm not right now\nIt is literally one of the top five interviews of my entire career I learned so much from gene he was gracious enough to answer all of my questions everything from the roughing the pastor emphasis to the targeting rule and throwing guys out of the games to instant replay the story about why he became referee referee in the first place is amazing\nUh and I did pose to him some of your questions like\nThe index card and how did that happen [laughter] also got a really good story about a game between the Steelers and the ravens but honestly thought to tell you the truth my favorite part of the conversation was hearing him describe the average work week for the NFL official\nA lot more goes into it then you think and the greeting process for these referees\nIs strenuous so if you miss it we're going to bring back part of it a little bit later this hour\nBut you can always find the full show pod cast and mine is going to\nOh I mean we love you advertisers after hours Amy Lawrence dot com or at our phone number is eight five five to one to forward to to seven eight five five to one to four to two

Drew Brees coming up this weekend only needs two hundred and one yards\nTo be the NFL's all time leader in that category\nAnd every time these guys step on the field now you've got different office of records\nThat are in jeopardy that could potentially fall\nIt's awesome to watch them play to be sure\nBut as much as it's about these guarding numbers it's also about the fact that they survived\nNFL career\nIs not even for years\nAbout three and a half years somewhere between three and three and a half years\nAnd the reason Tom Brady and throwing touchdown passes just so many guys\nBecause he's the constant everything else around them it's changed so often\nAnd I love that I Love it when you hear drew talk about records when you hear Tom Brady talked about records\nWhat they talk about more often than not\nIs the number of different guys who were involved in getting them to this point\nI just think of all the people that\nHave really worked hard and um\nYou know a quarterback them from doing so and these people are catching the block and defensive plays and coaches a coach and these are all you know great team or so\nVery cool sure is milestone moment for one Tom Brady it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio Julian Edelman came out with all kinds of fired energy intensity as you can imagine about a year and a half\nWorth of roars built up as he runs out on the field Eddie gets to a corner and he finds a friendly group and of course all the whole stadium was going to send to the fireworks are going off and all the colored smoke and everything else so it was neat to see him back on the field\n[laughter] ah I'm sure you weren't surprised at all\nThat he was ... on the receiving end of the first pass that Tom Brady through maybe everybody knew what the cold or maybe the colds near where they just didn't care either way it was good to see him back on the field and with all of that energy just bursting waiting for the chance to be out there again so\nHe had seven catches fifty seven yards is a that's a number that stands out to be but mostly it was about shaken out that Russ it was about being out there it is about finally being reunited with the fans who love him and\nThe guys that that he can't wait to play with\nMy guest and fired up and bring you to share with the people that come out and support you uh\nYou know I remember when I told my

don't know why she would change your mind what other words and investigative tools you using to come to a different conclusion but let's say for some weird reason she split your fifty fifty\nOkay now Mike Pence comes in anyone's right but\nDoes Joe Manchin the Democrat want to be responsible for Kavanaugh will be going to the Supreme Court I say yes it'll allow him to be the most powerful person in the Senate it'll be can persona non grata for awhile with the Democrats but in the big picture is going to be more powerful in Austin, Texas Brad hey Brad\nHey great show with dollar take right okay so I first want to say that the ...\nYou got to recall Senator Murkowski this ... this great that she voted against culture and the reason that I think that if they were good I'm going to make their summer ... will trust your by their yard for him\nPayment for sure he's going to turn the more difficult measures now\nI was also very nervous about the war talk that the president seemed to be a ... gauge again throughout most of the twenty Seventeen and\nI'm not sure the wild swings between war drums and love letters it was a constructive one but secretary Pompeo has to make clear to the Chinese were going to get very tough\nSo interesting uses a certain formula for this it's worked for decades and then the president comes in and\nThrough all of that on his head or you curious at all or being that sometimes you just do things totally different whether if it's football incomes is running shoe ... they start with a shotgun and things change you know the forward pass was something that football didn't embrace now all of a sudden it's commonplace\nThe way he goes in there and makes these deals are you curious it all to see if\nBy throwing everything in the air if we could get out of the sixty years stalemate\nThat's a fair point and you know I was a part of\nThe the now ... years of attempts to be there for our North Korea and we didn't get Bert are fully admit that we tried hard we try and soft and none of it seemed to work and so the president trying something new is not necessarily a bad thing\nBut I think he needs to do two things in particular first keep an eye on the ball\nWith isn't about a piece a treaty or some declaration that the war that that it's about stopping the production of this material that now may about two dozen nuclear weapon um and then the fact that he has to make sure that\nHis other choices contribute to this so for example starting a huge trade war with China probably doesn't make Beijing more likely to try and help us on the north Korea and I'm sure\nThat's true uh we are doing that although it has to be addressed and maybe it could all be leverage or we have that as well as a terrible relations with Russia all sides agree\nUm but they're all related as well so well and also with turkey where at a stalemate with turkey so these are these are the problematic ... some of the most of the problematic nations and at least we're addressing immoral head on and very curious to see where this goes I think on some level on the human level\nWhen he gets a taste of western culture you had a chance to get a little bit of respect he's going to South Korea he's looking around he's in his thirties I\nThink he's a horrible person don't get me wrong he's been to China three times where up until we started song relations he hasn't do you think on some level he is looking to change things in this country\nI think that's an excellent question he is ... is there is no doubt that he is a very different leader than his father and his grandfather\nHe went to prep school in Switzerland so here's a full understanding of what the West is capable up the apologized to president a moon of South Korea in saying that well if you come to a young you'll probably have to fly because our roads are so that they're not like you\nKnow he knows who is in a position of inferiority the real question though is on the the big questions the big issues are coming in the Korean War could party control um brutal\nA human rights a record of the north and the nuclear weapons themselves is he willing to try and we just don't know that yeah\nWe don't ah William Toby thanks so much appreciate bashing time we'll see if it Mike Pompeo comes out anything on Sunday it was a pleasure thank you All right a man is he\nGood a one eight six

I'm Out in the playoffs so I have a lot of time travel that we do we do have a lot of big issues going on some of which were solved a you know with the at least a Trump closing the deal on the U. S. M. C. A. and now we've got the farm bill percolating up ...\nRight right let's jump to use us MCA Haiti what's the reaction up in Canada\nI Would say oh the exporting commodities are relieved that there's going to be a trade deals if you talk to the beef pork a serial sectors they're excited the glad to see it do no harm obviously that was the U. S. message but I went to the Canadian exporters definitely share that sentiment\nExcited the glad to see it do no harm obviously that was a U.S message but I Would say the Canadian exporters definitely share that sentiment Canadian dairy and turkey or turkey and poultry not happy I'm I I Would say that the Canadian dairy industry the oil fields somewhat betrayed\nBy prime minister Trudeau market access that would give it up I think that was expected if you get the honest opinion it was the removal of class seven which is what USDA secretary so they produce push for from the very beginning and he got it and and I think that's where a lot of the concern lies Canadian dairy perspective\nYeah Jim I'm talked to yesterday with with both secretary Purdue and Secretary Vilsack they I think they kind of echo the way that farmers feel here in the U.S they were relieved that we've got a deal\nYou out a new record is better than no agreement or no agreement would have been a disaster so by that nature of its own\nIt was a success yes we got to get it passed so we're going to see all these lawmakers from both political I I I I also who have been educated again on the on the importance of market access whether or not they'll vote yes or no one disagreement comes up probably next year jail\nRight probably next year on it before we even start to implement to implement the agreement Pam what's your reaction\nJust plain and simple great news and I think you know the question won't be so when are the terrorists that are looming over the benefits of NAFTA gonna be lifted and maybe Jim you've got some insight on that\nWell I think Trump's going to continue to use that as leverage a secretary Purdue acknowledges that this has taken some of the bloom off the you know us a MCA\nBut I don't I think you're going to see this used as leverage to make sure of your lawmakers follow through on this fold et cetera Baptist style and I think that's you know what's gonna happen\nYeah so they're getting old\nGo ahead John how does it say that just gets kinda old\nLike I I I just think that if we are going to actually have a free trade agreement I Know we took\nThose words out of this for you know what we're calling this now but I just think that you know in an act of good faith\nIn trying to have a very very sold trading relationship between the three countries going forward and those those terrorists need to be and should be removed what's the purpose it's is it national security are we still going to hold on to to that old carrots I I just think we've got to move past this and and get them lifted\nI think we will right Jim\nOh yeah yeah and maybe he'll change on this one because it will maybe up to the uh late October surprise that will best or some of the er at markets I'm definitely not gonna you know rule that out because it needs to be done no doubt about it and it'll be it'll give a ...\nBecause of that not just Canada a terrorist but Mexico corn dairy you know pork etcetera there's some big games to be made there\nExactly there are some big games to be made and Jim I think your timing on it is is dead on a ... it you know\nLike it or not Pam uh the the stuff that you produce has become a political tool\n[noise] yes and you know the really happy to see some of the prices locally creeping up but honestly I really expected a big bomb with that announcement\nYou know almost [laughter] maybe I wasn't being realistic but I really thought the markets rid react more positively to the good news\nYeah heck even class the remote futures went down this week\n[laughter] and I take it out because Jim don't you think it's because we're waiting for those steel and aluminum tariffs to be lifted therefore lifting tariffs on some of our egg products or potentially ... opening the door for those terrorists will be lifted\nAbsolutely yes not truly functioning North America you know trade agreement even on her the existing NAFTA and until that happens that's why you've seen the delight response\nYou know and the one thing that's in this agreement that I I think is raising a lot of eyebrows Jim Sean Penn\nIs that if if Mexico or Canada or the U.S gets into trade talks with China they need to alert the other countries before\nMoving forward with that I mean all of the sudden used it a North American trade bloc against China\nWell isn't it and get him\nTo finally rally some allies to address the problems in China that are affecting all of us\nAnd to move forward because that's what one of the things that was really missing about withdrawing from the TPP is that there would be a a group of like minded countries on like minded people going in there to really solve the problems that are at the bottom of all this China trade war\nRight you know John ... chip I was a guest on Jim signal to noise podcasts last friday and and I talked about this that I think Trump's coming around to the fact that he can't do this alone that he he ... there is some powers and numbers here in the U.S getting the U. S. MCA done is just a piece of that\nAnd and so I I'm of the opinion I'm not as worried about this this causes a lot of people are making you know to be up here I China's been trying to bring Canada in Europe onto their side in this battle and thankfully I think the Canadian government saying hey we know what side were on and it's the right side of the U.S side on this issue so\nIs it kind of like an economic trade bloc yeah I guess you can kind of look at it that way\nYeah yeah Jim\nI think Sean spot on this is no longer just to trade conflict with trying to call it a war and whatever you want if the economic conflict to end up the geo political conflict and now they're going to be focused on China\nThe U.S MCA will serve as a template if you will offer other you know future agreement so I Do think we're finally as Pam said going on the right path allies to allies and focus on the detrimental thinks that China's been doing\nYeah yeah I got\nI I have to tell you chip though I Am really concern because it doesn't look like this is going to be over any time soon\nSo with the economics the way they are and just even thinking about agriculture is uncertainty in this whole thing when are we going to get to the table I I have a concern that if we think we're going to break the back of China\nWho's been in business for two thousand years versus us two hundred by ourselves we're looking at a long term conflict here\nYeah yeah absolutely hey I got a message from a listener last night\nIt's it's very interesting and it it applies to what we're talking here talking about right here he says just day for what it's worth\nI think it's misleading for your listeners to suggest any deal with China will be a trade deal us negotiator demands are specific to technology transfer and subsidizing state owned enterprises I've ...\nWe'll be a trade deal us negotiator demands are specific to technology transfer and subsidizing state owned enterprises I've not seen anything that points to a trade that's on the table gym that's a mouthful right there but it does kind of bottom line things doesn't it\nGot absolutely and on now that's when the two\nOf the country's leaders Trump binge eat meat in a you know Argentina and December unless they can come to a meeting of the minds on these multiple issues yes ah Pam I I guess this gets to cook the far longer than any one realizes and we're going to have to start challenging a Sunday for\nDon't get what little tariff aid program was just for one brings us back to the table we're going to talk about that now and\nI'm I'm Fran ...\n... I ... I'm ... not all\nAnd um because of opposition from the oil state senators\nShow and I think too yes as we said before each Fifteen we definitely need it we all can attest to\nUm the growth in the farm economy and the egg and kind of me for the U.S because of the renewable fuel standard so if that's not accompanied by addressing this waiver issue then really you have to ask yourself what have we gained yeah\nYup and Jim I don't think the waiver issues going to be addressed now trading of Iran's I think is going to be addressed isn't it\nYes while back to at least from now they're having a final meeting today so we haven't had the lakes you got out of that that meeting but yeah I'm not hearing waiver talk and in this coming announcement hopefully the announcement no ... October the ninth and Council Bluffs Illinois Iowa\n[laughter] sorry [laughter] the old Illinois boys threaten to lay claim\nAh but it it will be good news is not it's not a cure all\nUm move\nFor what's going on in the corn market I don't think there's a question about that\nIt it does help a but I I\nI think the expectations of what you Fifteen and year round availability in all areas or some some might have some\nSome overblown expectations of what am I mean for corn demand going down the road\nBut it is a positive the point the Pam made\nIs bought on\nReally what we need to get to do is address those waivers and make sure that we stick to the rule of the law of the our fs\nAnd and uh uh that uh I I don't know if that's gonna if that's going to happen\nOr not speaking of the earth as Jim what's cruises situation down in Texas\nWell he's in a tight contest the latest polls if you believe the army's up by only four point slapped that's ah that's tight uh that's uh where where his challenger bay token\nCan come back if the Hispanic vote a ... will vote in any numbers and they're not expected to a ... he he could actually lose but that's not a forecast\nI noticed on this letter to Trump a Trump was not on that letter or I maybe he was just not around when they asked for signatures but I thought it was odd that his name was not on that trying to to tell a Trump back off this announcement\nOh you mean cruises name wasn't on\nThe roses cruise yes same was not on that letter so maybe he just was out campaigning to be fair but usually they have a rubber stamp with yeah signature that they can put on those letters I'm trying to find out why his name was not on that trip\nThat's a good one that's a good one and they\nThey do even turned down or sort of talked down a possible endorsement from Obama who like bagels going all out here from for all sides have a chip I talked to one grain industry or green company executive this week who said\nHe thinks to deal with some of the glut of beans on a carry over a number that we dealt with last week and what's happening with corn he he thinks the problem is Asian should really get behind bio diesel and increasing or ethanol use that that is one way to to really tackle this\nWell if it would help it and it's actually\nYes and especially if this uh we've been ...\nWell if it would help it and it actually\nYes and especially if this uh we've been just kind of opened a little window to for some insight to see that this China thing is going to get a lot worse before it gets better\nAnd yes all of these little markets these other new trade agreements will help them mentally and his team would help but honest there's no replacement for China China's growth potential and other parts of that\nOf the world and India are really important to us that we make sure that we're in that market also so\nYou know is it is it just to temper um farmer anxious to before the election\nBy making these big announcements like in Council Bluffs I don't know yet are fs any fifteens important to us but so are these lingering trade deals\nRight right absolutely no question about it and Sean on the boat use of Bush believe me I'm all for ... D so uh but uh yeah you you you can't ... I I Am fully for ...

oath strayed really took off I go over there and watch Jay ... paper and that was that was impressed that\nHe that guy could flip order sheets quicker than anybody else\nOn the floor yeah [laughter] are they as it was yes it is yes it is All right man let\nLet's start with court here because when when you take a look at how this market as well\nI'm not going to make any statements the Clinton I just want to know what you think of how the corn market is traded go all the way back to this spring and and to where we are today give me ... how did we end up here\n[noise] oh boy um how long do we have here [laughter] well\nI I was in the camp for a long time or the you know let's wait and see how the Brazilians second crop turned out because it seemed like the world carry over was already starting to get pretty snug and it was going to be more and more dependent on that when that thing started having problems and uh the\nThe production ended up being slashed quite a bit let alone Argentina's shortfall uh I really thought corn could do better than it did\nYou know but that right about the same time course or shortly after that are are a\nCrap started looking better and better and for some reason the market just kind of turned his head away from a ... would normally have been you know some pretty friendly fundamentals those kind of frustrating I think for for everybody producer especially and I'm\nJust funds I think we're largely to blame for that for whatever reason they kind of monkey piled on that corn market and just kept driving a lower and lower\nAnd even now you know what I mean the Sox has used ratio for corn is is special in a world basis but even in the U.S has just\nLight years tighter than soybeans and yet a corn just can't really you know by any significant rally or saving Seoul\nYeah is it because we're expecting a big increase in corn acres for next year is that already having an influence\nWell yeah I think that's sort of been in the backdrop for a while yeah um and I think the markets kind of had to approve the Toomey attitude too as far as exports it's like a you know you've got to see these exports materialized kinda like the wheat market and I mean I'm yeah\nOn paper looks like the way we could be headed for a short for a tightening somewhat of the carry over in wheat but it's ... percent\nDepended on export demand finally taken off and which has failed to happen in wheat corn or at least it finally is I mean it's real strong but uh it's almost too little too late because\nI'm going to sell on time to go and I do think corn exports will impressed\nAnd they will rise and um [noise] but the problem is a yields numbers have just\nOut paste any increase in demand in most of the demands coming in most of the band increases have come from the exports so um it's like every time you get that hundred a hundred and fifty million bushels bump in the exports well lo and behold he had you know slightly bigger increase in the production is just a never ending battle\nYeah yeah that's that's exactly right you know it's a small sample size that get that but here we are for weeks and two the two thousand Eighteen Nineteen marketing year\nAnd our total corn export bookings are sixty three percent I had a year ago no way that we can sustain that I get that but boy it's a pretty phenomenal start\nYeah I'll say it is not no doubt about that but again um [noise] the problem is if you go back to the supply and demand report even at the end of July\nUh the corn carry over for a new crop was one point five five billion that's when they had one Seventy four wheels so even though these experts have been phenomenal not only shipments but you know sales on the books like you just said\nI'm the problem is now a the average trade gifts for the carry over next Thursday is over one point nine billion so you've had a three hundred and fifty million bushels to the carryover or even know exports of increase considerably in that\nTimeframe yeah\nSo it's kind of like we're both sort of like wasted a bullet here you know they're being\nStronger export demand but it's just kind of miss fire if that export demand increases met with even more supply its\nGood perspective right there so have you seen the average trade gas going into next Thursday the crop production report on you\nOr have yeah I just saw that right before a hooked up with you oh okay I'm at one eighty one point eight is what a Bloomberg was saying\nOkay and they wouldn't ... more than USDA's number\nOkay so you buying that or do you do you believe that number\nI think it's very possible I I think you could just easily swing a bushel down as well you know I mean we're kind of fine tuning at this point and\nIt's it's obviously an inexact science but uh [noise] uh I I guess I Would guess the smart money is taken the ... you know compared to the last deal number I mean when you have\nA ... there's definitely been a lot of um skepticism cynicism about all these private estimates you know where they poke along is almost just seems this year the perfect case in point more than ever it's kind of game of follow the leader you know\nThey all have their own ideas but they all cluster and USDA and then as soon as USDA comes you know moves away from the market you know they all do any choice but to follow it\nAnd um it it's kind of frustrating but it is we all know in the trade even though these private assessments are interesting and the the generally generally a little bit of a ripple in the market when they're released a there's nothing that matters like the USDA number and then Thursday is number will be the same way right\nAnd a little bit of a ripple in the market when they're released a there's nothing that matters like the USDA number and then Thursday's number will be the same way right up to answer because yeah I think is believed to you\nIt it it just I you know at the at when we got the one eighty one point three last month I I just felt like that pushed a little bit too hard to fathom yeah that was kind of courage\nTo be honest I have so many customers that that I didn't think it was going to happen but now now that these guys are out in the field and you know bringing in these unbelievable numbers I guess I'm a little bit more of a believer now\nGotcha gotcha you know and\nIt it feels I was convinced that this October number that we're going to get next week we're going to be more like a November number because of the ... Vance maturity\nGet out there get it harvest now that we're into some of the harvest delays now that we've got some tough conditions out there this does feel like in October number not a November number so they're still look there there's still some uncertainty out there with with exactly where we're going to end up what do you want to do with corn Clayton\n[noise] well it all depends on whether you've got storage or not I mean that's never been a ...\nA bigger deciding factor than this year in recent memory anyway a scrap the storage at the very least phenomenal merchandising play by that I mean you know go on for the basis gain and that goes for soybeans to soap is probably even better\nI mean they can't charge spreads or you know out of this world can ask for better than this um\n[noise] that being said as far as it so I Would do everything I could if I have on a farm stores to to do that preserved that opportunity to gain on the basis gains but that's not the same thing as saying uh you know I'm just flat out bullish 'cause I'm\nFlat price as a whole different story I'm Alive I was really friendly corn on the last time I was on your show a month to though was was friendly corn\nAnd the big picture I guess that's to lean friendly but I'm not nearly as as friendly as I was I think it it it takes it's going to take that much bigger of a catalyst probably in terms of foreign production scares or than it would have before just because like I said the carryover gone from one point five to over one point not\nThat's a big margin but cushion there\nYeah that's a good way of bottom line and get no doubt about it okay we're talking with Paul ... Clayton pope from\nClayton pope commodities when we come back I Want to talk a little bit more about what's going on in\nThis soybean market [noise] nice nice wrap up to the week for the soy complex we'll we'll see what they think about it [noise]\nCan we keep it going to talk about that right here on the TV [noise]\nCurrent price times one thousand acres carry the one of these\nDays it's hard to make the math word for your ... feels to be a chef liberty links system with liberty herbicides makes it easier to start with the two most bushels per acre yield advantage\nUm you know China titles rebel and I got to think that it's going to do everything they can to tighten the rebel [noise] you know they're going to change their feed rations and so forth and so on [noise]\nUm they're not going to have to wait that long before you know South American supplies are available so uh as long as South American uh can avoid a weather problem than um I think China's going to stay away for a while it would be my guess\nThat's no good at ... on\nTheir Monday though so I mean again there's all kinds of wheels turning behind the scenes that we have no idea what's going\nOn yeah yeah that's right and and I you know I don't know enough\nDifferent than what you just described to Clayton to argue with you on it I mean and you're exactly right what you said about Trump you never know he could pull the rabbit out of the hat and if he does that then we're probably going to see some kind of a relief rally it here ah but I never really changes the overall fundamentals\nThat well that's the thing and the other thing I like to mention is that the more we rally here the more they're pricing enter discounting\nChina coming back to the table to some extent so even even if they come back what are they going to come back and forth absolute max two hundred million bushels okay so you bring a carry over from nine hundred seven hundred right now how much of a rally is that worth I still don't think it just buys beans over nine dollars\nOkay hey we laugh Lauren ... we got Lauren from Minnesota on the line I he's been waiting patiently I Want to get to them Lauren how are you today\nOr Egypt pretty good how are you doing on\nDoing real find what's on your mind today\nAre going to want to ask you how much ... from the corn belt you break it down a record crop this year\nWho\nOn a percentage basis well you know you got to look at the Illinois\nPercent [noise] on\nA percentage basis well you know you gotta look at the Illinois\nYou gotta look at a I don't know if Indiana's going to have a record crop or not Nebraska I think it will I\nGather yeah I've got a table and there's some other Scott the cache of top my head I'd say it's probably Seventy percent of the states have a record deal\nThat\nThat might be pushing it just a little bit of my figure in Clayton but uh yeah it'll be in that two thirds maybe\nMhm I think so\nI ... percent do you think about when the worst prop ... in twenty five years\nWell since you're calling from Minnesota I Would guess that you're sitting with a bunch of potholes airfields Lauren is that right\nYeah your dog and the other on the other part of the worst drop a random tore part of your mind or tell you that\nThere are a lot of guys who picking corner I've heard you heard on the hundred forty yeah that's not even growing apart all\nYeah that that means that crop when we went through on crop to her Lawrence third week of August we really put out the warning that it looked like that Minnesota crop was running out of gas and it sounds like it might have\nYeah I have that\nI wrote the top of the hundred in you know like\nLast year where we are a lot of fuel beverages through forty\nThere were worked at your luggage Germany or so here you're G blood\nWell there's no question there's pockets around and in some states that are that are hurting Iran but uh some of the good stuff so over the top and then it goes a long ways to towards increasing those averages yeah but\nI looked at me have to drop\nFrom my perspective northern Iowa or way down the highway twenty\nGr crop there the law or that part of\nNorthern part of the murder of storm I go ... or being everything novel gr\nYup yup yup yeah lower and that is a tough spot no doubt about it I we've only got a couple of minutes left here with Clayton so I'm gonna let him wrap things up and I want him to comment on it on what you're talking about their Lauren\n... is the problem the problem that we run into their Clayton is can you take a big enough bite out of\nThose areas to have an influence over the entire corn crop and that I think is that's a question that we're going to have to wait until November to get an answer\n[noise] [laughter] yeah I I agree yeah it's just that\nI don't know at this late date and that was harvest a starting off so rapidly um I I've just got to think that the even though I absolutely was flabbergasted that uh [noise]\nUh September USDA use 'em for them to do an about face to start hacking at anything significantly at this point I'd be very surprised like I said before they take a bushel outfit I wouldn't be shocked okay hum\nAs possible but but even if that happened I don't think it's not a game changer you know write it certainly give a lot more site potential but the fact that not like immediately go skyrocketing\nOkay Clayton I I've only got about thirty seconds for you what do you want to do on beans\nBeans again a phenomenal play as far as I'm farm storage goes to some of these exorbitant drop charges a storage fees uh it it it just doesn't make sense of any sense anymore to commercially Stuart or corn in my opinion unless you're in an area that is relatively cheap storage but um [noise]\nEvery word this rally if at this point that I Would sell the cash beans is harvesting with this far off the ... I don't think there's that much additional upset\nIf you want to play for a China breakthrough by some calls [noise]\nAll right Clayton good stuff man you have a great weekend okay thank you you to take care of All right\nThat is Clayton pope plate both commodities all the banks the Lawrence Minnesota for calling in kind of interesting we got more in Minnesota where things are tough plate from Illinois where things look really good and those two to Virginia attitude towards the\nFox News Sunday Sunday mornings in ten ... news talk WG a G\nThe great thing about your phone or tablet is having information right at your fingertips who that guy in the movie\nWhere is the best deal stuff like that\nOf course for insurance you can meet your Battle Creek mutual independent agent and the new Battle Creek mobile apps carry electronic proof of insurance policy info pay your bill Moore connect with your Egypt and it's ready to help if you have an accident download the app or your device NBC mutual dot com Battle Creek mutual insurance better together\nLife not worthy of life was the slogan you to justify some of history's worst atrocities Reverend Perry heart warns against our cultures devaluation of life he joins us to see ourselves and others as precious people created by God redeemed by Christ this week on the Lutheran our\nDue to the Kansas City chiefs regained starting in Lebanon am this Sunday the Lutheran our will only be hurt at seven thirty AM this Sunday here on W.

all the all be paying for the fight was in the fight\nIt's a really tough one to call\nMcGregor has been out of the ring or out of the act of gum pardon me for two years and the idea of ring rushed to Israel and the ... undefeated be him is he is a pretty good striker he's pretty good defensively on his feet\nAnd his ground game is incredible which obviously is the opposite of what McGregor is good at McGregor is a striker and doesn't want to go to the ... doesn't want to go to the ground\nI just butt in McGregor is an underdog plus one thirty last I saw time and again man people underestimate Conor McGregor\nTo their own detriment this guy from me McGregor for me\nIs on the level\nOf all the brawn James of a Tiger Woods\nOf my trout he is the most exciting and the most dominant athlete of his generation into sport John Jones is probably a better pound for pound fighter but his inability to stay healthy and as independent as healthy just to stay\nWithin the rules within the confines of the rules I think McGregor is a remarkable talent\nAnd the U. S. C. and I like to USC\nJust sold for ... billion dollars a couple of years ago it's doing fine he hasn't fought in ... two years and I think the edge USC is lost something without it I think what we're gonna see tomorrow in part is a test of whether or not and trust me Dana White\nWhatever God Dana White believes into whatever superstitions he has he has praying he is hoping he is burning in says he is bringing whatever lucky rabbits feet I never understood why rabbits will be lucky hoping Conor McGregor ones is fight\nBecause the McGregor trying to empower the U.

interesting um because Walker your pitch so well and because of ... so well last night that people are kind of making her shrine to this guy who was more of just the number three guy in the rotation they don't look at him as a sending more um I personally do I\nOf making her shrine to this guy who is more of just the number three guy in the rotation they don't look at him as a eighth anymore and I personally do I think that he's been around he's been the best pitcher in baseball for the regular season at least\nFor the last eight to ten years and so a lot of people in LA are kind of down on her shock and to the point where a lot of people think that he's kind of kind of get blown up today which is really interesting to me I think he's going to come out and pitch great but a lot of LA is down on Cleveland curse shots ...\nNow ... gene or building a brand new leaves the air until seven o'clock tomorrow morning within twenty five miles north of Nebraska programming continues on translator came to nine zero Eighteen Eduardo fine point nine FM\nRadio producer extraordinary Greg Bergman\nBergman Greg on Twitter in Bergman Greg's what you're going to want on on the Twitter handle because this is where you can find the post game show he does after every Dodgers game for Dodgers nation it is really good in true story here\nGreg asked me to look at it recently and Greg it until you this I thought I wait to our national TV together and I didn't or national radio I didn't want to 'cause I didn't want to call you and tell you how bad you were on television that I watched it and you were short in there and I actually called you might dude you shocked at what would be really good [laughter]\nI Know shocked I was so\nSo you want to watch if you're interested in Dodgers origin baseball if you're interested in post season play it is a must it must turn to Bergman Greg on Twitter easiest way to find it on our friends over a Dodger nation at Dodgers nation and so on\nYou know make a lot of teams is this a cubs included didn't work out went out and got big names at the deadline may be the biggest that was available went to the Dodgers what is a good shot does impact been for this ball club for this club house for this team\nYou know many Machado has really filled in really well for Cory Seeger and that his defense has been phenomenal he's moved from third and short most but he's mostly the shortstop now um but when it wasn't really playing very much in the early parts of his time being there he was playing a lot of third but his defense is phenomenal the weird thing about manning Machado\nIs that he's not in Camden Yards anymore and the power seemed to have stayed in Camden Yards\nWhere he's not actually can and yard using it's he's not getting the big hit in the big moments\nAnd that's been kind of the issue with them and you saw it last night if you're watching the game that he struck out three times he grounded out into a double play last night and even booted up all its shortstop which is very rare from him he didn't make an amazing place at the at the end of the game\nBut for the most part he has not come through in the clutch situations so people here in LA are wondering Corey seekers coming back next year many Machado was a top five player in baseball he's going to demand between three hundred and four hundred million dollars\nIs it worth it to resign and if you can't get the ball out of the yard at Dodger Stadium so he's actually been not I wouldn't say a disappointment and I would love to bring them back\nBut the thing is he has not come through in the court situation it could change the night though because he hits and about Sanchez really really well\nI find that so interesting Greg Bergman in part because I can remember when I was in LA on on the Dodgers radio network and they went out and they got\nMachado but they got Josh reading from what the age of memory serves and even though it was like over four hundred or something ridiculous start and I remember talking to to a guy who played for the Dodgers just about it's different when you come to LA the pressure\nDo you buy that you do you think or something to what's going on Machado and what happened back in the day very different level players rhetoric is for some reason the Dodgers a tougher place to step into because of the pressure of the club or something that's going on there\nWell the clubhouse is that it's really tight clubhouse I wouldn't really think it's the clubhouse so much um it is different rang at\nA Dodger Stadium and you should not and you know this from being in LA Dodgers stadium is a pitcher's park the ball doesn't fly like it does at different places like camping yard or you know in a Houston the ball flies Yankee Stadium is just a teeny little ... where you can hit anything out in right field\nThat's not how it is here in LA you really have it has to be the right time of day it has to be the right whether and every ... to get the ball out of the out of the yard and so with him\nBeing in LA it's just not seeing that which many Machado when he was in Baltimore he had a huge huge O P s into who's on base percentage but all those numbers dropped by at least a hundred and points when he was on the road so now he's on the road technically by being\nIn LA and just not getting\nYou're just not able to hit as well he as he was there because it's a much bigger park so I think that's what happened with reading with interesting with Reddick though is that he started off really poorly he was actually really good in September for the Dodgers you had a really good I think there's anything wrong for hundreds of dollars in September he just didn't come through in the collection the postseason\nGreg Bergman
