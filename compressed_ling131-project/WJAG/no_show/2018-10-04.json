I mean I\nObviously breeze one of the same grades and we all see it from a distance from remove the fans on TV or the games can you give us some some perspective or some insight as a guy that's on the receiving end of what he does so well why he's so good what makes them so great\nAbout what what makes them good kind of a story about a of talked before when I\nWhen I came or two thousand Thirteen um it was either that year the year after I look out on the field and saw him going through this progression by himself or nobody was on the field we're all in the weight room working out we can see into indoor facility and he was out there\nI'm calling employers that the line and going through his progression something I'm sure you do so many other times I'm we're we're not around um but things like that you know the way that he's able to visualize the wage is um we're really affectionate but but he makes everybody better everybody\nOffensively wants to play well because they know that he was giving his all and he was going to be prepared if he's going to the to stand there and be with us and and make college you know throughout the games are so it really raises the level of of um competition and the level of competence represented\nMeasurement watching here on the show you that the the opportunity to play with two of the absolute greatest guys ever play the quarterback position the history of the game drew in ... and Tom Brady what other similarities in their excellence and maybe one of the differences in their excellence\n... will say first of all the they're both very competitive I I don't think you\nMake it um to the league first of all but also you don't\nYou don't become great at anything that you do in any fear um or occupation if you're not very very competitive if you're not someone who pays a lot of attention to detail\nAnd if you're somebody that's not easily satisfied I'm you know I can remember times in New England you know when he was for winning a big game by\nA large margin and and Tom is the first one in there the next day working out the next day or or upset about certain players that he didn't make I'm wanting to correct those things and move on to the next week the same thing with drew\nI'm do through two guys that are very driven um to perfection and and you know you know you have to enjoy your when sometimes but the enjoyment times very short with people\nUm that perform that the way that they do so they're very similar obviously I Would say a couple of differences there\nTheir personalities are a little bit different\nYou know when you look at among game drugs should be able to Tom going up and down the lives of a sideline to yelling you know encouraging God do you do the same way to do that at different styles so they have different styles but they're they're very similar a lot of ways\nThat's been watching the things I didn't hear on the show with me bill Ryder on CBS Sports radio when you're playing with those guys is there anything you do differently the way that you're on your route the way that you approach the situation from one quarterback\nNeither do I think I I think for any quarterback um do you always want to run routes and and do things the way that they want it done um the way that the process goes throughout the week is you get your installations on Wednesday Thursday Friday for a second down\nYou know third down goal on rent area on on Fridays and on the piece of paper there's a way that around this is kind of drawn\nBut as you get onto the field or you talk to the quarterback and you may say I want you to break that thing at eight dollars an hour once you to\nTo run it this way I'm going to be looking for you if you get this was sort of coverage knows that the ball is coming to you got to win a ... and so would you have a quarterbacks like that that communicate with you in that let let you know you know this is what I Want this is what I'm looking for they also do that type of information it helps you guys are out one of\n'em to know when the ball's probably coming to you when it might not be\nHow you need to run the ... if you want it to come to\nBenjamin in your time in the NFL how much has the tight end position and the way the titans are use all than simply shift didn't change the course of your career\nYou know I I think\nWe're we're all kind of talk about that but there were there were some great parents are tied in in the past you know a guy looked up to so much with without insurance shop um hall of fame or anything and he was someone who was known for\nCatching a ball alive you know you got guys that goes all is in the list goes on and on I I think that now the game um has moved probably further maybe because of the spread office in college but also because of some of the rule change\nThe tide in physician or if it's more common to be a a pass receiving position\nI'm with a guy that is that as tall and can run in and do all sorts of things that can create those types of mismatched she's I think that you see more of that now as it did in the past um that but I think a lot of that is because of the way the rules have changed um as far as how defenders can't\nCan't can check guys down field um the even though we're in a town\nWhere you can you can you can tackle all those sorts of things I think has changed uh the the the products that we're putting on the field which is a more officers friendly game now so\nHow do you assess or judge the new rules this year in terms of robbing the passer and the helmet rule that we've seen the are obviously a lot about the NFL\nBut I think that the one that that um has gotten to the most scrutiny as to the sort of rough and the passer and that's not necessarily to do with this appointed vest so whenever there's a point of emphasis\nThen it's going to be coming up on the eastern to call that more tightly um but when you look at some of these calls it it really is a again\nNobody can get here and get upset about it um but those of us that are played for over a decade and those of us who are fans of the game that remember how it was ten years ago at Twenty years ago or Thirty years ago\nYou understand like everything else things things change things we've all um and that's kind of what's happening right now there's all this kind of a rough patch where it's uncomfortable and maybe some calls get made that shouldn't have\nAnd those sorts of things that you have to work out but I think what we're seeing is evolution of the game and I can't say that if that is bad the only bad part about it I Will say is that there was not consistency with how those things are cold and that's something that could lead to um the officials are going to have to work through a throughout this year meaningful\nCBS Sports radio on bill Ryder talking with New Orleans saints tight in Benjamin Watson you as his three is freedom friday initiative donate five thousand

Jackson the defensive tackle for the jaguars there's really cool and really interesting and he played them that she doesn't Fifteen Broncos defense that won the super bowl\nI asked him for what he sees as the similarities between that event and the jak defense he plays for today\nFor me what I see the similarities are just the past you know if you could pass rushing is tremendous I think we have gotten the ads that can collapse as and allow quarterback to step up its interior Russia's like myself am I sat there is every Jones I think our linebacker they're coming\nComing down hitting people and also covered and people you know and also we have to get back there which I like to call it ties in with her who discovered titans allows our corners if it if you look like a one on one that gets people that we really need them on so it's also\nMulling since ... became daffodils that go back in two thousand sixteen the jak has gone fourteen they won the agency's out you've made in the sea championship game what's been the key to that success and what Doug ... to do in Jacksonville to turn the jags and one of the most dangerous teams in football\nOr what goes wrong with them they just bring amongst the you know that east coast rough greedy I'm coming up and say whatever I Want to do whatever I Want another team we pick that up you know we worked for what we're supposed to be all we're doing we're supposed to do when we come up with just a ... and and that's better for sooner about ourselves you know um\nWhen we were able to close a\nCoach or just a it was a great thing we have the same team fighting the wrong just about just a different type of mentality and that was really all we need it 'cause we didn't really really mean much to get going to see that mentality and are you seeing what we've done with that\nListening to my interview my conversation with Molly Jackson on the TV show earlier today this is rather than you I'm Bill Ryder low on CBS Sports radio the jacks played the cheeses we can make every week it feels like there's at least one incredible football game rams Vikings last week as a great game\nFor no chiefs three in one jaguars the wonder Ken the young style the gunslinger Patrick Holmes who was just ... percent of the scene against that jags event we have great great football game whatever happens and I asked ... Jackson what he sees in patterns of homes in what they have to do to stop it\nFrom the whole did I say that the great quarterback you know he's out here to make a lot of plays them on a on his own um decrease louder please speak\nSays I play um I Know what the difference but we have to do is make sure we keep them in the pocket laugh on Monday I was watching the games um Denver I think that a poor job of keeping them in a pocket allow him to go to a staples afterwards rights away from the blitz and that's the only thing that we have to change\nOur no yeah like almost a hundred and fifty two hundred Patton you are not the pocket so what the next week keeping the pocket another reason to keep on ... so I just think that he just he plays but something that's just do our jobs we do our jobs and\nBecame a great place so we just have to make sure what we're supposed to be ... as the weather is supposed to be at and are you just can't learn to use a trick them play it's really hard to\nOne of these guys a lot to do to do your job obviously a deal with Andy Reid and his authentic approach always dynamic always a complex for proposing defenses how are you preparing for the variety of formations and weapons Andy Reid has that has the holes on how does the preparation for an end to retain very made me from some other team to face over the course of ...\nI mean to be honest with you you have to give them give them a respect you know he's a great coach he's done a lot of great thing to have a huge a playbook and he doesn't mind going in depth to it\nBut we just practice probably usually friends we understand the tendency that we we we we have a good idea what they want to do\nAnd so I called you put it in our in our ear in her eyes of what they want to do we go out there and do it all the we try to get too hyped up or too low for teams and they come in here we just said the same team oh we don't we don't really worry about everybody else worry about ourselves and then that's happening how we got to this point so we're we're going to understand that the parents that you have a lot of great often a lot of ... off into\nWeapons so do we have ... weapons into it'd be a great message that's what\nI Love ... Jackson saying it just makes me want to go out there and put my pads on him and recently left him oh the ... I Love it I Love the football team I'm so under these guys I ask ... Jackson\nWhether or not given the fact that earlier in the year ... five foot three ... for no hyped up chiefs whether the game's going to have a playoff like atmosphere\nI think personally it's too early you know I mean you understand the AFC team so possibly could be a mess up for a ... I think what you want to go out here just make a great um\nBritain impression on the whole league you know this early in the seasons out about it is about work\nFor the play offs but it's also about setting the tone for the people actually about the ... coming up and from Nick Nick home for the playoffs so right now we're not doing too hard to have to keep our heads they're going to be a playoff can we say we need to make a statement now this is the next came up that's supposed to be the hardest thing since sliced bread and we have to make a statement\nHere first career solo sack I Love is that hot came at the expense of Tony Romo obviously then the Dallas Cowboys now a colleague of ours here at CBS Sports does that first one is it a little more room for meaningful for you when you see Tony ever give them our time\nNot got the kind of forgot after you you know you get in and then you realize it but the one thing that league does it moves fast you never really get a chance to sit down and I\nThink about what you just did it's always on the next you know last week we'd be a great team but hell we got right back in the locker room after the game as are now we've got tendency to come in and so you know you you don't get to say things that Tony Romo that that'd be disrespectful you know but I think it's something I Do I Do like to remember but\nNow I'm trying to get to a hundred so one is awesome but hopefully the hardest one feels great too far\nIt's been getting to a hundred or is there a quarterback out there yeah 'cause I have is your job is to go get the cue the is there a quarterback out there yet maybe respect that you haven't gotten to yet that your particular looking forward to try and take him down at some point between now and are in the end of your career\nAnd then my career man I got I Can't look that far ahead regardless such effect hoses next will not solve many ... he was getting out of last week\nPeople get hired you know so that makes me wonder if I'm up has on them and it really really fill me you know I see how that goes off with a line that really gets hyped up and I think the bigger hot stuff so you know for me I I started my own three to make a statement for the league and the ... by\nTheir heads of ads on them I Love I Love it I can however this game our last but not least ... Jackson who I talked to her in the day Jacksonville Z defensive tackle gave his reaction his perspective on his teammate ... comments the off season on what it felt like every single quarterback in the late\n... you know what I'm saying I mean you you you work with the guy I sat next to where I had the movie young guy outta here to get more space and my second luck or\nBy the right here you know so you hear the mindset you think he knows he's a ... like you the best in any proof so for me for him saying that you know I'll back more hundred percent you know um\nSorry I have to watch them at first game against Denver I mean this um Green Bay and I saw what he did and that game the one thing that really got me was that I saw this from another person like Michael Jordan I stay up right there\nIf you're a player got to cope with it every day every game and we already had tapped it if it so I figure when I saw a little to to ask to a site just go race level 'cause other guys got no excuse now the Cape where we're out so I Do is go to their level so I'm like okay\nWe got a great beef is probably going to be a top three ... out\nAnd then ... was Brooklyn I nothing personal ... you like I like you know our hatred for a color it wasn't like they were hurting Colombian early he's a team player he's a good ball but I just thought he was struggling a lot\nOf what this game did this Sunday show me he's a NFL quarterback now all beetles gives Tampa Bay and they have a horrible secondary he showed me it'd be NFL quarterback not obsessed will come when he plays ... let's go to a\nYou know be be better to me a bit of a template buccaneers and then the other thing I wanted to talk about this ... interview a yeah we're watching a that was a great\nGreat interview man you guys are you guys get together after being retired man you guys have no more show somewhere and you got to make a lot of money but that was a really really good interviewer ... like ...\n... I'm In the bedroom and watching you out their team up it was a ... he was great\nHe was really good and I appreciate trade with the kind words if you missed it it was an hour ago now\nAnd\nBenjamin just on a bunch of stuff and he was really honest in a really thoughtful perspective really explanation of why he didn't find New England a very joyous place to play despite success and he really did enjoy\nAnd has enjoyed and he is still enjoy being in New Orleans can find a podcast it's radio dot com or\nWas that later CBS Sports radio on Twitter or it might handle sports writer sports Ari I T E R eight five five to one to four CBS the number is our guy does our regular friends from Alaska our resident raiders fan Jay in Alaska was about a year on CBS Sports radio\nHey what they'll do it so you know you got to rub it in my pay about how bad the raiders are because\nI Know you've had your\nGloating and enjoying so I'm going to go a little bit today\nRub it in your at your companies are not in the playoffs\nAre on the statement saying we for your like my uncle Bob who did this I haven't heard\nA I wanted to say about pat wrong you know the only only uh drawback I see to that guy is unfortunately any rate I mean the guy never won and he's had great players\nHow far are you going to be that Dan Reeves I'm already shot in the hammer of F. L. I don't think he's gonna win at that ... the guy who can win the Superbowl Andy Reid just can't win the Superbowl or oh and\nI wanted to ask you to other things real quick and I'll let you do\nYou think curly finally get it because I was post game press conference and he was talking about how great martial Lynch it finally you recognize that and how much she wants to run the ball and how much he's begging for the ball\nYou taking partly a opened up his eyes and it is actually going to do what he should have been doing all year gym Marshall end up breaking football\nAnd secondly I Will just say you'd think that doctors can sweep out the er at ways I I really think they're gonna smoke so a bachelor\nSweep the Braves the Braves and underestimate all your I think the dog is really good in that play and gain a hundred and sixty there again that momentum is going to maybe be that missing ingredient no I don't think China grants figured it out and how do you use or on the cubs I'll say this about your injury point\nYeah he's never accomplished it but he's exactly Patrick moms needs right now\n... homes right now today or at least one wasn't trying to win the super bowl right now he's trying to figure out to be a successful quarterback in the NFL and Andy Reid is the I said earlier a few times of Joe ...\nOf the NFL he genius he does he and his great what he does players love and he sees the game\nIn a way that is more creative in in more intelligent than than most of the guys he competes with their respective league sports pardon me\nThe difference is Joe mad and got a World Series bill direct culture built the right guys and then he was awful awful in game than hire policies and we'd only wanted Andy Reid could benefit from that too he's in close\nAnd now he has battered moms I don't think this year but it ... a year or two or three I absolutely think any reading of Super Bowl with moms I think Andy Reid is great enough of what he's great at\nThem homes and that she's seen will be in position to do it and then I think Andy Reid will be a net negative once they get to the play offs and the question is when it all comes down to watch what happens I mean it's going to be in ... Jay\n... my uh my uncle Bob lives in Denver, Colorado Barbara levy uncle Bob\nDylan less laughter last night cinema no because he's a Broncos fan and my parents are chiefs fans just saying enjoy Vance Joseph ... but it was waiting for game last night when the cubs last he blew up my phone with message about the cubs season veto\nSo I'll just say this which is fine you're going to just you got to take it I'll just say this about an equal proportional response to Jane Alaska and to bunk about a week for a loss for the Broncos on this case the raiders ... senators to into one three is not the same thing\nAs your team in baseball who won the most games the national league losing two consecutive play in slash wild card playing a game wildcard playoff series and the year you know I think a little\nDifferent it'd be like if I'm not going to come up with that bad karma near\nBy appreciate your perspective earlier today on the show had the chance to visit with the Gina Kowalski longtime major league pitcher current analysts Fox Sports one you can hear them it'll be network radio good guy worked as CJ\nWhen we were both in LA and speaking of my heartache I asked CJ I think you might be able to hear him laugh you I Can't remember this is the clip he laughed at me like J I ask you ... you what went wrong with the cubs\nAnd I was to Christ probably wasn't the same the sheer will suffer the tourists wasn't the same this year a injuries or you know production issues and then of course what happened with\nUm ... right in the idea of what was going to happen in that rotation the way that things were expected to go down this year and it didn't happen I'm exactly collar chat with ran into that same situation um and you know they did a good job the fact that they still one Ninety five games when it was all said and done with all the pieces that had they had to add the adjustments that does it make\nIn season that in by itself as a successful a year but the fact that they fell short in those two games or remember of course in both to those games\nEven though it's not a winner go home you're fighting for the division that spot it's a huge deal your opponent is going at you with everything they have right over the course of the regular season that's not necessarily\nAlways the case but in that situation and what we saw first with the brewers are and then with the Rockies or it was everything we possibly had to throw at you and they push really well and uh the cubs did not take the the fact that you were looking for a consistent live they couldn't come through as much I'm unhappy by us had a big hit\nAt the original had a big hit but not enough\nOver the course of those two games or to to come up with tourists and they're just weren't enough of those big at bats ah that were used to seeing and when you're sitting there watching those games of the regular fan like a guy like me\nWho has no skin in the game you're like oh yeah they're going they're going to walk this off they're going to figure it out and we just it just felt it always feels like of course the cubs in a spot like this at home or going to get it done and it's pretty shocking when you see them fall short\nWhile it that's the measure time and I'm kinda measured respectful professional seasons mccaskey ... where we started with was him laughing at me here when I brought up my my thing\nOn the less important scale but so painful I'm a cubs fan and I'm Still not ...\nHow do you what are you like that idea that wow wow\nAnd Tom event data producer underscore Tom you and for me to kind of hurts guys you also have left in the moment\nYeah I'll on it like outline laugh like ... from the cubs and you went [laughter] yeah basically that harsh I'm ashamed\nTo rapidly shaming out good I have\nPlayed as he did then again maybe it'll shame him wherever he is\nOn the less important scale but still painful I'm a cubs fan and I'm Still not going to profit\nOff of people that are like that idea that wow I'd rather not\nFile a CD did then continue to talk sports with me including whether or not because consider that isn't the Yankees right now are winning that ball game against Oakland two to nothing to fear but they gave that over yet and there's still a scenario where the cubs obviously they won the most games\nA nationally along with everyone has a Ninety five they're out there you go to a hundred games this year they won nine more games and the Indians and the Yankees could be out and so in that context I ask you Jay mccaskey if major league baseball should reconsider recon figuring the postseason\nHope so I you know the ... all this thing about this deal about winning the division I just I'm not on board with it especially now that we have to well cards and so the fact that you have to all cards and everyone's not playing the same schedule to me uh doesn't make sense to Fifteen teams in each division make it a little bit harder\nThere's a better way to remove them most of the air and harmful pollutants it's with the way most your control unit wave can transform your home into a drier healthier environment satisfaction

Robertson had an easy I'll tell you and your pitches he threw a an easy a top of the seven or no age patterns reached\nHe retired decide in all of twelve pitches but as in like he had to work to get

... on a McGregor has the ban is obviously so my question for you is who do you think has better advantage and the other person straight so as hot are going to be better on the crowd or as a beep going to be better on\nWho hold his own in the week or if it's two aspects of the game is what you're asking me\nRight yeah ... who's better and the other person strong suit\nThat's a great question that's a great way to look at it to um I've seen most of the McGregor fights\nI Would you say he's not great on the ground I wouldn't think he's pretty\nGood deed rather stay on his feet as you correctly pointed out and you mentioned ... graded taking guys that are ground and then just pounding them um I Would say it\nThere's a better chance McGregor holds off what can be great at\nThen can be can hold up McGregor it's great at\nIowa hundred percent agree with you and another thing that I followed interesting is that the arts in Europe the embedded Habib faces all messed up I mean it scratched you got bruises um so you know that's the thing I keep thinking about is is kind of puts his hand and he wanted a lightweight division\nThey are going down to the so that's that's all I thought about\nOkay I haven't seen any of the uh behind the scenes stuff so I'll take your word for it they can be done look great coming into the fight every took the fight a than eat things that I'm

Roberts and get a guy on base I said I'd even let him get to on base I Would not go to Britain immediately I'd actually rather whole Britain as the safety net\nAfter Chapman and the name the that's the case that Britain he gave up an infielder single close play first base they review did they call the runner say ah they took all the videotape it was safe\nNext battery or American League a home run champion\nWho is very good at hitting the ball the other way he I think J. D. Martinez the had the most ... home runs in a baseball this year I Believe Chris Davis was second\nWell he just went opposite field himself just like Lou ... only his when just above the right field wall where's Luke Roy some run hit just below the rightful will fill a wall ended up being a to earn triple a two run Homer for Chris Davis\nOffset Britain so Britain comes in immediately gives up a couple of runs a I don't think it's necessarily gonna cause the Yankees the game but this is not second guessing there's a first cats in cars car when I talked about this while the Yankees were still up in the bottom of the seven\nI wanted to see Robert to stay in a game or this whole get your raining and get out stuff is ridiculous when you got a guy comes in he retires decide on twelve pitches he's not capable of going out for a second inning [laughter]\nI Know that the Yankees add a couple of days off before the game then I got a day off tomorrow or maybe they just thought Britain needed to work\nI Would have saved them a and actually I was honest about it the reason why it didn't scare me a little bit was I was more scared Chapman\nBecause he's been up ... up and down in uh hasn't always been able to throw strikes so I wanted to have Britain who's already given up two runs diverge runs again Yankee pitcher just given up here in the eighth inning I'm I Want it in my time as a safety net\nWell maybe it's a good thing let him get his couple of runs that he's given up out of the way early ah I think they've got green up in the bullpen just in case of the game and Britain continue struggle did get a a couple of loud cheers so now there's two down um but to in for the ... in the bottom of the eighth\nOr looked like they got a green up in the pen just in case I Believe that bone is going to chat with in the ninth\nOr they they need to get Chapman into that mindset postseason mind set of clothes and a half games get in the final out a win need be we'll see if that is the case uh you've got to walk here from a\nA Mr Britain so the ... are\nTrying to fight back into this one down six to two in the bottom of the top of the eighth inning at Yankee Stadium\nOr do want to make some NFL in this hour because that's how we're going to talk the combination of college football and the NFL when we look at some of the top quarterbacks in college football this year I don't think it's going to be the level of the draft last year when you add Darnell the Mayfield and rose in an Alan and\nFour guys when the top the ten pick some draft that's pretty impressive we do not have that often that's not going to be this ... the case that she or you're not going to have quarterbacks drafted\nAs high but there are legitimate first round talent quarterbacks in this draft Herbert kid from Oregon is probably going to be the first one off the board\nAnd it depends on how badly Eighteen needs a quarterback to topple the draft I think a lot of teams are going to be stopped the draft have already made that commitment\nCardinals going to struggle this year cardinals are not going to win many games kind of like a draft a quarterback\nBecause they got Rosen and they're

how's it going man where you say but\nUm I just want your take on those you're talking about the argument a little bit earlier and looking at ah Alabama's schedule you know the first time too or might have to play a full three quarters of the LSU game um does he have a legit chances are hiding in plain abs of every game I Know we can look at quarterback rating and completion percentage but\nI just don't think it's total numbers are going to back up and go to the ... and a joint effort\nTo legit question um and Ohio State might get a blowout winter to wear Africans or does some setting I\nMari said an unbelievable year and I read a couple of interesting article this week and a it's a little early to be projecting him as an NFL player we're going to talk about quarterbacks\nAt the top of that star as a matter of fact Yogi brought a comfortable and less from the ... network and for me quarterback guru ... he's the guy you don't even have to uh considered ... he's a freshman\nAnd oh by the way it was a top ten major league baseball draft I think it was the I'm\nNinety nine percent Josie aides who took a I H could use them tonight maybe 'cause the Yankees are clean and ... o'clock on nothing there in the top of the night\nWith Chapman on to try and get the last ... with the bombers um and we got years to go with that freshmen winning the Heisman not likely so a\nTechnical always at will ... putting up unbelievable numbers for West Virginia or if they continue their winning ways and then they're heading toward a college football playoff possibility they're\nNot there but they they could get involved if they got red hot ripped off five six seven straight wins he's still in the mix there was a couple\nYou ride a tiger by law gets handicapped by the fact that he doesn't play for folk quarters Alabama always does get up by three four five touchdowns and even the might go so far to say he gets hurt by jailing hurt stick around\nBecause you remember that there was a report that hurts was going to use his ability to stay as a red shirt\nThat he was only going to play for games you'd already played in to to start the season when a report came out and then he played in a blowout game which made no sense to me when I first read the board I said All right this make some sense\nOr they're on the same page\nHe's staying with the team he's not walking away but if they don't need them to play he's not going to play it's going to stick around in case ... gets hurt and then you step in and keep their championship march going but if he doesn't well then he can transfer it to under the air\nLast week he played the next week you play the weekend for that last week he played so he's not played in five games so he's not transferring anywhere he's not using a red shirt going anywhere else\nIf he had done that if they had said listen or he just going to play in games that we desperately need him or if to work to get hurt and or or at\nThe end of the year to get hurt that's not been the way they decided to handle it so when you've got to go to it's not you're not going to blink when you pull a guy like tiger below out of the game when you're already up by three four touchdown so you're right it does handicap his chance\nAnd uh but I think the eyes when Trump is still very much up for grabs we don't always to declare a winner the first couple of days of October is crazy anyway\nUm give me give me the next four weeks to look at them we'll get to November and then we'll get a much clearer picture of where the guys are right statistically uh there's

steely award from him but he did get the lead early in a nice job holding it all year long\nYou're in a Mac weren't gonna bones here on CBS Sports radio eight five five to one to four to seven weeks at five in the national football league coming up um\nIf you want to talk about any of the games we can achieve shouldn't jaguars is a pretty big showdown is already some trash talking going on there between tie retail and a genuine Ramsey I'll give you the details by that uh baseball's stop Yankees are in the top of the night we know the Rockies have already advance cubs around\nWhat apparently John Madden is not going to be ... sticking around we shall see a ... could be out too and uh somebody needs to get a hold of Billy Bean and see appeal reprise says well you know the play offs or a crap shoot line from years ago a Billy Billy liked to take take credit shooting took credit all the way to a movie\nAs a matter of fact and got Brad Pitt the play and ah he he loves to get credit when the AIDS with a small budget to find a way to get into the postseason\nBut when they don't win and oppose it won't just a cramped you you you can't apply money ball to the procedure that you didn't add suggest a crap shoot yeah crap that's what's happening tonight to the ice down seven nothing to the Yankee seven to ... gives me\nTo end it so well the Yankees are moving on I was ready for the little man tearing down at the Yankee fans and this is not\nPoking specifically at Yankee fans because of all for them to like this\nWhen you have the kind of sees him at the Yankees hat and went under games um and if you were eliminated after one game you're going to say now wait a minute distinct\nWhy did we have to play a one game do or die playoff game when we won a hundred games and other teams going to be still playing it ended up one no nowhere near hundred games like the Cleveland Indians who won I think it was Ninety One\nThey still won the central going away because the central was the worst division in baseball this year but they didn't come close to winning his right against the Yankees have guaranteed to be playing a in this next round the Yankees had to win their way in the next round hey those are the rules you know what they are when the season starts\nThey put an emphasis on winning divisions and the Yankees didn't win the division advantage I gained\nBack to the red Sox so you got ... playoff game now that they have not on equal footing Astros\nIndians Yankees Red Sox on equal footing movement to best three or five series Red Sox advantage because they got game five in their house if they needed actors advantage over the unions 'cause they get game five in their house if they needed\nA but we're through the wild card rounds Rockies moving on sorry cubs fans not going to be another celebratory parade in Chicago this year or so you got Dodgers Braves starting tomorrow and he got the Rockies going to Milwaukee to take on the brewers\nAnd same thing brewers finished with the most wins in the national league actually tied for the most wins in the ... and there are seasons over\nBut really you're talking about the Yankee fans and they they could have complained tonight and I would have told them stop it at any company that wants to complain oh I'll really tell you to stop it\nYou had to game\nAfter Sunday boat in your house at Wrigley Field\nAll you have to do is when one of those two games you when the first one you were in the next round or ... you wouldn't have taken one you're in the next round of the playoffs\nYou got to run in to plus gained like what Thirteen any ... twenty two weddings they got to run in twenty two weddings\nThe cubs have no one to blame yeah I Know you tied for the most wins over the one on just a regular season but the playoffs are short term and you left it open for the ... you don't have one shot ear Yangon like one game to advance they got the job done tonight by beating the ... the cubs had to\nThey first had the chance to win their division and die break the game\nThen they had the chance to win the wild card game\nAh so no no Chicago um the broadcast outlets TBS got the national league this year I think so\nOr a TV and two oh that's right they were young drunk tonight on PBS on TBS is is happy with this result or not the da's fans aren't\nA good team they had a dynamite season and kudos to them for the season that they had but they're in the same market as the giants\nAnd they are or not the bigger draw the giants of the biggest bigger draw their uh and any time you get your hands on the New York market you take it when you're broadcasting postseason action and Yankees Red Sox is one of the great rivals in his role sports\nNot he's not just a baseball so uh TBS gets a little bit of a break with the Yankees winning the game\nTonight hit me up to vote lines wide open you to board now eight five five to one to four to seven like John ... said he did John you're on CBS Sports radio\nJody I appreciate it a a great job fell enforced guide and I I'm\nReal quick on the cubs fan of course the lamenting the fact that they lost but you nailed it at a hundred and sixty two games to win the division and then they had you know two games on their on their home field to keep going and I love the wild card I Love the one game playoff even though you know it worked out and not the cubs favor so I'm not my favorite this particular year but\nUm when you're division if you want to if you want to go in right don't leave it up to one game playoff so that that's not what I call it but you hit on that and the and you just absolutely you absolutely nailed it\nAnd let me add one more point to then I'll let you get to your main point um and and give the cubs credited lease because we had a couple of teams one that I watch a lot because I Do shows down there in Philadelphia who just folded\nThe Phillies were in first place in August they folded and the brains went by them like they're standing still the cubs didn't fold the brewers advanced played well and caught them and finished in a tie so it wasn't like the cubs choked the division away\nThey just got beat by better team the brewers beat him caught them and then beat them into one game playoff and they are in the division\nAbsolutely absolutely so ah going back and talk to you were talking about last segment of one I just one small\nCrashing either Murray is actually a red shirt junior or do you remember ha a transfer that his ears writes your ear and then backed up may feel last year um but just going back to the Heisman itself I my first memory of the Heisman Trophy was ...\nUm and I remember people before him and I remember the name and and ... than a narrow Campbell come to mind just being being down in this part of the of the world um\nBut somewhere along the way the Heisman Trophy it used to be I remember it being a we play the games that end of the year we pick the best player and he wins the eyes but\nSomewhere along the way mid nineties it morphed into a you know you start talking about the Iceman early and then somewhere along the way you know eight and twelve years ago it started in a thing where you talk about the eyes and preseason and his pre season has been a watch list and I just wanted to know what\n... who who started that was that ESPN was that the Heisman foundation\nYeah down on them because there's so many there's so many sports channels I have to have something to talk about Iraq because it\nYou know it it just now it's it's they're already projecting Heisman watches for next year and you know we're four games end of the season this year just doesn't make any sense and\nAnd I'm a I'm a big college football fan and I love the eyes men but you know trying to annoy the Heisman Trophy or or ah found the Heisman Trophy winner for games and it's just it's just silly and then somewhere along the way\nThe you had to have a higher than moment when the height and then you could just have a stellar season and put up numbers and when and and do whatever you had to have a heightened moment I just wondered if you remember in your time covering sport\nYes kind of when that shifted in what happened and if there was something else behind\nI give you my thoughts on it number one um it was a media creation thing\nAnd I don't want to give ESPN credit or a critique ESPN\nThey they're they're the biggest a dog on the block and have been for a long time um but I don't I Can't tell you exactly the year the individual the person who said hey why don't we start hide hyping eyes have been so far in advance\nI I don't know who that was a and I don't want to choose anybody without knowing for sure but I can absolutely tell you I Believe\nIt was a media German one like college football a deeds got together and said listen I I've been trying for you is a big part of what we do in a big day for us said we need to be more proactive and aggressive as I don't believe that's the case now\nIndividual universities who have players who they believe are sitting on a potential Heisman season will I'd done before the year starts\nSo I'm not giving a university they complete and utter pass because yeah I've seen and I mentioned that and here where CBS Sports radio is located in New York City not a big college football a groundswell\nThere is no major college football program in New York Rutgers is over in Jersey and they\nKind of work there and talk their way into the big band and the Big Ten for its network wanted a a New York metropolitan area a\nTeam in their league Sunday eventually decided black renters in and oh by the way Rutgers has not been competitive in either football or basketball since I Am trying to make ten um but they get a big check because they got their OWN Network and they get big ball ... and the light\nA and all the universities are getting a cut of tape from Rutgers financially but if you like going to watch your a hometown college team when you're out motto go when you ended up winning all have a lot of games these days Rikers\n[noise] um but there really isn't a a major college football program here in the New York metropolitan area doesn't matter you got Heisman Trophy a pro mowing banners on ... in times square\nIt is that being gay a topic in times square against that kind of advertising and if people want to get a message out and get a brand stamped they're going to do it in places where a ton of people going to be able to say it while Einstein square\nEven though there is in ... not a hometown bang they're not going to be a New York city player is going to be on that a banner in times square\nAnd I've seen them for twenty twenty five years or they're pumping the Heisman Trophy in August the Heisman Trophy candidate when I walked through Times Square or so or universities don't get a free pass it isn't like they don't promote their players they do\nBut who got the ball rolling

nice old mix of a baseball mostly baseball the first couple of hours or below football as well and we even touched on the Heisman Trophy I won't get a little bit more specific\nBecause we've been doing a lot on the rookie quarterback and the fact that all for taking in the top ten or in last year's draft are now starting to their teams with mixed success and tough times a week before you know we can start to talk about who's next group\nComing in and last year last couple of years I've tapped into our next guest when it comes to talking a couch quarterbacks\nForm of college football wide receiver former college football coach now analyst for the ... wild and has been part of the elite eleven camp for the bats young quarterbacks in the country the last several seasons a Yogi ... joined us here on CBS Sports radio I Yogi\nI'm doing well are you\nHow you been I appreciate your coming on board I got a question for you specifically about um\nUh your guy same Donald cause I your your USC got used to coach wore a be careful out there and did a phenomenal job are you guys did winning championships and last year I Love doing every I ask you about ... because I thought you'd give me the U.S ... and you never did\nDespite the fact that he had ties to the university I always thought you shot very straight with me uh and he is a open my eyes as the starting quarterback of the jet so far uh and thank you again for that what is the thing that has either impressed you most\nEnd or disappointed you most with Donald in his first war game something you didn't know that he was going to be that good that fast\nOr something you don't he's going to be that good that ... that are always going through growing pains\nYeah well you know I don't watch every snapped you because you know I mean college season but whenever I catch you know a couple of drives or quarter after a game of of course I have and I think the biggest thing is\nYou know of course it burst out of the scene I mean you couldn't ask for like a better script to kick off your career on Monday Night football gets alliance ... come on back and and ball out but I think for them um he's never flinched\nYour career on Monday Night football games alliance fix fix and come back and and ball out but I think for them or he's never flinched\nYou know and I think a lot of times it I think if we if we took a step back regardless of the first game and said okay what what's this team you know 'cause it's probably gonna be a little bit of a rebuild you know there's a reason that it's such a high pick 'em there aren't a lot of players that are household names just yet\nAt least on that off the side of the football so we knew was going to take a little time\nAnd I think we all knew that it was a rookie the challenge was was on satellite and bald out like you didn't leak water like okay you're going to the pro ball for a year and the jets you have to feed it during the day with your recall a clear that hasn't happened with a in a lawsuit last couple of weeks but I I really think I'm\nSamaras is one of the most impressive young men who have been around his ... ability to process information they call it chunk information we can look at one thing and that triggers the entire public coming together as a quarterback\nHe does that with the use of his work ethic is as good as I've ever been around his teammates love them and he gets what it means to show up and compete every day you know he was never\nA shrinking guy he's always you know found elements of consistency broke through to the next level of consistency and I think that's what you're going to see with him throughout his career and specifically his rookie season\nOr gas or you'll be brought from the pack twelve network here with us on CBS Sports radio I let me ask you a ... as you mentioned you're in college ... mode right now and when you get the chance to catch as much NFL acting specifically guys like family you know when you add it all the Lebanon ah games great information on land here\nHere's the one issue I've had with them and I'm jak guy so I've seen every snappy spanking new year I'm\nA he's been everything that you just described but you're not friends on line isn't very good and you mentioned there's a reason why the jets were able to get them they were a number three and I got that by earning it with the shaky record the bad last year in our ... in the process of building the pieces around Sam\nThe offensive line hasn't been good he is so\nGood at making plays out at a pocket that he can move either left or right and I wanted to run into with accuracy and do the right guy and avoid sex and the like\nThe last couple of weeks I think he's gotten little Lansing the pocket and they were dreaming Warren because again I've been line isn't great but they were a couple of plays said\nI think that the puck was still there and he was nervous and got out before he needed to Henri drew going backwards rather than an attempted to step into a throw and throw away a laser coming out of there\nI don't remember that from USC days that he was I knew that he could make plays with his legs and it was that planet can make plays all over the field but I never in watching them play did I think he was skittish he's skittish the last couple of weeks for me I have you noticed that was that every part of his game before my just making this up\nFair enough or keep an eye on them because I think he's actually going to be able to play themselves in the draft he's only junior a and he's going to have to continue in uh but I wouldn't be surprised if he and make themselves so we shall see um who's the best seem in a packed well\nOh I think Washington is right now you know I think they're a little bit a cut above everybody else in terms of consistency\nOr you could away they've played you know even in the Auburn game that every chance to win it kind of hurts themselves I don't think it hurts and hurt them on the national scale at all so if they did last week in number twenty team or something like that it would be why you and you know get you they'll face off against Oregon will be\nIf he leaves early I mean just never will be the first quarter back taken off the board\nSo that'll be fun to watch those too because we saw with Donald is remember what he did two years ago I'm against Washington or now that gets to be almost three years ago uh you know one player can can have such an impact in any has that he's got the ability to kind of break your heart at the quarterbacks about so I say you dad right now\nI wouldn't be shocked at Stanford they get through this weekend and get to a buy a week [noise] um and then get healthy on the office of liner priceless if they ran the table um and obviously them and you'd have a critical match up later on in the seasons um and then in the south I think is the has a chance to win them all the finished season coming off of by this week\nUm where they got to clean things up like penalties last week was Eighteen of 'em and and there's only a with a\nWith a freshmen ha rookie quarterback as well so they've had to go through those growing pains in the month of September of what I say you have is a is a notch above and then\nStanford Oregon I mean heck Colorado them Jeter right now um and they don't get a a title of but they haven't really played anybody's or a partial one is sixteen but they probably probably the most consistent and if anybody in the south so it it's wide open in southern division or in the north had said\nOn the game

return which is Monday of next week\nOr speaking of picks I'm not going to make ... night I'll probably put a couple of picked out there tomorrow the only way uh I Would give you pick tonight was if I felt strongly about the Thursday night match up\nWhich has the patriots hosting Indianapolis\nAnd uh watch the entire culture eagles game because I Do shows in New York and Philly I'm here on CBS Sports radio on the weekend so I'm watching uh we got banks of monitors everywhere so I get a chance to watch a little bit of every single game\nUm but I ... a record the eagles the jets and the giants every single week and I go back in a a watch their games or in completion\nAnd coach went in and get beagles are time two weeks ago in fairly\nUm the eagles defense it's amazing eagles defense is much better at home than it is on the road\nI've been watching the national football league for shoot up on fifty years\nAnd there have been a whole bunch of teams that have been much better\nOff than similarly at home than they are on the road\nYou don't usually see as big a disparity in defense legal defense plays well don't and Indianapolis moved the ball against him shoot they added a Andrew Luck was inside the I don't know if it was a pen or inside certainly inside the ... he was in a red zone might have been the twelve or Thirteen yard line I'm\nA widow under two minutes to go down for points\nOr so they could have stuck in the end zone there the eagles came up with a a big sack\nA brand and Graham May kind of a oh no it was a wasn't Graham someone else got sick I don't even remember was\nBut it was a a shoestring a sack just kinda got 'em by the end of his cleats as he was sprinting out of the pocket and was able to trip him up and knock them down um Colts are a ... a blow average team\nBut they're not terrible either\nI expect them to go in and be competitive against the New England I don't think that when but I think that'd be competitive tendency is too much for me to ...\nOr so I'm not going to touch that game we got a good sweat a good scanned the good slate of games coming up this weekend I'll run down some of them for a year you want to talk about your team your match up this weekend get on board my telephone line stay up all cleared out here sometimes we get a little busy and a twelve o'clock hour not so much yet tonight get aboard\nA five five to one to four to seven um\nJacksonville Kansas City might be the best game of the week and it's a early one on CBS\nA you know we can't see it coming back from a behind and beating down to reopen the night in Denver um homes was great in the second half not I'm not great in the first day I Would make huge place in the second half and that's an accomplishment\nThird or fourth game as a starter and the national football league against a pretty good defense a Denver defense was not sane defensive won the super bowl a couple of years ago but still preached out deep and for him to rally his troops and and get a win and stay undefeated or was impressive\nBy Mr my home's not put them in the class of some of the all time great says some of my fellow media members ab but I too was impressed with the way did he played a Jacksonville does at one of the better ... city so does it two weeks in a row mom's going up against a one of the better defenses will trash talking I saw it\nUnder the better defense now to get city so does it\nTwo weeks in a row mom's going up against a one of the better defenses little trash talking I saw today a firm Ty retail\nOn facing off against J Lynne Ramsay um hills a quote was uh on Ramsey he thinks very highly of themselves\nOr but he also said he's the best right now in back to the best do the best challenged the best and take on the ... and he thinks he's going to have a big game against a Mr Ramsey and the jags in Jacksonville jak defense on Sunday we shall see that's one of the more intriguing matchups Kansas City a ... point favorite at all\nThat's only home field advantage so uh Vegas is saying they think these two teams are about even intensity is undefeated at this time or I Would lean ten cities way but I'm not on record on that one yet\nTennessee goes north to buffalo\nA bills come back down to Earth Day after day are upset win over Minnesota a couple of weeks ago Tennessee got a very useful win against the eagles this past week or more can marry you ought to convert and a couple of big a third and fourth downs in that game late to get tendency to win in late includes in overtime\nA giants in Carolina\n[noise] I Do shows in New York Giants fans are all up in arms because they are one and three\nI don't quite get it I didn't think the giants are going to be great for the season started I Know there were an Eighteen if things broke their way maybe they were nine and seven\nThey want in three they got a good when in Houston but that one when they got beat by the saints they weren't under dog and I gained a beat in Dallas they went on to dog an act game used again the big one they were as a matter of fact their biggest underdog I did six point on the dog in that one\nThey've been an underdog in all three of their games fall for the games and I wanted\nThree or the surprisingly shock\nFrom some giant fans I don't quite get 'em but they're getting seven points than a Carolina and then came to a good start a Caroline is pretty good football team the sandman might be impacting enough for me to take another shot on the giants\nThis week a jets are home favorite ouch I'd love to tell you I ... back the jets\nThe first three weeks of the season I wisely stayed away from the ... this week I didn't think that would go down in Jacksonville and winning and if and if I had to pick that game I Would have taken the jags I Would have laid the points that would have been a winner um I don't know if I could make the jets a favorite\nThis week against Denver I think that's a bit much a land of Pittsburgh Steelers a three point favorite at home and land has been a disappointment Pittsburgh has been a been a disappointment somebody's coming out of there with\nA loss of Atlanta falls to one in four or Pittsburgh goes to one three in one and these were teams have both had Super Bowl aspirations coming to the season that's not good somebody somebody's walking out of that game on Sunday really looking themselves in the mirror\nHelp me up on the phone they buy buy two one two for CBS\nA duck to leave mine in Cleveland's on CBS Sports radio ally yeah\nThese are good luck to you my pleasure\nBut looking forward to this for years ever really got the chance of getting into the night\nIf they're so you know I I Know most of the country obviously has heard about the brown bars are not coming off drafting or so for all and I don't know how many people are really on notice I Know the record isn't very good at\nOn June one but they hide and we want their mid ... goal ... to ... thing in the go away from winning that game\nThey're getting a field goal way and then they ask you why you know in three and then last week the game was going out from under us we feel like in the city or a river\nAt the end of the game that almost anyone that thought across the country hope that it shouldn't be reversed the biggest thing to me\nAnd this is why I Want to put the country I notice this isn't just say more about the team that was up in in the last game and went back down fourteen and I came back up me can you come back to lay down and take I wanted to get your thoughts on\nMy ah certainly agree with you\nI'm about a ... they got squeezed by the referees I thought that spot overturn was ridiculously other day\nUm you're right they could have won they surely could have won the first game was ... he doesn't get any closer than a tie a second gave me right missed field goals absolutely hurt you and you could have won the Oakland game\nBut you also could last the ...\nUh get you down and what was Thirteen not than seventeenth right whatever it was any rally to win that game [noise] um so all the browns games have hung in the balance they are one two in one you make the argument hey they can be foreign out you know to make the argument they could be on for\nSo then they they record is what it is in there about that level of team\nNow you got to start to take some of these games where the call goes you gangs do um the the bouncing ball goes against do you feel go kick has got to make the big field goal rather miss the big ... like you did against New Orleans and got a chance to be five hundred a team from Iran out\nAnd that would be a pretty good season or improving from a no win team to a six or seven when theme that'd be a damn good season for\n... from Pittsburgh up on CBS Sports radio what do you say oh\nWell thank you for taking a call a long time listener first time caller\nYou God what's on your mind and I\nWell you know in your

Yankees\nWell that's exactly what to believe they made a pretty poor decision by sending them to AAA right away [laughter] um I think um I think they know it was a head scratcher for a couple of reasons because essentially all they did was replaced Tyler often\nWho was the other you know he was right handed hitter with power or who could play first base little outfield what couldn't even put

up after this year and all I say only about there for a million dollars apart levy on making a little more would there would they consider a trade with Clay Masters for ... think\nWow not thought the thought about that at all I'm\n\nPackers could usually for damn sure but can a package of forward to give up quite Matthews and I know he's had a couple of outrageously bad roughing the pastor calls against them I'm not going to hold that against him a and the steel and defense has been pretty weak\nAnd I\nI think that's at least worth of conversation I don't know what happened and it all comes down to what it what will they be undue um he's got to not only say I'll report ASAP I'm but I'm going to be happy about being trade the Green Bay because if your Green Bay you're not giving up quite Matthews for a guy who's just going to come in\nAnd not be the type of player that ah he was when he was with Pittsburgh so anybody rates will they be on bells rolling the dice low but you don't do it without a conversation directly with the player at a time but that's that's not an outrageous exchange\nHe's a great receiving running back and then I mean we're due erasures thrown in the bar that would be a good selling point for a couple of years at least\nI I think your your Rogers could get on to the same page pretty darned quickly\nAll right thank you very much\nAnd the guy ah whenever you

root for the Yankees I may have told you this story before probably not going to ... maybe we can show you're on CBS Sports radio I grew up in New York um New York and my whole life ah as a kid um\nMy father started with the Mets in Nineteen sixty two year my birth\nSo I didn't really have a choice I probably would have picked the Mets anyway um but I was about ... from my entire childhood leading up all the way through high school and college and when your kid here in New York you have to pick sides\nYou have to be either I met fan or a Yankee fan I ... I just don't believe a young boy or girl who says there are met an Yankee fan of the same time you don't you choose sides it's one of those things you got to be either or it's not one of those gray areas it's black and white you gotta pick sides\nAnd then you get out of your adolescence and the like you get a little older\nIf you're still going out to the bars at night and I'm not just talking about only on Saturday Night but one time during the week on friday and Saturday Night you're still going out with the boy sang with the boys\nYou still stay on the team that you grew up rooting for you to you don't transfer or so I was a Mets fan forever and I voted against the New York Yankees because that's what you did\nWhen you get to be a little older and yours truly now the first numbers of five and you're not at the bar every week and you're not going down to the school yard to play hoops and screaming and yelling and debate with your boys you're gonna for both New York teams\nEven root for both the Mets and Yankees the jets and the giants the rangers and the islanders the nicks and the nets\nAnd the next ... that's a whole nother ball game because you could be a fan or even when you were a kid I was because the mess we're in da da and you're going to have an NBA team and an NBA team so I actually rooted for both teams [noise] um so it depends on I think\nYou're in a lot in life where you're at as far as age goes if you're going to root for both teams so I absolutely sat here and root for rooted for the Yankees tonight so a Carver and I were on uh the best of terms\nYou're we're not going to be for this next series because ah as I mentioned my father started in baseball the Mets in Nineteen sixty two he's still working at age eighty nine is a scout for the Boston Red Sox\nA spring training and uh the Florida State ladies' aid sunshine state her and are still working these days for the talks\nSo he's going for his six World Series wearing this year\nSix nine Mets eighty two cardinals\nAnd three Red Sox rings this millennium\nSo this would be ah the first one for the right hand if he puts all those rings on his left and the start 'cause that that the south park or so at this stage yes I become a Joe McDonalds fan\nWant a city oh man and a little bit more jewelry so sorry Carver kid the Yankees the going down and they're going down hard and so I think it's going to be a real competitive series I don't think the the rats aren't going to sweep 'em and three games it's going to go forward will probably go five ah and then gained five will be great\nBecause now you're back to where we are right now which is one and done that's why I like the two wild card guy was acting when they asked me to fill in for al as we said oh it's all good and bad\n'cause I like being here and hanging around with other guys I got a great man cave in my house and a huge flat screen TV and the like um but it's me by myself and my daughter is home then she'll come down and watch baseball what may cause she worked for the I'm going to be network\nMost times her schedule includes are working at nights so she's not all of our home by myself not work and it's it's relaxing it's great but you also enjoy watching the game with somebody else and getting at doing debating it and and Tibet thing about it\nWell when you're on the air you can't do that so your your your attention is divided so yes the cubs and the Rockies went till the wee hours of the morning was on almost the entire show last night and\nOh by the way I got to watch the first two hours 'cause it's Joe hadn't started yet but it just kept going and going and going and going but I appreciate the fact that I was here and go to hang with other guys watching baseball in the like for the cubs Rockies yesterday and then again with the Yankees Red Sox tonight so I was happy for it um yeah\nCar is going to be glad that I'm not going to be doing the show next week or cause Yankees Red Sox could give him a little ... faced\nA and I got to figure out my schedule and we're I'm going to be when those two teams meet its great series and the great rivalry always has been I think the red Sox won the season series this year ten nine Nineteen games Red Sox won ten\nOr so it was closed between these two teams all season long the red Sox didn't need the last couple of games a Yankees really did need Saturday or Sunday they locked up home field advantage on friday night anyway so the last two they split was one one Yankee one Red Sox won one didn't really matter for either of those two\nIf there is a game five next Thursday night\nI Will be in Cape Cod at my annual golf trip up there that I Do every year the weekend after Columbus Day\nWe've been doing it my family for you know

we came into the studio and I got an appropriate reactions so I thought I Would share it with\nYou because I don't know if I Believe it or I don't believe it or\nIf it makes it even more nervous about driving CBS News did a poll\nOr if it makes it even more nervous about driving CBS News did a poll\nIn which they asked people about using their devices wall they're behind the wheel\nAnd\nMore than

moving I've never put it in Dr ... but I've thought about it\nI wouldn't miss it I don't I shouldn't be even thinking about my phone while I'm driving\nHowever I put together a list of potential topics because I Want to be prepared I've done some research\nBut I thought it would be fun to put the question now to you what would you ask an NFL referee if you could he just retired over the summer from the NFL and this is the guy who does both Big Ten hoops as well as the NFL why would you ask\nAn NFL referee if you could but here's the ... has to be respectful and it has to be non idiotic please I'm not I'm not going to be no way\nI did that wrong only respectful and non idiotic questions who teaches [laughter] so yeah I mean I'm not going to ask you about specific place I don't have that kind of time with him it's not like he's going to spend the entire show with us so I wanted to be something that appeals to the whole country not just a particular fan base\nAnd so yeah this is going to be interesting I've only ever interviewed one NFL official in my life and it was Sarah Thomas who had just finished up her first year the NFL's only female official she was amazing I spoke to her at the super bowl in Houston I Believe it was and she was awesome\nBut it was a lot of the interview that was focused on being a female and the fact that she was the only one and how that was accepted inside football with gene it's going to be about rules it's going to be about uh the life of a of a referee and and uh some of the some of the issues that drive us crazy as fans to be short\nSo if you could ask genes territorial one question what would it be you can find me on Twitter a law radio or on our Facebook page after hours with Amy Lawrence at our phone number

for that question that I can pose to genes territory he's now with CBS which make them accessible to us and this is not a new thing\nEven before Chris joined the shell I had been working with our previous producer Tom to try to get an official on the show because there are so many questions that we can ask and so many different directions that we can go and I appreciate that you're posing questions that I hadn't thought of that some of the most serious ... not so serious\nUm but there are a lot of\nA lot of things that we don't understand about the position about being an NFL referee because we don't have that big Ole rulebook memorize but I think there are some things that these guys don't necessarily understand either and you you know that there is a\nBit of a transition an integration if you will with the new helmet rule we actually haven't seen that apply much ... we've seen unnecessary roughness we hadn't seen guys kicked out\nFor agree just hit but that's not under the new helmet rule we've just seen guys kicked out because that's now the deal you can be throw it out for one personal foul it doesn't have to be to anymore it's a judgment call and I'm interested to hear what he has to say about judgment calls and about\nReferees and officials being called on to make a judgment you make a ruling in the heat of the moment\nAnd how then sometimes you're undermined by replay that's also I think a really interesting facet of the game in two thousand Eighteen is that an official can be out there doing\nThe best the best job that he knows how to do and the numbers show that officials make the right call Ninety five percent of the time on average\n\nYou wouldn't know it by the way people rant and rave but Ninety five percent of the time they get these calls right\nIt's just that way the replay and with instant replay and with every angle known to man on a TV camera\nThe ones that aren't made correctly or that are overturned on replay and we've had some high profile calls overturned on replay even recently think about the the first down review in\nThe browns raiders game just last weekend\nThose get magnified because we can't because we see\nOver but the majority of the time these guys are spot on and we don't even know half of what goes into it I remember that Sarah Thomas told me at the super bowl\nAbout the different the different ways that they are expected to prepare for a game and uh that they\nShe already felt like not that it was a fulltime job but it did require a lot of hours away from work and for the call for full time NFL officials\nLike what else can you ask them to do they're already doing the preparation and doing the film and ah you know reading and watching the videos that to the NFL requires them to do they have to know that the book coal they have to practice\nAnd so yeah it's uh it definitely is a a a position that or a job that's unknown to most of us except that fans still act like they know\nIt's a really complicated job\nBut as far as we tend to simplify and oversimplify and then to uh to just poor on those officials that don't get a cold right here and there\nWas after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio what would you ask an NFL referee if you could on Twitter Ala radio on Facebook to\nI don't know that genes territory has the same side guns as at hockey league who's

Conn before that and he's so smart I don't know if you've ever seen him on TV or if you follow him on social media he puts out many films sessions\nA from a quarterback perspective and he is as good as say a Tony rollout at making\nThe quarterbacks progression and his decision making 'em and his plan all of that uh he makes it so plain and understandable for average Joe and Judy and so I learned a lot when I watch his videos\nBut he's become a friend of mine to we just met last year and we cannot have\nHim on the show any more because he now works for a competing network but I'm so proud of him and I'm so happy for him because he's doing what he loves it it's a second career for him now and he's worked really hard\nSo why I mentioned the genes territory interview to him and he said that he happened to be part of a seminar which dean was a speaker\nAnd that that gene was really really eye opening and made me look at rest differently in a good way and they finished with gene is a very bright dude [laughter]\nAnd then you've got to remember Derek Anderson was a was which was the Oregon quarterback and then he ... that he was in the NFL obviously but dared sent sent me a tweet actually in response to something I put on a social media about genes territory and I was kind\nBecause not only had I not thought about ... percent a really long time uh Oregon said thank you but I wasn't expecting him to see my tweet I didn't even know he was on social media and he writes back about genes territory he's an old timer always enjoyed playing games when he was on the field\nI mean that's high praise I think um so that's from inside the football fraternity ... quarterbacks\nThat were to win genes territory and and now in dance case has heard him speak that so I'm excited to talk to gene he's now part of the CBS family though it's relatively new for him about everything I hear about him as a nice personable he's likable\nHe's also a guy who can help you to understand what goes into these calls that we criticize up one side and down another\nAnd so most of your questions for genes territory has been extremely respectable [laughter]\nI like that to some of you want to know about calls that he regrets or or you know what happens when you make a mistake it maybe I'll bring that up with him but I prefer to stay positive if you know me you know that I I like to\nTo get our guests telling stories if at all possible and I've heard that gene is a great storyteller so I Will be asking about the index card because the story itself with the index card I've heard it more than once\nA day and brought it up to like make sure you asking about the the index card because your listeners will all want to hear about the story and why the index card came out in the game between Dallas in Oakland last year it's after hours with Amy Lawrence here on CBS Sports radio\nMatt said on Twitter a law radio please ask a gene what was the most exciting NFL game he's ever raft\nAnd maybe ask him who's the most friendly or polite NFL head coach he's ever dealt with\nThat's an interesting one but also there was another tweet that I saw before that\nBut I it's a complete other side of that which is what's the funniest thing and the coach or a player's ever said to you and the heat of the moment and got really mad I thought I Wonder how many times genes have been spit on ... not not on purpose not like a guy like you know\nAnd like spending on um I actually can't but it's I don't know if it's a girl thing or are we just made me thing or maybe it's a family thing but I Can't do it\nI Try I can do the whole like [noise] thing I Know that's really gross but then I nothing comes out so you know don't have to worry about it with me but I've often wondered if Wendy's coaches

Thursday morning for many of you mad as much as the weeks feels like a ... because there's so much that has to be accomplished it also ... live by a thank you to those of you who read my latest football column and responded I appreciate that\nI Know a lot of you have\nVery strong opinions about the way that the NFL is going and the path that it's taking and it's true\nI mean that the garde passing numbers and the records that have already fallen and the way that two thousand Eighteen could almost take on this major league baseball type quality when it comes to the number of home run records that had been smashed in the last two years\nAnd the fact that we got fewer balls in play than we ever had a major league baseball there are more strike out so they're shattering strike out records and home run records and it's weird it's this trend in baseball that a lot of people are disturbed by including\nThose in the commissioner's office in the end though is that\nUm you know that are in charge of the game that are responsible for the health of the game well in football\nI don't know that anybody is concerned about the health of the game so to speak I'm and I'm referring to to the commissioner's office and the owners because\nFans like a lot of points you may or may not have realized that ratings are trending up again\nNow they're just starting to see than they were about ... they were not dropping anymore and now they're taking upward a it's because we're getting these amazing finishes and we're getting all this high flying death defying action and here's something else when you have\nTeams like what we have in the NFL where when I say a dozen quarterbacks\nHave already know it's more than that it's like half the quarterbacks have already passed for a thousand yards I forgive me for not remember the exact number even though I wrote the column you don't watch it depends on the top of my Twitter page so open it up right now after hours with Amy Lawrence it's pinned to the top of my Facebook page to\nThat but you can find that on Twitter a law radio\nSo half the starters in the NFL have already thrown for a thousand yards which means what passing numbers pass\nWhen\nA opponent is off by fourteen point to the game or a team is down by fourteen points in the fourth quarter it's nothing because you could make up that kind of a deficit so quickly when you have a viable passing game\nYeah so it's it's crazy the potential\nIf you extrapolate these numbers and project them over a course of a full season\nGranted guys are going to get hurt they're going to be passing games that that slow down or the drop off the map the weather obviously affects the passing game and a lot of places but let's face it they're also a bunch of dome stadiums are stadiums that are in warm weather climate\nSo it I mean we're going to track these and and these will be shorted over the course of the full year this could be a record setting season and in many cases however\nThis was my tease it is ... it's not the passing that most division leaders have in common so we want to check that out you can do it and people always ask me what do I think about this ... what do I think about that team well in the column at the end\nAs I'm kind of value waiting for the season I pinball all over the NFL and and hit almost every single team with just a one liner\nBut it was fun I enjoyed writing like that it was about all that my brain could manage at that point because I did all the research and put all the numbers together and my brain was so tired so at the end I wanted to\nI wanted to hit on some of the other top storylines and the first month and I realized it was it was cool it's cool to just jump around the league and go AFC it at a sea and uh share one quick thought on each team so you can check that out again it's on our social media\nPinned to the top of both my Twitter page and our Facebook page our phone number is eight five five to one to four

you should take the Indianapolis Colts seriously\nWhere we can all go click right we're going to need it airs team is very close and all three of office are there and the fourth quarter to those who are dangerous thing and I got a good quarter record okay and you know young people there are some things have challenges\nYou should listen a Tom Brady they've got a young defense they'd been ahead in the fourth quarter of all of their games and we're going to take them seriously and of course that's\nComing off a short workweek too and\nBrady actually compared it to its essentially our Thursday Afternoon in terms of preparation I haven't at it as he was talking about having a bump everything up\nUp by a couple of days until you're scrunch sing it altogether it's less about the the physical preparation is more about giving your body as much of a rest as they possibly can but then mentally having a dive right into the game prepping film session and walk through and all that\nSpecific to your opponent\nAd for Andrew Luck well\nHe's healthy again and his soldier alter ego is killing it on Twitter but they've not\nA lot of success against the New England patriots since last guy to Indianapolis\nCertainly my experience was caught up on the shorter and uh and you know that's that's not fun of it I I you know in an officer we'd like to put like to turn that around with like with like the the the fourth of soy a in a sense thrown up I'm going to solve some of those great Danes are certainly that\nWhen we were as the championship game here ah and so yeah I I think I Do have an appreciation for\nColds and patriots rivalry it's not as competitive of course as it was say in the days of Peyton Manning and died Tom Brady younger Tom Brady [laughter]\nBut the manning played the patriots Thirteen times when he was still with Indianapolis\nHe won five of those gains including the two thousand sex AFC Championship game whereas Brady than be manning twice in the playoffs in over three and four but these are not Peyton Manning's Colts of course I Andrew Luck drafted number one overall in two thousand twelve\nHe missed all of last year though I think if you watch him play right now you can tell he's into a groove\nHe's back to being the same Andrew Luck or that could dominate again that could take over again with the athleticism I with the approach he's got it you know he's got a great mind that process as quickly and we've seen that since the beginning but other than Andrew Luck\nThis team only had six players left since the patriots and cold lasts competed in two thousand Fifteen so not the same scenario the calls are now trying to get back to the point at which they are a contender\nIn dealt with Andrew Luck injuries that was the last couple of years and also I think some poor decisions by their front office\nTo continue loading up with all sorts of guys and and to not take into account what was happening on the defensive side of the ball plus\nThey made it coaching change and Frank Reich is now the new head coach of the interesting twist to this would've been the teen adjustment Daniels has taken over but he decided he wanted to stay in New England

the agency's interest so much though that they've launched another investigation this time into the Trump family does the\nSpokesperson for the agency is vigorously pursuing all appropriate areas of investigation\nThe investigative story and the time documented to have the president's father Fred Trump transferred millions of dollars from his real estate empire to his children without\nPaying taxes on it reporters examined over one hundred thousand documents before concluding that Donald Trump received today's equivalent of four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father Mr Trump always claimed that he never got more than a one million dollar loan from his dad\nThe president called the New York times piece a hit job Trump lawyer Charles Harder denied allegations of fraud and tax evasion he claimed in New York Times article was extremely inaccurate [noise] the captain about New York\nNineteen to Jim ... says this new times ... port could be a taxing situation for Trump as New York state tax officials take up the matter\nTo talk about that is Ellen Smith senior politics reporter for Business Insider dot com\nThe gist of the New York times story I guess is that the president received a lot more help from his parents\nThan a a has been perhaps publicly acknowledged which is of course not illegal and that he in turn may have helped them hide some of their wealth later on almost a a I guess paying them back if you will did you go into further detail about what the times says\nShe I think that's a pretty good summary\nOf of course President Trump for years and said that he got he got small billion dollar loan\nFor his father to really start out and get his business going and what the times reported was at least in twenty Eighteen dollars that I was really much more like four hundred and ten million dollars at least what you would receive from his father a throughout much of his life\nThis started off when he was three years old he began making about two hundred thousand dollars a year\nOr and his his father and then eventually have siblings will shut up ah some of these corporation some of these sort of a sham companies\nOr to help new money in between members of the family now experts told the ties statute of limitations that a lot of these things are likely you know well we're we're well beyond them because it took place a long time ago so\nWhether we're going to see any legal action on it up in the air seems unlikely uh the New York state tax department is looking into it they've opened it in court you know like an allegation\nAnd the leading Democrat on the Senate Finance committee is requesting the IRS ... look into it which would be\nLike a more serious pro but the federal level and um but so far it it just looks unlikely that anything on that route is going to come out and but this does paint a picture of a narrative that Trump has talked a lot of being a self made billionaire\nAnd look narrative is very important in politics I mean president trouble able to craft there to help them become the president this was a key aspect of it is a central to the self made billionaire and there are a lot of businessmen who run\nFor political office especially the presidency who are not able to win because people didn't really take them that credibly as being a self made billionaire but a lot of people who follow Trump did I mean this this does have an impact there\nIt has an impact of little question about that although again if you've ever followed it that closely I mean even his initial claim that uh he only got his start with a million dollar loan from his father yeah I remember the first million dollars my father gave me the help that a lot\nI mean most of us believe that that's a joke obviously okay so we had a lot of help fine uh there's no question about that I mean I I never\nCared much one way or the other people's self made or not and I know apparently a lot of people do but I mean that to me is is right down there at the tabloid level of something you would see on the ... the headline of the national Enquirer you know so he's not a self made as we thought well I'm losing sleep over it even as I think about it now the rest of it\nUh over charges of of possible illegalities of that I Would take very very seriously the law matters do any of the things that are brought forward in this time story Allen Smith strike you as a open and shut a yeah that that's the illegal\nOr do some of them fall under the category of perhaps what might be called interpretation or are we need more information about the exact circumstances\nI think it would be safe to say that we need more information about the exact circumstances are not in your type did review more than a hundred thousand

E. O. of the U.S theory export council he's obviously got a lot at stake in these trade agreements and at the end of the show today I had a conversation with senator Heidi Heitkamp a late yesterday afternoon\nUs MCA and the farm bill or to a very hot button issues for her status of North Dakota\nAnd believe me she's got some strong opinions on what's really holding up the farm bill in the conference committee so we've got a lot to talk about on today's show right now let's turn it over to time Morgan for an update on the news today and how you doing today\nI'm doing well how are you chat good didn't want to remind our listeners will be at Iowa State next week for our next edition of our college road show\nYes absolutely going to be back on campus down in Ames, Iowa State University this I Do\nGo into chip that dumping ground if there's a statue anywhere or you know your name carved in any bathroom saw I'm going to check\nThat out [laughter] a\nHit you can't trust it established you met unless there are names and phone numbers right now the bathroom so that's all\nThat well I think it's probably there's a place that I Do but that was on that was only what thirty one years ago\n[laughter] number I I'm hoping that they'll let me back in ... well you know about\nThat rightly right in the middle of campus on friday for advertising and us farm reports of you're in the area maybe of rain keeping you out of that field joined us we're not we're not to have a good audience that I Am ... brought at Texas Tech brought up we've got to see if I was steak and bring it to\nYou bet you bet a there's a great group of kids down there that are involved in a I said kids I should've said students a great group of students down there that are involved in the egg marketing and I'm a management organization it's called\nAmbassador Lighthizer than destruction of President Trump feels strong and we got a deal better than tape they pay and better much more access and we had under the current NAFTA\nYeah and it seems like this agreement is very important to the dairy industry a at but it's important for all of us that right\nIt's all for that that's a point it's not well understood right and that's good for all of a lag mostly from\nUh renewing the access we locked in those markets in the\nUh Canada and Mexico or in our top a three year by year so these are very important markets star overall egg industry we talk a lot about dairy big poultry access in the week grading but actually it's very very encouraging for all of agriculture\nYeah and and I think it is important that uh that that we maintain to try lateral agreement between the U.S Mexico and Canada nets instead of having two separate bilateral agreements\nWell we felt the same way and I I Know that uh that's\nWhat we were hoping for Canada frankly it's been fairly and transferred in and they they're the ones that kind of ... you know held out until the very end and uh uh I was very frustrating from time to time but we were ready to\nDo it deals similar to what we got to the end in Canada just kind of drug along but I'm Glad it all got together a trial lateral ah I call the north America that you know the best neighbor or and there's no reason we shouldn't be trading with our allies to the north and the south\nAbsolutely okay there's been a lot of support for the deal from the commodity groups out there but there's some voices out there in the community that think this agreement comes up a little bit short what are your concerns with the agreement\nWell I um [noise]\nWe would always like to go more uh you know I guess that's just the American spirit we want the best that we won't most but uh the fact is compared to where we were this fulfilled President Trump's promised that uh he was going to improve\nAnd renew the uh the NAFTA agreement and he's done that with us MCA a we have to realize that the U.S economy\nThe agriculture although I Believe agriculture the bedrock\nA but it does a lot of things in Santo sanitary fighter sanitary rules of engagement between the three countries it does a lot with for the first time having a biotechnology tax in the in the language this agreement is very modern it sets a template\nFor other agreement so we think will be the template going forward\nOver how we do deals with the EU as well as China\nOkay yeah and ... we've got that momentum going that that we\nThat I think we we agree that we've got going here and now Japan wants to come to the negotiating table it sounds like India wants to I'm a ... to have some trade talks as well\nJapan specifically Mr Secretary what what should be the goals for the U.S with with a trade agreement with Japan\nWill huge market obviously even pork or Japan is\nTypically in our top five and a great customers and we would love to uh uh to get these ah terrorists back to where\nAre these other competitors have them in the TPP group we were looking for TTP plus would you pay in a agricultural issues in Japan's very touchy situation but uh I Believe the president all day and President Trump can get this done I think a interestingly well many have\nA voice some concerns over President Trump's negotiating strategy I think the u._s. MCA a demonstrated it's a it's\nA fact and this and bringing people to talk about some things that may have been uncomfortable shocked by the fast and the U.S to just let slide yes yeah\nAbsolutely and then with India boy that would be such a great market for us to tap into sitting here in the middle of ethanol country Mr Secretary that India ethanol mark it looks like it's got some huge potential force\nA lot of potential in in not just ethanol but the food and commodity production as well India's been essentially a closed market undersecretary Ted McKinney our foreign trade under secretary has been over there a couple of times we feel like we're making progress I think they realize\nThat growing population they have over there they're not going to be able to feed it indigenous leave but just production layer\nAnd we think are they are ready to join the or the world trade environment the way China the number of years ago and it can be a huge customer in the past ... in the future for us and that's really what we're looking at we don't want to be totally dependent on China\nHe was right to uh to our shame I think that we let ourselves become so dependent on the China market\nYeah yeah okay very good uh you said that the deadline got the deal done here but uh when it comes to the farm bill the deadline didn't get that deal done and it's pretty disappointing there what programs inside of your department are less vulnerable by the expiration of the two thousand fourteen bill\nWill ship where all disappointed we didn't get it done I think the German Conaway chairman Robert stride really hard but they just couldn't bridge the differences in the reconciliation but the good news is from a USDA perspective from a bomber\nFrom a from a just a dirt farmer out there there's not going to be a whole lot of change is just going to go on the way it has been with the continuation certainly to the end of the year\nThey'll have to do something by the end of the year that may be the real deadline they were looking at and ah we hope that we can get a a renewed farm bill a modernized farm bill that uh we think are on the right track of tweaking the things that was going to be\nMore evolutionary than revolutionary but ah they were on the right track in many ways and I think we can ah hopefully come together on the integrity of the food stamp program as well\nVery good very good okay uh out here in Iowa there's a lot of buzz that a President Trump when he comes out here next week that he's going to be confirming the move on year around availability of the Fifteen or is it hyper isn't going to happen\nWell I'm One of those is buzzing as well hoping that it happens or\nObviously I'm In no position to free up the president's announcement that's that's his announcement and uh uh but we're hopeful that are are based on what he has told me and others that are it's a a a set of couple of weeks ago it's eminent I just can't define what the definition of eminent\nSo ah but I Know it's something he wanted to do and it's hard for a while and uh it appears that uh any kind of tripped out would be a great opportunity to announce those things all low ah I'm not a\nNot at liberty don't know frankly uh that sold his mind or not but I sure hope it is\nOkay now with this agreement to you know quote unquote yep there is a an agreement and if the announcement is coming we're also hearing\nThat there's going to be some changes to the way that the renewable identification numbers are rated specifically who can who can trade in that market is there is there anything to that yeah\nI think that's a valid I think that's been on the point of agreement for a long time now needing transparency in the ... market it's\nBeen manipulated and then an unfair way of by some people in the market and\nThe transparency has been virtually nonexistent we would never think of the corner of the market or any other stock market operating in such an opaque way as the ... markets have operated so I think the whole market will benefit\nFrom the transparency of improvements that will be made and announced and I think that uh it will help overall will give people the confidence ozone both sides of the ledger where their users are consumers or manufacturers are producers are friends\nIt will give a all all of those segments the ability to know where when and how things are working\nOkay very good we've only got about thirty seconds left here Mr Secretary but I'm curious what's at the top of your priority list right now\nWell again I think we want to continue the momentum as you've described we need to get these retaliatory tariffs also are farmers can go about reducing as I have been able to get good crops in the fields in many places out here are some really stellar ... and now I just stopped a\nYoung lady this morning whose family farms out there I think they were average and two hundred and sixty four bushels of corn we've got to get main demand back up we're getting some backlog there with no no export demand so we want to keep trading\nVery good very good Mr Secretary again thank you for making\nTime for us today we since the early appreciate it thank you chip good to talk with you always power right that is USDA secretary Sonny Perdue coming up next we've got former U.S Secretary Tom Vilsack right here on TALK [noise]\nI'm On the red carpet waiting for the next generation cream dense soybeans\nDan's liberty link teach one you\nKnow and now he's got elite genetics you gotta love is floor bushels per acre you advantage Keith I'm Glad that they never tolerate definitely they years hottest performer\nOr if we can get China to change its way of doing business if we can get it in a position where it provides a fair a trading relationship uh that's obviously going to be beneficial but at this thing legs on I Know in the dairy industry we determined that if this were lying on for years we could lose as much as twelve billion dollars of opportunity just in that market alone\nAnd that's the theory that has on\nSoybeans that's not pork and ah you know the the that that the the damage has a pretty significant\nOut of the losses could be could be great um you know fortunately for dairy there are alternative markets a ... I don't think that that's necessarily\nA always the case for soybeans I mean we had such a large amount of soybeans sold in China that it's pretty hard to imagine that the rest of the world can absorb that ah without a lot of work and a lot of effort so um\nYou know ... this is a very unusual and very difficult time for agriculture and it comes at a time when farm incomes are down and whether there's already stressed out there in the countryside\nYeah no secretary produce just told us that he thinks that they found the right template for future trade agreements Japan potentially indeed China even the e you do you think he's right on that\n[noise] well uh you know Japan's ... immediate reaction to discussion of reopening trade talks with the U.S was not to include agriculture in those discussions so I think we are still some work to do with the Japanese I think they would prefer\nStill that we we rejoin T. V. P. or in terms of India by I tell you that's a that's a very tough market to discuss agriculture and we've not had much success over the course of the number of years\nAre the e you as a as an opportunity but until they figure out precisely what they're doing with the u._k. and how that split up it's going to take place and what do they do about GMOs and and some of the issues that have been sticky for quite some time agriculture may be very difficult in those conversations as well\nBut I think it's important for the administration to aggressively pursue bilateral discussions it's something that they've asked we've been asking them to do for some time and and it appears now that they may have the time in the past and you do it\nAll right let's talk a little bit more about what is going on in the U. S. dairy export council what are you doing to it we we talked about building those those Asian markets but what are you doing at ... at us a dairy export council that help keep this momentum going\n[noise] but we set a goal or to increase exports as a as a percentage of production from Fifteen Percent twenty percent next three to five years\nAnd we've decided that the strategy is to increase our presence to deepen our presence in these markets that means we're hiring more people who are working fulltime to promote us theory or in these emerging markets it means more partnerships with universities\nSo we can showcase the functionality and the versatility us dairy products and it it requires more promotion promotions like the one we have with Cosco and Korea Japan and China where we are essentially using their market opportunity to showcase American cheese\nAh promotions with the food manufacturers in with a chain restaurants in order to showcase the ingredients and and uh American dairy products so deepening our presence a and all of these key markets are increasing partnerships in ... and doing a lot more promotion\nSeems to be having an impact or because we have seen increases in exports and we have seen as I said earlier weren't or on a pace to have a record year in exports\nYeah yeah absolutely and didn't you recently need with a Cuban officials\nAh had the chance and the the privilege of meeting with the president from Cuba or with a number of other uh uh ag leaders of that would include a number of sectors of agriculture from various states a and a number of the commodities were represented as well\nUh you know we we we really think there's a terrific opportunity for agricultural trade relationship with Cuba or they clearly need a product they have to import about eighty percent of the food that they need to feed their people and uh the\nU. S. is and it brings position ... satisfy this or we just need to break down some of the barriers that have existed for far too\nLong um and maintaining that relationship continuing those conversations is important to building that relationship so when those barriers come down fully and completely were in the best position to take full advantage of it\nYeah one of the things that we missed in the dairy export potential is fluids milk in and it seems like he would be a a logical market for us to pursue the fluid melt market\nSo you don't have the the safety concerns of the transportation logistical concerns that you ever tried to to uh do fluid milk and other locations unless it's extended the chocolate milk uh\nSo ... obviously that and they're you know there are tremendous consumers she's a very very interested in um as for the pharmaceutical industry is big down in ... in a in a in Cuba and you would be surprised but a lot of the\nFiller in and pills and so forth is actually based so a lot of different ways to to look at opportunity a you know I was in Korea recently and found out that they are very interested\nIn pet foods is specifically designed for the individual pet or so they have milk that's designed for gas milk that's designed for dogs you know there was an opportunity there as well to help them very good grades that's taking place all of this represents great up to him for a\nVery good Secretary Vilsack thank you so much for your time\nYou bet thicker alright that Secretary Tom Vilsack CEO at president of the U.S theory export council we've got senator Heidi Heitkamp up next and\nCBS Sports radio week nights at six Saturdays it for Sundays and one\nIs finally here Graham tire small savings ...\nThis is the one you've been waiting for right now in ... in North fork all auto and light truck tires are on sale and save up to three hundred dollars and rebates when you purchase bore select Goodyear passenger and light truck tires you heard right up to three hundred dollars in rebates on selecting your tires also save on hand cook\nBy three select can cook tires and you'll get the both want free\nWith any for tier purchase you also receive a brief face oil change with up to five courts of oil\nGraham tires now under new management they'll stop in and see checking the team and let them help you get ready for winter driving\nAnd say all auto and light truck tires are on sale now with instant rebates and super savings during the ... entire fall saving spectacular and oh and with your tires are just don't forget to take home a free pumpkins for the kids Graham tired your tire store next door at Nineteen ... driving north on\nMy feet are killing me and my boats are shy all of my business and soon are all out is that listen up you're both in luck and the kids do renegade boot training sailors back\nYou are right now through October twenty that bringing it over here when we're in any condition and take twenty percent fair use your twenty percent trading cannot work the western Kansas even argue casual shoes it's easy all you have to do his victory of closeted binding\nOut uncomfortable even the oddly AQAP those huge issues ring the renegade and claim your stating that the mom oh usable trains will be donated to the ... and send to those in need across the globe today today to get down for the invaluable and help them re cops\nDo happen the trucking hit a renegade working western inside the sense that ... in Norfolk [noise]\nAt the great deal let's head renegade they can all guys run again you're asking western work in fashion headquarters\nNews talk W.

choice commodities he's also a traitor talk he's my guest on today's show looking forward to the conversation with Garrett here and just a little bit and give us a call said five five ... five five for eight to five five to four you can also tweet at us\nWhen you do just make sure that you include ... and the message All right let it go ahead and tell us what was moving the markets\nToday well check this out ship the spot but the U.S dollar index has pushed above resistance at Ninety five fifty the last two training sessions that has failed so far to pose to close above that level today's dollar traits all despite my index open a sharply higher and well above Ninety five fifty bucks the green back was trading mid range and below resistance at that as the grain trade was wrapping up today\nYeah boy it it it's like I was talking about in the grains if you were looking for a definitive trend in the grain markets today you're going to have to keep looking at because there really wasn't want but if you look at the dollar with a short term view right now\nIt's providing some opportunity for days traders okay a but it it's not it is not establishing much of a trend and trending dollar is what can have an impact on commodity\nSeventy five percent of the year you know debating crap size and and and you know how big the crop up the carry out and and now it's time to get home you know and and um\nYou know there's been some dynamics were you know we the commercials owned a lot of beans coming out of the marketing year you know they they the stocks report they've they've they owned a lot of old ... beans and that's gotten him through and uh you know we're now we're we've helped means at these levels here\nWhere we're starting to get in some fundamental things where we've had ... prices at lower levels and they're just not seeing the movement and Harvard delays\nSo you know you're starting to see a basis kinda from up here a little bit and the boards had a forty seven rally and you know it's you know\nWe're we're trying to do some things on the board and get some green to move and uh and at the end of the day though of Nino Ninety percent of it you know a lot of the market rally has been on the ... the realm of what this election this weekend [noise] but uh\nYou know the market is kind of doing some things that I have to do to get some stuff to move now we've had a forty some board rally now if we perk up basis here a little bit you know what level do we get some some commercial in the Tories the move\n'em but you know I think the crushes them and you look at how meals accident here despite the the soybean oil rally you know I think the crushers or you know are getting a little bit tight on him and tore I think they're concerned about being quality that's the sixty four thousand dollar question in here or there was a bean bean crap going to be like\nAnd uh and when you look at the when you look at the weather forecast shared between now It's Wednesday roughly\nRight in the middle of the corn belt were expected to get another two to six inches of rain right and you know we were already bumping up against record October rainfall and if we throw another two to six inches on top of it\nMan oh man yeah you get rid of it\nYet you Gary you know what I'll admit I have been patiently waiting for soggy field conditions to become a a a factor and I'm starting to run out of patience on it shouldn't be a little bit more patient\nAnd all the carrier still going to be big I mean ultimately yeah it's it's not you know you're\nThe board does enough to generate some movement here um and you know we've had it for some more rally you know you look at cash delivery break even were forty cents off the lows the old maybe spreads narrow in here a little bit in order flow is going to have some some impact on the ... down the beans spreads here near term as well because\nYou know in the actual start tomorrow\nWhile we were sitting here with a with a record you know record short you know once the index roles route then it's the shorts and a half to roll forwards so the ... going to be a little supportive of spreads in here\nUm so that's something to think about too when you're looking at you know from a bitter producers standpoint\nI'm In and wanting to\nGo make some sales out and reward the the carries out in the difference because I from a producer standpoint you know I'm you know we fought at some stuff here this week with some people and producers and clients and\nAnd you know farmers are are looking to sell the carries you know they're they're they're looking to do something on the back and so that's those kind of you know ideas are fairly well receptive\nYup no not even out and you know July or even on your own Nineteen\nYeah you know and talking about some of those carries which I'm always but I should say always you never want to say oh he's but normally very supportive of something like that\nBut at the same time Garrett the guys that I've talked to um did they they all want to they they want to capture that carry but\nThey want to use the strategy that's going to leave their upset or but just in case something would bust open on the China trade you know you you just heard with Oliver was saying he he's a little pessimistic thinking it could take as much as two years to get through the uh the trade issues with\nChina and if it takes two years than the market's going to be in a hangover for can\nIf it takes that long but guys I think what guys are most afraid of is they don't want the opportunity that's in front of them to get away from all but at the same time they're afraid that if they do capture that carry now they're going to be selling to suit\nWhat you mean there's I mean you don't have to necessarily so Carey I mean you can you know there's ... [laughter]\nYeah you know I mean you you you can lock in\nYour carry symbol spread and then sell the front end when you reach a proper level if you want to stay at I mean you don't necessarily have to go out and and and and so with him in ... in this gentleman concern\nYou know and and what you said it's interesting as I got golf on Twitter is the first week of July posted a a a a survey of ... when do you think the trade war is going to get resolved and I gave\nThe first week of July of posted a a a survey of ... when do you think the trade war is going to get resolved and I gave zero to six months six to twelve months ... months or greater\nFifty seven percent of the response that it'll be resolved within six months yeah okay that was four months ago alright two months as a month after December\nOr the month after the midterm excuse me and okay yeah we put NAFTA the bed you know we've you know we're working at the oh we've got deals with the ... you\nKnow but we ... and I and the Chinese we know they're not going to talk about you know they're not going to talk to us until after the midterms that they're that they're bargaining chip you know um\nBut we haven't we've they've played hard ball and we've played hardball\nWe haven't talked really you know what their demands what our what's our demand you know and we haven't had a face to face we've been we've been sitting here playing hardball with each other look how long it took to get NAFTA done right so I mean to see a quick resolution so now that comes into two thousand Nineteen acreage ideas\nYeah and you know I don't\nI I I don't know unless you know the futures market but\nI don't know necessarily if I agree with you know the the tenure hang over I mean this is the kind of price gyrations\nAre very similar to the F ... boom in in in ... five or six or seven or eight you know the the big picture is if okay I I don't think that we're going to drop you know the former type\nYou know seven million acres next year um but I Do think that you know I Do think that they're you know for the ... the ones who especially of corn gives us an opportunity above four dollars you know it's like twenty trading for quality you know these teams trading four dollars\nThere are some opportunities out there if producers lock that in we I don't think you can rule out Ninety three Ninety four million acres next year if they have the opportunity to walk that in ... but outside of China [noise] outside of China you know everyone we're growing world soybean demand what this break\nYou know we're we're we're we're in an outside of the coffee you know we're we're we're crimping world supply outside of South America you know so\nUm you know and I know that you know secretary of produce out some comments were needed diversify and you know it's it's kind of know your customers sort of thing I mean and you know China is our customer there's you know there's\nThat that's the that's the that's the that's the hand that feeds is um and you don't want to buy too bad but um you know it there's there's not much areas where we can really diversify their\nThey're the they're the the whale that that we need so\nYeah exactly and you know the\n... out a had some interesting perspective on that as well because well we think that our soybean market is dependent on China and making sales in China you look at that Brazilians situation down there when when you talk about the importance of soybean exports it's not\nJust important to the egg economy it's like the Brazilian economy right and here they are building up the expectation that this trade deal or the trade conflict between the U.S and China is going to last for ... for quite some time so they're building up there being\nThere the concern that Danielle had and I think it's pretty legitimate concern is that what if the U.S and China reconcile the differences here\nAnd ... part of part of what China gives there's a commitment to buy more us be that would leave a Brazilian not only the ... being industry but the Brazilian economy alerted and boy that's got to be a concern for them as well\nIf it can kind of a conflict concern for her South America not just Brazil Argentina I mean yeah um but you know the [noise] you know it it it it is what it is you know if we get a deal with China um and they buy more beans so be it you know that the sooner the better um the longer it goes on more investments\nYou know if if we're looking at the forest through the trees you know we want to get we want to get this done sooner yeah it'll be for Brazil can\nImprove their infrastructure um you know the the government the Brazilian government said issues you know long before now ... now that you know if that that money can you'll find this place elsewhere [laughter] yeah yeah so\n... yeah no doubt about it okay we're talking with Gary toy today is with first choice commodities\nTrader talk uh we've gotten a little bit into the south American conversation here but they've been point and beans that since September fifteenth and we haven't heard a whole lot of conversation out there about how the planning stages gone over to find out\nWhat Garret nose above the planting season down there in Brazil and we'll talk more strategy what you guys be doing right now to lock in some risk [noise]\nInforming getting things done early has a way of setting you up for success like using corpus were an early season when over weeds tourists keeps even the toughest weeds from gaining ...\nUm you know I I'm not one to really think that we're going to have a big rally um and so I mean even if we do have a trade ... a trade or\nUm you know a trade deal per se just because of carry out is what it is um you know the market for what price now we may see some basis appreciate here um\nBut you know I I'm okay with letting some initial sales go at nine thirty no balls fairly cheap um you know if we do get a trade deal I'm you all you're probably going to have we're probably going to see a weekly basis that we do this year I'm you know and I think a lot of people don't understand is that a lot of\nLot of the uncertainty because of the trade and lack of demand you know people just won a safe route as far as basis is concerned and ... and then it's kind of improved it from there to kind of see what works I mean it's not so much as you know from a seller standpoint yeah it's it's [laughter]\nIt's pretty bad but from a buyer standpoint as well you know they're they're playing the hand ... as well in a\n... and they don't want to be caught with something that that you know might be worth less you know down the road so I think everyone went to a very cheap level and have kind of work their way back hired to figure out what gets things to move\nIn and that's part of the reason you know you look at like the soy though I'm getting ahead of myself here but I I'm OK I'm OK with letting a little bit of Nineteen go at nine thirty and I think most guys are okay with you know nine Fifteen to nine twenty levels\nYou know near term you know reason we're doing it um it's just that the you know technically this last half September rallies the second largest you know that we've had on record in the charts kind of look like they're getting a little tired in here\nUm but the the sixty four thousand dollar question is is\nYou know you look at the the stocks use ratios and being versus corn you know and you would think the beans should be losing the corn but since the September ... reporters since ... September was the ... the corn racial but mostly flat you know um so I mean I think it's it just feels like we've\nGone the farmers and I really selling anything their store and everything put in a way they're selling corn if they need cash flow needs but I just kind of feels like we've run out of salaries a little bit um\nAnd the fact that you've got the quality issues like the crushes work through their inventories you know we're kind of at this access you know point for me to point B yeah\nHey Garrett I'm picking up a bit but I I I don't want to call it an attitude and picking up an attitude that\nSome people are talking about a fairly positive story for corn out there I don't know if I'm hearing that from you um\n[noise] the the only real positive story that I see in corn is is you know there is a underlying belief that the U.S steel come down and in corneal next month or next next week you know and\nYou you you've got 'em your that under a hanging or overhanging the market until it's proven wrong\nUm the the absentee it aren't necessarily Bush\nBut you know I don't know what else what more bearish stuff that you can throw at the market and then it won't break [noise] you know I mean you know if you're you're looking at them you know we had a staff report those ... pretty bearish\nUm you know and you've got to be a corneal that's pretty bearish I'm In a in a corn stock situation that's working towards to um yeah and then you've got the overhang of acres you know for next year\nIf not really that it's not really that uh that Bush but we're just trying to find sellers for the buyers out here you know the market may have over extended itself a little bit I mean you look at this short in the market structure\nYou know this money market short and corn\nYou know you had some long that we are trying to come in but this money market short it was building the same type of short\nThat they did this time last year round right wrong or indifferent right now and um [noise] it works until it doesn't and on um I don't I I just think that that might be a function that we are well carry out is is uh\nIs is is is on paper burgeoning um you know it it's still a fairly strong demand market\nFor the right hey yeah it'd be a before we get to the end of the show I got to ask your conversations with your clients and everything are you taking the over the under oath or one eighty one point three\nI'm I Am going to take a I'm going to I Want to take the under ...

a big Baker Mayfield fan but I think if a if I'm Talking to you and if you talk to my buddy it's a I think you would find that most of us would be hard pressed to say that yet earned the right to be compared to ... or\nOr John Elway I mean we love the guy but it's been\nOne game and I'll tell you what I think happening here I think the defensive coordinator butter butter eight minutes and I think China maybe play a head game maybe try to put some pressure on bigger um I'm not sure it out of work out\nThat great for him because they are handled the pressure and love the the big games and and usually drives and environmentalists but but I really I I don't think he is there yet certainly something we all hope for the\nUm with the main appreciate the call and I I root for the guy and I\nLike him I liked his whole act to his whole thing is competitiveness with the planting a flag\nThat it was amazing and and I told the story we had them on the television show on CBS Sports cue and that's who has a a charm and the confidence in a way about him even a cross of camera connection released each other over you know screens\nThat's real ... that's legit and I I I agree I think there's a real chance he can handle\nWhatever mind games pressure comparison but the NFL's game of inches and not just a sport itself as the browns right and the raiders but also the psychology of success\nThe line between believe in yourself and not the distance between the confidence you have to do to take on the best in the world and the arrogance that can bring it down\nAnd again not ... people want to raise

Jason in Pennsylvania Jason what's up man you're on CBS Sports radio\n[noise] yeah I Would I Would agree I I think it's a little far fetched to uh to put her in the same conversations outweigh and far right now uh I mean I definitely have some similarities with being a gun playing quarterback um but if I'm going to compare him to anybody on the field so far I'd I'd say probably plays more like Tony Romo right now I'm\nThan than anything like a like the other two um\nHowever I I Would say uh I Do disagree with the one on it you are saying that you're not the best rookie quarterback I Would say so far I Do feel is the best rookie quarterback that's playing\nYeah I mean I guess that was true in the homes in their ... as part of that conversation right as part of that that are analysis but I I hear you saying appreciate the call technically and actually I don't know just\nAn I should maybe depend a gentle words to you know more homes is on all of the boards for rookie of the year\nHow does he qualified for that is it more of a minimum games played a first year that preserves your average ability\nQuestion like major league baseball on most he didn't get the certain number of games started I didn't know that existed I Will look into that right now\nYeah it's all sure I've seen it offshore places which to me seems wrong but I ... of the guys who have been drafted this year\nI I think you're right Jason I think beggars the best guy probably better for me to have said of the young quarterback who are out there all of the young few bees who are making their more concerning for the first time I don't think he's the best of the group\nBecause to me it's clearly peasant bombs and if we're going to\nOr gain someone\nIf we're going to say this is the guy this is the future this is an ex hall of fame or if we can overreact\nLet's overreact to Patrick moms\nMoms had\nMaybe the best for game store to a career in the history of the NFL\nHey Manny\nOur neck in neck for a lot of steps the differences and no one ever brings up\nMaybe on his fourteen thousand touchdowns of his first four games starting last year's game in Denver\nFirst four games is distorted the designated shorter and manning had I think a touchdown more meaning also through a ton of interceptions\nMoms has done this without turning the ball over a single time it's really amazing\nBut yes I I think beggars great I think he's really good I think he has done some potential\nI don't know man that's a Elway and forms a pretty big ... bears eight five five to one to four CBS is the phone number Thursday Night Football just about an hour away so to Gino in Louisiana Gino think hanging out man you're on CBS Sports radio\nBill I just wanted to congratulate you on a show on ah some wise discretion and not play some money on\nI I'm not that I yeah yeah and uh you\nKnow I you know when I look back at it this early ah NFL season uh Indianapolis if you really look at their games you know I'll play here are played there\nIt's not outrageous to say they could be undefeated uh they put up a lot of points they've lost a you know some heartbreak her but uh but they've been in every game like you and like he said because Andrew Luck but I've\nHit and a half points you know you're getting can point\nA for Andrew Luck and I just as a I'm not a gambler\nA per se I found some money down on horses and a couple of games here and there but if I was a gambling man there is no way that I could stay off of uh Indianapolis tonight you give me ten points Landrieu lot even against the New England and I'll take it\nI I'm with you I appreciate the call a part of the reason\nI don't like betting on Andrew Love games is I think she I think the lines probably right\nThink that he is good enough to beat teams he shouldn't or at least be lines as he should which is easier when you're always the dog there to to the culture to into against spread this year and the page or two into against the spread this year which doesn't give you\nA lot of clarity in terms of where we should lean where you should go once a month ago and I do like to bet on sports not a lot of money just a little bit here they're twenty or thirty bucks or whatever it is\nTo get on a ... actually a little bit of a ... from last year I'm Still writing but I also think the numbers are interesting because Vegas\nAnd if he says you if you know how to look the lines and understand how when money comes in how it impacts them it gives a clear picture\nIn because Vegas\nAnd if he says you if you know how to live the lines and understand how when money comes in how it impacts them it gives a clear picture of any of the talking heads of any of the assessments that are out there of any of the Web that you can go to Vegas is information in perspective\nOn whatever sporting event we're looking at\nIs the most crystal clear\nIt doesn't tell you what will or won't happen but it gives you a really good starting point a really good base\nAnd the fact that New England\nIs going up against a cool scene that only has Andrew Luck and and not only that\nRiddled with injuries so far right now it feels like a mortal lock\nAn absolute mortal lock\nThat New England gonna win this game the questions by how many\nI guess you never know I hear in Vegas doing the show and the CBS poor taste to show which is CBS Sports is new\nTwenty four hour streaming sports networks have a show writer's block over there I I I bring up from time to time by the time to time I mean every single segments of cookies and do a book\nPacific had a guy named Tony guns on the show poker guy world poker tour announcer gambler and the most money he ever put down on the on an event was may weather against McGregor\nFor I think it was thirty or fifty thousand dollars and\nYou know I'm ... I'm sure that paid only what ten thousand dollars or Fifteen thousand dollars you just you never know you absolutely never do a little bit of breaking news we're going to dive into this and we may still get to see beyond me oh just my conversation with him in the same said we're going to actually maybe we'll push that back later in the show\nIt's being reported by sham that Kyrie Irving at a team event committed to resigning with the Celtics and then you also reportedly communicated this desire to ownership\nSo a Kyrie Irving we think we believe him as a long term Celtic means we come back to the show you want to weigh in eight five five to one to four CBS urine rather than you with me bill Ryder after the CBS Sports radio update with rich Akron [noise]\nTwenty five interceptions Peyton Manning's first year and I think I was woefully under did he throwing the thirties\nAnd that opening season he did I think that we get some like the the high tea and it was a lobbying like thirty thirty eight yeah twenty eight interceptions his first year\nTwenty six such that again is moments right\nHe was obviously the great Tom Brady\nThe first time he ever play the game was against Peyton Manning by that point manning was has certainly establish himself as\nA future all time great to be and Brady was off and run and never look back in the paper just wants to pull that year and so in both those cases right very different roads to greatness Peyton Manning number one overall quarterback the son of\nA great quarterback the brother of a future number one draft a quarterback and then Tom Brady the guy that couldn't even win an outright starting job in Michigan six round pick you know the tale gets a chance to ever look back but both of those guys are pretty\nGood early on and you knew it right away it doesn't really go that way\nIt doesn't always go that way and a little patience is probably the right prerogative\nI Hope bigger maybe it was the guy\nI'm not assume Donald guy probably gonna be wrong on that but I'm not going to know and probably neither\nAre you a year from now you'd be surprised if we know more often we know someone's an abject failure before we knew if they're going to be great because if a guy so bad he can't keep his job\nIf there's so much failure early on and not enough signs of progress that can become fairly ... self evident\nIn Johnny Manziel as a bad example because the guy wasn't\nHighly\nInteresting but not a not over a top drafting late first round draft big and obviously some demons that that sell them a little bit so these things they depend in large part on the ability to assess them overtime\nMore homes golf once I mean all these guys are still in their assessment phases in some cases go off once we know they can be I mean even Andrew Luck and looks looks great I'd come back from injury but we weren't sure\nMissed all of us season concerned about that shoulder what's gonna happen\nIt's a really brutal game it's brutal make it cheaper to prove yourself it's hard to stay healthy it's a very very competitive world and I like not even like I Love that scene Baker Mayfield so far\nThat doesn't make him Brett Farr took Brett Farr Welby Brett Farr\nAnd then like I Love that I've seen Baker Mayfield so far\nBut that doesn't make him Brett Farr took Brett Farr while the breath for\nA five five to one to\nFour CBS is the phone number so\nSham Z who covers the NBA now for the athletic\nHas reported the following quote sources\nAs Boston Store Kyrie Irving says it sells expand event that he plans to resign with the team next summer\nUrban is also communicate with Boston ownership over past several weeks and verbally committed plans\nAll right so ...\n... and it's really cool\nAnd I that's obviously a boon for the Celtics if it's true or if it plays out that way\nLike here's this word of caution and I do think\nBecause of Brad Stevens\nThat the ... I mean think about the Celtics long term if that's if that's legit\n... I mean the list goes on\nAnd on and on\nThat seems to be incredible incredible that carry\nI'll just say this\nOne carry did think the earth was flat and I'm [laughter] and we apologize for without saying that wasn't true\nBut it's just a it's a little hard for me a little hard for me\nTo be a hundred percent certain\nThat guy is going to commit in advance\nJust because he said so\nWhen he doesn't know the earth is round\nAnd if you're a flat earth or a five five two and two for CBS please call about something else but you can go by five to one to four CBS the other thing becomes\nHigher he's really smart right Cuba to do or die would you do\n... and I've I've interviewed him he's really\nInteresting he's really smart\nAnd I think he's probably smart enough to have watched free agency decisions and finally use of contracts and watches that looks like and to have a sense of what people are going to be focused on to do a smoother version of what ... did in Oregon I always go back to Portland because\nThe trailblazers though interesting aren't\nThe next right they aren't the Celtics and they aren't the Lakers and so I think what the markets all Germans did was under the radar when he was a huge leap highly coveted\nLakers in the whole show form ... of the whole show for him his inability to be the star that we thought he was going to be in live up to the expectations have also somewhat pushes under the radar he told the local media in Portland, Oregon\nIt felt like a non story\nThey ... they had been really impressive was a great deal\nHe just lie right or changes my I don't know which I've heard all emerges is a really good guy I don't know and\nNow character carrier for coverage really really plugged in to the politics and the\n... now nobody gay gene or felt in Nebraska leaves the air until seven o'clock tomorrow morning if you're within twenty five miles north of Nebraska programming continues on translator K. two nine zero Eighteen and one of five point nine FM\nI'm really excited to be here and then this is a smart move because the mistake of Arkansas ... did was he went on the record\nWhat Kyrie is doing his sources\nThe problem isn't GM's are great and poor I'm not saying he got it wrong but reporters get lied to or get spun\nHappened to me they give you ... if if Kyrie Irving called me right now in the break\nAnd it was like hey man carrier and they got your phone number from Chris Ball that's a joke you would never get him I got your phone number I'm really like to ride it and you show actually you know really like it there is a sled anyway column because I'm going to stay in Boston don't quote me just say sources close to me\nI Would come on the air is hey sources close to our car vein telling me that it doesn't make it ...\nIt makes it to the sources are saying\nAnd I don't think it's outside the realm of possibilities that\nKyrie to take the pressure off them\nTo not answer questions about whether he's going to pair up with Kevin ... with the next next year and then I also think it's possible is going to have these reports play out\nIs going to let it call people\nAnd people asking without it watch she'll be like yeah I Want to be you know I said at the same thing I just you know I'm In a worry about in the summer but I Love Boston I pulled out to the ownership and\nIn a non story or real story because there's like a non story\nThis is my very polite way of saying I don't buy it\nNow that he will be there I don't buy that he's made up his mind he sort of a five to onto for CBS bargain isn't really play over these guys\nHow how does he always going to like\nA five to onto for CBS yesterday and show for the pit bull season and ice surgery Paul in Richmond, Virginia\nThank you for hanging out buddy appreciate your man you're on CBS Sports radio [noise]\nHey guys how you as always had I bought up [noise] well\nUh I Want to comment on this topic I I'm a diehard Celtics fan\nAnd you know I follow the both the die off or too fast and you know\nIt's not only one reporter was before that it does\nCause a critical though are trying to force also reported if that ... it into a crowd of Boston fans that he gets his committed suicide in you know and they often makes you I'll take you know hiring is aware of the ... the head of him\nAnd what we have some young stars in the making\nI I I Would even extend so far to say that they're already start weighing David Brower and ... you know if the air and having gotten Hayward coming back to ...
