least until somebody takes him down there one of the most games along with the cubs won the playing game\nThe Dodgers are probably not probably they are better bill to make a difference but that you know in your ears and junior talked about that both men and Kenny Vance and then it certainly is a real problem the brewers bullpen is the best in baseball\nIs legit that matters there the hottest team in baseball that absolutely matters and the other reality\nIs they've got obviously some off ants and Christian yellow which is at the forefront of that the ones who came was incredible to\nSo I'm I'm a I was wrong Milwaukee you guys are you guys are bad ask you a great baseball team you earned it and whether it's Colorado the cubs who make there's can be really really interesting ... right now Colorado in the first one nothing\nCubs just got their lead off in Iran it looks like it is rock in at Wrigley Field and I'm a fan so obvious I'm a cubs fan\nObviously I'm partial is but man the

jumbo was talking brewers and I want to stay on that Fred a little bit I I think that the birds that really good success against the cubs recently but still over the course of the entire year the cops were better against breweries and the brewers are against the cops off\nAnd much rather have because I mean the brewers face the Rockies yeah because our NATO and story there to bat battered\nForty

[noise]\nNumber five [noise]\nReally likes to how you guys just like switched around a few things and not getting the quarterback like it's edited in their their work Stewart\nIt's been what I eat the whole the whole read\nJust like with Kobe Bryant you've been lied to whatever we Andres\nNumber five Aaron Rodgers\nKind of the all time\nGreatest it's kind of ranking situation here\nHe is I mean he's a little banked up and he has without the guardian numbers some other guys have\nBut he does have seven judge down to a low interception in that victory that when that gutsy performance against the bears and we've won couple with the fact that he's the best quarterback in football right now\nIf I had to choose the guy has him in this place of honor as a lot of competition air and you're basically coming for that's kind of a joke that although less of a joke\nBased on a couple of days ago\nBut as much as we talk about the axis of so many guys and there's a lot of like the committed was not going to sleep\nOn Aaron Rodgers trace\nNumber for now is\nReally tough it gets really tough this guy's a losing football team\nBut man he has been dynamic this year completing almost\nSeventy percent understands as does a ten touchdown passes\nGood for third in the league\nAnd the other spouses who won three met Ryan you're on the list because I think you are awesome and I believe in you and a lot of ways of leaving your football team despite that record but this is the only guy on the list\nWho has a football team was losing record\nWhich brings us to know Bush really\nDrew Brees Drew Brees my our guy dogs better data as a a website throw eyes analogy dot com check it out very cool but one thing ... might have missed was Drew Brees is excellent his numbers weren't as garde the first couple of weeks but he just looks good\nIn control that off as the obviously the tone or help with Alvin Kamara he is completely and this is a strong the number is by far\nThe best in football he is completing Seventy six percent of his passes three out of every four times the completion he has not throwing interception he has a touch a touchdown he has that rushing touchdown he has a\nBest quarterback rating in football he has a three in one said team that is just winning games of beans and good teams that over John victory against the guy he also beat out for this bomb at riding the falcons was a huge win\nAnd he's one of these two two hundred nine yards ... one yard for being in the old time leading passer\nI think he's grossly grossly underrated and I'm going to make a compelling case when he does pass that mark that is the better all the time quarterbacks and Peyton Manning therefore setting the phones on fire but it's still going to be true for a number\nOh it was hard I write these down those little insight into the process\nAnd we're we're creatures of habit I Am used to write the ... I have like a yellow note pads and a half of the show kinda like write what we're talking with every segment couple notes jotted down here and there's things occur to me and then going to fall apart and also have obviously today the quarterback power making now I've actually moved down to a white\nA legal pad because someone in the building I won't say who Steve ... took them all\nOne day as soon as the wife of it like a big deal Titus endeared everybody 'cause I'm weird I'm we're like that still would you like the gas or trace how many times I crossed off the name of a one two and kept switching them I Would say maybe four times if your guest trace sue I was going to say for\nIt was for it was for\nSue I bet you can get some things right after you've got Kobe wrong a for a decade so this is almost a tie like I Want to go one day one be I Know I'm not supposed to do\nThat that's not cool\nTies aren't as much fun to the band's not here because I Can't see is the pain in his face\nJared ... it was so close to ... go off just to have\nThe best quarterback writing in football get a perfect quarterback reading this past week in performance\nHe has eleven touchdown passes to just two interceptions he is completing Seventy two and a half percent of his throat and he leads the best football team and the second best often in terms of points per game in the national football league\nHe's got a ton of weapons so does the guy that beat 'em out we know that his victim and second child girlie is for my money by far the best running back and perform sorry often come on the ground as to\nWhether there's something about golf and I think we've talked about this on and on the last few weeks as as a seasonal on wild golf and I got some really interesting stats\nWhat Sean McVeigh is allowed to go off to do is to throw more often in more complicated schemes to throw into tighter windows and they've taken every single week\nThe leash off a little bit and they have empowered him and encouraged him to make throws that are a little more dangerous than they let them do last year there building like I think certainly there are doing in Kansas City will get them home to the second like I Hope that negative in Chicago\n... building golf piece by piece by piece brick by brick by brick and his mind's eye into a not a good quarterback and do a great quarterback\nAnd this next phase of galls me and we'll do we've seen some of the torch passes we've seen some of the remarkable read some of the throws that he's made especially in this past weekend's game where he was where they were I guess the ... were they were awesome\nIt's in almost any other year at this stage of things what golf is John how he's look lettuce team that undefeated record one of only two he would be the guy he would be the man you'd be number one\nBut instead number one Patrick ... as you look so good oh what what more by going to say\nThe guy has fourteen touchdowns he has not throwing interception here's a fun fact for ya\nHe's the only quarterback in football\nThe only one not to have ... ...\nThat's the western wall he's played fewer games Nick Boles is\nThrown one not start anymore Aaron Rodgers Israel wants to be awesome man is usually only has one interception can't moons only thrown a single pick Alex Smith was protective of was only one interception only for touchdowns more homes though\nHas not turned the football over\nPast fourteen touchdowns\nHas the second best quarterback reading in the game has a rushing touchdown\nHas that game winning drive yesterday and that incredible fourth quarter\nAnd has made throws it boggles the mind that very very few of us can actually see\nAnd just because I Love the kids were going to play some of his excellent some of his comments after the big one lesson is a close call well homes and golf rubble awesome they're off here's moms can study she's remarkable young quarterback\nLast night on winning that game\nI Love this team and just how we fight I mean we hadn't necessarily been tested in this situation yet and it it just showed that every ... every phase the ball special teams defense and all that everybody can step up and everybody can make twice and I knew we had it and I'm Glad we got to show it for everybody else or don't keep it rotted and season goes\nI I have such a ... on on mom's a quarterback 'cause I don't think we've ever done sound play you sound of\nThe quarterback from question in a ranking segment I don't care moms number one number one in my heart in my heart 'cause he may be a bunch of money on sports betting and my fantasy team a mom's also and I know electric players\nDon't defined excellent you want to win football games therefore no\nThat left him to throw yesterday and not just in the throat\nIs a critical Dr they have faced some really difficult penalties whether to them or not von ... homes basically scrambled to the left side\nHe's forced out of the

West Virginia which obviously has the potential to be a huge game what's your assessment of Oklahoma break when we we've gotten different answers from people who do this for a living and look at this in terms of how they view as soon as\nWell at first stars I think we're going to find out a lot more this week just because Texas has been so good defensively um I mean look at the past three games and you know the numbers they put up I mean since how to do is take her is there such a coordinator David lights out they get off the feeling that are down there to the red zone they're good at getting pressure on post quarterback show\nOr the defense it's kind of always been there it's they're off and that's been you know kind of chugging along and getting better but\nThis is gonna be the game is going to be tested because regardless of how good sex defense is are they calorie as dynamic as just wanting to football as electric as he is throwing the football uh they've got too much too many weapons on their off as to you know to be able to slow down lately so I think test score some points and I do think\nSecondary of Oklahoma's kind of put their back on a pickup truck through All right but it's been a secondary where they got so much experience has been able to kind of\nA help improve his defense why back place was to novel or that was kind of highlight versus argue with white blood and briefly um but you know as I kind of look at it I I think this Oklahoma team is maybe a little bit more well rounded in some ways\nThe what we saw last years of college football playoff team that has something to do with calories ability to run a as well be a part of the game or last year was more just the Rodney ... show now except to help the rest of the season\nBut I think the split duty with the long back quarterback makes it even harder to\nBreak when here on the show form or another quarterback judgment CBS or against you in a Fox college football analyst Brady um\nGambling massing question I'm going to do is it too soon to start talking about ... homes that as a top potentially top five quarterback in the NFL\nNo not after what I just saw on Monday Night football I mean I was gonna ask but you know we're we're ... we've got five game so now you get back to your subject last year I mean he's five an hour as a starting quarterback and you know there's multiple plays you can point out\nI just I mean it's crazy how fast at such an early stage diagnosis things that he sees\nIt's crazy the different throws he can make from different you know our bangles and whatnot I mean how he's got you know more completion is with us left on cars that are sexual is right off at this point I'm so it's it's just ridiculous to see what he's been able to use so far and you could probably make the case they played the best teams yet\nUm but last you know last night and really this is ... it's kind of a state of the game of my mind this week did other tough challenge had jacks welcome to their house um I I think if they end up\nBeing eight no taking into account the fact that DARPA the Jacksonville North Dakota Fox for her to be the New England patriots are I Believe they've got to be the chargers again and that there aren't that in\nOkay yeah 'cause again in Cincinnati that staff if if they end up if they end up\nEating all those teams like eight no yeah I mean this is like a Super Bowl containing team at that point but I I just think it's helpful and he's going to have a bag in some point that decides if you're a catch up with a ... you got to play this year\nBreak when you're on the job right here the philosophical question for you I'm I'm ...

over the weekend that fan I don't know um major league baseball has actually I think kudos to them Rob Manfred the the commissioner of baseball has done a nice job of\nPutting some things that need to change in the game of baseball in the play I'm\nI'm not talking about the overall way that they play the game and the like but there's always things are being done to upgrade your game and one of my biggest beef and it was in place for a hundred years or was the fact that they use to determine who had the world series home field advantage\nBy a just alternating you're in you're out and gets a one year the gets in the next day they'll get today I'll get either just dumb as far as I'm concerned\nAnd in the Bud Selig comes along and says the all star game is losing its luster we need to help out our television partner Fox we need to make the all star game count here and what we're going to win and determine a home field advantage in major league baseball by the winner of the all star game\nWhich I signed off on when it happened that don't always okay little a rational dazzle they're trying to add Jews okay wait say it's a nice idea short term now changing it lasted longer than I thought it would like a decade\nBut Rob Manfred takes over as commissioner and says All right we're not going to do this anymore it's just not right and he says here's how we're gonna do it we're going to give them real advantage in the world series to\nThe team that has the best record during the regular season which is the way the NBA does it and then a joke does it in other words the correct way to do it you make a more ward for having the best linked the season you up\nAnd I it hadn't been sailing gun previously and he had given me BS answers about why they couldn't do it that way previously or that they the media that covered the sport needed to know ahead of time what city they would be advancing too\nSo they would only need to book hotels and fly to broadcast trucks and everything else for two cities rather than for\nWell no it's actually only two cities three cities are ... cities rather than three because one of the themes has no chance the team that comes in with a port a best record has no chance to host the world series\nIt could be anyone or the other three but\nYou're really not giving the ah people the fans the broadcasters the media and the like that much of adds up really not where it's a ... it was just I was laziness more than anything else\nI get it the baseball likes to have certain things in place for promotional purposes for ease purposes and the like but I think you should always be all these decisions should be based on what's fair and what's right\nAnd we were in that position this week and I was ready to go crazy\nAbout baseball doing things old school ways that they need to change and adjust\nThey set the dates for the post season\nWell in advance before anything that indicates that the teams because they don't always good plane and um but they said the dates and the locations an el town a a town what day games won game to game the gate for gay flight and they put that all down before the regular season ever ends\nWhy can't you just adjusted on the fly it's not like you need building availability\nBaseball and football teams don't play in the same stadium anymore like they did twenty thirty forty years ago uncle is the only one left but\nDoes um ... why do you need to do that it's just because of its convenience that they think that it's better to lay it out at a time let the TV networks promote the product and everything else here's the point I'm trying to make\nI thought it was blatantly unfair to more so the Colorado Rockies the cubs both teams but more so the Rockies and the ... or the cubs because they had to travel yesterday\nIt ended up the dodging the Rockies had to play in the play in decide who wins the national league west varies match up yesterday and the cubs had to do the same against the brewers\nCubs last Rockies last they've got an out play the wild card game because\nIt was already scheduled became had to be today\nWell that means the Rockies to finish up that gained get on a plane fly to Chicago gum in ... late night and then get up and play the game today meanwhile on the American league the Yankees in the eighties finished on Sunday neither team at the game on Monday through that didn't have to play on Monday\nYou know those two teams are playing you know they're playing in New York they add that figure it out by like friday I think the Yankees locked up the whole field advantage she knew where the game was going to the Yankee Stadium why couldn't they just have the Yankees and the AIDS played a day and let the cubs and the Rockies play tomorrow\nIt would be more fair for the two National League teams you're not putting the American league teams out\nThey they got two days off as it is they would add Monday off then they play on Tuesday nationally get no days off the Rockies and the play Sunday and Monday and Tuesday that's just wrong while the AIDS and the Yankees get to getting up\nWell guess what I was ready to go off on this whole stupid ramp if they

card game\nAnd they finished tied for the best record in the national league but that didn't keep them from having to play in this wild card game\nOr if they lose it it'll be a disappointing end of the season for the cubs no way around it\nCould it means that job man manager of the cubs could become available during his off season he's got one more year on his contract two thousand Nineteen\nI feel I've seen is of course the boy wandering the boy genius of the Chicago Cubs who hired Joe man who fired rent a Maria their manager a couple of years ago I thought was a actually a\nPretty good higher prior to Madden you'd only completed one years the manager of the cubs and they fired him because they had the ability to go get a job and then they did\nAnd sure enough Joe man was part of I won't say that by itself surely didn't managers don't have that much sway a but he was a big part of the cubs winning their first world series in over a hundred years a and an unbelievable and smart signing and move by the ...\nBut the ... can get all caught up in himself every once in a while\nAnd oh by the way the trend in baseball is the managers are just making less money these days\nThat it is to become a cooperative a job that the manager shares responsibilities with the general manager and other executives and that uh it say organizational thing and putting teams together and making decisions about how you guys are used on a like\nA lot of teams are doing it uh last year's World Series champions the use of astro certainly do it that way\nAnd if that's the case well since the managers not making all the key decision why do you have to pay him anyway\nMy toes you're not going to be back as a matter of the ... he was the highest paid manager I'm pretty sure the madness second and I'm also pretty sure the buck Showalter we start\nAnd show up this contract is up with the Orioles if he resigns there I'm guaranteeing you right now will be far less he might go elsewhere and I'm going to pray predicted will probably be for less managers are just making less money\nSo there could be a tough negotiation if the cubs believed that having a lame duck manager is not the best for the team and not the way that they like to do business\nCould manly men actually shake out in Chicago if he is I think all team should have some interest in them well Joe just thought that a

watch and even with the gay be played before he got hurt needed and that's all I needed to do that Chinese or ... or moms could malls didn't play and to recede employing all that well when he took over as the starter\nIn Chicago so I I still am a big good deterrent watching fan I still believe he's going to be a very good quarterback and I have a lot of success or the taxes over the next several years who knows how long\nBut your point of\nHe's come back to the pack a little bit to start this year as compared to where he was that last year is dead on an accurate\n\nAppreciate the call thanks for checking in um let me quickly look at this a quarterback cracking um\nDo you like quarterback rankings no I don't some people do some people do here's what I think about quarterback rank it's like the age\nOld the statement and I know some people will agree and disagree with this\nDemocracy is the worst type of government you can have except for every other government on the face of the planet which of course translate to democracy has its issues no form of government is perfect we can point out the shortcomings\nIn the kind of government that we are here in our country today\nBut compared to everybody else is probably the best that's out there and\nIt's what I Would select so it's the worst except for everybody else that's the way I feel that quarterback rank ratings is it a perfect way to measure how good a quarterback is playing the job that he's doing no really isn't\nWhat it is better than any other one I can come up with or anyone or any other one I've ever heard anybody else reference to how to determine how good or bad quarterback is playing how quarterback ranks are rates as compared to the other quarterbacks around the league it's\nAn imperfect science there's no way to do it without subjectivity\nBut I I think we have to use some numbers do we not other than just well let's go back to the best because I said so ... okay you know everything\nI have to attach some numbers that's what the quarterback writing does it uses numbers to come up with a way to evaluate a quarterback it's not perfect it's important break but it's the best that they have a yard golf\nAs the typewriter quarterback in all of the national football league at one twenty seven point three missed a mom's out after his outstanding starred last night or I should say is outstanding secular 'cause he was kind of pedestrian in the first day at a but he was unbelievable as far as three games that ended when he needed to do in the second half\nSacramento quarterback ranking in four games in to be the second quarter back pretty damn good not going to call them the second coming of John Elway just yet but pretty damn good Drew Brees as third drop off to one Fifteen Ryan Fitzpatrick who was replaced\nIn game by game is Winston is already been replaced as this starting quarterback of the Tampa Bay buccaneers what have you done for me lately you didn't have much of her seven his team got crushed oh by the way Ryan Fitzpatrick did not give up any of those six ... touch them too much too busy to the other day that will not him\nBut ... you get benched this week for\nJames Winston or he's got to port best quarterback ranking one fourteen and change Matt Ryan's one fourteen Philip Rivers is one tan\nRyan tiny one oh six that he's coming back to the pack was higher than that after his game going and against the way but ah one oh sex with the arrow pointing down for ... yeah I'm adding some of my own opinion in here\nI'm Alex Smith\nYou may not like them they may not have a big arm\nThe guy does move teams he does little to football down the field or he's at a hundred and two dogs ... cousins he's at a hundred and three are slightly out of Smith in eighth Alex Smith is nine ... would that big game this week jumps up to ten ... quarterback at a hundred and two\nCam Newton eleven even manning who in certain circles is taking a lot of grief here in New York\nAh and I'm One of the guys who's defended Eli Manning in that I don't think he's the main reason that the giants won and three he hasn't been great\nAh he's getting paid a lot of money ... better numbers he's got all aboard touchdown passes import games but he's also going to Ninety nine and change writing which can make some of the twelve dies rated quarterback in the

see shack came in and finish the ending stroke pitch the nine\nSo somebody's got to come out and pitch a tent because they're still go and they weren't the extra frames who puts the top of the tense for the cubs\nCoal Hamel\nWho I'd figured was going to be the game or two starter a or the game one starter would wherever the cubs going to be playing next the brouhaha eyes are would be there next stop if they win tonight's game I thought that coming back coal animals well Joel Madden and it's a wise as\nGood as he has ... says there's no tomorrow if you don't win tonight's game guess what you're going to all your purchase lined up for the next series you don't get to the next series so he's pulling out all the stops she goes to ... in the top of the night I almost did give up pay you hit the cargo so the Rockies got to go ahead\nRun on um after he got down on the ground out he got ... to pop up and then he struck out pat bull Laker a pinch hitting coming off the bench to end the top of the tempting are so yeah the cubs are kind of into when it here going deep into their Rip Patton now using starters to try and get through the\nRest of the get see this I understand have an overly restart the game like the ... tomorrow the opener that I don't get back against the wall your seasons on the line you lose it's all over yeah pull out all the stops and if coal animals that come out of the pan to get you an ending or two\nYou got to do that are so I understand just that I'm\nAlways relieve Davis for Colorado they've already use their clothes or you're in the game so they're deeper into their ... and they haven't gone to eight started yet they've still got some bullpen guys because uh they didn't get to the bullpen as early as\nMadden did two outs top of the ten\nCubs and Rocky's tied at one and that turns Gore went in and pins ran earlier now with the plane had to go in and kept them in the game to play defense I'm not much of a hitter or he's up right now for the cubs or if you get on base it becomes a factor\nGetting on base yeah not quite as easy a turns coffers ... one for sixteen at the plate\nOr like sixteen career and bad like I said not really an offensive option he is purely a pinch runner and uh yeah he's now got to step up and try and get a big hit for the cubs\nA fake the but that's not a surprise I let me get a\nCall or two in

I'm not going to challenge your baseball hockey man I Know about your dad illicit you or that an up I Do have two questions for you the first one is why is uh uh I Know you're a fan of Joe mad and as a manager you why is it better than ...\nI don't know if he better than boats you I Love ... too I think they're probably the two best manage has their own baseball\nOne on one a goal and when you want if you're a San Fran guy you want to say boat you better okay I'll give you that\nAre out of bed and just as good\nA I'd take either one of ... ... cars giants have made the playoffs in a couple of years of giants sided or they were going to go a different route or cheaper route and boats you became available I desperately want him to manage my team too I think they're a ... like I said to best managers put them in whatever what do you want\nAnd I think I heard you say a little bit last week or whatever about ... you didn't think it should they be the yanks tomorrow they might not be able to go very far correct and yet ... or ... similar to the yanks why can't the yanks progress in the age\nCan I I probably I Would probably pick against the Yankees and the next round to\nCause the Yankees were ever win the game got paid the red Sox\nAnd the red Sox won ... games this year\nAnd a I have some concerns about sale he wasn't exactly a fire ended up there in the play is couple appearances come back off a deal stint he's thrown in the high eighties when he usually throws in the mid nineties\nUm buddy is all by the way even though he didn't get it up there Ninety five and nobody was going and he runs against them anyway so sales one of those guys who are dead it is so good that he doesn't even have to have is best stuff to be able to get you out\nI'm I'm banking on David Price finally breaking through and winning the game is a starter in the postseason I never asked\nHe pitch Whelan were leaving the ... season which doesn't really make a lot of sense but he hasn't had a ton of success as a starting pitcher in the postseason but he had another great year for them a poor cell is pretty damn good a wildly put pitch well for him after they acquired um yeah I like the red Sox starting pitching better than either the Yankees ... and that's why I pick them in that series\nIn your data try barracuda backup free at barracuda dot com slash backup\nSpring

I Believe that they just checked better than everybody else and I guess over the years [noise] you know you're probably especially in the in the Alex Ovechkin era you probably wouldn't put the word checking and the Washington Capitals and the same sentence but I think that's what they did they\nThey flat out I'll check everybody that they played against in the playoffs and think about the first three that they face they lost the first two games to the playoffs at home I guess Columbus both in overtime and then they go to Columbus and winning overtime game three\nAnd they win the next three games when they when the series they finally took down there are traveling to Pittsburgh Penguins which they haven't been able to do\nThey fall behind a couple of games again or they fall behind it gets Tampa Bay find a way to come back and when that serious and oh yeah by the way they last game one of the Stanley Cup final\nAgainst the Vegas Golden knights and then they went for straight and then the rest is history\nAnd when that serious and oh yeah by the way they last game one of the Stanley Cup final against the Vegas Golden knights and then they went for straight and then the rest is history so overcoming adversity and checking better than anybody else I think are the two biggest reasons why they were able to voice their first Stanley Cup\nAnd yet they separate ways with the Stanley Cup winning coach yeah what happened there well look\nI Lived in New York back in Nineteen Ninety four and it's really hard to believe coming up on her twenty five year anniversary since winning the Stanley Cup with the New York rangers a long time ago and you know we have a similar situation where my Keenan\nLeft a and we have one of our system coach takeover in in colon Campbell no different this year and in Washington were buried shots and the capitals couldn't come to a long term contract his head coach of the capitals and he decided to\nGo elsewhere and go to Long Island and and take the job behind the bench for the New York islanders entire career and assistant coach takes over the Stanley Cup winning team so look it it's a business not only for players but for coaches as well and you know trots the Barry drops that an amazing job with the capitals you can't\nCan never underestimate how he was able to keep this thing on the rails and look and I and I don't even mention earlier is the guy that ended up\nYou know ... winning the Stanley Cup finals as far as the number one goal center in Washington he wasn't even the starter last year in the playoffs and Philip group are now in Colorado and braid and hoping got his back and the rest is history so you know\nContracts a contract swallows for players you get 'em for coaches and uh when you're Stanley Cup winning coach or you have options and he decided that he wanted to leave and\nHe went to the Long Island and and now is the bench by the New York islanders\nJoe expect the unexpected yes you get a lot of that then we'd be\nGlance unit maybe this year or so let's take lane sharing apply it to this year\nThe night out of nowhere and they didn't deem Stanley Cup final award number I came as any old

haven't been sitting in front of a TV not diehard baseball fan for whatever reason you haven't been watching the cubs and the Rockies up first pitch eastern time\nWas a little after eight o'clock eight oh seven somewhere thereabouts I Believe it was a I rolled in\nI think it was seven fifty five so I I made a poor first pitchers throw 'em it's now twelve twenty four here on the east coast\nAh so we certainly exceeded for hours which sneaking up on four and a half hours because we are in the top of the twelfth anticipating checked a and it comes up to come up in the bottom and a twelve at a minimum so we're already for hours and it's because they get up on four and a half\nOne one in the twelve bottom of the eleven coal animals do their heads handles comes in in rural leave\nA I don't even know it didn't look that up for me quickly how many games Coelho says that were coming in relief in his life my guess is a handful at best a but the cubs it already is a bunch of relief pitchers just get to get the extra innings\nHamilton pitches the tenth and the eleventh scoreless he's due to bat in the bottom of the lab and they put up ... teeny their backup catcher which I have to believe\nIs the last regular player that they have left many Jews his entire bench I got nobody left and how do you need some backup catcher who by the way earlier in that happening contrary is\nHurting themselves swinging both the manager and the trainer came out to look at him and the batter's box the talk them into staying\nIn the game so I thought oh they're going to continue that their last the guy that they've got on the bench all know contrary state in the game a ends up at a princess for handles anyway I thought they are going to try and let it\nMaybe uh the the manager of the ... but black was worried about ... because he went to the pan to bring in a left hander debates goal animals\nAre in a pinch it carried teeny form encouraging you made the last Saturday and so you go to twelve and by the way in the top of the bottom eleventh thing really interesting play I guarantee you'll see a highlights of it or somewhere um\nContact runners up first and second with one out uh whoever was at the plate ground ball the third base ... no one hour NATO snags it hobby by as first and second I gotta go to second I gotta go to third um\nRuns right into no one hour NATO and he's allowed to do that they did the defensive players job to get out of the runners way but it was obvious that he had the ball obviously he was going to be able to tag 'em\nBy as when he gets there just basically pulls\nUp and stops\nPuts our NATO in a bear hug\nNow ... got the glove in his lap Danny's making the tag he kind of see that come in and he puts his arm around by as as well so they're getting it out there between second and third but the second out of the ... well they could have gone for a double play\nThe runner was getting darn close to second base it would have had been an unbelievable play now our\nNATO was arguably the best third baseman in baseball he or Chapman a kid from the aces phenomenal to a and Machado used to be but now he's back to shortstop yet uh but ... didn't really try to make a move to tag and throwing turning a double play because\nWhat black rightfully came out of the dugout and that question nearby go yet wait a minute he can't do that you can bear hug the guy and you're running the bases you got to give him a chance to make the other way\nWhich is ... ... others go oh they hug they don't get out right there between second and third\nNow they met the umpires consulted black complained\nThey eventually\nTo place than is called which was just they tag out but it could have gone the other way and I'm telling you part of the reason why it didn't was because\nI didn't really make a play the second he was ready to go to the hug do not as much as by as was was actually a pretty smart played by by as if they had ruled them interfering with the builder and they called the double play what a bit of smart but he got away with it anyway cubs don't score so we now moved to the top of the Thirteen or top of the twelfth\nA ... this was the second relief for parents that I tire climb I only see one relief for parents for him it was the last game of the season in twenty eleven for the Phillies he came in and the third inning and through five innings I the ...\nThe one relief for parents for him it was the last game of the season and twenty eleven for the Phillies he came in and the third inning in through five innings I the Phillies won a hundred and one games that year I don't know why you would have unless it was to get work before the playoffs I don't know but\nThat was the only the only relief appearance eye chart\nEver for al ... call I'm doing something not usually done in his career and he pitched to solid innings but much like ah the rest of the cubs who pitched in today's game\nIt means nothing he will not be getting away and he will not be getting a lot ah he will not be involved in the decision\nA coal animals like everybody else ah put his stamp on the game but it's stamped isn't going to be quite enough because there's going to be decided by deep in the bullpen\nBut that they've got starters in there now you know they went to ... now that go to Hendricks and this is a kind of thing around New

I think one of the best ... uh in the last ten Fifteen Twenty years in the NFL now much life weighed Philips well I think is one of the best defensive coordinators and the last five ten Fifteen Twenty years and he had he not head coach\nAnd when I get to that level and being so great is coordinated somebody's going to give you a shot as Ed Koch both of those guys got multiple shots\nAt had coaches and what they proved when they were had coaches is they're great coordinator so and that's why they're back to in the coordinating stuff so I Would agree with that or ... or he's helping came out\nUh let's see where it comes at a almost a hundred quarterback ranking at this point this year suddenly got five touch on pets but you know Tam he's going to run in as many as are going to throw in or somewhere close to that I'd say up to a pretty good start\nAnd cars now too and then of course look after they can run I left off with two hundred and something yard last game we had so he's doing a pretty good so far\n... plain and simple doesn't matter carrying a prominent to him the guy is just a tremendous weapon and a half\nWe just got to get past the science I think it's got to be a motivation for this last year and I found a playoff three and three you know again that's I've got to make the motivation for us to\nA little harder this year they got the eagles coming up\nI felt like a giant Sunday\nGiant well I mean when I say coming up next couple of weeks when we get the Panthers shit yeah jewel up here real quick um 'cause that was a key game last year I Know you're panther guy um but I Do show right in Philly so\nWhen the eagles went in to Carolina and beat the Panthers like we serve seven last year that's when I started a ham maybe the eagles are actually a Super Bowl contender I didn't know that they were going to be able to pull it all laid off and window dang but that was an impressive win for them um I ... for you yeah you've got giants this week\nGot to go to Washington and to Philadelphia the next couple of weeks thereafter so nice little test or a every straight games against the NFC East giants home at Redskins at eagles are no divisional\nA and you know that's going to decide that division because they're all good and that division as other than to impose got off that quick to start now come back down to earth of doing too they smell like they got a laugh plays written all over them or the same Cindy are Panthers and it's\nA ... a ... falcons who are off to a slow start themselves are all going to beat up on each other over the course of the year mark my words\nAnd then we get comments day was bad for his parents have to replace our games without him so below welcome addition\nNow do you get ... is is he eligible to play this week busy miss four weeks so four games\nI think it was four weeks I heard on the radio that I think it was a space and I was listening to last night I said they were like when people that have that for ... hours a day was one of them\nSay okay I well in the you know that's a break for the Panthers because only two teams rat bites you and the Redskins they're the only deems last week and that was the first week of the buys so anyone else who was suspended for games like I'm a dollar for the patriots missed four games\nIf time as David Was only missing three games because of ... going to come in the middle of me at the end of it that's a little bit of a a break for the Panthers\nOkay tang where you can get it right Chris\nOh yeah for taking I'm ready to ready for a lot of football miss last week\nOh you've got the giants this week uh and the giants are struggling a little bit\nYeah\nI I didn't think he was eligible to play or else everybody ... weeks six against the Redskins all week sick because they had our thereby and weak for so they're playing week five which is there for the game and he's eligible to return home so he said I write a game five weeks six\nWould we when he'd be eligible to come back okay yeah that didn't that didn't seem to make sense\nUm that the fact that ah you if you're buying goes or early in the season that your team and he's going to lose as far as a salary goes if you miss a game or you miss the by week that's quickly beyond bell is planning on doing he's going to come back for the by week 'cause you get paid on your by week\nUh NFL and case you don't know it\nTheir salaries paid over the course of the season which is the Seventeen weeks of the season ah so you get one seventeenth of your salary\nAnd you can ask them to do a\nDifferent type payment schedule is if you want to be paid over the entire fifty two weeks I guess you can do that but that to me would be silly I'd rather have all the money out of time or

once did I say\nBut all of that very very\nVery\nMind blowing first month of the season\nI Love it though I Love the fact that we're seeing some of these incredible trends\nAnd yet most\nOf the division leaders and major league baseball had something else in common that has nothing to do with three hundred yards passing games or\nFour touchdown performances from their quarterback or guys who were on pace to rack up five thousand yards between now and New Year's nope it's something else very basic to football\nAnd if you're wondering my impression of your favorite team well probably in there too I touched on almost every team in the NFL in my quarter review and I'm the only person who was doing Quarterly Review is either\nA lot of the coaches in the NFL on Tuesday taking stock in assessing where they are one month into the sea then of course there are two teams that have only played three games the Panthers and the red skins had there by early\nGiven their druthers remember the last time I said druthers\nI don't remember the last I heard druthers [laughter] given their choice and their druthers I Would assume that most teams would prefer a later bye week to have it in weeks for who've that means the rest of the season stretches on ...\nYou go\nNovember December and you hope\nJanuary without a break and let's see what I have a by if you happen to be a team that is that one or two seed in either conference will that maybe you're lucky enough to get by otherwise menu are marching through every single workweek the same\nAnd so that's an early by by both Carolina

exit for a team that went to three straight National League championship series\nFor the cubs are allied with the Rockies move on to take the Milwaukee Brewers next\nThis is I think really interesting series now Colorado hasn't been in a division series and sue thousand nine and we've talked about this before the brewers haven't been to the play offs and the eleven so you're talking about\nA handful of veterans who've who've at least appeared in the postseason in the Rockies were in the wild card game in in two thousand Seventeen same as this year but they didn't advance you got some guys

Love John ... it's a good Mexican restaurant I don't know that it's exclusive to Oklahoma City but I did like that and I like the restaurants in Britain towns\nAnyone who's ever been to okay see they've got some good steak houses there in ... and some good food there so\nWhat just happened to the music the band just got tired and was like\nUm [noise] so yeah it was he breaks out with a special treat but I really did enjoy Don problems as well and then I'm also not exclusive to okay see\nBut uh there was a Bahama Breeze that was on the water is a lake in Oklahoma City North West Oklahoma City that I really liked and so Bahama Breeze was out and had a jock or you could hang out on the water so that was also a really good but say those\nBahama Breeze is really really good for anyone who's never had before and quality sister says well what were some of your favorite things about Oklahoma City period [noise]\nThe people are amazing\nI mean that's that's why I left a piece of my heart in Oklahoma City for sure um it was also the place where I made the fulltime jumped to sports radio so doing news\nWith sports on the side before that a and moving to Oklahoma I took I took that leaf in and did my first ever sports talk show I was terrible at it\nNothing like what I Do now\nBut I did figure out that in Oklahoma as well as Texas and the other part of a college football crazy country if you starting quarterback controversy in the middle of the summer\nThan your phone lines will light up and uh\nI understood as well there are four seats in the to the year when you're in Oklahoma you've got the regular season for college football and that's both OU and in Oklahoma State as well as the other a smaller schools that are there the state so you got the regular season then you've got\nRecruiting season which ends with national letter of intense bonding day in February I think it is and then you go into two a days in the summer\nI don't know you got spring balls sorry spring ball and then two days in the summer so those are your four seasons of the year if you're at a college football crazy area a and even though I went to Syracuse and at the time that I was at Syracuse or they had a a big time program under ... was actually\nA program that was relevant more than it is now a ... and even though I went to gave to carry your job and that's a pretty cool atmosphere I did not understand in college football as a life blood I didn't understand the passion it until I moved to Oklahoma so I spent four years there\nAnd I really then came to understand um\nWhat college football is all about if I had moved to Oklahoma I Would never really get that taught me so much that the games that I cover when I was there oh oh you want it's national championship with Bob Stoops and so yeah it was my indoctrination into the world of college football so for that I Will forever appreciate it\nBut it was it's the people the the relationships that I um that I made their the friends that I met a day or some people were really close to me they're like family and so I get back whenever I can\n... wants to know what is your biggest personal sports let down\nMeaning my own career yeah oh I've told the story before\nWhen I was in high school I had a game in which I was nine of twenty two from the free throw line I don't know that I Will ever forget that now what it did\nMake me realize that uh that was going to be the thing that I practice more than anything else so is extremely embarrassing I was humiliated and obviously the other team was\nOnce valley me to put me on the line and it was just I'm so competitive and it was it was crushing to miss that many free throws 'em and then I Would say my college career we were a team that\nWas we were building the coaching staff was really totally knew they were building a program my senior year we made the playoffs for the first time in school history and his conference that we were in since then the team that go on to the final four they make the tournament every year but but\nI Wish that maybe I was a little bit further along you know I wasn't\nPart of the building blocks for say maybe Mitt 'cause we never want to play I'll tell you we made the playoffs we lost our first route and we were we were out but I\nI Would have liked to experience the final four so I don't necessarily regret it because I I learned so much of my career and and all of that but it would've been nice to maybe be part of the next wave as opposed to the team that was laying the foundation for the coaching staff [laughter]\nWhich by the way it's still there\nTo remember one of those what you would leave the gym and to you on your fridge\nOr Ohio yeah I Know that with me all summer long to when I Would be homeless I was obsessed so I'm pretty obsessive compulsive when it comes to something that I I Need to master\nI'm like a driving range I Can't just get a medium buckets of golf balls I have to get to

G. seven eighty am and one of five point nine F I\nAm am excited for one cause one goes to battle every day but he doesn't a friendly way uh on the five and everywhere else a and alerted way he comes from a deep background in politics and more as well as race relations what the hell do you have to lose the name of the book on Trump's war on civil rights now this is Trump's line why did you use that line title\nBecause I thought it was such a such a provocative line some people say condescending other people say straight fruit as then\nTrump said black community in this country might as well live in Afghanistan here I'm paraphrasing but it's that Afghanistan as a direct quote\nThat things are worse in the black community than they are in Afghanistan because of poverty violence in the street you know Chicago Brian people shooting each other not bad schools all the rest are and he said well what do you have to lose why not why are you voting\nThe Clinton and not for me right so this was like such a powerful question and the book is an answer here Mr Trump is what we have to lose but I Would begin by saying this to Mr receptive Mr kill me\nThat he distorted the reality of what it is to be black in America in twenty Eighteen\nAt a time when forty percent of the black population this country's making between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars twelve percent a hundred to two hundred thousand that's all I'm clear majority of black America\nIs in the middle class or beyond so these are striving people given what obstacles exist historically slavery legal discrimination ongoing biased especially in the public and private sector\nI Would think boy what a great American story people who at times had had some difficulties been denied equal I Believe in American the American dream\nInstead President Trump presents black the black community as something for the white community to spare someone's got a mug you or the twenty percent than living in poverty that defines a whole bunch of one\nDid President Obama take your stats and painted positive picture yes much more in other words and by the way I don't know what I interpreted from him I Would quote one speech but that's not what I got it all of them\nIn fact President Obama responded so many people responded to this what the hell do you have to lose ... including President Obama who said boy\nYeah so and I apologize for that but I just if I didn't say you were against them you would just waiting to hear more and then Kavanaugh spoke and almost everybody except Jeff Flake Susan Collins et cetera mccaskey are there on the Republican side you have you talked to any of those three and do you get the sense of where there might be leaning five\nNot spoken to them personally I've been in meetings in which they participated but I cannot tell you which direction they are leaning\nI Want you to hear Jeff Flake and tell me what you think cut Thirteen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the remarks or the initial defense that a judge Kavanaugh gave a ... was something\nLike I told my wife I Hope that I Would sound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly maligned but then it went on and the interaction with the members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nOr that is it doesn't sound like he's on board yet\nI all I can say is they were coming after him and he was absolutely right Kavanaugh is absolutely right in the sense that this was a coordinated campaign designed by innuendo and false representation to smear the guy's reputation including\nAccusations of gang rape I mean anybody that would not be upset in fact Brian I remember one Michael Dukakis was asking a debate what would you do if somebody murdered his wife or something terrible what would you do and they gave this kind of bland on emotional response he got pilloried for that\nAnd you're the guy that comes out swinging when people are swinging at him and he's getting pilloried for that I think he's a human being\nListen I'm with you and the thing is to if you're somebody in society that working their way up and then somebody ... it's tough enough but when you break Kavanaugh you spent the last thirty plus years living is a very laudable life on on and off on the job in off the job\nAnd they want to go back to the Nineteen eighties and call you a gang rapist and a drunk\nAnd you watch your kids and you see them get upset and you watch your parents and you see a humiliated they are and you wonder what happened in my life I was about to get the most prestigious job in America and now I have to worry that my integrity might be last forever I thoroughly get it but the fact that people are talking about this now\nTemperament and they're talking about high school drinking does that also show you they have nothing else\nMay have gotten nothing else for one thing I think a little bit of a different take on it\nThe people coming after him with their questions were being highly partisan again using innuendo to attempt to do exactly what you are saying\nDestroy his reputation he could either ignored either pretend they weren't bi partisan they weren't using innuendo and miss truce to tarnish him or he could come right back out on um\nMine gosh at some point you just got a call people out for what they're doing I think he was calling them out\nSet of Cassie I you know you're a doctor first you did this political thing is that this is the last ... one of the last phases of your career this supposed to be given back in your mind\nSo I understand your frustration you talk like a real person or on a regular basis with a God of experience but I Want you to hear what I think is a this just blew the lid off Jeff Flake for me and I like the guy you know I thought for a while I thought he'd get over the fact he doesn't like the Republican president but he despises them\nAnd then he thought well he got yelled at in the elevator and he was overcome with emotion he didn't\nBut to think that he was ignoring the allegations of sexual assault so he called for this FBI investigation and Republicans had no choice but listening to why he did it listen\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running no no not ... not a chance to show\nBecause politics has become too sharp to Puerto ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nI thought he was doing what was right now he's talking about currency and value in politics if he was staying on the job like you wore he would never have done what he did what does that make you think about the authenticity here\n[noise] um let's just say\nThat if you think them to see if you think something is right\nYou do and it's important you do it no matter what including no matter what the electoral politics period ending story and that's what you're elected for and every now and you take a vote and you still have to explain it and I may not be able to explain that well but that's what you do and so I'm going to disagree with Senator Flake no\n... for his position that may be the case but also for I'm I'm the better way would be it was important\nIs the right thing to do I'm taking the boat and let's see what the consequences are by the way I think John McCain did that on numerous occasions\nI obviously he did that and he got under George Bush's skin and he got under a obviously Donald Trump's skin a lot and he also went after President Obama when he thought he was wrong especially on foreign policy so the big thing in Washington now and it probably in New York who knows could happen to me tomorrow\nIs all these protesters disturbing everyday life people trying to do their jobs or spend time with their families or or a loved ones we saw with Ted Cruz last week\nWe saw it with a we saw with kerosene Nielsen we saw with Sarah Huckabee Sanders and that's just off the top of my head Mitch McConnell at the airport and then member Jeff Flake got harassed right here on friday listen\n\nI we we know what happened he didn't say a word or he was he was saying you know she was obviously if something horrible happened to her and she was taking out and Jeff Flake but listen to what happened to let everybody here what happened when you got confronted by a protester list\nThe ... or you know\nThey're the\nAre you okay the person to go ahead please a non criminal charges for\n[noise]\nOh\nAnd that's what she got a full FBI investigation center Cassie you actually you we worry about being politically correct you actually are actually engage the issue in the protest here she was not ready for that\nI Am being politically correct Brian because by golly if our country gets to the point where I Am an accusation can destroy somebody which everyone who is there says isn't true now I can tell you that everybody in our country is subject to being destroyed and that is a tyranny and we cannot tolerate tyranny\nAnd and do you so did you did you know have you been harassed by protesters I hear they're crawling all over the uh the Capitol building\nUm they're all over the Capitol building\nUm but on the other hand a it is time to push back it is time to push back on people that think that uncorroborated accusations are enough to destroy a life lived a above reproach up until these uncorroborated accusations\nUm and if we don't do that prime they're coming after everybody\nA there is no there is no stop as to as to how this weapon works\nYou know that the president brought up the other day in fact he said it last night at the rally cut five\nThat's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be a guilty of something that you may not be guilty of this is a very very very difficult time [noise]\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that even the appointment of a Supreme Court just [noise] it really does this route you are certainly guilty until proven innocent\nAnd Chris Coons said as much the president recognizes do you think we're talking about something even bigger than this\nTotally by the way this is just to the left or just started going to this they went up to Nikki Haley saying girls things about Nikki Haley\nUm and so somehow um they're gonna charge again in ... to rumors as a way to discredit people in the right um and you can't prove a negative so of course you say how do you just proven negative um uh the Christians and others know better than that but it doesn't just attacked you destroy\nI tend to Cassie give me your prediction it do you have you heard that the FBI report is in will you be one of the senators and read it carefully\nAbsolutely\nI'm really carefully because I have no doubt it's going to be misrepresented by those on the left\nAnd we have to be able to speak for protecting the identity of those who testified are thinking that there'll be speaking confidentially you got to respect them but nonetheless I if if people on the left are going to be ... be misrepresenting the people who are right\nNeed to be able to set the record straight\nSo then the procedure would be if it comes in today you have a cloture vote tomorrow and then you could vote on ... tomorrow be Thursday coach a vote on friday and then you'd actually have a floor vote on Saturday\nAh thirty hours and so whenever that runs out whatever time it's first filed suit was filed at ten o'clock at night on friday a Sunday Morning that sort of thing\nAnd we

to day the reins expected tonight are already falling in Port different Iowa southern Minnesota central Wisconsin in eastern North Dakota's covered up with rain this morning\nThe rainfall is expected to expand tonight with the some risk of some severe weather later this afternoon\nAnd into tonight in the upper Midwest it seems like growers across the corn belt apart combines in her wedding for field conditions to improve but there is still some activity out there in the field\nWill get an update on what's happening in the middle of the country from Chad Laymon from Illinois Ted ... from Iowa and Jim Gibbons from South Dakota on today's show we've got progress on trade issues it sounds like we're going to\nGet some progress Sony Fifteen when President Trump comes to Iowa next week\nAnd the markets they've made a nice recovery from the September ... is that changing attitudes in the in the countryside we'll find out on today's farm reform in their attitudes are changing what does it mean for acres in twenty Nineteen I mean you guys are taking one crop pilot field and trying to make plans for the next crop\nWill find out how Chad Ted and Jim are dealing with that decision making process this fall and we want you to be part of the conversation\nGive us a call it a five five for eight to five five to four you can also tweet at us just include hash tag ... we're talking the message right now let's turn it over to Clinton Griffiths for an update on the news how you doing this morning Clinton's\nOh a little bit sleepy but yeah I made it ends made it in watching a little baseball last evening yeah we don't have to talk too much about a chip I Know I Know I get it and then a little depressing I understand you're saying but heck of a good game though you are about evenly matched teams man\nYeah that was yeah it was down you know is scrapping fight as hard as you can\nExactly exactly and and you know I ... if they were very evenly matched for this time of the year right but if we if those two teams would have met in the middle of the season when both of those teams were playing as well as they were it might have turned out exactly the same way but it would have been a lot more entertaining\nThan I Am not a lot of fire power in the game last night but the pitching was phenomenal and the cubs Rockies playing a\nKind of wild card game to see if they can get in the postseason for people that weren't paying attention last night that\nYou know ... or ... will say that hey Clinton knew that was the postseason\nI Do I really do yeah I worked at that are we square now because I think a year ago yeah your cars recovered okay what square\nNo no no we're not because that that goes back two years ago and if we were going to be doing this double or nothing stuff he's still on me for last year too so I'm Still one up\nYeah but you wouldn't even invite me to your house or today so\n[laughter] oh shoot pat welcome to a welcome to the farmer format that it's good to talk with you again let's bring in Chad Laymon from Illinois how are you Chad\nI'm good thanks for having me on today\nYou bad and Jim Gibbons up in South Dakota Jim welcome back it's good to talk with you again\nYeah will break yields good to talk to you again to\nYou bet hey how's things look it up there in South east South Dakota or is there is there much if any progress being made\nYou know not much that\nI Know that are we starting to see if you combine those ah last friday afternoon\nFor some soybeans and ah then Monday we had a whip their day in and there was kind of a a switch over to to corn or yesterday afternoon and ah I imagine today we probably have a sunny day that\nWill be some movement or a year and probably core and more so than beans and uh yeah it's pretty slow bored with without the rain that we had two weeks ago uh you know the problem is still pretty much what field so it it's still going to take a little bit\nYeah absolutely Jim Ted I I don't even know what\nThe sunny skies are that game is talking about any more you\nActually right now you\nGo ahead ten okay yeah no no\nFor an audio Sonny Sonny as can be here right now in Seventy eight degrees and a relative humidity\nOkay yeah no no we're in sunny it's sunny as can be out here right now in Seventy eight degrees and a relative humidity of about eighty percent so I think there ought to be beautiful\nA summer thunder storm come through here later this afternoon and you know kinda kinda moist things up a little bit\nRight right but as far as progress in northeast Ohio here Ted what do you ... it feels like we're okay because when you look at the calendar is only October third but when you look at the crops it's out there in the field it feels like we should be further along\nYou know we started some corn on the seventeenth of September and I thought wow this is going to be great we're going to get a ... year after it where several percent done with corn and we are twenty five percent done with beans but something's going to happen again this week [noise]\nRight right All right Chad over in Illinois how things going over there and you're making much progress [noise]\nYeah\nYeah at the risk of making the other two guys a little upset where wages at several weeks have great weather we started harvest on about August thirtieth and really haven't had much of a break um so calling in from the combine apologize Bernie background noise but\nThere's there's a lot of guys in central Illinois beginning to knock on the door here of uh of rap and things up\nQuite honestly [noise] my gosh so how is it is that Illinois corn crop everything that it's been advertised to be\nYeah yeah what is the chip hash tag ... sweet so I don't yeah I should say much but a corn crops great and end up being crop is is the best we have ever seen so it's we're we're feeling pretty blast\nYeah you know ... you just made Luke lures and grand when you said that has to take no yield tweets right\nYeah yeah I Know I'm trying to be really careful I don't want to get on a bad guy to Twitter this morning [laughter] so many ... fans out there that are already cranky art there\nYes there are there's no question about that\nSo guys I I just wonder if uh you know Jim I think you've got an expectation of what your yields are going to be Ted you've got a good idea obviously Chad is has got a lot of bushels into thin already and and guys over there getting close to wrapping things up\nThis crop that we've got this year GM does it change your attitude it fall when you're thinking about what you're going to be doing in twenty Nineteen\n[noise] well I I think right here for what I've heard is that um the ... early ... that we're giving you really are quite what we expected they really really than at the heart yup the national average\nAnd um you know that's this this area of of course we we we caught a lot of moisture of precipitation\nAnd get all the moisture content still is to uh you know we're we're twelve to fourteen percent and a lot of beans and I haven't heard any corn under Eighteen or say most of the score is going to end up doing and drying up or then\nHeaded somewhere if it was we're contracts and so forth so you know I I think as far as decisions for next year yet I I just don't know if I've got enough data collected yet to really make a\nMake a decision yeah and so uh this this might be interested in because I I Know when the the the pro farmers crop to her started in this area the uh you have for corn we're we're a little bit lower than what the wheels were eventually farther west\nAnd so forth and just didn't have the quite the precipitation and the flooding issues that we had they were actually somewhat better so uh you know we might be a a smaller a couple of comedy areas here we're maybe it won't be quite as good as the national average\nYeah okay All right Ted what about in your area you it it seems like are you are right on the south and ... of that area in Iowa was that that just flat out had too much water this year but you are in pretty good shape most of the season weren't ya\nYeah we were we were in a fantastic position right here and I even said he came out last week you know I'm only a few miles south of highway one Seventy five and it just seems like all you have to do is cross one Seventy five right now like you almost double the rainfall it seems like I'm sitting here on\nSeptember we got ten inches in so far this month I've only had an inch and a half but\nI think is the approach Cedar Falls you know they're talking Fifteen inches of September and like for instance during the last couple of days so I feel kind of blessed that way or you know July was a little light we were two and a half inches of rain water we would get for but you know when you were\nWe were that super hot and let you lead lawns never looked like they were stressed so\n... where you sat in just a beautiful spot the whole year\nOkay so you you poked your nose into the ... and to some fields how are things looking yields holding up\nYeah yeah they look awfully good I'm not a you know I I agree with you I don't want to ... but\nYeah we're ...\nFirst film was Ninety seven day hybrid we never ever plan that anything that early and that that kept up with our whole farm average from last\nYear and they continue to where\nWe're at right now I don't remember pretty well or not but there would be our best teams out there\nYeah so these these bushels that you've got out there in the field and or in the van already is a change in your attitude about twenty Nineteen\nChanging attitude you know [noise] I Would say that every opportunity that I see\nUp around this four dollar these Nineteen corn crop I think you've gotta I gotta be selling if there were sold out we've got some sold in July of\nTwenty twenty and things like that but uh yeah I think you've got to be taken advantage of it if you're selling here selling some for Eighteen I think you ought to be adding a Nineteen central\nYeah interesting okay chat these quote extra bushels that you're pulling out of the field impacting your decision making process for twenty nine [noise]\nWell you know we'd be big so we got to have a lot of corn do we're going to always be heavy on corn basis around here is awful which I'm sure there's no news to you by right basis\nIs awful on corn and bean everybody is just stopping anything any ban you got your just up in a poll and even our local elevators are offering a\nOn being thirty five to forty cents since January so easily pays for that storage so\nI don't know what we're going to get all this under a roof though\nYeah yeah that that is obviously a big concern for this year's crop trying to put everything in the band finding space for it and Jim it's going to be a big problem up in South Dakota this year isn't it\nWell I'm hearing definitely that was probably going to be and and I know two there were there were guys I Know a polling corn last week I\nI'm hearing definitely that is probably going to be and and I know to over there are guys that I Know a polling or last week I may with a little rally on the market during their bills\nThat they they still have a support left over and and so on which will be what it is but yeah yeah I I Know that it's gonna be tough but says you know we we do do a lot of storage and bags and those are allowed to do that and people get along pretty well you're\nVery good very good Jim we got to get to a break here when we come back I Want to talk about a a staff\nIn China and the risk could it comes to the U.S will will get a chance to stay\nInforming getting things done early has a way of setting you up for success like using corpus for an early season when over weeds tourists keeps even the toughest tweets from gaining a foothold\nBut the the lack of a new farm bill has changed I you know I'm going to go back to the decision making process for for next year has it changed what you think about doing for twenty Nineteen\n[laughter] well I think that ah [noise] obviously you you gotta look at your casual and and what you can afford and what you can't afford and and where are you going to put your money and so yeah I I think probably it will have a fully an impact on it you know the\n... things that a lot of these terrorists even though we're we're talking that we've made these trade agreements\nUm you know these terrorists are so alone yeah yeah and and these these these these agreements have to be approved by Canada Mexico the United states and so on it and get out there there's there's still a tariffs on steel\nAnd they're they're going to be protected in our country which means that uh our equipment is is is not going to get any cheaper and um it's it's still going to be a a a difficult time\nFor if we are looking for certain piece of equipment whether it's new or you because these markets have been affected that way as well so you have to take that into consideration too\nYeah cat I Want to stay on this farm bill here for a second the the the lack of the new farm bill and missing the deadline this September thirty deadline has it changed your decision making process uh for twenty nine ... [noise]\nNo I I think yeah my I I didn't anticipate that there was a it was going to get we can't even get a Supreme Court justice confirmed right now what alone you know\nAll the way down and and worry about the farm bill uh so it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't really affect what I'm going to do um this what do they call it the market facility patient program or whatever it is I mean that's especially for harm producers that\nCertainly something that that ease the burden of bad you know and uh you know for crop producers that something that you know getting prop the crops got to get in a band before any of that and can be sent along but\nI mean that is helpful right now\nOkay All right ten same question do you\n... you know I don't know it's not I'm not you know it's not like the eighties or do you work harming your farm bill um you know we're going to go ahead what's his decisions we we've got to make it\nSound decisions you know for our operating send them to be on his Farm Bureau hasn't been that big of an impact on us in the last years may be going forward who knows\nBut [laughter] you know biggest concern to all these them all but they do is\nProper insurance subsidies and things like that like just since I sit on the up as a board of our county I just want to let guys do you do you do need to get in there and sign up for about\nA market facility assistant same when you've got to do that by the fifteenth to January but\nThey keep putting it off pretty soon you forget to do it too and you do have to wait until you're completely done what part of his before you can go in your personal sufficient light you can finish one part of a number often take that and they cannot go back once who's a done that so late sure you're completely done was heartless before you do that [noise]\nGood good reminder there Ted very good reminder these trade agreements or it feels like we've got some positive momentum does that improve your attitude looking out to twenty Nineteen\nYeah I I think so I mean I just it's\nIt it feels like we've got some positive momentum does that improve your attitude looking out to twenty Nineteen\nYeah I I think so I mean I just you're just going to we're like\nYou know it was like we're kind of getting all of a sudden the Betty a steady diet of you know little room or they're a little regret their little business here you know I I'm like no we're talking about a deal with with Taiwan here at the other day and by some beans do all that thing\nI think ... I'm not necessarily a toaster um but on the other hand it just seems like maybe these other countries are saying you know what your race and got to hold his feet to the fire here maybe we are doing so\nYeah yeah Jim the momentum is is pretty encouraging you know\nOh I think so I mean um [noise] you know we do so much with with ah Canada and Mexico and the thick of airport that we have that in place first\nAnd then a ... look at look at China and and I don't know either you know it'd be nice looked like we have a real Korea\nThat's good you know where it looks like we're starting some talks with Japan and and and that's a good start as well and you know we're not really quite sure what we're gonna do it without the TPP we're we're still not part of that\nAnd ah you know time will tell us that are going to be a good thing or not it goes apparently some of these other countries are still pretty much involved and and so on so but yeah that that I think these are all positive steps but again I I I just hope that we can get this\nFarm bill knocked off and and yeah done and you know it's it's too bad that the the snap program students to be the the one issue that holds it up and the story because I Do think that is\nA good program for those people that's definitely need us\nSo yeah absolutely it is absolutely All right we're talking with Jim from South Dakota set from Iowa chat

line chip Russia is still exporting wheat and wheat prices retraced a portion of yesterday's games\nYou know I'm not exactly clear what's going on in Russia yeah I Know surprise surprise but uh they may be\nTemporarily suspending activities that those thirty facilities but still loading votes for export or\nDoes the message that there are no immediate plans to suspend operations mean that no operation have been suspended but you know you're right on the bottom line there Davis Russia is still exporting we\nMath made absolutely ... what's the adult beverage maybe I don't know\nIt may maybe maybe the last ... yeah well the markets were under pressure today we know that\nWasn't really that big of a deal we'll find out from Bryan Doherty Stewart Peterson he joins us now Brian how are you buddy\nHey chip thank how great a high feeling satisfied I'm a fan of the lane [laughter] yeah it's funny how\nSomeone else's pain at someone else's satisfaction but you know that's baseball it's it's I I Love it so and I thought it was kind of had our number again this year but we got to get out at the end so uh we enjoy it\nYeah you know what I'm what I'm looking for right now is the birds A's worlds theory I think that would just be awesome\nThat would be great hack Tobar can be a lot of fun job and actually you know that's a good segue into the markets you you're kind of looked at beans and and ... corn and I met said caught fun but I'll tell you what when you kind of step back and just listening here in the last half hour yeah that the general ... met some of the technicals\nA boy you know we can't be optimistic we've weathered a lot of negative things and yet the market's going to add that non quid attitude right now today was a setback and then there may be more of that to come but you got some pretty copious rains in the forecast I that's not a game change but it certainly changes the mindset\nWell you know I think for some of the guys out there it is a bit of a game change\nThere's a lot well number one there's just a lot of frustration sitting when you've got corn that's ready to be harvested when you've got beans are ready to be harvested but you don't have a field fit to get out into it can be boys that that is a combination for frustration right there\nIt has been I'll tell you in particular in some parts of the Midwest and all kind of call it the Ninety color court or in particular through Minnesota there but my goodness what a what a challenging long hard spring and now\nYou know moving into this window where there could be you know from what I see two four or five ten inches of rain uh ... this can be along fall again how long hair yeah\nNow what does that do as we stretch out this uh this harvest season you know one of the positives ears that stretches out too well I you know I don't want to say it's a positive or not hear Bryan it's going to stretch out the the required hedging that's going to happen as these crops come into the market\n[noise] I think it does a number of or can't do a number of things and you don't want over analyze this because typically rain delays or that their delays yeah but what it does do potentially is is this this real\nBig glut any one week or two weeks where everything just hits at one time and he's long lines of people trying to load it just starts stretching the south but more importantly and I think you're seeing this in the market the last few weeks he creates a little more sense of urgency on the end user perspective or should that they need to\nYou know think about how they're going to secure inventory if you're looking at\nTwo or three weeks of rain delay\nUm we might see in fact there was a farmer today in northwest Missouri that got a real pop on basis I'm In the same thing they just can't get being so I think all of a sudden the process or whoever's buying says hey we need to pull some of these old crop beans at a farmer's hands or do something to get him and tore so you start to see this stuff\nMight encourage minutes to monitor you know stay in touch with the elevator guy you don't put your name on the list they might get a quick order for or\nSomething and get a a pop and you're there so I'm\nYou know there's all kinds of things in general what you're looking at is very very big crops\nUm I Would I Would like to make the argument on the show that I don't think we can reach one eighty one point three at least not from the ... that I've heard from a good number of people variability is kind of the key term this year very good crop split for a lot not record\nI Know there's record crafts but boy I think about last year one Seventy six point six that was an I pop or we're adding nearly five bushels an acre on that and yet we know we have some problematic areas I just scratch my head I just can't quite bring myself to think we're in that ball game I think we're still closer to one Seventy eight maybe maybe one Seventy nine\nUm that that too is not what I call a game changer but it's certainly sets a different tone if you look at it and you look at corn a year to year drought don't carry out world stocks drawdown stocks usage all those numbers we've kind of talking about for some time continue to sort of you know pack that argument that you know in the end users going to have to start\nPaying up to ... out of farmers hands\nYeah yeah interesting okay a there's a couple of issues that I Want to come back here that you that you just mentioned a brain but we do have a\nTweet in from at R. J. friend twenty three he says if we would get and eat Fifteen announcement soon how will quarter respond will seize analogy trends and supply the heavy blanket on the market\nI think when you get news to things happen you get the perceptive or knee jerk move and then you get sort of the step back big picture move\nI think what the Fifteen everybody's trying to run and pounced and what that actually could could mean I I I'll just take kind of a you know I'd I'd number I think makes some sense it could draw don't carry out maybe a couple of hundred million bushels um\nThat's really important because now we start to move in that stocks usage number the world numbers on corn make it very well so much so that I think the corn export market is going to be sort of the shining star in the your head it's just one more of those things that adds to the demand side of the picture\nThe bigger term or the long term picture as I think and it was a little too I'm a prior to coming on here that when you look at it kind of the investment money in the index money what would you starting to see shake out\nI think that's perceptive money that's long term by money that's that's fine value commodities that's inflationary Hedges all those things so he Fifteen comes in may not have much impact or could have significant impact if there's any kind of a weather blurb next year\nRight right good stuff and a poll from I was calling in here uh Brian an impulse I got a call ... got a great question it's a tough one to answer but it's a great question Paul welcome to ATV how are you\nA it was a late night but I guess we'll get through it\nYeah yeah [laughter] so what do you get on your mind but\nUh I heard a a respected analysts that I follow yesterday on our radio program mention that a historically if you buy beans November beans on October for Ninety three percent of the time they rally through the end of the month and that average rally is forty nine so\nHow can as a farmer who are looking to add some money or some uh some a little extra money on them I mean how do I participate in that really\nWow great great question um I I'll I'll take it and try and run one is we're being prices are now we're basis level is right now you know there's not much of a reason to aggressively cell being so\nIn that window of time and I'm just looking to in my uh got a kind of a cheat sheet here and it it it it it doesn't give the the number of our sense\nBut it does tell us that were for example if you bought march soybeans today sixty days from today the futures is up seven out of ten years so that coincides a little bit with that but I Would I'd love to to if you want to keep your risk fixed or keep it simple or buy a car option or if you want to\nUm you know take the risk of buying the board by the board another thing you could do is say look I'm not really ready to do that but you could look underneath the markets selling put option and gain some value\nBut with basis is why does it is in his power tools the market can be I'd be tempted to just you know my my bias it'd be I'd be tempted to buy a car option one or two strike prices above the market and if we did get that sixty sent rally probably start to move some of the imagery and have the call option already in place\nAnd what month would you buy that option and\nUm well he's he's talking over this window you could certainly go to February I like I like to buy time I'd like to extend my cell phone to march uh I think he boxed herself in with was January options are a little bit to tighten that window from a time perspective just to give you some some bearing the march options have a hundred and forty one day's\nJanuary options are they're going to be sixty days lesson that's there\nWherever options are very what I call short term here twenty two days so do you think about this hundred and forty one days you're talking over four months\nYou almost five months and a half months think back four and a half months the world changes a lot for months in the market\nAbsolutely absolutely it does Paul great question appreciate the call their body\nThey got All right we'll be right back with more with Brian ... Peterson still got along the banks coverage today on ATV [noise]\nMoney do you push\nOne just on\nThe ... century my mortgage will make it look deeper real green ... view\nNumber one reduce drugs\nWhen your goal is greater we want to call you or you use for summer one just on on both grown up on your roof it will be you'll\nYeah yeah it is but you know there's our our stocks too tight in Russia or you do does it matter if it doesn't turn into more demand for us we\n[noise] you know ... if if you have faith in the U. S. D. A. which [laughter] you know we can all question at at times but they've got some pretty pretty strong export numbers projected and we're not we're not meeting though so one or two things are going to happen either they're going to curb those down word\nOr the demand market's going to pick up and I think the end user still has been very comfortable especially him pull back some prices sticking with or just in time and mentor you approach as you head into mid to late fall that begins to change there's not as much him and tore just floating around\nI think they'll sales begin to pick up I think we've got some good things coming on the export side for wheat there's just too much drawdown elsewhere in the world you're still issues whether this week freezes freeze issues in in Australia [noise]\nUm I just don't think there's a lot of good quality export will lead their prices are going to stay at this level I think we're going to capture business\nOkay All right hey we got a tweet from ... he says I should have gone along some pumps July I [laughter] that makes sense but but it reminded me Caleb sent a tweet I don't know if it was last week or the week before\nBut he was asking the question that ... that took his back ten years and and was or even longer than that\nAnd was basically saying are we setting up in these green markets\nFor something similar to that we saw in two thousand eight and he was looking at what's happening to the crude oil market\nUm and you said you said it right I mean the world's appetite for cheap commodities is huge are we in a three two thousand eight type environment in here\nI think the glass half full mentality says we are in fact we communicate earlier today I talked about this feels a lot like two thousand six two thousand seven to me who are still not really getting out of the starting blocks once we do it just starts to move so\nThat may be wishful thinking but I I'll hearken back to the there's you know basic economics there's low prices are low prices\nYou build demand the only thing that slows demand is higher prices it just that's it so so you may keep prices down by adding supply but you don't diminished demand so if you keep that premise\nThere is just a matter of time and I'll give a visual that I've used my presentations and if you heard me I'm Sorry it's a little boring but it's a good way to give to fifty five gallon barrels plank across some you start you know you put a brick on and you put a brick unemployed brick on no problem until the last ... brakes got to wonder if we're not we're not\nThat that analogy isn't the way the corn market you look at the drawdown in Chinese stocks\nYou look at our ability to produce good car crop this year and yet we're still going to have less carry out domestically and less worldwide\nWhat is it going to take for the market rules we usually takes that last brick something out there to kick start it whether it's eight Fifteen which probably combination he Fifteen\nMaybe some weather issue and then you get the strong money pushing speculative buying into the market and all of a sudden there's not enough him and tore and it becomes headline news and everybody wants in\nSo I Want to be careful not wishful thinking but look at the way the stock market has gone energy prices more than doubled it has a lot of the same elements that we've seen before with inflationary concerns at higher interest rates all of those elements cycling right back in\nYeah man I like it I like it I it it it's going to be interesting to see what that one last brick might be what that factor might be a but I liked the analogy there right now like it a lot a real quick but\nYeah not too much um unfortunately I got to be the burial not necessarily bad news but just really kind of range bound news they're just as much we liked the stuff that we thought from Canada and hopefully Congress can improve but that is going to take time to implement and really make some some channels in the head ways\nHere's the bottom line you still cheap fate and when you looked at some of his last cop production or up production reports you're not reducing college you're you're you're slaughtering more cows but you're bringing more effort into the mix and so you're right around that nine point for\nA million head and got such a fish and sea and farmers are doing what the best they cut corners but they do they they produced well that is their issue so there again patience with the demand markets but at some point you know something's got to curb that supplied just a little bit to be the that brick dissent prices two or three dollars higher\nThat probably has to be higher grain prices\nYeah yeah no question about it Brian I tell you what it's always fun to sit and talk with you man we need to do it more often\nYes sir my pleasure joy\nI really appreciate the conversation today but that is Bryan Doherty from Stuart Peterson man I tell you what there are a lot of highlights to pull from that conversation I've been making\nSome notes here during ah during the show I'm going to look back at some of the highlights from the conversation

but so painful I'm a cubs fan and I'm Still ...\nWhat are you like that I Do that while they had read the pet enjoy that is that okay\nI mean it depends on you know the angle that he's coming from it like for me as a Mets fan I had the exact same response and it didn't even sound weird when he did it\nBut that it was a little bit harsh from a neutral standpoint I I don't know I wouldn't feel so ...

I think it's too early to sell on ... to tell you who are the victims ... such a small sample size of the season\nI think it'd be really are pretty mature for anyone to say who was a week of um we got there still seems it's still have to earn their strike you know we're not even halfway through the season so I think it's too early posts in the league teams\nAustin when the season starts to reveal itself just as the guy in a team and your experience how many games does it take for you'd have a sense of of the league and have a sense of your own football team\nAre probably like a six a just kind of like a they probably six really between six and send you kind of files ethical or whatever on doing or we can you know everyone was\nTalking to Austin is a very ... the Jacksonville Jaguars tied in here on the program I Know every game matters in sixteen game season\nEvery game is significant you guys are three one teaser for no so far as bill parcell said you are what your record says you are to the best teams in football does a game when you look at the record of your opponent and and like yours it says that this is a really good football team does it feel a little more significant does it take on a little more edge even in say a week five showed him\nWell honestly I think you know go wrong and or has run is really good job of preparing us each week for what we have the front of us we don't look forward I'm more than anyone in Iraq or anything like that we look at the squares and we look how they play\nAnd the chiefs are really really good football team are very very you know they got fallacy or they can run the capacity of the best third down defense and football\nUm and that is critical so uh you know we we we tend not to look at the record we tend to look at the we tend to look at the ... more than anything\nAnd when you look at the film this year at least initially the cheese all of them just been incredible scores most points if a ball it defense not quite not quite as a as stellar what are you only on ...\nThere'd be a factor do you have to put the wealth or down like you know that's that's a really important for\nThe most important one of the most important downs football started down and getting off the field and there was a number one defects right football with that no totally guards and all that you know it's really early self I wouldn't I wouldn't really take too much into their you know over all the facts I think they have a good effect and they have a really ... it's a really good song if you have to be really good\nUm when they were good and third down the best of both authors out so there's a lot of room to grow up and take the money\nThat's really interesting talking to a Austin's very Jenkins here on the show Austin since the gentleman you just referred you a few questions go Doug grown came to Jacksonville in two thousand sixteen\nYou guys have gone for teenage you've won AFC South you've made the AC conference championship game you have an identity that seems to find you can you give us some insight just what it is about about coach from around about the organization that has helped Jacksonville have so much success in such a small window of time\nI think goes wrong is really understand the plays players you know I think he understands the\nOr he wants once was a player um and I think he carries himself in that way you understand the guys who understand you understand us you know we have to put in a good amount of work to be where we want to be if you know sometimes it's hard you know typical but I think the players and him being a\nYou know at one time before I think he knows that those hard practical hard training camp there that commitment to being great that commitment to always putting into hard work and the commitment\nThat everyone works regardless who they are on the team\nI think it really sets the base foundation of togetherness and a family unit that we will do anything for each other I think that's really what you brought to Jacksonville is bringing a family that family feeling to the football field bring our family feeling to to to the work that we put in\nUm that we're all putting we're all doing it together and we're all doing it for each other not just ourselves and I think that's why you see such a remarkable turnaround here\nI'm In the past two years because he has done that\nAustin's varying Jenkins on with me bill Ryder here on CBS Sports radio the tide in for the jags Austin I'm a I'm a pretty passionate\nBig time cubs fan and and things
