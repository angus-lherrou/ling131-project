Grammy hired I was like oh no one wants to mess with her I could just tell and then ever since then she noticed that I deserve to be in the ring and then she let me yet\nBut I mean I ... I was planning to be in the ring and then she let me em but ever since then I've heard so many stories about our through my friends like mojo and other guys about how she can just walk anyone's bought at any time\n[laughter] I feel like I feel like you're kind of soldiers out there are a little bit yeah I hate that\nAnd that's his favorite part of the old days it was all my friends favorite part when the ladies care to guide almost what my but\nIt would have been amazed that an that there is of how many times that video get washed over under ten million views on YouTube grandkids to crack picked out of them by this lady as he described IT security guard traced to you're going over on the ten movies are under\nI'll silver trace I'll agree to do over I like everything about where you guys are for your head dress up growing also talked about when the time has done he's obviously talking about retirement before but whenever his career comes to an end what he wants his legacy\nWow I mean I never really thought about that but I mean just the way of playing the game a on both aspects of the game being able to run block and be able to go out there and cut some balls were safety linebackers corners no matter who was verse so\nOr just to be able to have a complete game and play a complete game at and both sides of the ball of the blocking side and the receiving\nThere's a lot of guys planning a high level like herself at the position you played the tide imposition excluding Robin ... who's the best time to get to is the best tightened any NFL not named off\nOn me and those many great players out there but I mean Dr is tell us I mean I Would say a he's an excellent player or in the way he can just a separation Mick place where his team on and it just helps out big time and he's a guy that is very very talented\nAnd what was one of the I Know there's a lot but it was a one of the toughest offenders that you've gone up against when you see his team on the schedule you know you're gonna have to be particularly good that day\nI mean there's a lot of great defenders out there yeah every single week or no matter who you clay and I would say that you you just never know what you're going to get I mean the NFL is a week to week game and there is some times guys are you just never really hear of\nThat you just never really played before and they could be young\nAnd they're the guys up bringing the most are the guys that brings the hardest\nAnd then there's guys that you hear of and they bring it the hardest and sometimes they don't solve it so weak the weak game I mean I Would say in pain on how every players feeling that week I mean but it's always great to get the best out of everyone and it's always tough competition every week\nAnd last but not least and talking to Rob Gronkowski asked him whether his teen any concerns any point this year about what the patriots would accomplish\nI mean the NFL there's so many up and downs throughout the whole season uh especially at the beginning of the season when you're trying to fill out things throughout the team and uh\nI mean we've lost tuna roll and now we want to in a row we're the worst team and now we're one of the better teams I mean you just can't listen to that type of stuff you just gotta keep moving forward keep trying to get better every single week and just focus on your opponent\nOn no matter who it is that coming back Sunday Coming up so stay focused and basically just do your job and just block out everything else\nYou guys have had back in back thirty eight point outings almost two forty burgers the last two weeks do you feel like the authenticity found its footing in a way maybe it didn't early on\nI mean I feel like we're definitely quicken better than what we were before at the beginning of the season\nAnd we're getting a pieces back\nNot to the office like Julie announcement on John ... coming through getting better every week learning to play book doing a great job so the pieces putting altogether now we've got a great practice week to come up and build some chemistry out there and bring all the guys together\nAnd ah just keep on going from there I mean we always want a fast start we always want to be putting up points but that puts in a lot of time a lot of work and that's what we're trying to do\nYour reference settlement you referenced Gordon one of those two guys present on the field do just to open things up and change the dynamic for you and the rest of the guys authentically\nWith shoes I mean you want good players at a every position on the field and having a guy like Julian back this helps create opportunities for many other players and opportunities for himself\nOr just the way he can get open just energy brings to the field to in the locker room it's just great and how we can get opened underneath catch the ball make some guys miss and get a first down keep the chains moving it just helps are often it's tremendously\nAppreciate

moment\nWhether or not there's two players are not last year this is the moment that Lincoln Riley asserted his program and not the stoops program because the stoops are held in very highly regard in that city and as you may know and the common sense as a very close knit family and obviously that is not a great defensive performance by\nThat defense and Mike stupid took responsibility for the game my sibs a longtime head coach in the lake and that's a respected football guy and so this is the deal to it's a consequences driven profession and driven sport in space on merit but I was an eyebrow raiser for me when the news came to\nNumber two\nSpeaking of top ten teams getting upset previously fifth ranked LSU also law says they felt to previously rank twenty second Florida by scores twenty seven to Nineteen\nThis occurrence wasn't anything new however as the tigers have lost four straight times when they brought a top five ranked team in Gainesville to battle the gators the story of the game was Florida forcing LSU quarterback Joe Burrow into three turnovers including a costly pick six\nAnd you guys asked me last week I think by herself and it was a trace and buy or sell it was three games and I would the favorite losers LSU quid they Oklahoma and who is the third Notre Dame how happy are you guys\nThan it was not you're fighting Irish very very very happy so are you\nDoing man with your sports I mean the Yankees are down the raiders are basically there is over your Notre Dame team as a real\nShot at the college football playoff who am I forget his you're the\nTeam well the Lakers opted out can be exciting what's that gets started yeah you're pretty good shape right to the fore yeah I mean the Yankees aren't done yet but you know kind of seems like it's it's if it's inevitable at this point but\nArsenals doing really well bull Duke in North Carolina look like they could have pretty promising seasons um the Astros and the red Sox as your backup team that looks like that can work out pretty well for you and I didn't realize that's my fault\nYou were such a a Dodger anti brewers fan so that's why things are going you\nKnow Bush really\nAnother Saturday and another dominant performance by quarter back to a ton of Iowa and the Alabama offense to complete a ten of us Thirteen passes for three hundred and thirty four yards for touchdowns in zero interceptions and\nBam a sixty five to thirty one win over Arkansas\nIt made him the first power five quarterback with three hundred yards and for touchdowns in the first half of the conference game since Patrick ... did so in two thousand and sixteen and gets Baylor in the latest Heisman Trophy odds from bow vow to to his ... all the way to minus one fifty as the favorite to win the award\nI mean he is such a revelation and such a special talent is part of the reason I don't know if you notice this guy's\nAlabama's on to win the national championship this year\n... astronomically in their favor and fairly unprecedented\nFor a team to be as heavy a favorite is Alabama in part because what we talked about last year even for people to follow the team closely people talk about when to got recruited once you've got recruited it was the highest recruited quarterback that saving it ever had in Alabama he's the best quarterback statements ever had and that his plane at that level all ready\nRecently until you JAG news what\nWe're seeing more and more families that are faced with crisis is\nThere is a also MERS association Nebraska chapter and they actually do a lot of work in our community he hadn't really tiny help provide services and it also helps to sell a lot of gaps\nThat's just another offsetting deferring some different look to the areas that feel very strongly that

can listen to ease the host of the pick six pod cast a daily NFL ... can't seem to be a sport that you will by\nBoth bell just hanging out here watching I'm\nWatching Drew Brees chases Peyton Manning record is the first time yesterday in all stopped talking about it I\nWill be for um we get anything before you check any updates don't look at what you were in the same fantasy football league would you be interested in change I Am happy to give them to you because I like is a friend of just how\nTough I wasn't fired happily trade for them um I think the eagles might be the team that they have to look at trading for a potential running back and the name still here was out there who's conflicting reports could lay beyond bell I certainly would be extreme you know you can treat me like a bell for judge I\nI Know what if I can break into Evers accounts has it I Will I Will do it [laughter] then I guess I got to ask you a Pentagon homes question again\nIs that when they get to Denver was so impressive what do you make now how do we increase our assessment of and if we do based on what are you to get into a very impressive Jacksonville defense\nYeah I mean I I mean I think bill like the the thing about\nMy home to and I continue to be oppressive in these in these two weeks since you know he put up this huge stats and then came back and and now has managed to to produce not as ... games but you know when it gets really good defense is that this is the guy who's willing to take what how to defenses will give so\nHe and Andy Reid clearly are on the same page you know had to pick up a few of the world and\nUm and I think that you can tell that that\nPatrick ... homes is willing\nTo you know to he doesn't he doesn't he's not the gunslinger we thought he was going to be really we thought you're going to go out and just you know throw the few times a week um their throat for five hundred yards whether or not you know he was thirty nine picks a game or whatever it was the opposite doubt I think\nI think we're the point where we can trust the cheese to operate efficiently and and really if their defense keeps playing well this is a very scary key I mean I I look at the chiefs and\nUh I Know most people wouldn't put up above the rams but I think you could make the case that they're right there with the rest\nWill Brunson here on the show will the patriots are going to play they're going to host the cheese and we'd sex knowing that and normal and seen so far from New England do you feel like that organization is out of the woods in terms of their slow start\nYeah they're five built up the ... the defensive and get primary picky picky over in this game is it fifty nine which is just absurd number but it opened at fifty eight or maybe fifty seven and a half it's going to keep growing up I think\nBecause this is a you know these are two teams that do have great defenses and there are two of the best officers in football um you know with a captain by Tom Brady and Patrick ... homes you're going to see them go up top and take some shots you can see them move the ball quickly and you saw how fast you're the patient patriot you're coming off a ten day rats\nOr that she's got beat up by the jaguars they still should be fine on off and it's a Sunday night game I think it's gonna be fireworks go war and I don't expect either team to be able to stop the other teams often you know barring some kind of horrible weather up in up in New England I think you would see a lot of points scored in this game and\nYou know I don't I mean the patriots are out of the woods in the sense of\nThey're going to win the AFC East because the rest of the division is terrible but dolphins looked like fraud the jets have young quarterback um\nThe bills are still trying to figure some stuff out that's the beauty of the patriots set up for the last decade or so\nIs they've been able to you know to spend a half or quarter this season\nFiguring out what their identity is on one side of the ball Tom Brady he's got a window of a lot of games with the author Joshua Daniels set it up well so they can sort of figure things out defensively saw him do it last year and then you get to the playoffs agricultural wins\nYou know get some of your own advantage make a run and and all of a sudden it's a different cliques they can win a title I I just think that the the same formula is going to operate perfectly fires we're giving them the season as it has for the last seven hundred years\nWell Brunson how good are the Cleveland Browns or not\nEven really I mean this this is even thinner jerk bill and um I ... ... dollars by one and a half I Believe hosting the chargers this week in week sick I wouldn't be surprised off it'd be Los Angeles\nYeah Philip Rivers is a great quarterback that pettiness cooking really well I don't think this is a good match up to the the the brown defense is is one of the top five unit to the league right now and I think that that's a legitimate thing now\nI'll simply they still have some was Baker may feel is is a rookie year he's made some mistakes you know as I mentioned drugs that you can see\nThe future coming together for them and then ultimately are handicapped by the fact that they ask you jak with her head coach your he he might be overseeing this project for the the ... get better and started to come along\nBut he's also the guy who who consistently cost them a couple of points for a week and I'm pretty sure he was\nRaising his fingers to like we've never to either to go for two after making your game when it's your goal or to let his team go there were two second thoughts on the clock and it overturn roe kicked gave when Israel though I'm not entirely sure what he was doing\nUm the game was over there one and uh I I just think that he's going to limit their ceiling for they can certainly rip off a couple of friends that ended up keeping themselves involved with the playoff conversation\nBrunson here on the show will I'm going to give you a few teams that are under five hundred by all means including other teams if ... if you think of excluding somebody\nThey're off conversation will Brunson here on the show we'll give you a few teams that are under five hundred\nBy all means including other teams if ... if you think of excluding somebody but between the eagles who were two and three he was he was gone to two and three the lions are now two and three Dallas has lost two and three Denver which of those teams do you believe is going to be playing postseason football when that rolls around\nAll of the Dallas is going to be their houses terrible um the eagles are still coming together I mean you know they're the last ... I mean that's it that's a hit because if they can they can operate their off and she got a you know a power of a running back he was like a a pound or undergraduate treated tackles\nPermanently ... bought last year they have\nThey need a physical rather to pick up their shortage plays\nUm course which not entirely healthy quite yet also an Jeffrey still working its way back the defense is not as good as it was the last year although the defense of lines playing really well I just I mean if I'm picking a\nGod I mean I I don't know that I mean it would be the eagles would be the answer because they think they can get rolling in that division is still very bad\nUm but I'm not entirely confident and all those teams I think you can bury guys like the falcons and the the raiders\nUm I I'm not buying the Broncos they lost a bad when the Kansas City that go on the road and get blasted defensively by the federal jets in the Bronx or the the the threats isn't that good Chris Harris is a great quarterback\nI'm Bradley ... by Ravi industry a couple of times they they do if you're identical outrage at three hundred yards events and do this is a situation in Denver where it's a man\nOr we we thought we could assign case we might be close enough to to make it up and running as it turns out we need to blow this whole thing off\nFor instance who do you like this you're who's going to win the NFC North\nBy ... your\nAir yeah buddy I mean\nI I haven't done anything kitten\nI I we need to see a little bit more from Mitchell trip is he a division Stillwater if Congress put themselves in the road as part of your early by this tax and wins should before it never really a good defense I think the one thing I have few concerned about what the defense\nAs talented as it is it's really it's really it's not it's not to eat and serve they suffered injuries on frontline starters\nYou could really see should drop off they're playing the sexual football I'm the opposite is starting to take a step forward I I I'm not by the missile trip is you can have this of moms to break out and after the by but I Do think the usage of Rico and is sort of the the ... century kill roller revolving involving him just like a future back\nInstead of Jordan Howard makes it off it's more dynamic lets them do more of what Matt wants to do and so I I wouldn't I Would at this point it wouldn't be surprised that they won the Vikings are afraid to fall and they're all sorts of line\nYear old just airtight or news talk W.

of weight is\nI mean you're talking best picture front runner and it's an amazing trailer an amazing movie and just trays and with the man like as the ... the killer song about a year ago I thought it was new\nI should say when I found out I was twenty Seventeen I was shocked I really thought this is like one of the new songs I was like oh wow I'm onto the new music before like everyone else and then I'm pretty late in the party\nDon't worry news you know as long as you get to that party it's all good I'm with you I didn't I didn't know those long either I liked the killers to earlier in the show earlier today we had CBS forces combat writer Brian Campbell on the show\nBe Campbell CBS on Twitter ... and he was at USC two twenty nine where\nMcGregor got really dominated by it'd be I still can't believe\nThe domination that played itself out in the octagon in that final fight\nA beep just don't know and I asked Brian for his reaction as a guy in the building to be to defeating Conor McGregor\nIt maybe could have been in that spot this whole idea of like wow this guy is not a magician this guy's a human being and it's not that we hadn't seen kinda McGregor lose before right I I was Kate side when he lost and they did as ringside we lost a Floyd Mayweather but I guess there's some justification than those losses to a certain degree with the\nDifferent sports different weight classes this certainly\nThe initial feeling was wow you know I I Believe too much in the end the call of Conor McGregor that there really was this magic in him that could carry him to the next level against anybody but that feeling though was quickly overwhelmed by just how can I say damn on this show just how\nYou handle it interests if ... was\nAnd that everything he said he was going to do a you know then I'm going to smash year boy he did he controlled that fight bill not just from a wrestling standpoint like we all thought could end would happen if this fight when you know three four rounds\nBut that third round when he stood up and went toe to toe with Connor and at worst fought on an even level in in terms of boxing and the stand up and drop Connor around to that over and write that showed me that he didn't just dominate this fight against and the lead guy against a guy who would build the resume already is one of the best in history\nBut he broke and mentally like he absolutely\nDominated and he's the ... though I Know it's a messy situation now we're going to talk suspensions and arrest and all that stuff but he'll even met off as the best fighter in the world\nI Am a big Ryan Campbell fan\nAnd Brian is really cool\nBut I did kind of get a kick out of him asking on the air if you can say the word damn by saying the word damn sue your the producer of the show\nBut doesn't it seem like if you're not sure\nJust don't say it right set of ask you if you could say while saying the word and I found the D word my ... ... ... ... if you say it and you say you're defeating the purpose of asking\nYeah Brian those you have you guys are edging man I so many times I've had and I love you see I've had we've had us the fighters on this show\nPreview shows and they just can't not drop F bombs like guys stop doing it I I guess if the you know transferred to the writers in a in a PG Thirteen kind of way\nObviously the biggest story out of USC two twenty nine unfortunately for the sport\nWasn't Habib combination of McGregor\nBut the reaction after the fight\nWill be jumps out of the octagon\nAnd goes after someone from McGregor camp\nAnd some people from ... camp jumped in the big on and one of those guys certainly appears sucker punch Conor McGregor in the head from behind McGregor is not looking which is really dangerous and so I asked Brian who was there for all the mainland the chaos his reaction to what took place after the fight\nDid have a couple of moments they're not just where you are fearing for your own safety but honestly don't your fearing for the sport\nAnd this was sort of take I had after kinda McGregor is April attack and how he really wasn't punished by the U. S. C. for this\nYou're setting a dangerous precedent when you're allowing yourself to get that close to the fire because once you get burned it takes a long time to fix those problems once boxing had that Riddick Bowe Andrew ... a lot of ... followed by the Tyson Holyfield brawl the following year with the air by\nAnd the crowd fighting each other boxing it wasn't on regular TV for upwards of Twenty years after that and I'm not saying that's the only reason\nBut you'll lose sponsorships you lose acceptance\nAnd then it may in us see you can say it's an insane success story that they've gotten this far that they've just signed a major deal with ESPN they could have lost it in one night though\nI have this and appreciate Brian Campbell time I just processing what Drew Brees accomplishing what will get into it in a in a very um hopefully interesting way tomorrow\nI Know it's amazing to be the all time leading passing leader in NFL history it's an incredible accomplishment\nI think is a strong case to be made but I'll probably make tomorrow\nFor Drew Brees is plays in the game to be on the level of or beyond even Peyton Manning as much as some people can trace deal with it some people are going to lose their minds but I Do\nAnd the game to be on the level of or beyond even Peyton Manning as much as some people can trace deal with it some people are going to lose their minds\nBut I don't\nYour one of the oh 'cause you're a college guy trays though is that when I was coming from that one not pay mandate hurt\nYou know or how many touchdowns interceptions he had the first year in Indianapolis when they beat the civil\nOr paid in the first year the year that he won his first of all oh a it was I don't other issue now three touchdowns seven

worse statistical quarterbacks ever make and then when it's all\nIt's all ... while there might be the better option when he came back\nWas that some are a little little\nLittle little preview\nI

get ten million a year but darn before season even started made the dumbest person personal Walker was John Ritter you're getting rid of ... when you see what he's doing is you're cargo and how bad their defenses without him so he came in with this or this big persona biggie or do you all remember where out of town and now the teams are terrible\nImage look even worse now there's all talk about them getting forced out Oakland early this call seems like it's a complete mess when you're ...\nI I just think that the problem with him coming back was and what's making this worse the money's obviously making it bad because he was paid like a guy who won seven Super Bowl at all\nAnd he was paid like a guy who's been doing it the guy had coached a football game in ten years and you pay them like he was coming off to straight Super Bowl was right that's the issue here is I don't have so much of an issue of him coming back to coach\nYou know the guy that's what he is he's a football coach what the issue is is it took too long and he's getting paid too much money you\nThank God and you know you've heard this before many times on there's a touchdown this is unbelievable there just pouring and on now forty it's going to end up being forty to Thirteen if they kicked the extra points so um do you think I heard this before do you think the game is passed\nHim by like does he seemed like a guy that's a with it\nI think there's a little bit of that right now too I think they're really interest yeah I think there it might take him is full year they're going to take a lot of lumps this year and it might take a nap before he sees what's ... I Know we were sitting up in a booth wants to run but he's going to see what really goes on in the NFL this year\nDo you think he was better than this guy a wedding is\nAbsolutely on one hundred percent ... the nobody's doing up there and maybe maybe it'll get better but there was a million times better\nI don't know why you owe him a no offense to it and what do you owe him\nI mean 'cause 'cause jumping Americanized there's a lot of his element it's they should have put them in the situation is not as both as\nBounded who's bright idea was that to have this guy\nGet the most important gig in football basically right Monday Night football as well it's kind of become a joke now Monday Night football\nBut like Thursday night was considered a joke now all of a sudden it's a hot commodity with Fox doing it right everybody thinks Thursday nights are great now and it's actually gotten to the point where it's it's replaced Monday Night football\nMonday Night football now it has been the problem with all these changes they've made like every year it seems like they're making changes to it and I just think\nYou know now I actually think the guy burgers doing a better job than the guys in the booze\nOr group so the guy sitting down by the sideline is actually the one that's teaching me the most and talking to be like sensibly during the game I honestly I have to say that I before I get a going on anything else I promise that we would talk about this fiasco and Vegas I don't have a lot of time but we can talk about it on that I just want to scratch the surface of it right now\nAre first of all a ... well not in the rye and bitter about it do what he thought of it later he's fighting this Friday at the Mohegan Sun and there's a ballot or a heavyweight championship but what do you think of ah what happened you know from the point where a bead literally as you know beat his ass and\nLet Debbie a JAG take you to see them eating legend share live in concert in Omaha Beach I Am center I may have serious concerns are just a constant\nOver the top costume changes and the choreography to all of ... ... to one hundred and eighty one dollar per person and put his grades these infection one's funny and the motor coach\nDoor the W.

problem and then he went around still drinking knowing that he was an alcoholic I mean you are just getting for this orange\nAre listening\nOur buddy a\nBill Michael joins us now from the great state of Wisconsin is everywhere else is global eyes on all over the state and he's got a lot to talk about tonight\nI Want to start or how you doing belly I'm doing well how you doing walking back I might thanks man a very exciting so uh\nI got to ask you first before I get into the brewers ... about ... what I mean at some point what has gone wrong with Mason Crosby that he misses all these uh you know feel goals and they have to be just freaking out about what's going on with this guy\nWell two things first and foremost they didn't directly point a finger ready to go along snapper the holder which has JK Scott rookie partner but you got the indication that maybe there was something wrong there mechanically between those two show we'll see if they get it worked out but\nRemember a couple of years ago about three or four years ago Mitch across he went through the same thing it's kind of a way I equate it it's like a golf game man when your swing goes and you put everything in the woods\nAnd you do everything you can get out of it it's just you just need to get off the field goal way have a drink and come back in the other day\nAnd ... we went through that for almost an entire season and they stuck with them and then he figured it out even for the best kicker last four or five years so they're going to stick with him gather freaking out a little bit because that's just not nation because it can get in your head but\nI I don't think there's a little blurb Walsh type of thing where he is just all of a sudden going to go sideways I think he's going to be okay but this is something that are obviously very concerning when you leave\nYou know what twelve points on the board you lose by eight so this is this is something that's going to be a little bit concerning for a while until he gets a if you say ten twelve in a row\nI mean five ... for a field I was in an extra point it was embarrassing uh what did you find when I was like twenty or not they were they down something like that and and it's hard veiled\nYes they were and it was ugly and it was it just makes you Crosby I mean the office has been dysfunctional this you know what we hear this crap every year about nobody needs to play with extra dollar starters\nAnd then we're going to be just fine and every year it's four or five games this thing's dysfunctional then you throw Aaron Rodgers mini injury on top of it over the last two to three weeks he hasn't really been right I mean he's been good at sports obviously the second half of that game you put a big numbers and if you read his members over four hundred yards three touchdowns\nNo interceptions in New York at a quarterback reading it say man they should have won that game going away but they're doing it and catch up they were behind the bears are behind the Vikings I meet shorter the special teams touched down\nOr you know obviously what happened in Washington was ugly the only thing they weren't really behind to was the Buffalo Bills and then they get behind it again this week things aren't right right now in Green Bay and there's a lot of fingers W appointed to head coach the play color and uh and the guy that brings out the personnel packages if you kind of read some of the veil commented Aaron Rodgers\nAt and what do you think is a injuries and problems that they continue to pretend like I said you asked me don't exist but they do\nThey do I I completely agree with you I I think you can say Aaron Rodgers has never been this off I mean when he's missing wide open receivers you can say OK something's wrong with the guy uh but\nYou can say Aaron Rodgers has never been this off I mean when he's missing wide open receivers you can say OK something's wrong with the guy or but what is so remarkable to me as he had this innate ability to feel pressure\nAround him when he doesn't even see it and the less I mean to get ... seconds stripped twice in one game is on a horde of for Aaron Rodgers he's looked pretty good last week he looked pretty good and pretty mobile with that need but he's still just off on froze and\nYou don't notice he's hanging on to the ball I mean he's got guys that are checked downs that her first downs nine ten eleven yards down field he's not taking them he's looking for the big play now he's made a career doing that\nBut right now when you're a little bit nicked out maybe you should just live to fight another day take the first down moved to stick to continue on down the field especially when you're working with a lot of young receivers\nBecause he had Randall ... Adams was the only guy that was really there you had ... and the guy that they're really rely upon as well he was out of the concussion protocol and the Jimmy ... got a bad knee again there I see him on the sidelines and between series so\nYou know right now there next up on our fencing in Aaron Rodgers isn't doing a ton of helping self beginning to end their playing maybe too good quarters of football\nSo I Know it's a week from than I but I Do you think they'll be able to handle their business and land on against the niners\nPut it this way they'd better because if they don't\nAfter that they've got the by and then they come back and then they face LA in LA and take on the rams then they go to New England before they come back home\nAnd they don't have an easy stretch then they go back on the road to Seattle and then they got to go back in the U.S bank stadium and face the Vikings again if they don't get a win this week is it about as much ... must win as you can get it if they don't get it this week and they go on a losing streak the season's over McCarthy's fire they're cleaning house\nWow I mean that's just an extreme is that like the name\nBut they know what might have a party painted himself into a corner when they were he was asked a couple of years ago about assistant coaches he said after a while you just need a new voice it's not that they did a bad job you need a new voice guys tune you out and you've already heard you know Aaron Rodgers sniping with with Mike mccarthy\nI you know we've seen this story before and they figured it figured out remember that one year he says Arielle a acts and then the other year he said hey we can run the table there still are football left but you've got to win this game and you got to start something positive going into the going into the by week and a self scout or you're really in trouble as a football team\n[noise] wow uh so I don't mind goes with us let's talk about the brewers I have to say that\nI actually on it for Elena bass my less than one as far as ... as I said and on that show too that I I was taking the brewers didn't win the pennant and and to actually go to the world series I got the best team in baseball over last month and a half you know\nAny age does just teams and raise frankly but the brewers to me had then internationally the best team you know I Know the Dodgers are doing their normal thing there in the postseason again but I think the brewers have played better baseball than even the Dodgers\nThe brewers are doing in many different facets the only area that they're struggling in right now is hitting with runners in scoring position but otherwise otherwise they're doing everything they need to do and this whole thing that gets highly criticized do\nIf you are behind on your

JR Smith tried to be just a\nYeah I when I Would think so I see all these people like just in Thompson guaranteeing that they're the team to beat a niece that's not true either\nUh uh but my thought is ah what do you think the browns can do this weekend against the charters about a three point spread\nYeah I listen I I thought it one at the chargers laying one so I I think you know\nI'm not going to deny the browns or look good you know defensively I Love ward I I like this you know the events peppers and everybody on a Garrett I like um I I don't think they're bad I never went out going in and the season I didn't think they were going to be that bad or\nYou know going into every game they play now they're in the game or they should have won the Oakland games do they blew that they had that game wrapped up and then show\nI thought they had the game and open one and the raiders that was my number one play that data writers winning that game they won by three they were laying too but I still don't think the raiders are better than the browns to be honest with you and I thought the brown so great against Baltimore and uh obviously you have to think that uh if you think\nThat the chargers are better and that they're just going to win this game easily then I'm sure the browns or when\nThey write whatever you think's going to happen it won't happen that way so that's the way the NFL wants to whatever you think is automatic will go the other way a tent out of ten times anything you think as a certainty in the NFL guarantee that that it's uncertain it's automatic\nI mean everything it doesn't matter who's playing it doesn't matter what the circumstances are like the bills no one doctor bills were going to be the titans the titans where suddenly the best defensive game they're beating the super bowl champions they're winning they're brave all everybody's bragged member before the game rebels your greatest couch\nPlayers love blame marry out a lot they all love and they'll walk to fire form and then what happens they go out in the bills beat him\nAnd so I don't think anyone died the bells are going to win the game to be honest with you besides garb awry but the bills you know played um topped all day and beat him there's all kinds of games that I thought were bizarre no one died the browns are going to push the ravens around no one got the lions are we going to beat the Packers\nAre no it's not the jets when when they never win or I don't think anyone thought the Steelers would blow out the falcons 'cause you can't beat anybody demolished them to know adopt the giants\nWere going to a went in Charlotte they didn't but no one thought they'd have the lead with five seconds left either\nOr you know I think we both are the chargers with when I don't think people thought the Vikings would be the eagles they beat him in the NFC title game I don't think anyone thought the cardinals were gonna when they did ... I don't think anyone does the odds were going to go toe to toe with the rams all day and lose by two\nAnd I think the taxes would win but I had the cowboys and three and having a governor and I thought the saints win win and I laid the six and a half so that was fine but I think you know what I'm suggesting here as a matter of what you think\nUh start drinking the exact opposite and you'll probably start winning some bats because you cannot bet on a team now with any confidence and think you're going to win the bat so if you just can't go the other way completely and have no idea what you're doing that team will usually when now uncover is that about right Garber I seriously\nYou're right there I think that every week now\nYou see games that you just you can't believe it at the end of the day like how did this team beat that team and my team is kind of been the the kind of team that's been waving the flag for that this year because\nI mean we went into Minnesota and we do and beat the Vikings are out of your week three out of nowhere even yesterday everybody was on a tight\nThey right they took us off of their website like did you know that that they did not know they eliminated our county as like a one of the places where the basketball they're like they're done they're boom they took it out so when people are going on there to try to sign up it didn't work\nIt's because they took it off they thought we were ... what are you surprised that an eight days I was able to get\nFive loaded beams of players to sign up and pay to play\nNo I'm not surprised at all because ruin who's doing also part of the things anyway before and all the numbers middle the contacts you the one making sure there were five guys on his team for every game so we never forfeit you're always doing before so it didn't surprise me really good at going to die\nSo are you going to pay you excited that will be playing again a on Wednesday night starting this Wednesday\nAre very excited to get back to work out of the girls went up and down the court so\nDo you think will be better or worse without a our boy Tommy Messina\nThey're going to be a very New York times reporter but he's also a guy there wasn't there consistently was our whether it be for work brings a lot of times when you know it's just miserable should he was there for maybe half the game's best\nSo it's just going to be business as usual for us the guy that always show up yeah\nI think so especially because it seems like we always play better when there's less dogs not the you know when\nI was in the news the rest of your role in good shape we all know how to play with each other so when we're not changed a lot of you know five different times every half hour or two guards with regards you're going to get time works a lot better for us\nDid you like the name of the one team that I gave a that refused to return my messages and they wouldn't I kept asking them what you want to call you again what do you want to go to Jim I Need an answer blah blah blah and they never came on so I named them for them but I ...\nI thought there were to go to the movies\nOn the crime Amy do you think they would have liked that pain name\nNot all member crowd about it would have to name\nCrybaby [laughter] that would have been great for all bars against the cry babies on Wednesday night eight Fifteen to [laughter]\nI called them Harry's pub\nLike a barn pub is that right where they are there's a bar with grub is a pub is that right I don't know anyway and then do varies by the guy wouldn't return my call so I just name the team for 'em and then they actually liked it they're like wow that's a cool name like All right thanks\nBe their Wednesday or games any for saying don't be late anyway I think one\nThing I noticed as well tonight or I was watching hockey the ducks won that game in a shootout and the guy that is the host of the show I Will not\nName names but I used to work with them and now

because there's so many bad ones now that they need to fire a mall and hire new ones\nYou know what I mean so let 'em rap for like an extra for years and then have your kids in training to be a rapper and um he could end up having a really good job and you know 'cause the guy said raff believe it or not you know the ones that are like fulltime NFL fulltime baseball fulltime NBA they make good money right and not\nThat great money I'm not going to sit here and act like they're rich\nBut they're making they're making\nIn my view right am I wrong like roll over six figures right aren't day like making a couple of three hundred grand for on a grand some of them probably\nWouldn't you think so I got to tell you that it would appear to me that that that would be a job he actually go get you could actually become a rapper and on and make it in this business because people say how hard it is to become on how hard can it be to become one when everyone that's in it sucks\nI mean honestly if everyone ... said their job isn't that a good job to go after less than this guy socks on better I'll prove it watch\nAnd then you get a job and then you're on your way right now I'll get in and let's just keep using the crappy ones we got because they are atrocious I mean if you watch the NBA game you'll want to stick a gun in your mouth the calls are so bad I mean all night it's every night the whole night\nI mean harassed literally and the home arise milk toast calls that they make the the home team calls that they make in the NBA are absolutely the worst it never ends\nThe NFL now every good play that happens I I don't ever celebrate any play ever like I got your teams go down in the first thing I Do is spend five minutes looking for flags right 'cause there's a flag on every play\nThere's never just a touchdown anymore he noticed in the NFL without a five minute review and that and a couple of flags how many flags are thrown where there's two calls in one play like a hundred hundred and again we've got offsetting penalties they call somebody flags I Can't even keep track of them they got multiple ... you know thrown on every play\nIt does it not drive any are you not watch any sports and all they do ... I mean it's the entire game now it's become about rafts it's not about the players that are making hundreds of millions of dollars that we want to watch I Wanna watch players may play I don't watch sports to watch wraps\nI think that unfortunately it's all kind of just become part of the of the game experiences that you know you're going to have\nUm more than half the time some questionable officiating whether you're watching the NFL the NBA major league baseball\nIt it really doesn't matter um the officiating and all of them is horrible and the reason also why the officiating is at least criticized and works now right is because we now have access to so much more technology and ... and things like that that we instantly know how bad the calls are instantly we know\nAnd I guess to me just given them throwing the small little bit of a bone there doing it in real time but the problem with that is\nEven sometimes when they go to that review things they still get to know who knows as part of the game Austin and Minnesota here on CBS merge radio\nAre always doing my man era and I just\nWant to buy you a ball my Minnesota Vikings I'm ... ... ... he's got like a team of media through to everybody wrong at all to go back to to play playing out of ... speaking by and I don't care if you agree with me or not he planned amazing\nTrue to everybody wrong at all to go back to to play playing out of it freaking by and I don't care if you agree with me or not he planned amazing\nIDs and I don't know about amazing but I think he's done a pretty good job I amazing really I I don't think he's been amazing at all\nWell I mean he's he's strong for three hundred four hundred yards and almost every game is played so far two three touched off the game and what that um I mean you need to get out of the more that bad I Will say I mean he he's he's a boxer quarterback guy will not move out of pocket ex wife bubbled three times a year\nAnd so he's a body quarterback that needs to get out of the pocket more is what you're saying to me but the bottom line is it'd be so great and why are they doing to\nI I agree with you there I mean that's the goal of the whole other ball game and you got the phone number wondering if you find some elite last year overall as far as I Know that this year I mean or they rake I mean it got to be asked\nThey barely ... they they've allowed a six fewer points than the lions so I I don't\nI don't think their defense or I'd gotten their defense look good yesterday frankly for me the first time all year now I Will never forget the buffalo loss okay so that's who they're capable of being on any given Sunday they could be that day and the one that got smoked by the bills\nBoat so to\nRule\nOver ...\nInvestigators say the ... failed in the section last month the driver was not properly life this Fox News [noise]\nNo huge AG sky watching whether the whether our weather center closed it\nDown to about forty five night under overcast guys with isolated thunderstorms likely wins out of the north eight Fifteen miles an hour ... tomorrow isolated thunderstorms likely forty five\nYear old just stare kite or news talk W.

Ingram being back which I think part of the crowd and then everyone was just waiting you know to see this moment because you know everyone sort of knew that Drew Brees [noise]\nYou know would get two hundred and one yard but he needed to break paid Manigault time passing urge record and I think I was pretty surprised that it happened\nIn the first task is watching it as a good defense but uh\nYou know it became apparent right away that to Washington with no match for the faint and then uh I thought it was a pretty fitting way for him to break the record on a long touchdown pass which is sort of been a staple play\nI'm not that specific play but you know just the idea of Drew Brees going deep um you know in the Sean Payton often they've been doing that but that Thirteen Years and you know it was just\nA while to see the fans erupt and then you know the Drew Brees give the ball to the hall of fame president and then you know catch his daughter and his wife and his sons and hug Sean Payton\nAnd it was just a really memorable moment and the and one that I'm sure everyone here won't forget\nWhat the saints and coach paint and have to say about being part of this moment\nBut it I think they were all just really happy for uh drew and and it was actually interesting you compare what everyone else was saying just you know talking about a ... you know the greatest quarterback of all time in it he met them and saying that all year especially after that falcons game um where he really put the team on his back\nBut you know Sean Payton and Drew Brees both really didn't want to reflect too much but certainly you know everyone was just really happy that drew at this moment because I think a lot of people here\nSort of think that he's been under rated uh for a long time in this week and I think you know in a situation like this it really puts him in the spotlight and one that you know a lot of people here think that he deserves a meanwhile breeze you know total opposite was just\nWanting to get credit than everyone else talking about you know the\nPlayers that you know help them do the the coaches and and all that stuff but I mean he was trying as best as they ... but um you know I think you know everyone here was just really happy for him\nHow emotional did he get because he looked like he got a little bit emotional\nWhen the saints in the NFL stop the game to take the ball and to recognize that\nHe was really emotional I mean it after the game that was one thing\nThat definitely stood out was that he said\nThat he'd actually cried a few times this week because he was a sort of picturing\nWhat this moment it'd be like and he was thinking about all the people that helped them get to the\nWhite wow a you know he said I'm I'm thinking about how to the biggest influences\nIn his life or his mother and his grandfather and they're both dead but he knows you know they were looking down on him tonight and every night and his family and all that\nStuff [noise] me definitely a broke down a little bit he didn't cry on the podium but I mean certainly you could see you know that it was an ...\nAnd all that so we definitely a broke down a little bit he didn't cry on the podium but I mean certainly you could see you know that it was an emotional moment for him [noise]\nJosh catching scene is with us from the times Picayune covers the saints and was there for this historic moment Drew Brees becoming the NFL's all time\nPassing yards leader it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio how would you describe what drew has meant to the city of New Orleans saints he got their Thirteen Years ago\n[noise] I didn't so much ah I wrote in a story leading up to the the um\nI mean he might be you know I mean he's one of the most important people in the city's history I mean if you ask just people in New Orleans I mean Drew Brees is by far one of their favorite New Orleans and he's not even from here and he doesn't even you know spend a lot of his off season's here I mean he spends a lot of time back in San Diego\nUm but you know just this this city rallies so much around the pain and\nThat he was the one to help them you know sort of\nDig out of a Hurricane Katrina you know lifting a city back in two thousand six with that big dome coming game with the police and um and then you know a few years later to to lead them to a Super Bowl championship the first and the franchise history I mean when it's all said and done there's going to be I Would think multiple statues of Drew Brees\nThat wouldn't be surprised I mean in\nIn the five year weight that he has to you know set out to get into all the same I Would think that you know the New Orleans will be doing plenty of stuff to to recognize him that he doesn't have to spend any time you know sitting and waiting for a those honors I mean people here to love him and\nIf you have hard water the lime scale not only leads white spots that plugs pipes and breaks down

Monday Night football in in New Orleans as I was watching that moment with Drew Brees with his teammates and his family and I was thinking of how much I admire him\nBut I also thought and I tweeted this that I Can't imagine a better ambassador for the sport and for the league for a lot of reasons he\nAs you hear people say over and over he's he's done it the right way I mean Peyton Manning said that is tribute video after he\nYou know got done grousing about the fact that he no longer with the record holder but Peyton Manning set it Jason waiting set it on Monday Night football as they were kind of basking in that moment they're inside the superdome\nI've seen other people former quarterbacks in the NFL longtime athletes themselves but not if they can even LeBron James sitting in between\nHe made I mentioned that particularly but there was another athlete from another sport that I saw highlighted all the post game show that said you did it the right way it may have been around\nBut what if people point to Drew Brees has an incredible work ethic which is allowed him to stay not just competitive but on the top of his game at thirty nine years old he's durable\nOutside of the shoulder injury he doesn't miss much time and that shoulder injury was back in two thousand\nFive he joined the saints in two thousand six\n... I don't know if this is true or not because I've never actually been in the same room with drew but\nI've heard people say even though he's lifted that six foot he's no more than five ten which is my height and you can see sometimes he is throwing over the top of it all but the blind men depending on the angle and and how far he dropped back\nHe shocked that both in the air it's\nAbout his accuracy it's about as preparation he was Mike up\nOn this edition of Monday Night football and there was one exchange with Sean Payton that really highlighted his\nHis ability to\nTo make a change or to pinpoint in detail that could be the difference between\nA first down a touchdown even just a successful play\nIn which they were you know Sean Payton call for a play and they were working on a particular play coming off the sidelines and he says just showing well hey this guy's been on the field all week and practice for this particular play we should have him on the field and Sean like oh yeah okay\nAnd and he's really an extension of his head coach out there in the huddle\nThere is this unbelievable trust there is also wisdom and experience is there anything on the football field that Drew Brees hasn't seen no we split is the highest\nHe's won the Superbowl he knows what the defense of doing before the snow is what the defense is doing and so his mind is a great asset\nAnd obviously introduced himself to the nation during the the Indians and parents in the world series a couple of years ago\nBut he has he recognized\nEither face or name enough that people will listen when he speaks does he carry that kind of an impact does he cast that kind of a shadow you guys can tell me but I appreciate the suggestion Albert on Twitter might trout LeBron James said Crosby Drew Brees ...\nThat'd be\nTo be an interesting one his resume\nOn the ice any injury if he's overcome\nUnparalleled I mean he's a once in a lifetime player he's amazing\nBut she didn't ambassador to\nBe a guy that ah that speaks a lot or that at least commander sits really quiet I'm not suggesting we shouldn't listen to what he has to say but only that he\nHe's president is his presence is not quite as magnanimous if that makes sense it's not necessarily requirement is just something that I'm thinking about who is the best ambassador for the sport\nI don't even know that said would want to be an ambassador front page [laughter] though he certainly is fantastic at his crab so again\nTwitter Ala radio or on Facebook after hours with Amy Lawrence who are the top ambassadors for the four major team sports in a U.S and you can use the hashtag ...

hours\nRan Road Home\nAfter oh we're [noise]\n\nThe Dodgers are onto their third consecutive and the S. and their fourth championship series in six seasons but there'll be on the road this year they do not have a home field advantage there'll be on the road in Milwaukee\nTo take on the brewers who haven't been there since two thousand eleven many Machado with a three year run home run\nAs you hear Charlie Steiner say on the Dodgers radio network his signature moment since the Dodgers traded for him with the Orioles before the deadline David Freese I mean this guy's a postseason killer he's oppose even giant ah and he comes through with a big hit as well so between the two of them a A N and pitching staff\nDid the job against the Braves abetting but not break kind of a thing rich hill was the starter Ryan match that actually got the when\nPedro by as we saw came to my eat a a in a non safe situation we saw kindling chance and all these guys getting their work and I'm not sure David Roberts could have drawn up any better it wasn't a sweep like we saw with the brewers over the Rockies\nBut it certainly was a series in which you again solve the home runs because that's what the Dodgers do they set a National League record for most home runs in a single season in two thousand Eighteen and I think it's a culmination of a season that\nDidn't actually come easy for that I'm not sure if you'll remember at the beginning of the year they were talking about a World Series hangover and they were talking about being nervous and recognizing ... what's at stake and how if they didn't get back to the world series it would\nBe a disappointment and all of that pressure on them\nAt the beginning they didn't respond well then they lost Corey Seeger they're all star shortstop and Justin Turner was out for what the the first a month and a half or so a Clinton courage show was on the ... they had a they had a health issue that they had to deal with ... and that he had to deal with until he was out for a while\nThey stretch where their bullpen last like a dozen games in a row or something I mean they they were nine games back on may first I Believe nine games back on may first and it took them until game one sixty three to be able to win\nThat an Old West division but if you backup even to the final three weeks of the season there was a chance that we're going to miss the blouse altogether\nBecause of how hot in St Louis cardinals were and how well the Colorado Rockies were playing and so this is a different type of uh see that but it's still great preparation for now I'm\nA match up with a brewer seem to want to Lebanon consecutive games\nWe took a hard time to get to this point but I Do think it made us a\nStronger and kind of galvanized or ... or team but you know we celebrate tonight but I Know that we all know the\nYou know there's a lot more work to be done and we have a more when I go\nI think that's the benefit of having been to the world series last year but also having been in the end they'll see us now three consecutive seasons it's not all the same guys but it is some of the same guys and that and knowing what to expect\nCertainly understanding from last year's World Series how you're ... you're just never doubt you're never done it until it's literally done how many game too we seem to go back and forth back and forth between the Astros and the Dodgers a tug of war almost in that World Series\nAnd it's neat\nMaybe just as someone who love these kind of storylines\nThat many Machado gets to be part of an adult CBS and uh that that he was a major reason why they got there\nYou know every time you're going to do an audit convicted for suck on an [noise] in the back of my mind was at that point you know just on a truck driver driving on running for governor your doctor and now they're going to win over near but he made an ogre Robin\nWe saw the Dodgers rally a couple of different times in a series of the first few games were incredible pitching performances from\nYour engine review and Clinton cursed job but they fell behind five nothing against the raisin in game three and came back to tie it before oh to mentally losing a and then this many Machado line drive home run in the seventh which was the big blow also put them a head\nOn and and I think on the part of the Braves this experience is invaluable we got to see Iran will do coon yet junior we got to see ... we got to see some of these young guys\nThey're called the baby Braves right almost like we were calling the Yankees a baby bombers last year because so many young guys rookie sewer experiencing the play off stage with the first time despite the paint stripes it wasn't these guys\nAre who'd wrapped up all of those postseason appearances and all of this World Series championship so in my opinion the future is bright for the Braves\nAnd this can only help them as painful as it is but it's not really about the emotions it's just about that step it's about recognizing what it takes to win an adult east title and understanding how to build on that now and Brian sneakers the guy who gets to get\nHelp them through that now in the off season in the hot stove and make sure they're ready to go in two thousand Nineteen degree right\nThere was um ... everybody's expectations\nSad I mean you know we got this far and and um

John McCain she did a lot of that work and go into battlefields in two years after Lieberman left\nSo that might make sense I don't know if she'd be willing to do it but clearly she wants to run for the Senate again didn't work why wouldn't she accepted position like this again\nTo see your point even Nikki Haley had ah some early actually Israel President Trump and even in this role as a basket of to the U.S she was never afraid to speak your mind or the push back against the White House machine thought maybe there was a difference a ... so so all of this in mind a and considering how how\nTense or we are in a certain relationships particularly with the with China but also North Korea or Iran and they're even our allies on certain things this is this is really going to be critical isn't an Bryant\nI think so either the secretary of state overwhelms the position or works with a position now she was their first upon pale and they did they respect each other but that's why you got to pick the right person to go in there the seat that he or she has to have the respect of Bolton and the secretary defense as well as secretary of state\nTherefore if they do have that the seat doesn't shrink\nSo she didn't shrink within bachelor Haley it grew but there are a lot of ... nations I have to think twice and we do this every day who are they\nI mean Susan Rice was there she was invisible Samantha Power was on masking people more than she was actually pick me up for America internationally if you ask me and then you have Nikki Haley came in there and every ... statement she made every policy chi trumpeted seem to make headlines because this president is a disruptor he's a rebalance er\nAnd it's not going to be having this position unless you believe what he believes what about governor Mike Huckabee in that spot if you talk about ah the synthesis of thought\nThat would make sense\nYeah what I mean there's a lot of great things out there\nAre some really helping your show Charles and they were throwing books or even the president's press conference ... right now we were finished this wouldn't you this segment\nBut unfortunately we've run out of time and you were fantastic Brian thank you very much higher I think right stuff you see Mali nice to Charles [laughter] and I said I don't know if I ever meter [laughter] more lives are coming out of this Nikki Haley saying\nAll right one eight six six eight seven six six and I've got some calls to make who just able to go on at the end and do some wild speculation oh I I Know Charles was reading something and they want to look down on camera Alison could you read to me with this early read outs are are you getting the pool reports\nNot going to pour it part of what I see here is Trump apparently said something along the lines that she told me six months to do that maybe at the end of the year she wanted to take a break he was governor this is perhaps even more intense and solve a problem to gather and North Korea is moving along compare things for both Nikki Haley\nAs soon as they get the tape andme overland pack um but yeah from seeing so far\nWell All right when we come back I Want to be able to bring it to you so maybe if I take a break now we'll have a a long enough to do it also get bored one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine it ends the best way possible but with Nikki Haley steps aside that is a big loss for the Trump Administration your thoughts next Brian kill me Joe [noise]\nPolitics [noise] current events and use up facts you Brian's got a lot more to say with Brian kill made [noise]\nHave you ever looked at your credit card statement have been shocked by the interest rate did you know you ...\nHave you ever looked at your credit card statement have been shocked by the interest rate did you know you can actually roll all of your credit card debt into one monthly payment at a lower fixed interest rate light stream offers credit card consolidation loan from five point eight nine percent a PR with auto pay lower than average credit card interest rate of over Eighteen percent a PR\nGet along from five thousand to a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd you can even get your fund as soon as the day you apply white stream plant a tree by the way with every loan they fun\nI feel great recommending to my friends and my family because it's life's dream ... can also get a special discount on top of ice creams already low rates\nThe only way to get the discount is go to light stream dot com slash kill made that L.

Horwitz from above a trading dot com will join me for a conversation about money flow\nAbove it has been watching for science that investment money is starting to rotate out of stocks into commodities we'll get an update on how money is flowing through the markets from above at the end of the show today and of course we want you to be part of the conversation give us called say five five for eight to five five to four\nYou can also tweet at us just include hash tag we're talking the message right now let's turn it over to the gym and get an update on the news ... how are you this morning I'm doing alright how are you chat good good just fine I'd like to get this rain out of here\n[noise] yeah yeah and we're supposed to have rain here too in Indiana but it was a beautiful day yesterday but of course every time I come on the radio I have to call my family back in South Dakota\nDumb they're getting a little nervous because they have received some rain are supposed to get about two to four inches of rain some parts in South Dakota will be the F word knew\nUm and maybe even ten percent from average it's a Fifteen Percent of of the high or um you know in twenty four team but that was when we had record milk prices um the other thing that I noticed was that\nUm international gas um we're way off we only had about twenty three twenty four hundred international visitors and typically will attract\nOver three thirty two hundred so that's off you know a good twenty twenty five percent um and and it just reflective you know of the economy and not only here but in other parts of the world as to what's happening with the prices\nYou know GM I look at what's going on in the dairy industry and it's got to be exciting and frustrating all at the same time kind of like a for a quarter or I mean you look at the yields that are coming out of the field right now and you compare it to the prices are getting and tried to put a bottom line on it and sometimes those bottom lines turnout red rather than black\nBut it it's a similar situation in the dairy industry because of this pushing the genetics is is really impressive right now isn't it\nOh yeah I mean these these cattle have an ability in a will to milk that\nYou know we've we've never seen before and um you know we we talk a lot about the latest and greatest and technology\nBut a lot of the seminars virtual farm tours that diet that I attended last week was really getting back to basics and and making sure um rations were properly\nBalanced and then mixed and delivered to the cow I'm you know that that ... are getting bread on time milking routines are precise and consistent and all of that\nYou know adds up to nickels and dimes it's not you don't think it's big money but when you add it all up you know all of a sudden it's fifty\nOr sixty or Seventy cents a hundred weight and that right now makes a difference between profit and loss and that's where a lot of farmers should be you know and have been really focusing their efforts yeah makes a lot of sense\nBut it was the the the expos right on the heels of\nThe U.S Mexico Canada agreement us MCA um we we we talked a little bit about it in the in the last segment him but what is what a debt do for the attitude at the actual\nYou know I think it was positive I mean I think\nThe the details were released on Monday and Tuesday of last week just as\nAs the show was beginning and you know there are\nSome of the local TV stations were courting farmers is saying you know this was going to save my farm this is going to save our industry and at the same time you know a lot of the Canadian a show men that were there with cattle didn't even want to comment on it right um but I I think\nIt's um both\nBoth approaches attitudes um\nMaybe we're a little bit over blowing because like we talked earlier in the segment hum it's going to take some time for all of this to be implemented first of all it has to be approved\nBy all three governments um it may take years to implement the class seven stuff on the milk protein concentrates and it may take five or six years to actually fully increase access\nTo the Canadian a market for a U.S dairy exports um and we forget\nThat I'm through the Trans Pacific partnership or we would have gained about three and a quarter percent or more access to Canada and then we walked away from that um the U. S. M. A. C. grants about three point six percent more access um so it's just a little bit better\nUm so it's it's gonna be incremental changes as national milk has pointed out and it's going to take some time but you know end of the day it is positive will have to keep that in mind\nYeah and everybody it it it's so easy with us a CIA should just be focused on Canada the seat part of that agreement but Mexico is such an important market to our to our dairy but\nOh yeah I mean Mexico is our number one dairy export\nThat had a nation and we need continued access to that market because of those tariffs um our cheese exports to ah Canada we're down I'm Twenty one percent in August that's one thing we didn't talk about earlier and that's despite the fact that\nShe's exporters in some cases were I'm\nMaking up the difference on those tariffs that\nYou know to maintain their market share you so we need\nWe need access and the thing I learned last week is that um the steel and aluminum tariffs that\nAre ongoing are actually a separate track and are being negotiated separately and until we get relief from that and we're probably not going to see relief fund the cheese tariffs right so we need to continue to move forward on that stuff that\nThat is exactly right and you know with with all the talk about the exports and developing markets out there we still need to stay focused on the domestic market and that message market is really pretty good\n[noise] yeah it is I mean I I was a little bit surprised to see those numbers I'm very management ANC or had a breakfast for us one day last week and Marilyn Hershey who's the president\nOf the dairy ... spoke and um you know domestic sales are up to point three percent and that\nThat's huge you know your date um typically we only grow it about two percent on an annual basis and um you know fast food restaurants like McDonalds\nTaco Bell or dominoes and have all stepped up their promotion um this summer in anticipation of ah some of these uh trade impacts\nAnd we're seeing some really good volumes domestically so again that's that's really good news for us\nRight okay so the industry as a whole I mean we we see mergers and agriculture happening all the time out here Jim uh what about the dairy industry anything to report their\nYeah a Cape upon and Gen x\nHum you know officially announced their merger um that's el to genetics and Gen x a which is a U.S dairy based um AI company and they um incorporate\nSix or seven other um dairy companies such as a source which does a lot of the d._a. chai records for um [noise] uh the upper Midwest so they finally approved their merger they announce that last December\nUm and that's really significant it because it's the first time a U.S very cooperative AI dairy cooperative has merged with a private international uh hey I from\nI'm taking a minority position which is really unusual but that allows Gen x and all to to be ultra competitive invest in the in the company and genetics to move forward so that's kind of exciting\nAll right so where are we going where where's the dairy industry had\nA you know it's we've got to get through um\nThese trade wars but I think there's an awful lot of opportunity you know as global demand continues to increase um we increase or improve our ... productivity I think there is still an awful lot of opportunity out there it's just\nYou know getting through this next year so I'm as as some of that stuff um opens up but again you know I'm encouraged by the resiliency of of us producers you know there are down right now but\nUm for the most part I think the attitude was you know we've we've got to get through this we will get through this and we're we're pretty well positioned to move forward gym\nI've only got about thirty seconds left for you here but what about the labor issues how are we going to produce more with little tight labor situation\nWell that that's another scary part we had hoped that we can move some immigration reform through this Congress it didn't happen ah we're crossing our fingers that maybe we can get something done in Congress\nNext year yeah All right Jim it's always fun to talk with your body\nOkay take care of ... you bet you've asked\nYou to that is Jim deck hurled at Earl ... editor Meredith pork dairy herd management okay we're going to talk some more trade issues when we

get more productive more efficient in the dairy\nBarn a labor in robotics are have got to be part of the equation I don't think ah I don't think there's any question about that uh like I said we've got a few minutes left here in this segment if you want to give us a call and say five five ... five five for eight to five five to four\nYou can also tweet at us and if you do make sure that you include hash tag Edwards talk\nIn a message OK I'm harvest\nLet's talk about that a little bit uh Betsy and I were talking it started the show and kind of joking about her dad Jim up in southeast South Dakota and how he's dealing with some harvest delays hasn't turned a wheel up there yet and getting a little anxious over the\nOver the fact that they haven't turned a wheel ... I'm a little surprised and this is the week where the harvest delays really should start to show up now yesterday was Columbus Day we normally would get the crop progress report from USDA on Monday but that was the late and\nYesterday on ATV on a agra talk after the bell\nI mentioned I mentioned the fact that doggone it normally I don't\nReally quote unquote look forward to the crop progress cramped edition reports because I don't think they show us a whole lot more than what the market already knows what the market is already factored into prices\nIn this case I think ... [laughter] I'd have to lay on the crop progress report was I I did miss it I did miss it because I think the market needs an update on just\nHow the weather conditions in the western corn belt in particular really starting to slow things down or\nNot turning wheel and southeast South Dakota and here we are on the night of October\nA that's a bit of a problem that that is definitely a bit of a problem now we're expected to see rains continue\nAt least through the end of the week we had Michael Clarke from bam W. S. dot com on the radio with me on the show yesterday with me we've got that that uh rain in the forecast or the end of the week there is another chance for a front to move through over the weekend brings some\nSome moisture and but when you look at the national weather service six to ten day outlook Andy aid to fourteen day outlook we are starting to see some relief come into the outlook\nThat's good news I it it's that light at the end of the tunnel it's got to take time to dry field conditions out and get this crop fit again to run run combine but boy I tell you what guys are chomping at the bit and and are trying to get out there and get after of what kind of an impact is that having on the markets right now\nSomewhat surprisingly even with all the soybeans that we've got out there in the ban it in on farms storage and uh in commercials storage some of the crushers some of the crushers in the U.S are starting to get a little tight on supply\nAs a result we're seeing some basis pops some basis bumps in areas especially if you can tell that that crush or\nHey I've got I I'm not talking about bringing in one loader too low as I'm Talking about bringing intend loads\nIf you can talk volume with those crushers out there right now there is an opportunity to secure a better basis then what is being advertised whether it be at a crush facility or whether it be at a uh at at the local elevator there is an opportunity to get some of those uh basis passed the best way to get that top\nIs to make sure that the crush or knows that you've got the beans available if you've got the beans available\nAnd he all of a sudden needs them\nYou know that he's going to be picking up the phone and giving you a call so that you can um uh satisfy the needs that that he's got so\nIt's kind of a weird situation kind of a different situation on corn we're not we we haven't seen the basis of pressure on corn that we saw on soybeans\nBut we are starting to see plenty of movement down the river and uh uh uh that that is helping us out there okay one other thing on\nOn um uh the corn market eight Fifteen\nSmith today boy it sure sounds like we're going to because a ... ... all of the sources that we've made contact with say that yes this is the day we're finally going to get the uh uh we're finally going to get the announcement on e Fifteen it's going to be available year around\nNow this subject has is one of those subjects that I don't know if I if I Want a guarantee it I sure wouldn't bet the farm on it because it's been a false start on this subject for a several times already but\nBoy I which I it feels like this is the day it feels like this is the day is that we're going to get the Fifteen available year round we're finally going to get the announcement here's this to cure all for the corn market no is it a step in the right direction\nYou know gone right it it it is definitely a step in the right direction okay when we come back we're

beautiful sunny day here in Chicago although in\nSo many other parts of the of the world that is not such a sunny day hearing about rain and snow from guys sort of all over the place not a whole lot of fun now Davis how things out by you\nSaid I'm going to ask you to watch your language um we are broadcasting to a live national audience and the word snow is on my list of the several dirty words that were to know that allowed to say\n[laughter] yeah I I Wish I wouldn't say it I mean\nAgain it's it's hard for me to believe when it's Seventy six degrees and sunny here don't see these are the words that I should not be able to say um\nBut yeah I I some of the guys I'm Talking to open the Dakotas or talking snow\nYeah yeah well it's getting to be that time of year I mean let's be honest\nYeah but with with the amount of precipitation that we've had and this is stupid I've said this to my wife if there were a little colder and the rain that we're getting in my area and in lots of parts of the Midwest or if that wants to know\nWe'd be in trouble yeah\nI yeah well you know and the thing is I mean it's a tale of two harvests right I mean the the guys down south or just rock and roll and then a moving along and it's that makes it even kinda tougher for the guys that aren't able to do anything right now so it's it's a\nIt's a tough one and it also when we look at the crop progress later on this afternoon I don't think it's going to say that we're necessarily all that behind but\nReally the guys that are behind are the ones that\nWe should be worried about so I think the market right is kind of brush and then off at the moment but that's something that maybe we need to be a little bit more concern about maybe we will be who does\nAnd what were we to six points ahead of the five year average last week if I recall\nYeah so uh for corn I Believe so yeah mhm\nWell we we could be race because nothing is rolling around here in central Iowa\nYeah so [noise] but ... hopefully soon the six than an eight to fourteen day forecast while they're showing below normal temperatures are still showing below number precepts so hopefully that will be enough time for us to dry out and get out and get it done\nWe'll see we'll\nSee we'll see [laughter] I don't know if we're ever going to get this done yeah that that certainly feel\nThat way right now buddy [noise] well what do you say we got the news today\nWe sure do let's see let's start at the top of the page where we futures recovered from declines the overnight sessions betrayed modestly higher today us you know the daily sale of one hundred twenty thousand metric tons of hard red spring wheat to Bangladesh and the Kurds marketing near today\nAnd they carry outs are so big that bankers and farmers are good at so and early rally now there's nothing wrong with showing an early rally for Nineteen\nBut in my opinion if you start so ingrained march April May June wherever you so you need to Rio and it was some call options because I really think that these low prices\nI've been training for forty five years yeah one of the many things I've learned is that some of the best ball markets start with the biggest carry out you know this could be one of those years and I think you got to be careful\nMy guess is the grain companies the bankers a lot of folks are going to tell you don't miss it again this year and I don't think they should I think they should do some marketing no question about it ... but when I get that grand sold would I be looking to buy that calls you better would\nWell you know I gotta say mark you know ... and I think ... myself I'm I'm a little surprised to hear you say that I think a lot of listeners might be surprised you say that you you've got a reputation not a bad one by the way of you know by put a lot of times a day that the guy who what where we should be doing is producers\nUm but I don't know if I can think of in the many conversations that we've had\nIf I've heard just they called before um so I think that's a very interesting idea I I'm a big proponent of that sort of thing\nWell you know\nAs long as I've been managing risk for the farmers you know I really believe that the put options are a great tool how do I want to be aggressively won't put options\nAt age sixty bans and a three sixty corn no I Want to be very aggressive at five and six dollar corn let alone eight dollar corn right and you know twelve dollar bands and sixteen dollar bans but you know down here you know if we do get a rally we've got November man's at nine thirty\nIf we get up over ten bucks but I look to sell some rain sure if we can get December corn up to four forty what I saw some rent you back but I Would immediately by that call options\nIf not the kind of a year and my opinion\nThat you want to sell grain hope for a break to buy the calls cheaper this is the kind\nOf a year that could catch a lot of people [noise] blindsided\nAnd if you're going to sell the grain by the cost\nTo do it immediately right use cash to manager rescues cost manager opportunity mark I like it we're gonna have more on this conversation when we come back\nCome on back to agriculture after the bell everybody\n[noise]\nInforming getting things done early has a way of setting you up for success like using corpus for an early season when over weeds tourists keeps even the toughest weeds for gaining a political\nRight and as a banker going to be more involved in being proactive in helping these farmers or do something and and managing this risk I think\nThere will be some tough decisions between now and spring\nOn his operating lawns about you know what's your marketing plan no pay a farmer answers well I Hope it goes higher that may not be a good enough answer but more to your point a white you know you got to have a guy that is willing to listen and unfortunately over the last hundred years\nWhen farmers of listen to the commodity brokers they put their ... and you know as I said my seminars grandad has told\nHis son and that's on has told the next generation don't ever trade with those bombs in Chicago and clearly you and I are those bombs in Chicago [laughter] and how do you get them how do you get them\nTo get over that negativity that's been out there and I think the only way you can really do that is through education I don't think of well educated person as well armed to to bust some of the stereotypes are one of my favorite stereotypes when we talk about options\nIs it eighty five percent of all options explainer worthless but what nobody ever says nobody ever finishes that sentence the sons is eighty five percent of all options are worthless at expiration yeah that doesn't tell you how much of what percent of options\nSons is eighty five percent of all options are worthless at expiration yeah that doesn't tell you how much what percent of options had good money in some point and you didn't take the money out before it goes worthless\nRan I Know for you know that's one of the things we try to do very well here at top third is to manage those options as an asset and not just let them watch and and expire worthless if you go to a port and forget about it well you know you do have an eighty five ... percent chance of ex by are worthless\nBut it's not to say that you don't get a forty or fifty cent move one way or the other or you can do something with that put either sell their cash or pick some money out of the put so you've got to be proactive you got to understand how these things work\nAnd like I said I think education is the key and as brokers our job isn't to generate trades our job is to educate on the proper use of these tools that are available to the American public\nAnd manage risk and and you're absolutely right and that's the thing is that you know even if you do own a put it in and we talked about earlier that maybe not the strategy right now but he was just theoretically if you do own a foot and you manage it and whatever and then put the fires worthless\nWell hey that's kind of a win because it means you didn't need to put them in the market did good things for you and hopefully you're making it up on the cast side of things so it gets more tricky when you're when you're looking at your ... ownership strategies a but at low prices like these I think it's absolutely absolutely sense essential to be to try to\nYou know get as much of the profit margin you can capture as much of that as you can\nUm and really the only way to do that at these prices by ... ownership and futures especially and soybeans in my opinion is very risky at the moment so\nYeah it's a lot of different strategies we need to educate I'm with you mark I think that's a great idea hey we're we're going to start to run out of the time you're pretty quickly so I Do want to get into a little bit of a a livestock livestock conversation I think you heard me saying to David that the October December hog spread is just exceptionally wide right now what do you make of that\nNot only is the act is wide but the ... up it was almost as white man you know they've they've dumped on those December a contract and kept it cheap relative to the other month obviously somebody boys were either\nGoing to have a huge break in demand or that there is an awful a bigger onslaught of hogs coming in\nNow I don't know that I agree with those numbers uh I think we're going to see some increase in the last quarter but it was enough to put a Thirteen twelve Thirteen dollar discount\nYou know the market Sam ... thanks so at this time so it is what it is there's really not much you can do um you're not going to keep their dogs around for to watch continue to feed them and try to get a higher price later so it is what it is for the moment but ah\nHopefully we can see this whole thing really maybe get it up to Seventy eighty bucks which were dragged to\nThese to maybe sixty five somewhere that re rank and hopefully we can see something positive out here\nNo right now as far as life cattle and also feed her cat are concerned we've been trading very sideways for the past three weeks but we've been trading up near the high in the last couple of days it seems like we might be starting to roll over a little bit too down side or do you think we hold support here head back to those I stay in this range or what do you see for the cat\nCat I don't have a clue what I Do know or is that we've made\nContract ties and we're starting to back off we've had nice run up in those cattle market and the feeder cattle market and these are prices well worth protecting\nOut here uh nobody wants to spend you know four or five dollars on a port option but that's what it's going to take to get something legitimate out here and my biggest concern\nAnd the cattle is a moment as the stock market I Am telling people as long as the stock market stay strong that the upside potential cattle is there now looks like we're hitting Mars on your side of the doubt time flies when you're having fun buddy you knew I had to get\nYou to Fox News Sunday Sunday mornings intent on

cares about the answer is outside of Houston or the Indians out of the Cleveland or the Dodgers outside of LA which is one of baseball's problems but to be fair to brave men the Astros are the reigning World Series champions\nThere the reigning World Series champions\nIf you win the super bowl and you're the eagles\nYou're in the NFC championship game in the playoffs you're going to get a

I mean I Will watch a ballgame but\nThey just don't have the cash that they do in the north and then what do you have been and I know it before and seen Red Sox Yankees fans there and fight you know not fit but rubble arguments\nOver any little thing that happened in the baseball game you get football and the ... you just don't have the the\nPeople they have the added up more that\nI don't really call it for baseball and the south like you do in the northeast you go past the Mason Dixon Line and if you're going to be a Yankees fan or Red Sox fan\nTiny appreciate the call appreciate the thought thank you for the perspective I respectfully\nWill agree to disagree with you\nHaving lived in a lot of cities around the country\nThere's some real passionate fans outside of the northeast\nAnd cubs fans are real jolly and nice but when inter league play first began the first time the Yankees ever played at Wrigley Field and a regular season game I went to that series\nAnd Yankees fans descended on Wrigley Field and got kind of loud and obnoxious and we're being I I don't know I'm hoping they were like fake New Yorkers and\nMy brother and my mom my dad and my mom and dad are here the shown an hour and a half we got rid of the trace 'cause it's so rude to people but anyway ah\nWe watch New Yorkers get the living crap kicked out and buy cubs fans and then the security guards come down and roughly take out the Yankees fans who have been overwhelmed by like Fifteen people that that\nThere is a dark side all across the country Dodgers fans among the most passionate I've ever seen Astros fans are so into it I've spent a lot of time in Milwaukee especially on the NBA because I have family there those folks who love their baseball team\nThe St Louis cardinals and God forgive me for telling the truth on this are the best fan base in terms of passion and anger and obsession I've ever seen\nThere aren't as many of them cause in St Louis and as big as New York so I Will just agree to disagree there are amazing fans spread around the country and there's also storylines that are worth celebrating his Jeremy mats and tweets at sports writer sport's already I T E R where he says Milwaukee isn't the same boat\nNationally MVP manager of the year best record\nAnd his team in baseball\nI think it means best than he might like it hit us was made of where I'm In three o seven first

all\nAt guy go dot com\nLou an eerie Pennsylvania thank you for ah hanging out here on the program my friend you're on CBS Sports radio\nTo go I absolutely agree with your point I think you're dead on Bob's whole Yankees Red Sox a TV network emphasis that just\nYou know it inhibits that sport from ever growing more and we know ahead of time ratings are automatically going to be higher for New York Boston just because of the population so it's\nA self fulfilling prophecy but they're never going to attract like you said other fans or the stars that exist other cities go unnoticed by a lot of people because they're almost never show\nOr if I may on another ... another sport the same way I feel about the Dallas Cowboys you've been mediocre for Twenty years\nThey're always show on the game of St your game enough with the cowboys they've been a while it's for the late nineties\nI Would lose a great point I used to always when I went to Missouri I Lived in Iowa I went to Missouri for college and all these taxes kids came up and three of my four closest friends from college protects us kids and\nEyes just make fun of America's Team Mike\nWhat do you mean America say there's a whole but there's a lot of America and the Mets lost his cool gal says cool but I agree and we ... especially in baseball we latch on we latch on\nTo these organizations and these these notions\nOnly this team of that the matters\nThere's an echo chamber in New York they're ... they're just human nature it's not a shot at New Yorkers people into ... people in LA people in Saudi Arabia people in America people in Canada people by nature are are somewhat can conform us and they want to be agreeable and therefore when you're not\nThinking about other people's perspectives or looking beyond sort of your own world it's easy to get caught up in the secular chamber\nAnd New York's biggest echo chamber in the world is an amazing dynamic incredibly cool city with its own media ecosystem we lost James ward to a twenty four hour sports network 'cause there's nothing but New York sports that's awesome for New York but major league baseball the national sport and they've got to think\nA little more why is it about what they and how they grow their sport what they promote how they grow their sport and just to reiterate this point\nI'd argue that you have a chance to ... to to showcase an illustrate teams like the brewers\nTeams like the Dodgers by the Dodgers big market west coast team\nOver the course of the regular season a lot of America especially out where I'm sitting right now on the east coast are sleep and by the time the Dodgers and the third or fourth or fifth inning a chance to promote an Astros team that my goodness shouldn't need the promotion towers ... point they won this little thing small tiny accomplishment called the world series last year I mean come on\nCome on major league baseball your business Cleveland's a really dynamic team which a lot of people didn't know about until they play the cubs a couple of years ago\nI mean it's an interesting baseball team\nEight by five two and two for CBS News on a part of the segment brings to recoup Exxon I live a a images

obviously a guy who is going to be the focal point of whatever hopes Cleveland has free post ... era and I ask Kevin about how he actually found out\nA little brown was going to the Lakers and and Kevin loves reaction to the news\nI think I found out about it like most people find their news now is I'm a social media is on Instagram and I was actually taking vacations to the Hamptons and\nI'm sitting there having my lunch and or do I first looked at my phone and any possible much screen so I think I found out like like most people but you know immediately after that about you know five ten minutes I decided to drop Ron I'm a little known and congratulate\nThem I Know as as far as probably didn't hit us like crazy with a bunch of calls and text messages or the or the streets out to him I'm told him I Love and wish them well in that you know the brother we continue between his team and and my two\nReality in Cleveland is LeBron is gone Kyrie is gone you decided this off season to sign a four year extension to stay with the cabs what one is that decision\nI think more than anything I just said that I wanted to be here um you know it's easy for a championship four years in a row

show their games or to help us so that was\nA big thing for me in a you know allow me to see divisions are as to where we're headed a sign of the states\nYou know one of the things that Kevin Love and I talked about we discussed was his response\nTo the donors\nWho do not believe he can still be a go to score\nYou know I saw I forgot how to play basketball I can I can go to the ball to hide but I'm going to do whatever you know this is actually out there um I I don't expect to\nBe top five in scoring like I was or even by five and rebounding like I was I'm just I'm I'm looking to you know make your point I'm not certain noses goals that I'm I'm you know I think I I really care about the sacrifices so much is is is that when calling them well there'll be times where I Need to put up\nTwenty five or thirty points sure they'd be times where I Need to clean up the glass at a very high rate and certain games of course but uh you know I'm going to be looking a lot more to facilitate like I
