corruption trial the verdicts\nTo aspiring agents virtues me an aspiring agent into former dean is representative but I wanted to get the most connected\nAnd I think insightful reporter covering this

like there's a natural thing cold weather in New York I'm Still getting used to not LA different\nBut otherwise good for for people Gary who haven't followed this corruption trial can can you give us maybe just a quick summary of what it is what it was in what happens\nYeah so it's interesting right yep three men in this trial charged with a a federal crime\nA basically a crime is is that they the fraud at universities typically when you have a\nA trial ... you're going to have somebody who is accused of something charged with something and the goal is to set out and convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt\nThat you did what you're accused of doing it out of work on trial for murder you got to try to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that you killed this person you're on trial for a bank robber you got to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that you actually Rob ... um\nThis is different than knowledge that the ads that they were accused of doing they actually did right from the job in other words yes we did pay this family to get this player to go here we pay this guardian to get this player to go here we pay this person to get this player to go here\nBought we were helping the universities we work hurting the universities in some cases we were working hand in hand with the universities we weren't the friday anybody we were actually trying to help them be better\nIn a way that they signed off on either literally like instructed at the health told us to help\nThey just for helping or\nIn some cases perhaps it was left unsaid because plausible deniability can be a coach your best friend but that was the entire case more or less the jury was\nUh the present it from the prosecution with the idea that these men harm the universities because when they compromise the amateur status of the prospect of student athletes\nAnd then they stood athletes enrolled at a university and accepted a scholarship\nThe universities were being the fraud because they were in Raleigh prospect\nThat could call them in the ... issues and the defense is counter to that was basically let's get serious\nWe weren't the friday anybody we were only doing what it is these universities wanted us to do and the truth is to anybody who follows the sport and understands how high level recording work of human side with the defense\nBut the jury by design\nWas not made up of people who are listening to you and I talk right now it was eight women and for men who largely had no um\nNo level of understanding as they enter this case about college basketball work and the prosecution to their credit was able to convince them that yes the universities were defrauded that yes the crime was committed and now a three men are going to serve some day\nAre real time and a real prison or simply because they at the time that\nThey they ... they they were just trying to help college basketball program in a way that shoe companies have been helping college basketball program\nEssentially because they at the time did they they ... they they were just trying to help college basketball program in a way that shoe companies have been helping college basketball program for a while\nYou're in Paris you're on the show and I guess the old adage is a real reality when the fed knock on your door Gehring it's not a good thing regardless of the details of circumstances the sex\nFor I mean that's why a lot of federal cases don't even get to trial because they got you and that was so interesting about this again or you know moral code Jim ghetto and Christian Dawkins didn't try to deny that\nThey did what it is the federal government said they did their argument was simply stop it with this we'd defaulted university we were helping we were helping universities and\nI honestly like ... that's an argument that resonated with me and I think resonated with most others who understand how this for work\nUm but it clearly did not resonate with the jury and so you know so now you know these these guys are going to hurt real time and it it's sort of a ... a scary thing in this regard\nUsually if you commit a crime you know you're committing a crime like if I drink and drive I understand that if I get caught there is a place to pet you know like I might be fine I might lose my license I could lose my job all sorts of things\nIf I you know Rob the store I understand that if I get caught there's a price to pay I'm probably gonna be charged with a crime and go to jail\nThe difference here is that these men when they did what they did\nBuy their own admission they know that were violating it she'd have like rules\nBut I think it's reasonable picking clues if not impossible to knock the coup that they had no idea they were committing a federal crime\nLike like if you want to stop sign you know if you get caught you're going to get a ticket but if you did what they did when they did it was really no precedent for being charged with a federal crime and maybe have to do real time and a real President Jimmy Carter was looking seriously at seven years in federal prison\nMan with no criminal background at all and he really was just a shoe company executives trying to make law vote better at the sport of college basketball he could possibly known this would be the penalty for what he was doing and that's just another thing that makes

Christian Dawkins and moral code to Adidas former excuse me Adidas reps any aspiring agent and what it means there's a lot to untangle here\nBut I'll I'll I'll go to this place I think there's two major takeaways from me the first is it is a surprisingly good day for Indianapolis and they want this rather happen no of course not\nBut this is a great outcome for them which makes it the wrong outcome not to release the law not a lawyer I'm not an expert on the law in terms of what's good or bad for sports cars amateur amateur is a is a lie it is ally\nBut it's going to be harder now to have reform to apply pressure to the NC double A. to stop being a bastion of greedy hypocrites because\nAs Gary and I talk about in the in the last segment which I thought it was really interesting carries great\nYou've now co defied in federal law the notion that an NC double a violation is a criminal act they can send you to prison and let me explain this way I think this is the take away the matters most I think this is the most important reaction and by the way\nEight five five to one to four CBS your reaction of the trial and whether you like me that it's just time to just be honest and do away with amateurs and pay these kids here's why I think the big takeaway\nIs the notion that this is now crime if you are or run or a recruiter and Adidas or Nike or new balance\nYour bill sell for any other coach I like Bill but he's been in the news will use his name during assistant coach\nThere's always been the concern about getting caught right and the NC double a firing you but you know a few things one\nEnded up really looks the other way a lot of the time to Nancy doubling doesn't look the other way they do not have subpoena power it is really trying to prove your co workers we're talking smack about during the break room good luck\nGood luck and three the enforcement arm or the NC double a has been really watered down the last few years you talked to people to cover the sport everyday they've had a lot of defection and why would they believe because it's been a miserable existence there was no subpoena power here called a hypocrite you called by people like me and arm of the problem and those that are trying to actually make a difference\nFeel steps to me by stymied by those above them and the fact that the people that are investigating the subpoena power\nWell that all changes now you're an assistant coach your big time coach and all of a sudden you have to worry\nAbout the fact this could be a federal crime you have to worry about the fact that if you mess with the federal government they take a look at you if you're on a wiretap they have your text messages they have the power and the ability to squeeze people to get information to aggressively get to the truth\nAnd that's kind of scared the hell out of it and I was I called several people today and tested that I that I trust from the world of college basketball wanted various perspectives\nAnd it wasn't thirty people in the small sample size but interesting disagreement arose everybody agreed that the take away which is what we're talking about that a federal jury\nIs sending people to prison for violating rules that previously people thought were just a violation of the NC double A. you could get fire but your going to go to prison\nAnd again eight five five to one to four CBS if you want to\nWeigh it but what are the disagreement is whether or not U.S attorneys\nAre going to be motivated to go out there and find people who are doing this and you heard Gary parasite not every single one is going to I think more than people think will be though and here's why\nI Love the notion that the laws about the law and the U.S attorney general are always after truth injustice I loved to believe that\nJustice really is blind but it's not just like amateurs ally\nThere are a lot of very ambitious people\nWho are U.S attorneys do they do they have a moral center or they're trying to fight crime that trying to make a difference ... absolutely absolutely but like most successful human beings are also very ambitious and how do you if you're a U.S attorney become a governor or a congressman or senator or on your own minds are the halo the presidency\nYou get written about you distinguish yourself you make headlines you make noise in a previous life when I wrote about politics and I covered Bill Clinton and I did those sorts of things most of the people that I interact with were successful politicians most not all but a lot were former attorneys and\nButton and I did those sorts of things most of the people that I interact with were successful politicians most not all but a lot were former attorneys and former U.S attorneys\nHow do you do that how real Rudolph Giuliani become governor and ... to a president how did the former governor of New Jersey\nChris Christie become governor of New Jersey to presidential candidate they were U.S attorneys and they went after big time names\nPeople in the mafia but also people certainly that we're famous Martha Stewart went to prison she committed the crime she's found guilty why Martha Stewart because it was a headline and I think people in the world of sports that don't understand the world politics are sleeping on the very real reality that U.S attorneys are going to view it as a crime\nThey see the ... they see young kids who are often from impoverished backgrounds being taken advantage of by millionaire coaches and Adidas wraps and they're like wow there's also going to be a whole bunch of headlines Google right now Christian ... and ... favorite America's going to come up and you know his name is going to be an all those those papers the various people who are at the heart of prosecuting these crimes\nMy conversation earlier today as and dynamic and sue but want to take a call or two Charles in Virginia thank you for a listener brother you're on CBS Sports radio\nHey bill ... taking my call man I Love your show with the every night on my way home from work but um I think you hit the nail on the head with the attorney general I think it's for somebody to try to make a name for himself um\nBut I wanted to ask you your power on this uh so you've got three guys that are getting ready to serve jail um and they probably had no clue I mean they knew that they were probably violating NCWA rules but again like you said I have no idea about the jail time\nIn the student athletes and they get any kind of trouble do you think for a set thing\nAny of this cast your or anything like that\nIt's a really good question because the law here thinking of the car called Charles thank you for the for the kind words appreciate you listening and grass you're on your way home it's the best part of the day right like going over Mark I'm\nThe legal easier that's really interesting is the notion that these universities or choose me these\nFigures in the world of recruiting defrauded universities\nWhen they were working with the university's highest paid employees the coaches and some of their staff to get\nThese players recruited in in the example is being used and it's a good one is the University of Kansas really a\nPlace that got to fraud in by having student athletes get some money which then led to Adidas given a seven year hundred and twenty million dollar contract to Kansas that\nSounds like a business partnership it sounds like one that's on ethical it sounds like one that doesn't fall into the rules but it does not like being the fraud that actually sounds like you were being held in a significant way\nFinancially it's it is legal Samantha ... is what it is and so to answer your question trust I don't know if it's student athletes could be under that prosecuted as some of the people who defrauded\nThose universities my aunt my guess is you could probably now try it but I don't know you'd find a lot of prosecuting attorneys are juries willing to go there because it's a lot easier to go after the greedy moneymaking adults taking advantage of the kids\nThan it is to prosecutors Seventeen year old\nAre you going to Seventy in high school kid\nWho's just trying to make his way in the world that's what it's deep in the defense attorneys will sell them to actually do it it would be accurate\nAll right Bye bye to onto for CBS over on\nCBS poor taste to\nCBS board streaming network I had the chance shows on five Eastern Pacific\nI had the chance to visit with some some pretty big names it's cooler I like talking to those kind of guys and I I really enjoyed the conversation I had with yesterday with ...\nThe defensive tackle for the ramps and we had a really interesting talk I thought in ... and want to play some of the one of the things that I asked him I always ask them guys but in this case it actually this idea of a special teams materialize I asked sue how long does it take to realize how special a team can be\nI think I got a feeling of it during my recruiting trip or in coming down here and taking the visit as I went to the old school or high school days and cook a visitor him for this in Queens and so being able to see in touch and feel and talk to people\nWho look people in the eyes are all the good feeling for work and special here in uh we're starting to some some of that comes alive but we've got a lot of work ahead of ourselves\nOr to get that done the results and the goal\nYou guys are remarkable on paper been really good on paper to your they're airing Donald had some injuries like a ... but it's a real\nUltimate goal defensive you guys are remarkable on paper in really good on paper to your they're airing Donald ... like a keep delay but it's a really talented crew for you what is it like playing with Aaron in terms of what he does and what it frees you up to be able to do\nIt's great I mean our season a very early talent uh plays very hard a very\nAn amazing past Russia and prove that this last week for sex I'm so it gives me opportunities to make plays and uh we play off each other as well as Michael Brown offers a you mentioned a key to Marcus appears to great towns in the back in that allow us to get after quarterbacking quarterbacks afraid to throw the ball so uh it's overall gray situation and we're all competitive\nAnd it comes together quite nicely\nAnd talking to ... to ... I asked him the balance that\nYou need to strike between enjoying success and the rams the only undefeated team in the NFL certainly so far successful but also knowing that\nThe seasons young and they're still work to do\nYeah we all realize is a long season in our first goal is to winnow division and which we had to go this past weekend and take a big part of that down so are we beaten all three teams in our division and we have to continue to focus on that particular piece a and has to answer your direct question of the night\nFeeding into success and being seven to know a great we take a twenty four hour period victory lap around the circle\nHave fun with it enjoy it but we understand on Mondays run a breakdown this film understand our mistakes\nAnd we have a great team are and we have a huge target on our back but uh you can't be a target if you're if you're going after the attack another other teams\nEndemic in individually you have three ... already this season just in terms of your personal performance and try and help the team what's been the biggest difference playing on the rams this year versus previous seasons of different ...\nI Would say the biggest difference for me is a primarily playing\nAll three positions on Mondays and so on a plane for nose tackle the three technique to five technique I'm In for me I've always prided myself on being able to be flexible\nOr being able to just adapt and er I'm getting the biggest tested that this year which has been great for me I enjoy it I'm all about winning and being able to fit in that as a as\nWhat's asked his knee and so being asked to do a lot of different things that I've got to compartmentalize\nThree different positions which is a challenging but fun at the same time\nYou guys held the niners the temp points a couple of days ago you got to have the fourth best and I think it's Fort that's going to events in the national football league has been a couple of games we've given up thirty plus points one of the sea only what is the the high side the best case scenario for the defense of unit when everybody's healthy and you guys feel like you're on the same page\nI think we haven't reached there and we are I think that ceilings unknown I'm as you mentioned because we've had injuries are missing some of our key players are but we have a lot of young guys that have stepped up and done a tremendous job for us and we'd expected that from them and they understood that uh this is unfortunately one of the league's\nUm that there's a hundred percent injury rate so there's at some point in time they're going to be stepped up to ask them do something different a and guys have been able to do that so once we get hopefully a hundred percent healthy going into the\nPlayoffs or whatever maybe towards the end of the season when we get everybody back a bats will really find out where our differences and we'll be able to understand a word true stealing is and hopefully there's no see\nI always enjoy it when athletes of the caliber of endemic ensue are willing to engage in the interview and\nVery thoughtful\nVery interesting\nBlowing off the clash I really enjoyed the conversation with the with the rams defensive linemen and one of the things that that makes the rams really interesting and really successful great defense\nBrain often on both sides of the football they're really really formidable ... and I know for people to know sue that he's a very very competitive guy so I asked him what it's like to watch this often dominate\nOther teams in and to know that you don't have to in real games ever go against these guys\nI think one of the best things about us while we're successful we compete all the time so we have challenges whether it was in camp whether it's right now we're in the gloom and grinding the seasons are we compete ah and we\nTalk crap back and forth each and every single day ah we have ... ... competition periods in practice a specially on Thursday so uh we we have opportunities against our office but definitely glad I don't have a C. T. G. in in in full steam as well as Todd girly and\nUh the arch and see and put his stake in the ground get in touch downs or in Britain and cook so those guys are I got a lot of respect for a and glad there on my side\nHe posted a few weeks ago speaking of all kinds of guys and their side of the ball that Jared golf is the best quarterback that you've ever played with what is it about Jared that impresses you so much\nIt's funny because I got to play against ... or his first career NFL game I think it was back in twenty sixteen and are you was\nNot what he is today or to be able to see the transformation of my eyes going against them and then now being alongside him a tremendous amount of respect for him and he's just an elite guy that I can ... I Believe is going to continue to continue to grow a and I'm excited for a in and that's why I made that statement in and that's something I Believe in\nSo interested in drawing McVeigh and what made him as successful as he has been and I thought to in our conversation over at CBS forte she was really interesting is answering what she thinks makes his young head coach with Los Angeles ramp so special\nI said it before and not continue said or there's something special about him and and the things that I've seen from him of similar to a guy that I hold in high regard says is one of the best coaches I've ever been around which gym called well uh in what may Jim Colwell special is that he gave direction to each and every last\nPerson from the equipment staff to the number one player on the team with extra quarterback or\nEven to linemen are running back or wherever it may be in in\nThe ... for transparency and that's what puts me say has and being such a young guy a and I've been around young coaches and a lot of them have\nThe mindset of their way or the highway and and and you either they know everything and whatever it may be but\nUh Shaun as open minded at the same time\nI Believe there's many ways to re success and he wants to find a common goal for everybody to agree and I think his motto is we not mean in in if your\nFocus is about the better greater good of everybody else will ... will be happy to get to where he wants to ah and then also my favorite is being on time or a part of myself from being on time being president or in this two simple rules that he carries which is very similar costs Colwell and why we saw success when I was with him and fourteen\nHydro care will eliminate length scale because it's hundreds of dollars in damage the pipes and appliances without using sold\nWell water will no longer smell or staying your fixtures city water will be purified harmful pouring lid arsenic and chemicals way home solutions provides the cleanest healthiest water at every faucet satisfaction guaranteed for more information coal one\nEight eight eight nine seven three wave one eight eight eight nine seven three W.

Thompson the athletic fame that the raiders players have lost confidence in court back their car and that the relationship is fractured earlier today had goes junk food and said that he can't see the team dealing car and titan we Smith had this to say\nAll these reports about this locker room being fractured with Derrick or is the most obnoxious and ridiculous thing I've heard ever\nIt's or to the point to where it's comical laughable that I'm even sitting here talking about it um us as players\nAre have zero issue with Derrick or he is our leader he's always been our leader we put a C on his chest for a reason along with Rodney Hudson\nAnd a regardless of what facing makes after a tackle or or what everybody wants to dive into and and we're him out about a attacking his character attacking him as a leader on this football teams of jokes and um [noise]\nI Hope that everyone adheres me loud and clear of what a joke that is um it's it's frustrating it's it's\nAnnoying and it's a laughable not fair to him when it's obviously not coming from inside this locker room\nThat yeah but what [noise] what is Lee Smith really thing [laughter]\nI mean that's an aggressive push back the problem becomes and I'm not saying Lee Smith knows that he's wrong you don't lie here's the problem let me get some conduct as a reporter and this is especially true in in a ... it's so big Lisa can feel that way\nAnd the guys that isn't table with made me feel that way or the guys he buddies with but NFL lockers were so big their Balkan eyes needs different Clifton these different groups\nHe may not have an entire sense what the entire locker room is feeling there may be an important group of guys who absolutely think their cars a baby and should have been crying and as a joke and another group of guys who don't and the problem becomes it makes the story accurate or accurate enough because the quarterback in particular\nHas to be able to appeal to the different branches in NFL locker room for things that go to the right way so\nAs much as it sounds like I'm I'm hedging or not\nIt can be both can be truly Smith can think it's the report is fake and not understand hey man maybe you and your guys when you're hanging out with the tide as you're hanging out the receivers hearing in the office of Wyman wherever you're around the group of coaches you interact with maybe that's not\nThe overriding reality that may not be true in the line backers of hanging out and the guys in the secondary\nNFL locker rooms in their interest in their heart that covered ... hard to cover\nTheir so big they are so many personalities it's so divided\nFrom my experience I don't know Marcus Thompson but he's got a reputation as a really good reporter it makes sense doesn't mean it's fair but it makes sense that their car and all this turmoil has taken some of the blame for the mess John ... is a great\nNumber three in last night's game between the Sixers and pistons Blake Griffin had one of the best performances of his entire career he's got a career hype fifty points on twenty or thirty five shooting five three pointers in fourteen rebounds the pistons announced three and I

up on the deck gives off with the NFL today at twelve Eastern Pacific on CBS Dale Earnhardt junior\nI get more of a legend the regime's success story but\nThe most popular driver for what I think Fifteen Years ago the popular driver NASCAR Fifteen consecutive years phase of a sport and now retired and he wrote a book a new but I'm always interested in this 'cause there's a guy I used to write for a living for a long time even as a\nAt a certain point seasoned trained and I would like to think I Do think fairly successful writer the blank page is pretty terrifying I Can't imagine sitting down to write a book and we never really done that for a living and trying to get your\nMind around feeling all that space and so I always ask guys when when they join me on the various shows here CBS Sports where I interviewed Dale junior\nYou sort of where the motivation came from and that was where we started the conversation when I ask Dale Earnhardt junior\nWhy write this book now\nWell writing the book was a\nI don't know their therapeutic in a way but I went through a lot of things are in the last final four or five years of my race and career and and deal with this in concussion issues that\nAre some were documented and some are not and then I made the decision to retire and I got a call a lot of my ah supporters are friends and family by surprise\nAnd I'm In the book I really get the chance to explain why I made that decision uh also as a person who's\nRecovered from some serious concussions and and healthy and happy I have a urgency to try to raise awareness about treatment\nAnd making the right choices when faced with a situation when faced with the symptoms and the and the um instance of having a concussion I Want to be able to help people understand exactly what they need to do and where they need to go so\nThey don't make the same mistakes as I did and so it's been a great experience the books finally out came out yesterday\nAnd I'm already getting some break the back on social media and so forth from the fans and people that have read it even people that are dealing with concussions today and people that have family members and friends who have experienced the same thing\nSo it's been a great experience for me\nAnd which I figured it would be\nAnd I also ask Dale Earnhardt junior in our conversation what's going on bill rather with Iran right as new as Dale Earnhardt junior one of those like sharing so much personal information in the book\nI had a yeah ... so I was going through about four or five years there where I was getting concussions and personally documenting that experience but not\nNot going to a doctor and you know I wasn't sharing this information with my wife or my family and certainly didn't share it with the industry\nAnd if I caught up with me and I've gotten some real trouble because of that decision I I'm actually got to help I needed to get well and uh [noise]\nOf actually once I retired and was free of you know the responsibilities as a race car driver I can tell this story\nYeah I mean I just felt like\nMaybe I can help some people maybe I could help someone when I've been on the phone or had conversations with my doctor which we continue to stay in constant contact with each other over the years he's encouraged my transparency and\nEncouraged me to tell my side of the story in my experience because that has been driving people to his office to get help and so by writing this\nBook that's just another way of doing that and he's ... he's a part of the book he was a he wrote the forward and also a\nProvided a lot of insight into why I was responding the way I was why the concussions happened and what we did to treat them and so I appreciated his involvement alive because it adds a lot of credibility to the book\nAnd um he's excited about and does he he really firmly believe is going to help a lot of people so I'm excited to see that happen\nDuring our junior and I also had a ...\nHe's excited about and does he he really firmly believe is going to help a lot of people so I'm excited to see that happen\nDuring our junior and I also had a ... he's a huge football fan and I I wanted to know since he spent\nSo much of his book and and really wanted to discuss the concussion end of his career how we view sports like football Anna may which concussions are are and will continue to be a part of the landscape\nYeah it just I just hope that as we get smarter as there's more information available and more ... more you know more patience athletes\nParticularly and Dr speaking out and sharing their knowledge and information I just hope that um anyone an\nAthlete race car driver anyone any you know\nThe carpeting or a housewife or a child playing for anyone who finds\nHimself in trouble for head injury I just hope that they're going to make the right decisions\nAnd you know I Would never um\nTry to persuade someone from following their dream of becoming a race car driver or being a football player or being a boxer or anything they want to do in life\nJust that when they do face the sort of situations in dilemmas that they make the right choice to take time get in front of the right doctor get the right help take care of that before they go back to playing the game\nI think as we all are you know in a society get smarter and have more equipment and understanding and tools\nUh we can better you know prevent um\nIssues like my own where I didn't take care of this properly and it and it's um put me in a bad place\nIn lastly and talking to Dale Earnhardt junior asked him given the fact that he was for Fifteen consecutive years voted the fans\nWho thinks now can carry the torch we're NASCAR\nWe have an incredible uh you know we have so many dynamic personalities in the sport right now there's a lot of veterans a cabbage Kevin harming Jimmy Johnson and a\n... everybody knows most of those names those guys have been around for a while and and uh certainly had a lot of history and experienced some among them\nThere's a really solid core a of a young drivers coming into sport right now ... Baron would be another guy I mean there's just a long list of young drivers coming in\nThat are aged uh Eighteen to twenty five and a they're in the future of the sport\nAnd they will be in the sport for the next Twenty years and the unique thing about this group of guys is they grew up\n...\nRecord about the ... that can hang on against the rules and they were really good\nReally good if you like to join the conversation hang out a little bit before we sign off for the evening\nLove to hear from you\nYou can give us a call\nOn CBS portrayals toll free line it's eight five five to one to four to seven his budget by guy go everybody's bill here is a quick way you could say money's which to go do you need homeowners runners a motorcycle insurance to get it all\nThat guy go dot com we've\nNBA power Reagan's coming tomorrow pretty a pretty exciting\nIt's going to be just a tough talk I\nI I Know it's early and you don't wanna get too carried away but both the rappers and the books have looked really\nIn Juneau bottom ... what the next last even though they have a window that I get to go cabs last probably write a novel not under the Lakers last those are the other two teams that have one yet\nThe nicks actually aren't the worst team in the league that rate right\n... put up I he's actually my fantasy team is putting up some voice saying well yeah it's like a very very very very poor man's uh Kobe Bryant a lot of shots not alone efficiency\nSome points so a lot of victory ... I mean like it's basically if you take that expression it's it's an impoverished it's grossly impoverished version of\nKobe Bryant stew one war world war one word answer ready I'm ready no explanation no him and on cobra\nWill drop off the top like that\nOne more to answer your ready I'm ready no explanation no Hammond on Kobe Brian\nLeBron top like that\nYou like it to be in play in order anything more Savage to a Laker fan it's adage I Love it though\nNo [laughter] no explanation allowed SARS do LeBron for me to a\nReally good show today really fun show and great job I was you were Kovacs booking even Jane Harman who I Love this amazing but I wouldn't say\nRoutinely take say deep seated in interest in the gas we have on the show and listen to ... and it gives me a hard time\nActually when I was way it's a great job great job on deck Prescott by stew I agree that Prescott\nQuarterback of the Dallas Cowboys on the program earlier and one of the things we talked about was how he got the news he found out that a mark Cooper was going to be seen me\nYeah it was on the plane were coming back from Washington which day to day over to do uh to do some things some events within Washington ah and then so we're headed over and I woke up from a nap in a simpler teammate told me I guess he he was a had that with a wife by that time and just told me we just made a trait\nI Love the notion of of ... right I'm close my eyes right out of the is sleeping chill and like you know when you're ... planes leap into Europe in the air and kind of above the world headphones Ron I got your noise cancellation you wake up\nIn um our ... we're dream it's exactly like stews life when he wakes up in the morning and he thinks the raiders only index case it's nice ensues case it's a wiki nightmare\nI don't want it to the beach [laughter]\n[laughter] so must ... group and is still doing stupid quarterback conversations with people that that plays it sells wings no man is in charge\nOf your organization buddy a dog in the deck I also asked him what he thinks I mean let's be very well it's like let's keep it real mark Cooper very very good his first couple of years in the league\nVery disappointing last year continue to be disappointing this year and so I asked that\nWants to see think mark Cooper being on this team actually means\nIt offers are often it's a lot um and I'm so excited about it just everything as I said I haven't been such an explosive Clara God that\nYou can just give them the ball on a simple slant or just a hit trout and he can do the rest are guys like that I don't come around often so for us to be able to get one an added this all fence um it's so exciting but it starts when I was just executed doing doing odd jobs better and then when you put in a receiver like him are\nUm as you say we can put up a lot of points or excited about that\nYou know decked Prescott who's had his own interesting ups and downs right\nFirst year incredible replace Tony Romo second year not is incredible was pretty honest the interview and if you missed it by the way if you missed any of the interviews any of the show you could always find it on the podcast version of radio dot com and let me also say well I'm pointing to that several of you continued to ask about my Chris Paul story\nIt's a Fifteen minute tail\nBasically my my personal experience I have Chris poses regulatory of relates to I think he is the reporting really the reaching out from a clippers officials who are embarrassed by the way Chris Paul treated me\nAnd then those conversations that led to me I was a reporter at the time still consider myself a reporter did a lot of legwork on the NBA tied to get them who is Chris ... who is the guy that I that is presented to us and who is the guy that I interact with and got you know\nThirty F bombs set my way out of nowhere\nAnd it's a long tailed ... to me makes it clear that rage Enron was telling the truth if if you missed it we did it yesterday on the show was a probably a Fifteen minute cynically means is that sort of telling the story\nAnd it goes into great detail so you can find it on my Twitter sports writers ports Ari IT or if you're looking we we actually clip the the actual segment so you could just that part you could download\nOr you could go to radio dot com go to yesterday showing find it the first part of the second hour but ... for ... and I'm I'm very flattered and thank you for listening that you want to hear or you you heard about it on da show you heard about it in Miami or you saw it on Twitter ... and the whole story again but it's out there and they're it's available on my time on sports writer sports Ari I T E R\nAnd uh the very long story about my the reason I made Chris Paul jokes and the reason that I Believe\nUnequivocal he\nThat he is a phony but he's not the person than you think he is that he is a\nDeceptive and when he presented to you that he's not a good team made and that Ron does write and by the there's some nuance there and I said is hoping the interviews I had friends of principle\nOr supporters one case of ... people that like Chris Paul sort of pulled me aside and apologize for the way that that I was treated and I said fine reporter and it happens it was interesting their explanation wasn't Chris\nWas right it was Christmas is a really good dad ... really good husband he's just a different guy at work and he'd he'd read a lot of people this way but he doesn't mean too so there's he's and he wants to human being too and I've I've known people\nThat was a radio host in LA just a horrible colleague I I mean a horrible horrible human being a collie\nBut I think a pretty good dad and a pretty good husband some people are there's a there's a difference there and I think that's because Paul VI is I\nI never reported on Christmas personal life that's none of my business but it came back a lot of people just like she's not this guy away from basketball we promise\nAnd I'll take my answer was I'm not interested in who he is as a husband and father I Know a great team mates were terrible husbands and fathers and the husband father thing to me is a lot more important than the career thing but there are different things that I cover athletes they don't cover people as as husbands and parents so it's the first of all things nuance but I Do think that there's some information and it's interesting and and again and for those of you asking about\nSports writers porch or react to your uh getting back to Dick Prescott ... also asked him how this team deals with the constant criticism of head coach Jason\nYeah you know we don't listen to any outside noise and that's from the coast guard is a good job of making sure preaching to the team or we can listen to anything outside 'cause everything I'm outside of the guys\nThat matter or other trying to do is create a division within our team so it's important for us to know that um well we've got a what they have always got to continue to um to just back each other up and support each other a Sony we we don't focus on those things outside we give us a ... give ourselves a better chance atop success\nReally appreciate deck Prescott in his time on the show also spent some time talking about\nThe guilty verdicts for three figures in the world of college basketball to former Adidas wraps inspiring ... would be agent kind of runner found guilty federal court\nFor what in effect codify violations of the NC double a rules violations in recruiting amateurs into criminal law and these guys are going to prison\nAnd ... they may sentiment isn't I think to march it's not for a while\nThey very well may if if the federal government's interested if prosecutors interested give of other people in other information and other misdeeds in exchange for a lighter sentence this is very bad news for a whole bunch of this is a this is some big dominoes falling had Gary parish on the excellence college basketball guru my colleagues CBS Sports\nHad Gary on to get his perspective and to ask him in part\nTo what extent he believes this verdict will modify because it's criminal behavior now at least from one federal jury to what he's been modified behavior in college bass\nAnd it will modify because it's criminal behavior now at least from one federal jury to what he's been modified behavior in college basketball\nI think it's something that you at least got to think about if you are sneaker executive if you're a street agent if you're a college basketball coach because you're exactly right what a jury told the world today is that if you compromise no matter who you are\nA student athletes amateur status and then that student athlete and role of at a university accept a scholarship you have theoretically committed a federal crime and you can be prosecuted\nFor federal crime and you can't be convicted and you can be sent it to real time at a federal print that now I don't think every district attorney in America is going to be anxious to dive into cases like this but today was a historic day on some level because\nUm there is now a precedent for that and I do think at the very least if you are a coach or an agent or sneaker executive you have to have it in the back of your mind like yo this isn't just an issue anymore if I get caught it could also be a federal issue and and that's not far\nCan terrifying for that because we already have to find the Iran from carrying need at now no matter where am I only ill prepared\nWith her at home or

do you think your Red Sox and the world series or you went to the game last night I was at\nA it was awesome loud a it was or wasn't that cold was a little bit colder tonight I just like you know I'm not sell it costs like the red Sox are by the same and I think the one in five games I think they're better than the speed better ... better hitter bigger payroll\nYou know they they actually they were down to one and then they tied and they walked in Iran and then the uh Janey Martinez singled to write a drove into more I think that's where they're at now right forward to the sport\nDo you have to do that all throughout\nSo are you know they are the best team in baseball they went on learning games and not\nJust one Ninety two games when you think about it or they beat the Yankees and the Astros by both of their asses I mean the fact that I think the Yankees and a Astros are both better than the Dodgers to be honest with you so they've slaughtered I mean when they put in front of him and they're probably going to do the same thing to this game I think the Dodgers a win games in Los Angeles in fact\nI won't be surprised at all and they went all three games there\nOh wow that's a that's the for the gutsy statement right there maybe it's just too too cold and the for the job for the Dodgers right now I I don't know but just a requirement Red Sox seem like they're going to lose it all with an all out in the game and just read the grinder way with biggest gift he\nDon't even I I think that's a kind of you you're probably right about the weather 'cause everybody's saying it was cold and damp and and you know that a here's another one I heard and I really got an array of one at Dodger Stadium but on a road he's almost five runs a game well then why would you start and guided doesn't win on the road at Fenway Park you're going to get made and that's what's happening my\nPoint is if the guy so granting pitch 'em at home I mean they got all these other pictures I mean Mueller didn't have a problem in a you know went in that game seven in Milwaukee why not start him\nYeah yeah he was looking nasty for a little while they're still in the first three or four and a ... seat in the last ... less than a\nShow or can you imagine if somebody if they win it this will be there for the world series championship and Fifteen Years is that right\nYeah so it'll be a for Thirteen and now this year it's funny I was walking around the stadium but ... but if I said when I was looking at stuff\nAll the championship some nice you know five ... and they seem like the same thing a facade of a century they want for World Series on all night the a team and then later when he got the same thing a hundred years ago it would be like if there for two thousand each team will be the funniest they want to have another drought they'll\nKnow what do you think of a when you live there even live there are a lot in your life what do you like going to the bash the patriots the red Sox are the Celtics are the Bruins games the big games like the playoff games\nWith more respect for the Gulf out west of what's going to go up my dad and I guess a little bit of an easier drive like just like if there's only a home games a year and the site and\nAsk for being a working in Boston there's nothing like the popular over the life guard and wash them for one of the the topics so

Nineteen he's got seven sixty of or one of five downtown for a for from the line\nThree rebounds from a triple double at this point and then a in this game everybody scoring Lance Stevens ... got a\nUh twelve spot a God well pope tan or Josh heart twelve a ball\nGot eight and six ... six dimes there you go it is ten seven and selling again McGee is got Seventeen and five when a steel and four block shots\nPlaying ... got seven genes for and won with a block shot settlers are doing it all the night if you're interested and if you're a Laker fan that's all happening\nThe Dodgers are in big trouble they're down to all in the world series they got there at bait in Boston that's just the bottom line that's where they're at so friday night is game three if they don't win that it's over\nThey got their ass beat in Boston that's just the bottom line that's where they're at so friday night in game three if they don't win that it's over\nI mean literally there will be over and that'll be that there's no way you're beaten that game four straight times right so they have to win that game a lot of people say that series isn't necessary so the other team but I still at home right\nAre you buying or selling that after what you saw them do in Boston there down in a de Paul if you ask me I mean or to win so everyone in the world series and when you went on a game and then you kick the Astros asking\nThe Yankees ask your and your beating the Dodgers asked already do not it it's over I think it's over now\nI think it would be very hard to imagine this Red Sox team was how good they been\nLosing for the next five games and ... now I think at this point the only question is do the Dodgers lay down and ended quick\nOrder the Dodgers give you a little a little juice and maybe take two out of three at home and send you back to Boston for a game six you know with a little bit of drama maybe but but I don't see how this Red Sox theme without great they are losing four out of the next five games I just don't\nSee so just a you know I'm just saying is right now Devin Booker just pulled up his hand me in that game and he left the game is on the sideline and he's come Paul late late limping he's done he's done Vernon Iowa hand me some done by because he just shut it down\nOne on one eighty one a Lakers Joe in Houston age down what's happening\nWith a room and told me so mad I ate out a lot so it had jobs back on a bandwagon slam\nHere man my baby getting married for ... big man I'm going to the man she can be\n... because you don't ... job up with that\nMan and I mean by that may have moved I moved\nTo new location may and everything else you know I'm I'm doing my thing but I wanted to talk to you about the\nMan I little yeah All right\nOkay now you see how you do man where Jane Harman need to say\nHe needs to get rid of the beard\nAnd they live with her home in Alabama you know what I'll watch the game tonight ... we'll talk I wanted to a game and they need to incorporate\nA call me a little a little bit more man I don't like are they doing Carmelo man outlook mellow I don't like how they do on\nHim and they don't use ... and they don't use them at all he's like oh Vin points a game it's embarrassing\nAnd then he said he found out when he in the game\nIt looked kind of good you know what I'm\nSaying but they're not using them you know saying like I Walk and basketball you know\nWhile he ... he had twenty ... twenty news uh seven barge two times a steel and a block shot in thirty nine minutes he shot nine at\nSeventeen and and a three of aid from downtown to me that's as good as they'll get from them at the end of twenty two point nine every night they're going to be in good shape\nYou know but they don't follow them and then you know it was just like put him acclimate him to the to the game and it's like I'm looking over the man is like been telling me you know the the season going to be in all of this I heard you talking about it I'm gonna tell you something about Ron do to Iran do ... things again is really going to go there I'll tell you there\nAnd listen I Am ... I Would agree with you that I Would probably start Anthony more than they're they're playing Carter Williams twenty minutes but then they're playing mellow forty minutes off the bench I mean why not just play mellow and then bring Carter Williams on the bench because it ... Carter Williams had seven points\nIn twenty minutes and does not thing and you got a guy bland thirty nine minutes give any of that kind of productivity and mellow tonight that twenty two now that may be that second unit he leads the second unit in scoring I get all of that\nBut I think at some point or another you'll see Dan Tony sweat gym into the starting line up this year I don't think he's going to be\nI'm On the bench the whole season began as well right now are there a disaster\nThere one in three and a low into at home I thought they'd win denied hands down I was all over the rockets tonight I got burned because now I don't trust them at all they're\nUh they're not the same game they were ...

you the truth about what they\nThought about it because all the time they weren't twenty four hours a day I don't care how long they weren't the players don't play well they don't win I won't do that with my you know why the hell\nAnd behavior at those games have so little of this ... this way [noise]\n[noise]\nSo much in Vegas in Vancouver and over time under a minute to go tied up and uh the nights are bad multiple chances to score and witness game and they haven't been able to get it done and Vancouver's all over him and I mean Vegas had their shots and here we are under a a minute\n... got to park and it's like they're a plan for a shoot out but they had their chances discord flurries made the big saves\nGot right to ask you a question uh why do you think they're not I mean they obviously don't look like last year same at all I Know it's the new year but when you go to the Stanley Cup finals the expectations are are heavy and they have not shown up yet this year at all\nLook there's there's no way that they're going to be able to duplicate what they did last year it was their first season and they went\nAs far as you could possibly go\nWithout winning it right and it and it was from the jump I mean remember how good they were to be getting last year I mean they got out every game they got out to a huge dark\nAnd it and it just carried them all the way through that kind of had a little low in the middle and then they kicked it back up towards the end of the regular season at a carrot into the play offs and the and what's going to be hard for the fans out there is and you talked about this when you know when they were in the final is\nYou know this is all they know right now is winning and go to this data compiled it ain't gonna be like this every year and even the start they're having\nYou know this is all they know right now is winning and go to the Stanley Cup finals are going to be like this every year and even the start having now I mean listen they're not terrible there they're but they're not what they were in October last year\nAnd not and I'm not at all and I think they're a playoff\nTeam I think it will be in the play offs but do you expect that they did last year to happen again you just you can't do it just can't\nHave you have you watched them play do you think uh I I have\nNot seen much of them this year yet because I just uh I haven't gotten going too much on the late night with on the weekends so football or so um and then here they've been on a couple of times while we're on and that's it\nYou know Vancouver's actually been surprisingly decent started the season\nThey have they were ah the experts that they would be one of the worst teams the NHL to\nWrite because they were right\nAnd now all of a sudden they're playing decent right but\nLike we just said would be it's early\nIt is very early and like today I have two more in line there's Fifteen\nTo twenty games before I started when it really ah get crazy about who's doing bad who's doing good\nMother about a twenty games now so they're like most of the teams are you know ten five for like ten ten games but there you go\nAll right and see what you're saying so um but Vancouver hasn't been a all that bad I think eventually it'll get job but um there are two points ahead of the Vegas Golden knights in the Pacific sharks lead that division\nI said the from the beginning that I thought the addition of Carlson would be a difference maker for the sharks they were already good now they're better uh and they're tied with the docks for first in the Pacific do you think San jose will keep it up all year and B that team 'cause I thought like I said member on\nThe show I thought the sharks would be you know my gas\nOr from the west is basically Nashville when a bag again and San jose\nYeah I think there'll be there it's is it do I think could set in stone is going to be one of those three teams in the Stanley Cup finals no because so much can happen between now and then but\nThey've played okay they kind of turned it on that win last night over Nashville I think that we really get them going because they have been they had along the east coast trip to start the year\nI'm a\nI I thought they learned in the ... some Vancouver last ... twins right they both are done yes and the boy you'd think that day would be a worse for the where wouldn't do that without those guys are doing all the damage they caused on the ice would points in golden assess that day would be worse but they're actually better without on\nWell you know the last couple of years for those guys weren't exactly you know they weren't exactly lighten it up like they were right for most of their career so\nIt's a it's a different kind of trade off I Mac and Jack you're on CBS Sports radio\nThey bought I enjoy your ... your college football yeah we're talking about ... you know breaking down to a ... year old one one one of those teams that cost accomplished book right but it ... me it it is going to worry about like call me at all costs they left because of\nYou know Georgia and Florida are you going to please juggle a muggy as we play we play warehouse money right now and the data for almost ... goes to a to win in my home town I'm a cocktail party\nIf we do that that that would that would be\nSo do you go to their mandated desire to that game\n... that's the best the poll or a girl you can't go to we got very oh is that right even in Jacksonville you can tell you this or that they\nOwn the stadium is really the\nActual what they're doing Scott it adds to you know the ads thanks to all of the you know when the Jack ... when when the when you know when the when the well actually the ... already in the ... every every year we have ... ... ...

eighty percent of the time [noise]\nIt's happened in the fall classic [noise] now a year ago the Dodgers had home field advantage in the world series\nAnd they [noise] ended up losing the fight [noise]\nThey're down oh to build the series is heading to Chavez Ravine and Dodger Stadium\nIs a huge ask especially when the Dodgers that have gone to silent about like cricket do you know that there were no Dodgers hit after the top of the fourth at Fenway Park in game two\nThere were no Dodgers hit\nAfter the fourth inning [noise]\nNow you could look at\nThat their percentage with runners on base was slightly better\nThan what it was engaging number one\nExcept there were no guys don't\n\nThey didn't leave a lot of guys on base because they got very few guys on base there were one for three with\nRunners in scoring position which came in the fourth inning they had bases loaded it could've been worse there was a sacrifice fly for ... camp there was an RBI single for ...\nAnd that was it and they did not get another hit\n\nAnd so for the red Sox with David Price starting with three guys out of the bullpen including a guy that there has been starting to them and Nathan ... in their clothes are Craig kimbrell who seems to have fixed the issue in his mechanics\n\nThey've got the perfect formula right now they are heading they continue to drive and runs with two outs in fact all four of their RBI in this game on Wednesday night at Fenway Park came with two outs including the big JD Martinez to run single\nAnother episode of the Ryan Madsen show I think Boston is enjoying every episode of the ride Madsen show so far\nBut even a two run lead feels insurmountable for the Dodgers at this point because\nThey are not hitting it's not just with runners in scoring position in game two they didn't get anybody on base to drive home and so right now it's a lopsided affair the red Sox have a two oh leave they've won both the games in Boston which means they preserved their home field advantage\n\nAnd now they had to Los Angeles or as I saw one of their bench coaches tweet we're going to Hollywood is after hours\nWith Amy Lourdes on CBS Sports radio thanks so much for

the oddest bed fellows in sports\nThey work together well they managed to not only coexist but to succeed\nIt's like ... and yang\nLike oil and water they would never hang out away from their profession\nBut when they get together in a sport whether it's basketball baseball football hockey whatever it is\nCan be a different sport\nCoaches to I don't know if this one's odd but it's definitely not\nOn paper a relationship that you would think would be so successful and yet in his second year it already is how about showing McVeigh\nYoungest head coach in the NFL\nAnd wait Phillips\nOldest coach in the NFL a former head coach himself now a defensive coordinator and the two of them work together\nThey go together like peanut butter and jelly roll rooms except it's odd on

poke the bear a little bit\nWorried about a remote little boy [laughter]\nBut he's a guy that has the rest of the NBA eating out of his hand and then land Steven said I wouldn't call him an outcast by

adversity\nTo either bring out the best or\nIf it isn't a locker room or a club house with great leadership and good character it tends to bring out the worse\nBy now there's a whole lot of drama in Oakland it'll be up to John Gurdon and to the captains in that locker room with the raiders to help keep them together\nAnd try to find some positive momentum\nHours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio we're heading into week eight in the NFL and of course I'm already Cooper just got treated\nThe tree deadline is still a few days away for the big question for Gurdon is about any future moves out both ... and I'm Ari Cooper had been moved\nBattlefields making any more trade that is just making sure the other day I really did was sometimes like I said oh you're blessed James Worthy like in London you don't know who's going to call your what they're going to say you really don't know that goes all phases of life on God don't make it any more trades\nI don't see us making any more trade score city at the Kavli out of I didn't see is making a trade the other day and\nJibe with what Reggie McKenzie has said which is\nWe weren't planning on trading Cooper we weren't going to give him up for anything less than a first round pick and we didn't think it was going to offer us the first round pick but here comes Stephen Jones and the Dallas Cowboys and they offer\nThe only thing that we would have taken in return for I'm already Cooper and so Gurdon why he probably wasn't blindsided by it didn't see that one coming either can you imagine how his locker room reacted when they finally heard the news now that's got to put a lot of guys on edge writes the fact\nHad two of their best players in their mid twenties get traded she other teams so what about it coach Gurdon\nWhen you think about moving forward now and the fact that you've had two guys who have been traded away her in the prime of their careers worth a whole lot of money to other teams\nWas that the plan\nWas I was now but I'm like I said the plans you know first in ten or when you run the board game six yards sometimes you know holding color you get some adversity you got to respond\nAnd it's a hard thing to do sometimes um and where do we think is best for the raiders\nWhile there certainly is a whole lot of diversity now we'll find out what kind of character they've got from their leaders on down it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio one of those leaders is Derek cars a captain\nAs the quarterback and he understands he gets it probably speak for the entire locker room when he talks about this idea of maybe getting a phone call and finding out you have been traded before Tuesday's deadline\nMy brother told me when I can I mean I felt because they they are going to cut you some good so that that's always a realization for anybody in our locker room we all have to show up and\nGive are both on the front filled the room and all those kinds of things to make sure we're around you know for for a long and so a lot to be honest with you um [noise] quarterback your confidence I'll be here tomorrow and when we turn this around I'm very confident I'm going to be here when we do that as well\nHow 'bout that perspective from Derek car his brother and told him when he got into the lead if they'll cut Peyton Manning they will cut you I mean it's a tough business what\nIt's\nSo true though right and Peyton Manning you'd get caught well than anybody can get caught and he's just an example and quarterback there have been many other quality players who've been cut for nothing other than financial reasons\nSo Derrick are believe he's going to be the quarterback of the Oakland Raiders moving past week number eight again the deadline is on Tuesday but that\nStop the drama and the rumors from voting around it also doesn't stop people talking about Derek are having lost the locker room and guys not listening to many more guys out following he's the lead anymore a ends\nThis whole idea that he was crying on the field but he lost the locker room because he was crying on the field after he took a hard hit to his left shoulder against the sea hawks in London up\nAt any minute drive in is going to talk to them you know if they don't want to put their name on a I'm a labor of what it is a movement from the minute you know they want to come to my locker with the other

I'm sure\nI'm real quick point is if they want to get rid of the reasons that they have a kind of like a good point about the same well we're sure like to watch um\nOh is that the game and\nHe has really been weren't that over the last three years raiders fans are horrible the number one issue that with that last people\nAre taken is and again I was there for everyone in the stadium which school you know call time at all because the more they line up to kick that extra point was as if they were rushing\nStill at one point and operating in St overloaded the stars aren't as good as we got sent home one side\nAnd something just didn't feel like everybody is you know screaming at the coach of our mouth but it is what it is a\nWell I feel like OK Johnson Tucker felt like he was rushed\nAnd felt like he wasn't ready show he's ... he's at his responsibility at the same time how many other of those two hundred and twenty three consecutive point after attempts do you think the situation wasn't quite perfect wind was blowing\nGuys were rushing maybe you didn't feel right I mean it's it's a guinea ... it's still a if I can lay up in basketball it's still something he could do in his sleep probably with his eyes closed\nSo yeah I mean I get what you're saying if it's a long field goal and it just it felt like things weren't right or you know something was going to take away from his kick he\nCould have but there's no way he's going to use that as as an excuse\nThough I was going up but I mean take the time to recruit them you know it's again I agree with you just personal so if he thought he should have done or of all its moments like that that happened you know it seems like every three\nOkay it's not our boss fault that Tucker miss a cat [laughter]\nSo it's not the all time out of Sonia from the because the flow of the game and the way everything thought just for the touchdown and it was almost as if everybody was saying well slow slow down so to regroup all time out but it just it didn't happen that way\nYeah no I Would think that it would mean considering that you'd want to get that point of the board as quickly as possible so that you could make sure the game was tight and send it into overtime\nBut but I mean this for ... what was the Carolina\nI'm a truck with us but it's going to affect the ravens the offensive line will cause issues for a candidate and players like are quote on on both you know end up being a good position of equation I think we're quite a way to to get it so\nThat you were you on the road you know the score twenty four twenty or twenty or something like ...\nAll right thanks so much Tony I appreciate your phone call\nYeah I feel like this particular game of the ravens defense has played well now early on the eagles looks great Carson went switch great in that game\nI remember going back to two week number six and Thursday Night Football for the eagles but I felt like it was maybe a turning point for them because finally the often looked so comfortable and when I looked like he was in a position a ... to ... back in that flow that earned him MVP\nConversation last year before he got hurt and to billions up Seventeen nothing early in the fourth quarter and the Panthers start cooking and they get those three touchdown drive in a row meanwhile the eagles stumble and and Carson said I'm not really sure what happened we just took our foot off the gas\nAnd they had a pair of ... I think one of them was a three and out the other one was maybe a handful yards they maybe got one first down and then the phone call which of course was the the game clincher there but he looks so comfortable most of the game so if the the pay interns are going to win I'm Sorry if\nThere's a yes okay there's but I was referring to the right within the ravens are going to win this game they need to get\nCam Newton out of his comfort zone of course you want to make life difficult you want to get comfortable for him and you want to make sure that you don't vote on the gas if you get in a position to when I'm I feel like that kind of a quarter the Panthers just had\nIn coming back against the eagles can really galvanized the team and can be a springboard for them so we'll see if they use that moving forward pushes their bust hard\nNot to mention you've obviously got a very competitive and in the south now it's the same for the AFC North where the ravens are been talking about the Panthers they're trying to keep up with the same two one five consecutive games and of course\nOne of them was that last one was against the ravens but the painters or again back at four and to me while in the AFC North with every team losing last week except for the Steelers now it's Pittsburg with that tie\nThat has moved to the top of the north division\nIt's after hours with Amy Lawrence

what they say\nPlayoff series does it actually start until a team wins on the road\nSo now it's up to the Dodgers to protect their home court\nTo protect their territory protect this house a at Dodger Stadium Chavez Ravine they're going to do that friday\nSaturday and then if they can extend the series on Sunday so next three games taken over your weekend the world series Friday Saturday and Sunday if necessary the Dodgers would actually be in front it's just\nThey can't hit right now they're all sense is meager it's missing it's MIA endgame number two they had not a single hit after the fourth inning\n\nI mean that's tough tough to win a game even though you could point to the pitcher is you can point to the right match and show you can say once again poor decision by Dave Roberts to bring him in with guys on base you can say about mats and he walked in Iran yes he sure did he faced eighty Martinez\nHe gave up to run with two outs in fact the red Sox with all of their runs coming onto out\n\nRight now they're the ones producing and the Dodgers they're struggling to come up with any kind of positive all sense of momentum obese could absolutely change when they get home\nBut they're going to have to do better than three hits\nIt was the coldest start\nOf young gene reuse career for whatever that word and it was cold or at first pitch and windy or met it was windy then it was for game one on Tuesday night that generally favors the pitchers but\nI Love the Dodgers aren't making life difficult or the red Sox pitchers credit David Price with another host season when so getting here now back to back strong performances in the playoffs after ... what was a\nStretch of over nine that you've heard about so often he looked good and he said calm and simple those were the two words that I Would go with the two mindsets comb and simple and so oh how the tide has turned\nThe red Sox getting not just the two out RBI but also being able to put the pressure on hunting review and get him out of the game before he finished up the fifth inning\nRyan ... while he is in charge with any runs this weird thing about major league baseball and actually baseball in general I feel like a ... it's always bothered me I Know this is how they do it it's how they score those runners that were on base they weren't mad sins responsibility so I understand why the runs or charge to review\nBut for now in back to that game he's coming in and the red Sox have these did\nThe walk is definitely his problem it's definitely his responsibility to walk the pairs with the bases loaded oh it's like a ... a punch to the guy but again the credit goes to the red Sox and outlets Cora for making the right moves\nSo David Price go six and then it's a perfect progression through the bullpen

weeks and I'm Mark listening in Leesburg, Florida a mark\nA bright how you doing good where do you think about all these who have nine separate packages now what do you think the overall aim is it's got to be from the same people\nSure um first of all you can leave your shirt on TALK\nAnd you got to make a statement gets simple God she's Robert ... oh really okay yeah I'm I think it's a group of people I think it's multiple people that are doing this um I don't think it's just one person I think they want to make an impact they didn't go after the Democrats and they didn't they didn't target both of them\nBecause they wanted to make an impact so they just went up to the Democrats\nDebate you know give Trump a hard time I think it's um it's a group of them not just what mob mentality work in a group like they did with Kavanaugh\nEthic that's what the problem is and I think you're going to find it that one it's a bunch of all\nWas the design to actually function at a certain uh our uh ... you know after they were received the answer to that might be no that\nThat this is really a a a a dangerous device because it has black powder in it but it's really a movie device it's a TV show device because\nYou know it looks threatening and act threatening but it actually would not detonate a\nThe movie device it's a TV show device because you know it looks threatening at X. threatening but it actually would not detonate a intentionally by design could have detonated by accident if if they're right activities if they're right actions were taken on it\nI mean we know a couple of things where if it is true and it's a dummy device who we wouldn't be able to detonate I Wonder what we can learn from it and how much danger postal workers were in UPS drivers were in\nAnybody was in how far did he get now we know it wasn't going to get close to the Clintons house we don't go to George tours his mailbox we got to Brock Obama's didn't get to his house but got to his location where his mail is distributed or John Brennan was actually sent to CNN even though it doesn't work there\nAnd they spelled his name Ron Eric Holder Maxine Waters that too and now you have Robert De Niro and Joe Biden and didn't get to actually to their house and I'm Wondering where other with those people who were handling it if it was a legitimate bomb as it turns out not to be were they in danger and do we have to amend the system again\nYeah I think that uh will again remains to be seen if the devices or actually did have a running timer attached to some sort of power source a battery a battery device within the timer\nOr the clock mechanism is there a power source there that that could have actually triggered these devices good question secondarily if if certain mishandling a bouncing the devices around a machine sorting the devices\nOr they sufficient to but you know potentially trigger that can cause a an injury or death or or maybe somebody look if if black powder in it and in a one inch PVC pipe with glass it sorted all that PVC is potential shrapnel as well\nAh the glass as potential shrapnel could you kill somebody could you blind them could you maimed somebody ... you know cause them to lose a hand unarm\n'em because of the the amount of black powder that's all in my mind a possibility this is a dangerous device even if it couldn't have been triggered by the clock because the the person didn't have the technical skill right to detonate this it's still a very dangerous devices\nOn I just want to get your mind taking in twisting around just to see what other conclusions you get too so we pulled marry an old tool or she's a profile or oh she was on CBS this morning this is what she would some of her conclusions go on\nI Would be looking at that forensic and our results [noise] um and also the behavior it's a combination of the tennis so for example the FBI lab will be looking at the functionality on these devices are they intentionally not working or are they not exploding because that's how powerful I'm I'm\nKind of case if they are intentionally designed\nNot to explode but to create fear and panic um then we can possibly expect to see an escalation and finance another batch of bombs had come out on this subject for me that this is someone that really plan this out quite well\nSo we should not assume that mistakes that we see in a posting of Pakistan's are fake but may think on purpose ...\nThere's also an arrogance about being a ... and\nThis is someone who um it's creating a green Sahara fear and panic in New York and then on the area and he's enjoying my hair and fat have power and control and I'm not the kind of study and getting out of\nReally being the center of attention now throughout the country and it's probably like a narcotic for him so that can play a part in housing\n... or how the series of attacks may ... wow the word of bombs is that your fear was that you worry\nYeah that that is a concern some of these are folks who are building devices are very often are testing them beforehand I think we saw that with the the Chelsea bomb\nA more that the guy had been created some other devices was testing them near his house a bad happens with some of these guys and so how does he evolved from this does he is he fearful because of this big law enforcement response right you have\nFBI Secret Service New York police department post ... ... postal inspectors um US Capitol police all engaged in this so far and other law enforcement as well um the does that make him fearful and say holy crap I'm going to get caught and he pulls back\nOr does it it power him and hasn't Mary Ellen was saying does it in Boulder him is that the rush he's looking for and say look look at the that the power that I hold you see sometimes this with arsonist who are ... they they are they start a fire and they pulled back to watch the response that excites them [noise]\nSo what kind of a fender do we have a you know the next few days may tell us that\nYeah my lines are jammed I Want to let the people talk for a while but before we go can you let me know what it's like in New York New York has got the sense that they can do things themselves and maybe they earned that right that we have a very uh steamed counterintelligence operation at the same time the FBI comes in and they want to run things\nAre they ... the joy terrorists taskforce or they clashing do you know how they're doing right now\n[noise] yeah I think we we have some good leadership up there I Know a bill Sweeney of the the assistant director charged a friend of mine\nUpright apartment I just saw him uh about ten days ago down and down in Orlando a runs counter terrorism for the FBI J. T. F. John Miller is an FBI alumni I think those relationships have matured and moved to the right direction\nI don't think ... particularly because these devices are popping up and other places around the country\nNYPD understands if it's terrorism the FBI takes the lead I think that department gets it um and that these relationships are mature enough now\nThat look this is a combination a team effort not a one department effort a ... at the FBI as I understand that the FBI has taken the lead on evaluating these devices out at the lab in Quantico\nThis should be a team sport right now we need the team to come together I think these participants get that\nGot a run thanks so much sure thing ...\nRun out and go a former deputy director the FBI or every line is Jim I'm going to try to get to as many as possible one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine by the way the serious times but Andrew Jackson the miracle neurons out in paperback I Hope to talk to all you\nIf not in St Louis on friday night in Baton Rouge on Saturday or New Orleans on Sunday you listen to the brain to meet you see is Brian kill made [noise]\nAttention business owners and independent contractors this is a money saving message from tax mediation services if your business those twenty thousand dollars or more in taxes we going to help you today right\nNow lives in dealing with the IRS is no picnic it's an intimidating and extremely stressful process and you don't want to go it alone our attorneys know every law every tax break and every possible opportunity to help you resolve and reduce your tax dead\nAnd if you owe more than twenty thousand dollars you may be the top of their hit list\nBreak and every possible opportunities to help you resolve and reduce your tax dead\nAnd if you owe more than twenty thousand dollars you may be at the top of their hit list so don't take your tax that lightly because it will not go away on its own the IRS conceived your bank account\nYour home and even shut down your business call our tax experts today at one eight hundred three one eight six nine three four and a lot of us deal with the IRS while you focus on your business\nThat's one eight hundred three one eight six nine three four again that's eight hundred three one eight six nine three for\nDo you have an idea for an adventure interview product do you think companies would be interested in ... after you want to try to get a patent garlic bread help now it keeps your idea confidential unexplained every step of adventure process we create professional materials representing your idea and submitted to companies who are looking for new ideas we have more than nine\nThousand companies agreed to review ideas in confidence if a company shows interest in manufacturing you were adventure we can negotiate on your behalf we of helped over\nTen thousand clients receive ... we also offer services including three D. modeling an animation demonstrating your idea rotor typing services and we used to be our technology to show and been held client ideas to additional companies joined the dolphins of people just like you who chose invent helped to\nPursue their idea we're experience we are working for you we are in better\nAlcohol is for free information at one eight hundred five four or five zero Seventy five that's one eight hundred by four or five zero seven eight five again one eight hundred and five four or five zero seven eight five\nNews talk W.

ads are will not be today's fastest today\nFor you and the mom right yes daughter yeah yeah ... ... we're pretty excited here in the ... no doubt about it and you can just hear the heart palpitations ... that are everyone's excited hey I spent the day\nWell I think that the you know really one thing that's a\nDifferent this year you know us prices are very competitive but yeah I was just base that they're they're very competitive prices\nAnd a ... folks around the world that we work with on a daily basis are tracking the market's pretty closely and well yes encouraging but it's actually pretty normal for what happened that export exchange a when you put these buyers and sellers together they start to look at you know where they're headed for the next year I'll prepare much looking\nOr they get information on the marketplace but this year again I think there's yeah there's been some concerns on on what's going on with trade but where the very strong competitive position on gay grants on corn on ethanol on on all the you know our co products ... things like that so\nAgain it's sort of a robot a meeting and people are are are are ... you know doing business\nWhich is what we want to hear yeah and like you said Tom uh the u._s. grains are basically on sale to every country out there except for China right now right\nYeah but we've got a delegation here from China just the you know the Cape\nTalks going keep contact the live or\nYou know they're not doing too much business right now but there's still interest in us products us DVDs us corn but a U.S sorghum even and uh now we're still talking\nTo everybody else is is pretty much here in a in a pretty good mood good climate\nOkay so tell me about the Chinese delegation I obviously they still want to do business but what how did they see the relationship between China and the U.S right now\nWhile there they they know it's difficult we know it's difficult or they feel the same way as we do let's\nLet's get talking let's let's hope for\nWell it's difficult or they feel the same way as we do let's\nLet's get talking let's let's hope for better days ahead but uh you know we've had a long long a period of ... since Nineteen eighty two really since we've been involved with China or you know working together with their industries you know we're seeing where we can have\nCooperative programs there still interested in working with us they're still interested\nIn us grants because again they know they're they're they're competitive um you know basically more competitive than there are alternatives sources so\nAgain we liked the mixture of ... by the folks that came a day notes\nTimes are tough but they're hoping for better times were up for better times\nAnd uh you know we just keep talk again hopefully a you know the two governments will will start talking again soon\nYeah Tom I I Know the U. S. grains council is handsome trade team some foreign trade teams taking them out on farms are around the U.S have you been involved in any of those\nWell sure yeah here and they're everywhere yeah yeah we're you know we'd like to make to see how the now the reception is going and what they're seeing and what they're what the teams are are talking about yeah sure\nYeah so I don't have got to be such rewarding\nThere that's got to be time Los than not only for the U.S producers but for the trade team to come and see where where's the product that that they want is being grown that's got to be a really cool event\nIt's always a reward yeah so I mean you know at the age old uh you know saying that you like to do business with people you know well we're making sure that they they know the people they know they they're familiar with the the farmers that are growing the crops are that connection really means a lot to them both when it happens here in the United states\nAnd you know as well as when the farmers go overseas they like to see you know sort of the production system behind the behind the product elect you see the transportation system by the grading system are contracting system seeing all these things up front\nIn some cases are we bring buyers into meet their salaries for the first time in the face to face basis so that's a\nThat's pretty cool when that happens but again they also like talking to farmers in understanding some of the pressures they're under and the and the care that they take the to grow their crops\nYeah Tom I have not had a lot of exposure to those\nTrade or the the trade teams coming in from other countries but the Asian trade teams in in particular\nAre so interested in the details\nWhat it takes to move that product from the field to the elevator\nDown the rail down the river whatever they're so interested in the detail of of parliament aren't they\nYeah yeah I think the whole chain how it comes together and how again farmers take care of their crops the quality or how they handle you know even things like pesticides application and things like that they like to understand more about that\nHow farmers care about water quality how they care about their own environments how they take care of their their their machinery their employees all the above they'd love to see their family life that really gives them a special\nSpecial thrill uh it it's great again we like to just shorten the difference between you know the farmer and the end user and the best way to do it is that is to have these people meet face to face talk face to face and and understand each other better that's usually you know under pins a great trade relationships\nWhat a great way to say it short in the distance between the the the grower in the fire I think that's a great way of putting it now us grains council been working for a long time to develop those markets over in Asia China has been a big target of it but when you get into south east Asia\nOr there's been a lot of effort spent down there as well and now we're getting word that there's going to be some\nTrade talks with the Philippines tell us what are you know about that Tom\nWell yeah we've been working with the administration pretty routinely on on trade on trade negotiations now that uh\nThe NAFTA one is is done and we have the U.S MCA and hopefully that\nGoes to ratification process we're starting to get some momentum going which is something we always wanted to see\nAnd yeah we've been talking a lot Southeast Asia has been a very constant source of attention from us we've been talking to folks are throughout the U.S to argue and administration\nAre about free trade agreements in Southeast Asia and we knew Philippines was on the list and we also know that they were taking a look at the countries like Vietnam and maybe a way down the road Indonesia Philippines since me coming to the front of the line which is fine for us\nUh you know uh we we see good prospects there to we have some really interesting things going on with the ethanol market in the Philippines\nI'm a you know corn left her so but it's still it's still a market for us corn and as well as DVDs so we have a things to gain in the Philippines um but we also encourage the administration to continue looking at Vietnam and\nContinuing gauging with Indonesia south east Asia big growth area for us agriculture\nYou've that put Malaysia in there as well it was really encouraging the other day in a a\nA exports sales report that we had a\nA couple of votes of beans leaving the west coast that were bound for Vietnam that's all part of the development and\nAnd everything that the u._s. grains council is is a is all about what's our best growth potential over there do you think right now and I ... I I understand that China is still it's a great market it's it's got great\nGreat growth potential if we can get beyond the trade difficulties that we're having right now\nWhat do you think might be a shining\nShining market that's going to surprise some people\nWho are you know we just talked about really chipping ... is is people don't know there's this growing the market in the world meeting that their feet industry is that has the fastest rate of growth of anywhere in the world and we see that as a as a big a big plus\nSoutheast Asia in general is a great place for us Indonesia can be a game changer for us uh on the other side and the feet side\nOn we had over sixty people from South East Asia alone come door export\nExchange a meeting and so that just shows you\nAre the interest in in what's going on here in in looking for the U.S has sources supply\nAnd the interest so we have in that region again Vietnam a Vietnam are you know formerly known as Burma or Malaysia to a lesser extent the Philippines or put them all together and we've got we've got some really exciting dynamics there\nWere also looking a strongly at what we call South Asia or you know frontier markets places like India Pakistan\nOr Bangladesh a you know ... ... even the pollen and very much shut down the road but those areas that have some good prospects for us too so um you know in South Asia south east Asia put them all together and got a lot of people and you've got a lot of market there\nBoy Tom I tell you what I'm Glad that you mentioned India there so that I didn't have to come back to it because\nYeah there you got a lot of people and you've got a lot of market there\nBoy town I tell you what I'm Glad that you mentioned India there so that I didn't have to come back to it because it seems like every time I have a conversation about global trade\nI always get emails saying you don't talk enough about India I'm Glad that you brought it up thank you Tom I'm\nReally appreciative we'll talk with you again\nReal soon [noise] okay so do you ... that sounds like us grain [noise]\nMovement farming getting things done early here's a way of setting you up for success using corn is or an early season when we\n[noise] we don't directly while we don't do any direct research on the on the fuel itself or with it and users\nOf the fuel we touch every step in the commercialization path way up to the point where it is a fuel when it is a fuel the leaves are building\nGotcha gotcha okay that's interesting so um so I asked I watched the I shouldn't say watch these new plants come online as I watched the new plants come on line it seemed like the fish and sea continue to grow\nWith with each new generation of technology in the plant can we expect more of that going forward John\n... chip I'm sitting here right now with a with a smile that only I can see since\nWe're on the radio [laughter] oh\nI Love that subject matter it it it's it's a whole radio segment in and of itself and ... and here's why in the early years of the national ... Research Center anytime that you would pick up a a trade journal and and here a phrase\nSuch as the USDA states that the theoretical yield of ethanol from a bushel of corn is and then they would give a number and that number was generated right here at the national on death in our Research Center chip it's it's amazing the distance\nThat we've come in and just the last decade and and I argue you know keeping in mind at all times I had a strong bias is the son of southern Illinois farmers\nWe've just scratched the surface then what we can do not only an ethanol\nBut with that outstanding commodity that kernel of corn um it's it really seems like it's unlimited an in oak trip but a follow up to that would be this do we have seen over the last Eighteen to twenty months\nA renewed interest a renewed interest in investment and new products new technologies and the corn ethanol space that frankly we hadn't seen in a few years leading up to that so there there's a lot of excitement right now\nYeah you know um it back when when we\nWere going through the food versus deals debate debate John and I shouldn't say we win mainstream media was into it CNBC make contact with me and we'll wanted me to come on and talk about ethanol\nWe did the interview and I said you know I Love the ethanol because it might be the most efficient use of bushel of corn that we've got because we've got to the energy coming out of it and then we've got the feet component coming out of it well of course\nI didn't make it on CNBC because it didn't fit their rhetoric right but what are what are you discovering about the fish and sea of that colonel that that just surprises you every day\n[noise] couple of things one being twelve years ago when I was named the executive director of the center theoretical yields of ethanol from a bushel of corn would be in the two six range yeah we saw it go to the to seven range to the to a range\nIt's not that far of a stretch to hit three gallons a ... a bushel plus ... and all at the same time that you're doing that\nYou're producing a very high percentage of the industry is producing a very valuable corn oil that's being extracted off the back and you know this corn or if you're going to industrial uses such as by a diesel or it can find its way back into the feed industry very very good product particularly in\nAnd poetry and and swine diets and then the distillers grains is\nAs well I I think that far too often and going back to the food versus fuel thing there was this landscape\nThat was ... painted that you know X percent of the bushels of of course\nAnd there was this landscape\nThat was painted that you know X percent of the bushels of corn we're we're just disappearing or if it's the absolute for this thing from the from the truth out of that colonel the ethanol industry we only use a third of it we get the remainder of it and we turned it we were trying to write back over\nTo the feed industry I'm into other high value uses um ... ... the crazy thing is is it to this day you occasionally hear that flare up about\nYeah yeah yeah absolutely do there's no question about it not a lot of time here John but what do we expect from the national Cornell has no Research Center over the next Fifteen Years\nWell chip again lots of excitement and you know a couple of key things one thing is this farm bill spent yesterday with US Congressman Mike Boston and a secretary of of agriculture Sonny Perdue we've got to get this farm bill through there is some energy programs in there\nThat it's not only key to the ... Research Center but but they're cheated those that we serve so this industry can continue to grow the vibrant\nRenewable fuel standard my goodness we need to protect it like we've never never protected it before I we we have those things happen what's going to happen is the following as policy evolves\nIndustry will evolve technology will evolve and the national con death in our Research Center we will evolve as well just just as we have\nThese last Fifteen Years and we just look forward to continuing to play the role that we played um which today is commercialized over sixty five technologies these technologies are being utilized in every single corn ethanol plant in the United states\nI'm Mazie John I've learned a lot if they don't much I appreciate it so much for chip thank you for your time give us a call anytime we will that's John ... executive director national corn ethanol Research Center and\nCBS Sports radio week nights at six Saturdays it for Sunday's in one\nAnd we'd run Jane Raybould as a D.C lobbyist Jane was part of this one now she's looking for a one way ticket back to Washington to push for a complete government takeover of health care that would double the national debt and stand with the liberal extremism who support abortion on demand\nJane Raybould wrong for Nebraska\nWe need to senator who puts Nebraska first\nDeb Fischer in the U.S Senate\nDeb Fischer cutting taxes for Nebraska families she's fought against federal overreach to protect our farmers and ranchers\nAnd Deb Fischer works hard to take care of our veterans and that's why Republicans and Democrats are standing beside dengue Fisher in why she's been endorsed by the Nebraska Farm Bureau and the Nebraska Hospital Association\nDeb Fischer delivering result putting Nebraska for\nFisher I'm running for the U.S Senate approved this message paid for by Deb Fischer for us and and\nYou find yourself standing and you're living you wish for the new hardwood floor\nYou long for the feel of Syria new carpet and make it a reality\nHead to the gift for this fall of ... going on now outlined solution in addition to our lowest prices every year you can get an instant ... after five hundred dollars that's up to five hundred dollars off learning style shock including cancer nylon St Clair catch platinum and the lair carpet\nMark hey and for type prone vinyl plant south portfolio Thailand's down and repels water resistant landing so get the beautiful shot far you've always dreamed up for last during the gift for this law tales of that\nVery it's offering thin isn't flying solution for saving and insert ... five hundred dollars off your dream floor shots are flying solution western states reached you know in our Fox\nNews talk W.

working hard hard and harvest progress continues to rise yield information has shown strong positive yields in both our corn and soybeans and many are predicting or have reported above average fields\nIn the areas affected by hail the yields have been variable\nWith some average yields and some that had been significantly negatively affected\nOur cover crops in our pasture anchors continue

absolutely yeah the wife was ah was pretty insistent that I have that bag packed and be ready to roll just as soon as we get the phone call so\n[laughter] we're ready to rock that's good yup yup yup how you doing man\nDoing pretty well uh like to see a harvest continue to go a little bit at a faster pace but uh finally seeing something happened here\nYeah what are you hearing from your clients Matt uh I I mean\nYou know it it seems like\nThe some of the guys that had the beans ready to go before we got into that was a relay they opened up some fields they felt really good about what they were saying and now all I hear is dang I'm disappointed by that\nYeah I I think from a ... and I'm hearing a lot of the same and I you know I'm going to be probably pretty specific on\nClient base that I talked to in Iowa I'm western corner about but if I think in your area in your backyard right away a lot of field loss and beans I think a lot of disappointment in that and you go further last and I know they were battling NAFTA that terribly wet spring that\nYou know you drove through there this summer and you could just see this wasn't the crop there is just too many big holes and I think you know field averages including the drowned out spots are just you know we'll do a little bit of disappointment around a round the state for sure\nYeah it's hard to recover from those spots when you drive through a couple acres of drowned out spot in in a in a forty acre field it's surprising what that takes off the field but take that yield monitor a long time to recover and going through the zero spots or a ... go ahead\nI'm Sorry to say you you can look and you can tell what areas you know the real pretty easily that I'm pretty good estimate of that\nYeah yeah yeah no doubt\nSo are you guys are going to be doing it and how you feel that the stone are you doing another survey leading up to the November a crop production report\nWill have one last one on on the first to November So we'll we'll get our final estimates at that point and you know my general thoughts are\n... you know I don't I'm just kind of an aggregator of data on this one I don't have a whole lot of or inside information how sausages made but uh we've I'm going to guess we're going to see a little bit lower yields based on what I'm hearing what I'm seeing thing and that confirms just kind of a bias that I've had for a long time now so I\nThink it's still a probably a good crop just too many too many hurdles that early on in the her hand and too much dryness\nAnd in ... it's kind of the middle part of the growing season I just think we had too many you know the word to in there yeah\nYeah yeah yeah good point I I like how you put that they're so USDA back in uh\nThe October crop production report put the national average corn yells at one eighty point seven let's go ahead and take a bushel off of that get all the way to one Seventy nine point seven does it make that much of a difference for corn\nI I don't think so and I think that that wasn't that shift happens psychologically from the USDA in October report I think traders just largely started already leaning that direction that OK maybe this crop is going to get a little bit smaller so I think that's kind of factor and\nI also think that you know we've been a little bit underwhelming by demand I think by and large I think people are just thinking this carry out might get a little smaller but not a lot smaller than\nThe reality is on both crops the but even in the corn where you are seeing shrinking near on your carry out we still have too much supply on it really becomes more about what are we looking at as we head into the two thousand Nineteen balance sheet um because we still obviously have enough to get us through this year\nYeah speaking of demand here what is the deal with Vietnam South Korea unknown I think France was on the list of of cancellations this morning in the export sales report\nYeah there's a real bizarre exports sales report net look just completely dismal the new ones looked relatively strong but there were just huge cancellations so and you know just the net sales by themselves on beans will really on all commodities weren't great when we leads to pack in in October it's not\nReally an right [laughter]\nBut uh no I I don't know what to make the beans I just know that this is going to be one of those years where where we just know we're going to have an absolutely bizarre trade flow\nAnd probably some very unconventional buyers are gonna be showing up not probably we already have seen some that have really not been customers for years coming to the U. S. for for being so it's it's pretty unconventional\nAnd I don't really know that it changes drastically anytime soon but we are getting into kind of more intriguing part of the ... program in the next few weeks so I think\nProbably a couple of things going on obviously will get through our mid term election I think that could be a pretty big pivotal point\nOr secondly you've got to be thinking that based on current five offers out to Brazil landed in to China being values are about on par level with us at some point we've got to be talking about the fact of how much more supplied as Brazil have\nAll these things just make you say is there an opening for us beans into China while they wait out the next a Brazilian being harvest no those are those are some things that might come into play I'm pretty pessimistic though going forward unfortunately and it just seems like there's going to be a long marketing here on soybeans\nYeah it it really does and here we are we're sitting with the the school all the way out to the July contract today we're at eight Ninety three and three quarters lost the nine handle on it um\nI don't know I I did this\n... hour week into a market where it's going to try to maintain carry\nBut that ... month contract whatever the ... month\nIs is is going to be kind of tethered\nTo you know twenty cents either side eight fifty\n[laughter] um I I I agree with your first point I'm hoping that that's the other point I'm I'm not really looking\nAt a bean balance sheet you know what we're seeing out there is a futures market that's been probably pretty consolidating efforts\nDespite an overwhelmingly bearish you know long term outlook and the cash markets been doing a little bit of a work with keeping she basis in a lot of areas and in most of the bell but uh\nYou know I I think that there's room to down to the downside still your biggest caviar or risk on an upside moving beans is really just a fun deciding they don't want to maintain a short position maybe want to shift into along position\nBiggest caviar or risk on 'em upside moving beans is really just a fun deciding they don't want to maintain a short position and maybe want to shift into along position as we head into a South American growing season\nYeah and you've got to ask your question whether they would want to stay short right now no question about it hey let's get a harvest record we got dean up in Minnesota dean welcome back to the show how you doing\nKnowing a winding down here in some ways some guys are getting done some guy's got a little ways goal and Mother

guard and tell a story that average the hundred and fifty are going to be lucky and soybeans are probably going to be right around that forty five Bush from Arkansas and I said you're there and he was talking about the drowned out spot or we had good quarterly I go to court and by taking drowned out spot and don't take long to bringing down from one eighty down to one forty in a hurry\nYes no question about it and don't don't don't mad I think will agree with me do not downplay the important so that Minnesota crop right Matt\nNot at all in fact I think that that that area that he's talking about goes all the way and to kind of really down into central part of of Iowa you know it's not a small area that you're talking about there's four to six percent of the national corn crop in that area that super on even\nYeah why and\nYou know we went through last box you know yeah there are coroner by one drunk Twenty one thirty percent washer and some of that Corning immature you know I planted some on\nJune ... accent and when I quit combine and Gen days ago it was started by ... percent moisture and so I don't know what that's going to be like so you know is on that corner we did combine early in order to lie to hold water a majority you know so some of that weren't well the way it wasn't that great a little lighter a cast away so I mean\nBigger than the guys are going to start us grain that are really control and watch it one toy and better be running the bans what it's called or\nBoy you got that right we were down in Iowa State here a couple of weeks ago and and Dr Herbert down there started with the school temperatures and and low humidity if you've got corn into\nBeen that the fans said better be rented dean thanks for the call buddy we appreciate you will talk to you again real soon we're going to have more with Matt Campbell from science ... don't coming up here\nIn the next segment so we've got to talk more about this South American crop is really no big issue where is the support for the market's\nNo matter what you do you're always raising the bar trying to do better than ever knew Laurel fungicides for corn and soybeans and help you get the edge you're looking for\nAnd based on what I see price wise we're we're we're not showing the right or spreads\nSo you talked about the carry in the market the carrying the beam markets actually pretty attractive for no Nineteen beans and I would certainly consider you know if you're if you're if you're looking at that\nI'd probably be starting to mark a new crop means pretty you know relatively aggressively right now and I think that's that's not what anybody wants to hear but I think that's the reality of the situation of of of just extremely bearish fundamental outlook and domestic situation and and really the global side isn't any better so that's why I kinda think\nWe've got you got you know the Kerry is an earned and tell us all and I think we've got to make sure those marketing efforts are focused on that new crop market has as much as they are in the old ...\nYeah yeah hey Davis ... we we need to remember to to lose one of the contracts on are closing prices and okay or putting these Nineteen corn and no Nineteen beans and to adjust to you know mad if for no other reason\nTo put out there a reminder that a no Nineteen beans today closed at nine o seven and three quarters I mean it's not a great opportunity but what you're saying is the opportunity ... ... ... ... by the time we're moving those beans that could look like a great price\nVery easily very easily could look like a great price next year I'm given the kind of situation we've got our hands right now\nYeah three Ninety six and a quarter on the ... team corn you wanted to do anything go ahead and they were\nOpen to four bucks three quarters today this morning or dropped off you know five and a quarter throughout the day but still not too shabby maybe or is it too far to ... to be called not too shabby\n[laughter] it's not too shabby I mean look where nice Eighteen is today they look\nOr is it too far to ... to be called not too shabby\n[laughter] it's not too shabby I mean look at the word is Eighteen is today it looks not too shabby back to you\nKnow I I think that there are still some some you know gamesmanship and easy played between east corner no means am I certainly if you're in the low for is I'm I'm active I'm certainly starting making my my first sales and hoping my worst sales and I definitely think you know this is that year as I said\nYou shift five million acres into being I mean I'm Sorry ... corn out of beans you've probably got a pretty well satisfied balance sheet on both markets and to me that's that's kind of your upside risk so\nYou know you're going to low for is I think it's time to start to the D.C Nineteen marketing and certainly kind of a scale up approach till you get up for thirty area which has been kind of the high over the last few marketing seasons on D scorn\nYeah and the hope that it's the worst sale that you make all year I'm right what what\nStrategy deal like that man I mean it's it's hard to just go with a straight hatch but I don't think you want to be locking basis that far out do you\nI I'm I'm I'm extremely cautious on the basis this year on being so I think\nYou know for the mention the mentioned before you know given the fact that fall supplies next year with minimal acreage last you know you could be talking about a a worse situation next year then you have this year certainly we know we're going to be logging a lot more beans out of this marketing here in the next years marketing here so I I'm a little cautious on that\nUm I Know you're not going to get many takers on on fixing basis and along with futures now but at least to the future side you know at least think about that\nAnd if the basis is something you can live with I I just think this is still kind of a noun hoping you hit singles kind of a marketing year for for being unfortunately\nYeah yeah no doubt about it okay we don't have a lot of time left but I Do want to get your impression on what you think is going on down in South America\nWell you know I think there's a lot of things going on I think you've hit on at the top of the show and you've got some currency issues or ALS been very strong or last few weeks and it's actually brought down the prices of beans to the south American Girl or a little bit as they're taking the field to have an extremely active\nPlanning pays to well I had a schedule I think you've got that you've got the idea that means you know really aren't that bad price to the south American Girl or so that I used for for acreage expansion you've got ideas of credit concerns you've got the ideas of of the currency issues you know some things that might\nDetract from from acreage expansion but my my ... you know we've been talking about a three percent a year on year acreage gross in Brazil at this point I kinda feel like that's a starting point I think you could fit increase even more again you know this is my bias on being isn't real positives you can tell you\nRight now I just I think you're going to happen and you know significant year on year a change in the Brazilian\nAnd argued time production obviously Argentina's going to be rebounding from a from a massive drought a year ago Brazil likely to see acreage expansion I just have no at this point no reason to believe that South America doesn't have a monster crop relative to where they were last year to\nYeah you know\nSince you've been such a barrel full of good news positive thoughts today that I I'm really has to to ask you this but go ahead Matt Campbell put on the coaches at Texas Tech coming names what do you think\nHey we've we've I'm I'm optimistic chip and I and I think this has been one of those good seasons I'm thing we've got the right the mojo going and we'll win\nAll right well you know it is still I got to do it again it is still rocked Tobar and the teams looking pretty good [noise]\nOh boy [laughter]\nMad I always enjoy talking way to get the eggs brother will talk to you

... who was\nEver in the NBA and I'm being from Iowa New people from that program in Iowa State and having covered the big twelve for a long time was familiar with enough people to know that it wasn't

time off because just for any other reason to go for two which is ... and wind up and just kick\nThe ball and you know take a breath I I I I hear your version of the goal of a bind five to one to force you to be a little personal breaking news I'm actually really excited about this Carmelo Anthony\nRobustly and\nRoutinely here on the radio show\nHas confirmed for Monday on CBS Sports age Cuban interviewing\nA I'm Kerry I'm asked the guys that I Love to hear from you too at eight five five to one to four CBS it's an interesting balancing act when as it with a TV camera because\nThe way that I was trained as a reporter right I talked earlier about the honorable thing to do with your under contract and I think it is the honorable thing to play it out I was taught the honorable thing to do as a writer is if you ride a critical story about someone you show up but the balance of power is interesting right you write the column and you have your space a newspaper or on national website\nAnd you don't have the advantage there you get to write whatever you want and there's nothing they can we do about it but then if you show up like I Would do this is why like people will go off on gee merry audience some of the few writers who wouldn't show up when you show up you're on their turf man like you were on their turf and their clubhouse all that adrenaline all that machismo and I am you know\nI actually don't mind as much as other people I Am a weirdo I competition isn't great but it doesn't bother me\nIt bothers a lot of people and I've been screamed and yelled at\nAnd when I when I tried to do my transition to radio and television was to bring the same principles I'm going to criticize someone I'm never going to like a had them on the show and be like Hi Chris Paul how's it going to Iraq itself to be very honest Chris falls a bad example because that's basically I think you're a terrible person\nWhy are you ... I got an email is a good person I just don't think he's a very good basketball player first town which I'm going to say to my Monday\nBut what I learned is is not the same thing as being a writer because there is no I'm always on home turf cause I I have a camera right like the guys on camera and there is an unfairness there but I have to ask it so I Do and um and Tom an eight by five to one to four CBS if you have suggestions when I interviewed mellow I think my plan is\nI've already given a heads up through his PR people don't want to surprise him I don't wanna like hey this is the guy who said these things about you and I think I'm gonna say\nCarmelo this a lot and you've been a target of criticism including from me here's my criticism tell me why I'm wrong is that\nSeemed like a a fair way to sort of never get that\nTotally you're being up front with them that you were critical of him and you're not basically saying like you have to ask him you're just saying hey tell me why I'm wrong to me why other people in the sports media or even fans are wrong about\nThis be amazing it's like now you're ... so I don't care I make a whole bunch of money yeah\nLiving the dream have you seen who have said\nWell if in the thing about mellow as he is a\nNot everybody is mellowed a pro mellow and I have and interact with them a lot like repeatedly since the Jeremy Lin days but I mean I was pretty hard on him and the Jeremy Lin days and and you know I was thinking that at that stage but everybody was hard on him and he just shut up he was gracious answer the questions Tom what's your uh what's your take on a\nThe proper way to\nHonor that sort of code without being like gotcha I just confronted you on\nCamera I think that's it be up front I think the interesting thing is I don't know that he knows like he I I agree with you I think he sees himself as a professional I don't think he realizes the deficiencies in his entire approach to his career so when you say things like ... it's classic example of untapped potential an MBA history\nHe ... he can't even fathom using understand where you're coming from with that so that's why I think it's going to be a very interesting discussion\nI Hope I'm not going to be disrespectful I'm going to be honest I Hope he said I'll be challenging hope it gets fired up and he's like well you tell me why am and I will tell\nYou you never know I I did this LeBron he was awesome I deserve Dwight Howard you know it looks like he's a start crying I knew was James Harden\nMe just stare at me from behind his beard and didn't didn't care I told I actually did not do with Chris Ball because pollen but bonkers anyways isn't it's an interesting thing and a lot of these guys don't\nIt's ... and this is probably unfair and probably been a little self righteous but to me it does seem like there's a lot of either sick efficiency in interviews or gotcha like oh gosh I'm gonna make you mad at ...\nI haven't seen a lot of new ones conversations between people who very much don't agree with each other and I I'm I'm hoping that's where we can go on on Monday over on CBS Sports that you\nAnd ... apparently a joke Kelly and ... were both tripping their pictures at one point or another\nAnd that kind of figured out the answer to that and they've kind of remedy that so uh now they're coming out with a full confidence an arsenal and and it's got to be very tough I mean the Boston starting pitching can somewhat keep the Dodgers office down as they've done so far\nIt's very clear up the Dodgers the score on late in the game\nI that's not a problem that the red Sox have or have had so um if it comes down to a battle the bullpen and that was that there are several\nRan lives here on the show brand new one world series and if memory serves as a closer than ... saves\nIn that in that series can you give us a sense whether you're a starting pitcher your clothes are just what it feels like when you go out there and a key moment in a World Series how different is it does or doesn't feel from what happens over the course of a long regular season\nWell it it definitely feels different media drummer levels and a lot different and you know over the course of the regular season\nOr you don't have it and just going to the ballpark ... you know if you're about to pitch and it's the seventh inning say and you're a closer the adrenaline starts kicking in and and that's great but when you're the world series like you have a trial and the second you wake up and it just it kind of stays with you all day and it always just kind of amplifies\nMore and more and more is the day goes on and then you know ... you cannot sit down it's everything you could do to just try and calm yourself down before you go into the game so\nUm you know from a certain point I I think they feel that those of it right on a lot as well uh there are more used to pacing themselves but uh you know for a closer or both had guy\nAnd what's that phone rings and you're up and go and it's a I mean it's ... it's an incredible feeling and and I think ah you know it's everything you can do to try and just we use and and and ... try and figure out a way to relax 'cause the moment it's so exciting\nBrand names you're on the show Brad I'm In that game by you guys want against against the raise in correct me if I'm wrong I think you guys had a four three lead and you had to come in an enclosed that thing down\nHere are mental approach so you took to to get the adrenaline under control to make sure not overthrow into ... did you do you embrace what give us a sense of just want that like when literally the world series is in your hands\n[noise] well yeah I mean you know you got to go out there and you want to convince yourself or easier said than done that you're just it's just another outing to continue to do the same things you've done in the entire year on your mind wants to get ahead of that your mind wants to you know\nVisual lives what it's going to be like to get that last out but you can't let it happen or you can't let yourself get ahead of of each pick and so that's the toughest thing you're kind of fighting is is staying within each pitch in and it all the abortion the adrenalin that come with a you know knowing that it could be the last out of the world series so\nUnfortunately I was able to do that I mean I wasn't always able to do that I had some uh you know some good games with the Astros and not so good games with the aftermath of the play offs but\nI was able to get back to the to the playoffs obviously with the Phillies is that it it's\nA state law or under control it focused in those games that\nI think experience is huge and and I would I Would kinda parlayed that into saying that uh you know one thing for me that I've seen David Price to be able to do now\nIs take a lot of deep breaths and get a higher level of focus and concentrate the folks that I've ever seen or have and I think it's been able to kind of save him quite a bit but you know ... it's unfortunately for him he had a lot of like you know I feel great experiences but I think it's been able to use those now\nTo his advantage when they'll let he needs to do to be able to get out there you saw a picture for the red Sox out\nHe's had two great outings in a row and if that's going to be the case is going to be really tough for the Dodgers they can beat the red Sox\nIt's really interesting because that that strikes such a familiar core talking to ... you're on the show right on the news media writer a couple of years ago I read I was talking to the Dodgers official about what the deal was with\nClinton curse All right to maybe some in can sit now maybe some inconsistencies in the postseason in a moment in his answer to me was he's like why should I don't have an eye for me said watch Clinton rushes in the postseason away they never did in the regular season\nHe's rushing you not taking the time is getting behind the county started to overthrow ... I mean the numbers speak for itself the claim 'cause I was not perform in the postseason the way that we've\nCome to spend time and time on the regular season do you see something similar when you look at what what goes on with Persian when things go wrong are you able to to put a finger on what's going on there\n[noise] [noise] well I listen to I think there's there's a couple of things that that kind of go into it I think what he was doing a little bit harder he was out of it is it a crime in terms of\nA large city and he was facing the St Louis cardinals I I still go to this day after talking to some of the cardinals in a kind of understanding more about it that he was taping his pictures that they'd had his pitches and those series and I think that kind of got him off to a real fast heart in the postseason\nUm and it was very hard for him to overcome that for a while because once you get off that bad start then that becomes a narrative that you're not a good postseason pitcher and so he had to really on a kind of very talented and right the ship so to speak it figure out experience just how to slow the game down\nHe was able to do that and you know he I think he you know it just it probably is is one last record career on the post season is right around five hundred if you've got a real fast start so more often than not over the last couple of years he turned and good performance is but uh\nOne last record career on the post season is right around five hundred if you've got optical real fat starts so more often than not have last couple of years he turned in good performance is but\nUm he did have a tendency to Rashid slowed it down now that all of a sudden now he's learned how to you know slow it down but now his stuff isn't quite as good so it's a little bit tougher for him he's got to be a master pitcher out there in the postseason where you're facing these lineups\nNow nobody JAG Norfolk, Nebraska leaves the year until seven o'clock tomorrow morning within twenty five miles north of Nebraska programming continues on translator cage you know you're Eighteen and one of five point nine ...\nAlmost impossible to navigate through that line up so um\nHe's kind of a tricky spot right now if he was facing a lesser opponents are heading back to LA I Would say he'll be fine and I still think you'll have a good outing game five I in fact I think I'll probably have like a six setting rewrite quality start type outing but you just can't keep the red Sox lineup down forever no matter how comfortable you feel no matter how focused yard\n... you brought up the ... was a couple of times now claim control which I mean it really interested in and with kimbrell ... whose whose responsibility is that I can you give us a sense of how you go about guarding against that and and along with the pitcher who's supposed to be making sure that that is recognized in real time\n[noise] so it's really tough and I remember there was a time or two of my career where where I ... and um you know we kind of found out later that and I remember people asking like isn't that the pitch the coach's job to to see if you're dipping your pitch in\nAnd I would say it's not their primary job I mean certainly it would be nice if the pitching coach could tell that based on how the hitters were swinging but a lot of times it's\nYou know the pitching coach is so focused on mechanics an approach\nThat that element kind of gets thrown out a little bit from time to time\nWell you know ... it for me when I figured it out it was actually brought office in Houston\nI'm watching video of the game and and and lo and behold he was watching a video about outing we thought if you could all well he couldn't understand what the hitters we're looking for and he saw\nA video showing the game to kind of show guys some of the the hitter is at the other dug out a set of mimicking what I Would do it by glove on certain pictures of what I wanted to hit him and he's like oh my gosh that's going on\nSo you know in the case of Chris Kimball Eric ... was watching the games and and even though he's a former Dodger he's also former Red Sox friends without scorer\nAnd he called up and he said hey I got a he's like I I can clearly see a sip it gets pitches on let me give you the ... and and as soon as chemical got that he had his last outing against the Astros and and he was totally different tied he's been a different guy said in these first two games but\nYou can tell like when he lashed out against the Astros he went up there and it gets all of us\nWho are aggressive hitter took three fast balls right down the middle of from general\nSat back down to the best ever got the bat off his eye off your shoulder and kind of scratch his head at that point you know it was it was pretty obvious to me that he was taping his pitches if he corrected it I'm ... and that puts the other team at a loss if that's what they were depending on the the one\nThat is really interesting bred lineage former and there'll be pitcher World Series champion and there'll be network radio host here on the show and brand we we've seen a lot of storylines about teams trying to to get to to to creative measures to get this kind of information including cellphones pointed at dug out not just as your Boston didn't last year against the Yankees\nFor for you guys play the game is walking us through this one is the line of work within the code of of doing the right way and baseball in terms of trying to get these ... just trying to steal
