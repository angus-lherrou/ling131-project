tip\nDon't be boring I got a ton of tweets but it's just people read tweeting what I tweeted earlier in the day and or liking my tweets not not going to get the job done you actually have to share a thought a point you got to actually give me something\nSearching your tweets ... daddy Tweedle Dee here's Judy ...\nGetting on the air on CBS forge right now that is one of the two age get through San off between a Jody Mac manned Jay oh do you I Am ACME and you could be\nThe Mack daddy tweeted today are you going to have me up on the telephone lines a vibe to one to four to seven black guy from Staten Island as Ari you're on CBS Sports radio\nHey how are you know but\nI tell you what a what a pleasure to sit there and enjoy your game like today especially the way they got started it looked like I said oh no here we go again but I gave them a lot of credit and you know why\nThere's a million ... we could talk about you know washing the bottom line is here they try a solid football game or three faces and what else to penalty if they shoot themselves in a heart\nAnd why it took him for a dollar or a little and then\nThe tea to me was you touched on it\nThey plates march because they hadn't played smart the last several weeks they didn't play discipline the last several weeks they play disciplined day\nUh you're right no penalties when they least needed penalties like they had several weeks earlier a day right well but polls for ... for a while without holding\nA yeah it was a pretty impressive effort because I still think even though the jets moved the ball up and down the field against him today I still think Denver defense is pretty good I think it was more execution and well played by the ... the fans are allowing them to do the things they did\nThat that's true but you know it all in all I mean you got to give the outlines of credit how they have all this I mean that the parents to predict legitimate I don't know whether there's rubble after first Syria to also\nI think they were going to hurt your game is where\nWe're going to act with your position today at least the bronco and back and you know we you know getting issue is is you know I think that was part of it and I'm just curious all your gear Vance Joseph I Know they were down Seventeen points\nBut Stuart score game and you're gonna have to pick up your goal at some point if you're tired up I Can't believe on Fort down and decided to go for that effort I Would like twelve years ago\nThere was a ... a nerve recall and it's one of those if you are converted then you're gutsy guy if you don't you're a dope\nGuess what they didn't so he's going to have to wear the gold coins in Denver this week I Would have thought this was the better part of our ah it again both teams moved to the Broncos the mood to football against the jets they just came up short a couple of times\nA couple of days they were the team that made a a foolish mistakes today and\nI guess he had faith in his op ed piece that they were going to be able to get the ball back\nAnd uh be able to ... when they got it but the jet spend the night job once they got it back of taking time off the clock\nHere we're in a secondary role play better and I think a lot of the Denver's I think a lot of the yard and\nIt was you know late third quarter fourth quarter when you're a jet already at that point they were you know they were given up yard and they were your clock right down because it became a numbers game\nSo I'm not going to get too crazy with that but overall I tell you the truth of course Detroit I just think of all for going every which way I think if you buy a better overall game today against her Broncos and getting it against the lions\nMm at first game was pretty darn good um you can make that argument certainly ... well I had that big game that was the best they ran a ball and that was what was disappointing even more so more than anything else\nI gather at two main John to burn last week and there are there corners didn't look like they were as good as they were supposed to be and that was certainly a worthy of critique and and worry\nBut watching them play in pre season and that first week against Detroit the I've been to blind to the really I ... and ...\nAnd the running game just disappeared for three weeks the lines of blind when completely ah off the deep end or and they also were getting darnel or Donald I thought was a little nervous in a park and was always looking to make plays with his legs and get it out but that was again all pre season I didn't pass blocking was great\nThe run backing run run boxing was back today ...\nHe plays with his legs and get it out but that was again all pre season I didn't think past blocking was great the run backing will run run boxing was back to that car well I had a couple of unbelievable to go through\nPowell is well now calls cut to speed to turn it into a big play like then on to Seventy seven yards or a but the halls with ... a blind with superior today\nThere really were and you know why I don't know where your leaders to but I tell you they can get the cooking next week and just polish even Korea trade with the Viking colonel out after that right now it's structured away we started\nRight when you're sitting in a one in three and didn't know if they were going to be able to win a game and the next month or so or when you get a win like that not only win win against a team was playing pretty well the Broncos were a shoot if they had beaten Kansas City the other night\nThat's what scared me most about coming into this game was the fact that I thought Denver might be a little bit on edge because they let that one slip where they had the lead against Kansas City\n\n\n[noise]\nYou ... and early use of the children that\nWill do you use and then grow up with you in a full yesterday here in New England\nMen I grew up watching your body so now I'm rooting for you on the sidelines thank you much Robin with us here's Judy ...\nNegative together you're on CBS for eight hours I on foot ball him never singing the national football league now I take your unanswerable fall league call or your baseball calls\nWherever you want to mix it up into the college football new ... around and the like I can give you a a piece of information\nThe Braves scored a run because I just see that with my own eyes\nI saw ... and early ... asked them to come in here and throw on the baseball game for me\nOr the Braves has not scored in the first two games of their an LBS against the Los Angeles Dodgers they've already put one on the board of the early\nUh I I didn't think they were going to get shut out tonight but man how embarrassing without a bit after I got shut out three consecutive games are no such luck abrasive already scored grab the early one nothing lead against Dutch\nSo I'll take your baseball calls brouhaha sweep a first seven games played into divisional series ... all one by the home team last night Yankees got the first road when beating up on the red Sox and David Price man that guy's got postseason issues\nHe just can't get the job done in a post nine ... for nine oh for ten ... oh I think he's over nine now for a record and ten po cheeses starchy\nNever won one at one no decision mixed in there he's actually had a couple of decent relief appearances and oh by the way they cheer the Yankees smack them around\nSince she's actually joined the red Sox Yankees have been smacking them around\nA so kudos to the Yankees they got that when he would want one coming back to the Bronx but the home team says a been a superior\nUh up until last night and then today the brewers went on the road and got the necessary when number three to make that when a clean sweep by shutting out the Rockies the Rockies got two runs\nIn three games first game when ten inning for members so you got it a little extra money so they scored tool runs in twenty eight innings\nThat was supposed to be in a ... a bled team when you've got our NATO and story in the like ... you're supposed to be a team was going to put up Charlie Black when a bunch of runs two runs twenty eight innings\nSo baseball fans we're not you want to get on the telephone lines do it do it now I'll keep a wide open eight five five to one to four to seven that CBS portrayal don't rely on which is

CBS portray\nHey I just wanted to touch on how poorly the NFL kick hers are performing these days at a time when quarterback plays at an all time high and basically a three hundred yards games expected everyone's throw him for four hundred yards pickers can't even make extra points these days [noise]\nCourse Crosby was the poster boy this week but I mean you've got goals you got damn Bailey got the people in Cleveland it's just that you think that's what the NFL wanted\nWhen they do have a guy like that and the guy in Cleveland made the big take today to win it for the brands\nEventually but he missed a couple along the way I just I see the team's going for two and going forward on Fort down it's like no one has faith in the kicker and rightfully so\nThat's why they moved it back to make it child they leave the after point they moved to point back to make a challenging a couple of years ago and\nYou write extra points are no longer the given that they used to be because they judge that to be boring though they are I you know guaranteed Ninety nine point nine presided diet scored a touchdown you're going to go out and take the extra point\nI didn't think it was such a bad thing because yes now you get that much more annoyed\nWhat do you want to do keep it from being boring or make it more frustrating because if you lose the game and and I I'm sure the rams fans felt that today\nWhen they thought they were going to tie up thirty one thirty one and Cairo Santos missed an extra point now we ended up making a film about winning the game warm but I guarantee you there were some ram ... with little ... than their stomach\nThat they're undefeated season was going by the boards because of a missed P. A. T.\nSure I just never thought have seen kicking this bad I don't recall seasons in the past where it was this unpredictable it is definitely interesting\nIt is but as that guy also talked about John and I appreciate your call\nSixty three Autor at the gun today in Carolina\nWhen you get your sixty three yard field\nGoal Jews are you guys got to be Denver my hire\nThat's where the guys would take sixty some odd charters are\nAll ... hang a no this was in Carolina\nAnd I watched a lot of the giant came today I'd heard no mention of the air being been there\nIt was just a great kick and be even though it was from sixty three I'm telling you\nI think it's good from Seventy three\n... you get the\nOnes that just scrape over the cross bar that you know made it by a yard\nThis was like halfway up the post and well into the next\nFrom sixty three yards out\nSo yes some real go kick 'cause they're kicking it seems like the shorter picks are harder to make these days but longer kicked so easy to make which it doesn't make sense right but those are the facts jak so\nIt depends on the field go pick up that you have in the way your team is trying to win games\nJoy from LA up on CBS Sports radio ally of George\nJody Mack how you doing rather good you\nGood good good man I I Can't wait to get regular lime back\nFilters airline Jody ... he's a very good kicker but he's also catch that ball gait\nWere having issues that they are kick officers that all those guys I mean that's the ... we just talked about it but you know some also take the wind buddy because there's ... show some resiliency and childlike they how about the colonies to go on that for us\nAt ... ... ... is nuts\nI I yeah I don't have a ... and like a couple of the coaches and the national football league the last couple of weeks\nTeams have taken some chance up or down Frank Frank last night I last week I thought it was crazy to go for it I Know that if he punched then there's a very good chance again going to end in a tie and a tie as bad as boring as it comes but it's better than a loss\nThere's no way yeah testified that and your mind\nWell yeah but I think they I mean to come to Seattle I was just up the game I just I'm trying to get back to the airport and I'll never see your fans or something else but anyway the fact that it was a ... game we got to tighten up our our Rushdie fence big time\nUm and Peters markets Peter she got burnt to touch down so I mean I don't know what he's doing after\nThat the I think he's playing hurt today I think it would keep to leave about that he decided he was going to go even though he was dead anywhere near a hundred percent so first thing you gotta give them healthy\nAnd you got to play a little bit better but you're right about the ... I Know they got knocked around in the secondary a little bit but uh you got those two big behemoth right there in the middle of the run game and teams are run into football against them that shouldn't be happened to that ramps defense\nNo I I agree but when they count at the very end they did shut them down and get to sock so they did what they had to do in a ... million probably to see the whole game but there was three sex that were taken by the ... so you know what I mean just it's just part of football\nYou got to George a safe to the airport the rams get two five\nInto a not only are they atop the division a there's ...\nThere's only a chance for one of the foreign one team in the NFC or this week and that would be the saints playing on Monday nights because the Panthers at three in one already had thereby\nBears at three in one or on nearby as we speak\nSo nobody else is going to be bumping up against Rahm Seattle's already formed a two and three ah the Arizona Cardinals a one in four and that division they're going nowhere San Francisco's one in four and that division they're going nowhere the rams are gonna cruising the division I Know that are they going to be able to cruise overall in the conference\nIt's too early to say I'm not going to say that they can a Green Bay only being two two and one helps Minnesota only being two two and one helps because these teams that were considered main challengers to the rams I you know I thought the rams with a team to beat in the NFC and I picked him to go to the super bowl\nI'm the eagles being two and three help\nTeams that you would have thought would have been top contenders ah versus the rams in other division would have been Philly in the east they've only got two wins\nThree one one eight hundred three seven four oh three one one eight hundred three seven four oh three one one\nIf you have hard water the lines scale not only leads white spots of plugs pipes and breakdown appliances costing you hundreds of dollars in energy and wear\nEliminate lines scaling other water issues like brown standing bad odors and lead with hydro care water products available from wave homes illusions waves affordable systems don't use salt or chemicals you'll love the way your water taste smells and looks satisfaction guaranteed\nFor more information go to good Clearwater dot com that's good Clearwater dot com [noise]\nCBS Sports radio we saw in northeast Nebraska on AM seven eighty five point nine FM news talk W JAG north of\n\nA tragic ride to a celebration I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News twenty people killed yesterday in a crash involving a limo in upstate New York authorities saying the limo blew past a stop sign\nAll Eighteen people inside a two thousand one Ford Excursion limousine had died they were all reportedly on their way to a birthday party the crash happening at about one fifty five pm Saturday at the intersection of route thirty en route thirty eight and sky Harry New York the New York state police say the limousine\nDrove down the hill on route thirty through the intersection into the parking lot of the apple barrel country store the limo struck a two thousand Fifteen till you're the Highlander in a lot and hit to pedestrians killing that\nFox's Brian is federal investigators are on scene\nThis is the most deadly transportation accident in this country since February of two thousand and not Robert\nSumwalt with the NTSB with the mid term elections a month away both sides feeling energized after the confirmation of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nDemocrats are trying to capitalize on the anti Kevin protests by promising to launch further investigations into the allegations against them\nAnd potentially even in teaching if they are able to retake the house on Fox News Sunday Senator Lindsey Graham said that strategy could actually backfired end up helping Republicans and a lot of swing district for the Democrats are targeting the hope everybody running for the house and these purple districts\n... will be asked a question do sport in teaching judge Kavanaugh holding on to the house will still be a challenge for the geo people in the Senate confirmation finding votes could actually help them pick up another seat or to\nFox is ... in Washington next stop the N.

[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n... me to tears too early\nMac Sunday gets together here on CBS Sports radio some wild action today games coming down to the wire all day long maybe even some surprise results I was surprised by the result in Philadelphia\nI thought the eagles after a ... less than stellar performance last week against tendency would have a bounce back record a effort at home where they've been very good in the last couple of years against Minnesota Vikings a desperate team coming in but I thought the eagles were desperate to\nI don't know when a soda one because they were more desperate let me hear from a guy who I Know knows what the eagles are up to these days because he owns the eagles game show on their radio network their flagship station WIP down in Philly climatic now joins us here on CBS Sports radio\nGene Mack what happened to the birds today\n[laughter] you know Jodi one of the hallmark of this thing last year was they didn't play stupid they played smart they didn't kill themselves they didn't turn the ball over they were fishing\nAnd the red zone they did not get dumb penalties and through six games this year excuse me five games this year the eagles\nAre doing all those things and today it happened from the beginning of the game to the end of the game they shot themselves in the foot so many times they got no toes\nAnd it's relatively the same roster they had a couple of change a couple of free agent slapped in the like but they didn't make any massive change there's no massive changes the coaching staff rank right gas took job in Indianapolis um but don't produce instilled a man calling the plays\nWhere whereas the drop off in\nFocus or attention or whatever come that they're making these are easily definable mistakes\nYou know they I've heard many many times the teams that get Super Bowl hangovers I'd never been around that team that's experienced it because the eagles have never won one I have nothing to judge\nAnd you use the old guy and I used to get there all the time but didn't actually when it\nRight so I don't know from Superbowl hanging over my old in the Buffalo Bills as you know well we get there and never went it so\nI'm watching it up close this year and I want to say and they all say no no we are just as hungry as we used to work just as focused as we used to be but I mean I'll start with the all kinds of line which was arguably the best one in the league last year\nThey get dumb motion penalties um they you know they're getting older and some guys are hurt but they just play foolish they missed assignments they myth block they they may well they run the wrong way\nIt's really something to say and they did it all day long enough ... to ... year last year the wide receiver\nHe had all dark ending illegal formation penalty today how does that happen\nThat's just like the concentration you're right and I think it's almost humorous I Know ego fans are laughing but from a perspective that you and I could add as guys who host talk shows in Philadelphia\nAll anybody talked about all the off season was can cause and come back we'll costs and be able to play what's cars in South by as harsh as Carson risking the future by coming back when he comes back we said\nNo one ever talked about you know we might not play as well as we did last year that we may have over the last year we may set the bar a little bit higher than we're actually capable of building up cars in wind just looked great any money where his life\nYeah yeah he's the least and they're worried I mean he's he's had some turnovers and you hold the ball too long but if\nIf they had forty seven guys playing like Carson lands that have won every game um yeah I mean than I think that what they saw last year as what they're going to get I I don't know that there's a lot of guys who had career years last year I'm trying to think through the roster\nBut boy they are just they're telling themselves this year and and I'll tell you with another place it's just really awful\nIs their quarterback play and I'm I was thoroughly Ron going into the air or that Ronald Darby I'm being healthy this you're gonna miss half the year last year was going to be really good they got they got from buffalo last year um and they are Sidney Jones\nWho is the second round pick last year would have been a ... Kelly is coming back healthy I thought he'd be good General Mills and expect great but one more year I thought he'd be fine all three of those guys are having a horrible years the can't cover that can tackle\nUm and ... and certainly in the case of Jay Leno he goes for a stop and go fake every single game and today hailing Adam failing burn them for sixty one yard or on the same mo that he gets beat on every single week\nAnd genuine Memphis is one of those guys who might have had a career year because he didn't get burned as often last year I had he has got burned in the first five games this season I\nThese guys who might have had a career year because he didn't get burned as often last year I had a he has gotten burned in the first five games this season\nI how do they handle is going forward did they have them to rally the troops\nYeah I think so I you know the good news for them is the NFC isn't great um the giants lost today and heartbreak or sixty street or feel role at the end um the cowboys I don't think their world leaders and while we'll see what Washington is they may be the best of the other three teams\nAre legal shouldn't say this and shouldn't think that but I Will I think if they finished nine and seven\nAnd they have they've played no games within the division you write so they have all six games within the division of\nIf if they do well in the division and when nine or ten games to win that division put him in the playoffs and you see how they finish you and I've been around long enough that we see teams that look great in September October and then they're nowhere in December and vice versa\nSo at two in three they're far from out of it they play the giants this Thursday the early weak and the mental and if you win that your three and three and you still have five games left and the vision that tell you rally the troops you you you know\nThat you're good enough to win a weekend if see\nBut you and I agree with what you said do you agree with me that the reason the eagles the super bowl champions is because they ended up with the best record in a conference last year\nHad to buy and then to home games I Know everybody wants to win the super bowl the year after you win the super bowl you want to go back to back and that was probably very optimistic wide\nEagles fans aren't going to be happy with making the playoffs and getting bounce in the first round they're gonna want them to go in and be competitive and the like and that's not happening at nine and seven you're going to be playing in that first weekend\nNo we've seen a lot of cars when the playoffs but it doesn't happen very often in yeah I agree with you the last year having that by having at home field advantage ... Minnesota Atlantic here in Minnesota here it was a great advance them sure it was simply the Minnesota game um yeah the fans would not be happy with that but\nJoni this is why no team is won the super bowl two years in a row since the patriots beat the eagles and two thousand for it's a really hard thing to do\nIt is I'm ... I don't know if you go to any of the post the game stuff ... Peterson ... says to the last couple of weeks similar like other than a shot themselves into ... which I think you actually ... the accurately stated earlier he have any ...\n... head coach speak you know he said well coaches say concentration and we have to we have to go back and focus and look at it and go back do will do what we do well\nHe's been really um and I was probably smart move he\nFox News on Debbie hand like Florida governor Rick Scott warned that a tropical storm call Michael and headed for the Florida Panhandle could become a category ... hurricane when it makes landfall in the middle of the week preparations underway\nWe also have a team from FEMA here to march provide federal assistance that includes experts from homeland security BPA department defense health and Human Services and the Army Corps\nMichael could become a hurricane by Monday Night gas prices are higher\nRight now the highest in this panel of cities is Los Angeles three eighty two for regular and the low is Houston took it to eight\nJovi lumber says prices rose over the past two weeks by seven cents the manager of a store and go Harry in upstate New York where a liberal crash killed twenty\nSays it sets a dangerous intersection played by accident [noise] this is Fox News [noise]\nNo huge age sky watching whether the whether our weather center\nScattered thunderstorms likely tonight otherwise overcast guys lows around forty three wins out at the north east five to ten miles an hour\nIsolated thunderstorms again tomorrow eyes level off route fifty five cloudy skies year old just airtight for news talk W.

Ken Carmen C A R I may and usually\nThey're the same thing\nOur lives quest in America is money\nMoney for goods money for services money for convenience\nThe acquisition of sayings acquisition of wealth\nSo that we have peace of mind for our future\nSo that we can live a more comfortable life\nSo we can sleep at night knowing we will be safe even though none of us are truly safe that we can sleep at night knowing we are as close to safe as we possibly can be\nAnd they know that tomorrow will be safe and the day after that and the day after that that we will be safer children will be safer with more money that our children's children will be safer with more money and with a more acquisition of more money and the more acquisition of more things when it comes to\nPossibly our children's children's children for generations\nIs a capitalistic system that's the way we do our business\nGood bad ugly whatever it might be that is the end all be all that is the rat race\nEvery morning we wake up\nWhere every night we go to work\nWe get in our trucks\nAnd our tens we commute\nTrying to get ahead\nAnd for most of us we put in the work now so we can get ahead years later\nThe very beginning of our lives we workers as tirelessly as we possibly can as hard as we possibly can to put ourselves in a better position this is the capitalistic system\nWinner take all getting what you deserve trying to get what you deserve cutting people off doing exactly what you can we do this because we want to acquire money\nThe symbol of thing\nOnce you're dead you can't take it with you\nWe hear that all the time\nBut we like that for a peace of mind\nBut there is a harsh truth to money\nAnd that harsh truth money\nIs that it's not about money at all\nIt's not about the acquisition of things are just the acquisition of things it's not just about a new car new house or or better closer better food it's not just about those thing\nMoney equals to us power\nSometimes these things don't go hand in hand that's very true\nBut most of the time Ninety nine percent of the time they do in a most walks of life\nThat's the way life works\nMoney and power at the same thing\nAnd then a week five\nWe're seeing money and power\nWith what our favorite sports are\nBecause with money with what's given great comes great power\nAnd I ask you look no further than New York giants\nBecause today or I should say this weekend\nA power play has been made\nA power play within the New York giants to change the system to change the way they look towards the future and I changed that they might possibly need to make\nI might think it's disrespectful but it could very well be the truth and it could be very well too little too late\nTo go back and junior sending a\nInterview with just seen Anderson that he wasn't sure if it was necessarily the fault of Eli Manning while the office was running\nPerhaps a little bit too long in the tooth maybe it was he lies phone I saw everybody in New York commenting on that today\nWas one thing I thought of though while the giants were falling today\nWell they kept the close with the Panthers they still couldn't get over the hump what became a great rivalry for just a couple of games went right back to the dumpster\nAnd watching these two teams this afternoon seeing Cam Newton and grand you know get over it to go out to a three and one record to three you know at home which has become a tough place for other people to play\nAnd this is the giants photo one and four\nAnd left them searching for answers\n... searching for answers it left people questioning catcher in the post game and this is what the giants head coach had to say about ... back in but remember this isn't necessarily about Ilan\nThis is about power hit\nSo I'm going to after all the drama questions right now and I'm gonna go back to what I said All right I address it without a doubt I addressed it with our team I publicly declared that I didn't agree with his comments\nAnd I asked anybody that was interested if they wanted clarification go to a hotel because he's a big man now I'm not going to give the public a pound of flesh on this right that would make me small not strong and these are the kind\nTo answer right now I'm months into the season who's dead but really truly who's actually good\nYou can name two teams and the rest is a toss up in the air\nAnd that's become more frustrating for teams as the weeks have gone on we're just getting to October power plays ugliness drama it's exactly what we have her as the NFL

Fifteen minutes you could say fifty percent or more\nOn car insurance week five of the NFL season we will come in they Davis USA Today NFL rider to get you all set for everything that's going to happen through the rest of this week\nGot a lot of guys already on the hot seat and some teams that we thought were going to be good and they just ended up being a bunch of fraud snake Dave is with us on the show find him on Twitter at by Nate Davis Nate thanks for joining us\nGet my pleasure like Nate a first off I I'm just looking at a couple of these teams Atlanta had one of the most horrific losses I think you could find to a team that has talent you seem to be just sound as they do it a lot of ways and then there's been injuries and such but I keep getting the whole\nWell you know college Shanahan isn't there\nAnd I just think that's garbage Nate I I don't think that that's a ... a political excuse whatsoever when they were a postseason team last year and if you're going to allow ... it'd be that powerful he's a good coach then I have to call into question Dan Quinn obviously ark and obviously that Ryan\nWell you know I I I thought that that a ... for the problem last year or an ... I think he was kind of the problem we lost the eagles and the opener but I mean the last couple of weeks and you can weigh any of the\nIssues with your friends to see it I mean I think I met ... ... he's having historic output right now for a guy that can't win a game um ... the issue here the parents I mean there's just too many injuries over there you know you don't have ... you don't have the un Jones um you know the whole the whole team played poorly\nA today but I mean you know they they've been losing these he's thirty seven thirty six where he could be thirty seven games lately um you know ... to me that that's all just a a depth issue in the ... the first to a level\nYou know work or stopping those bleed so um you know the falcons they're never over overcome wanna forget the playoffs or cook two or three a couple of times but I think I think it's about ...\nNe Davis joining us on the show so you gone five weeks through the season or their teams that are better than what you thought they would be who's actually a good football team or do we still not really no over a month into this thing\nI mean I think some some we now I mean we're kind of getting to that point you know we're so far so like to say you are you are what your record\nUs says you are I think I think when you're still want to pick out some frauds are worse than teams that could come back you know I I I didn't believe in Miami and I think you know they're they're starting to show his that thrill start a ... with a little bit\nHyperbolic and four holes there um you know took the chargers are probably starting to kind of given point now and you know they're going to last a pattern ... so I think they can be forgiven that and there are certain ... looked like a team I fought to challenge to maybe get to the Superbowl\nUm otherwise shouldn't eagles were concerned about them or you know the only one team started two or three off Superbowl\nGotten back to the playoffs so you have to start to to worry about what they are and I'll be curious to see what the bears are uh when they come off by you know the three one starts been very nice\nUh certainly they look dominant against the bucks but uh again aside from that week one game and gets Green Bay were were they caught the lead haven't played a whole lot of good teams so that's another team I think ... put an asterisk next to the first place status right now\n... Davis joining us on the show USA Today NFL right or find him on Twitter at by nay Davis how badly the Mitchell Trybulski need that outing last week in Tampa Bay\nI mean it it's a good step forward for him you know I don't know how how badly it uh it it probably should be for Chicago I think but\nYeah to me this entire my vehicle rex Ryan jets were where I think they've got kind of everything around him they need 'em and if he's Okay Mark Sanchez was back then\nI think this team can go pretty long way but if he can play like he did against box\nOr you know there there are certainly a legit but\nYou know I certainly by him that I think ... ... ... I'm not short list right now for for a MVP contenders mistake and that was a good defense or to to an elite level I'm thinking about running in going a little bit of a slow start to Jordan Howard I mean this this really could be a team that that uh you know\nBrush and if you have to have to deal with and then and maybe one given the way the rest of the vision looks right now a could could maybe come away as she chats specific keeps up\nYour ovaries should break that that a yard edge record coming up tomorrow night against the Redskins where would you put him on among the all time greats\nYeah that's a great question are we trying to ask about that this week and I kinda I kinda feel like we all take for granted a little bit you know like you said have to order one yard tomorrow night to pass both Peyton Manning and Brett Farr uh\nProbably do it for half time but you know we have to I think for years uh I feel like I have another people caught kind of just fall into the trap recover expect him to throw for\nYou know five thousand yards and thirty touchdowns and\nComplete Seventy percent of his passes and you know it certainly helps when you get the same head coach for the last dozen years and uh and that kind of thing but to me he really is one of the more under under raised undervalued guys are an NFL history to some degree and we'll talk about them enough I think the same ... with Tom Brady and Peyton Manning\nI'm ... and even you know among his peers Tom Brady Aaron Rodgers ... stealing a lot of the the pub right now I'm you're I think I think when we look back you know hopefully will will appreciate breeze or maybe a little bit more than we are in a moment because it's just it's it's unbelievable what are you going to be able to do for the last twelve years in New Orleans\nDavis with us on the show I read somewhere Peyton Manning got an MVP hit a Ninety four quarterback reading and now that wasn't what touched the top five altogether or how do we judge quarterbacks now especially with rule changes and we're seeing more prolific numbers and we have in the last Twenty years\nI don't we judge quarterbacks now especially with rule changes and we're seeing more prolific numbers and we have in the last Twenty years\nYeah I think the average quarterback writing this year right now it's like Ninety two or something you know like like you said that used to be used to be a number of the ... would be a legally kind of thing and\nI you know I think I I think five quarterbacks right now I have a career can be reading over a hundred or but there are certain quarterbacks is your habits so\nUm it it's definitely changing the metrics and and just you know all these were passion game that spread offices the things we're seeing these days uh you know the numbers definitely um you know don't don't wind up from what we've seen\nA in the past in terms of of of breeding quarterbacks but ah yeah I mean I I don't know I mean I think it's it's just got to be more of an eyeball test to some degree and uh some of the stuff that is manufactured and you kinda have to figure out you know what\nWhat really a is value and how much of it is it's just numbers that get a inflated when you have guys that are that are doing five yard dump off to turn into long games\nYou know I think that one of those teams patch went home since ... I think are the two of them will kind of shovel passes and um\nYeah I mean but that being said to you Kevin Clark of the ring or a great article a couple of weeks ago I mean we're we're finally seeing you know and I felt teams really integrate adopt\nA scheme from college and high school or into into today's game you seen Andy redoing it print puts in Texas Tech concepts into the chief's office once in a you know it's really help and I think a lot of these younger players\nTranslate from from a college game to the program pro game a much better way than they had been a you know in prior years when these cortical system quarterbacks could make the jump\nAre you a numbers guy or an analytic sky by any means\n[noise] I mean I think you've got to pay pay heed to some level but I think people that are that are slaves to it you know a ... there's got to be that that mix to it right I mean I I'm definitely not analytics guy when it came to all the way the browns we're\nWe're building their team because again I thought I thought they were overly reliant on it um you know I I think I think analytics purely a football\nWhen you're talking about eleven guys so much\nYou know it's just not apples to apples I think from team to team scheme scheme\nOr before from college a college when you're bringing these guys up but uh it it tells a story you know I think I think you you you take it for what it is one thing that's really but you know Alex also and then you know you kind of kind of pick and choose what you think's important in what may put maybe is is more uh you know empty calories kind of numbers\nNay Davis with his USA Today because I Know we can watch a whole bunch of games but when it comes to the quarterback position because we find ourselves trying to find more advanced stats are creating more advanced ads because you just can't look at rating anymore and say well that guy is good because they all seem to be inflated do we have something that we could cook up like Warren baseball or anything like that\n[noise] I'm sure I mean I'm sure somebody will ... that that's that's probably going to be one of these when he's next Gen kind of thing so I Can't say that I've broken down a ESPN's QB are for for all things that that is important to that but it does seem like it's often a better\nIf you have a hard water the length scale not only leads white spots

Atlanta for a whole season this year they didn't have carried cold last year and the ... and you know that got titled now who used to be their number one started years their third starter and he's going tomorrow so I mean\nIt it they have a good bullpen that they didn't have last year if you remember you know they had to Charlie Martin to close the ALCOA as they had to use the colors to close the world series\nBecause it just didn't have a bump now they're they're Ripley and they've got all the good young players that they've built up over the course of the years and uh\nYou know and so

I I I Know it's one of those reactionary things but I I I think you're right when you're talking about how it's been building up for a long time and it's like you knew what on their head they're Dennis Dennis ... joining us on the show\nI I Want to go to save in I Want to go to Alabama oh real quick and I wanted to ask this and I almost forgot to ask you\nI I Love that rivalry I Love it that it's just the Texas state fair the whole deal is that one of the most underrated rivalries when we think of all the great rival reason in pro in college sports maybe it's just where I'm from it doesn't get brought up as much as some of the others\nYou know it it it's I wouldn't say it's under rated by just for sitting around yesterday at the game saying how how many rivalry games are good at this in you know there's like four years in Michigan Ohio State Alabama Auburn\nAnd what was the third what was the fourth one of the port went in there too but this one day and a neutral field where you have your exactly one half Texas than the exactly one half Oklahoma fan and that line is it the fifty yard line in this day and then it goes you know for things go on a path thrown down the middle\nAre you really can throw out the windows most you throughout the records most years and\nThe fact that it's right in the middle of a state fair if there's a reason they play it at eleven o'clock usually\nEvery you know every year people drank all day you know a big problem [laughter] so it ... I don't think it's under rated I think in front of for best rivalries in the country\nDidn't start joining us on the show is there any fly in the ... with the Alabama Crimson Tide or they almost perfect\nDay I think we're seeing a transformation before our eyes ah this is the best team make savings had that Alabama and it's approaching the best teams ever to Alabama because I didn't make faith and has\nGone to a full full whole hog into the office of philosophy I think that all they have the capacity and um he knew he had to play this way this year because of to his talent because the defense wasn't as good as it was in the past\nThat you know on on and off day they could out scored teams now we haven't really yet to see that yeah the closest game it's been twenty points protected them\nBut he knew how good this kid was quarterback and there was no use to him getting the fall off no let him go out there and make plays but the point that I'm trying to think I think he's got twenty five and completion than Eighteen touchdown pass that's pretty efficient\nAh so no I I they don't have many flaws when you're winning like that\nThe flaws are taking too many paddle the you know they're not very good into the oval unit but that's always been the case of saving teams but it's always been running the ball and playing defense not always one for him\nI think we're seeing that a transition to off into football by next favorite of all people\nThen it sounds joining us on the show at one of the big storylines has been jailing hurts a him being there are still trying to be a leader doing your job that I Want to ask maybe some just turns into advice I guess [noise] ah because I see what's going on there and then I watched what happened with Kelly Bryant with\nClemson and I understand that if he feels that that's the best decision for him that he needs to do this really we're seeing transfers like we've never seen it in history\nAnd I've always been a little bit leery of talking about players in the decision some of the decisions that they make if they do something wrong they do something wrong I'm not saying that this was wrong but there is a difference between the pro football player in the quote unquote amateur football player and I'll talk about\nWhen I look at a guy like Kelly Brown who's this is a big boy decision this is almost the professional association of amateur athletics\nDo I start to treat him as a big boy do I started to treat some of these guys is if they were professionals and speak about them on the field as if they were professionals\nOh I think that train left the station long ago if they if they don't understand the public figures and if they don't understand with all that attention they get your recruiting that they're going to be shut my expectations at the highest level\nThan they diluted themselves so um you know these coaches what these kids can be these innocent little little deer camp faith seven beat writers or after a game but they somehow can change the play line of scrimmage before a hundred thousand screaming fan so now\nThat that's bad you know they're they're big boys make better know the big boys because that's of everything they want it you know all of its glory and adulation and playing time championships\nChristophe ... should ever remove any leans the IRS has employees and help you reduce your back taxes by as much as eighty percent\nThat's right eighty percent don't wait until another tax season is at another year penalties in interest or editor your balance\nYou oh at least ten thousand dollars to the IRS and meet a new start on your back taxes call one eight hundred three one two Ninety nine Seventy that's why you know two or three one two Ninety nine Seventy liberal professional big coastal and financial group\nFight to get you got a new start\nYou deserve again about wanting to under three one two Ninety nine Seventy [noise]\nCBS Sports radio we saw in northeast Nebraska on AM seven eighty five point nine FM news talk W.

five were dreams live and then dreams die but a weird year this year in twenty Eighteen because so many teams are still alive\nStill around there's there's a few things that I Know for certain though\nOne is that we wrap up Sunday Night Football and we see the cowboys lose yet again in prime time television now I'd bury bloom on the show earlier I Will admit I'm not a Yankees fan I'm not a Red Sox fan and in fact I could care less about either oh\nExcuse me I couldn't care less about either baseball's magical 'cause it's maybe the last regional sport in the United states\nYou're a hardcore fan of the Milwaukee Brewers you don't give a damn about the Boston Red Sox you'll still probably watched tomorrow night at the highest rented LDS all that thing and it very bloom wanted to tell me and he was right absolutely one hundred percent right\nBury bloom but I think we're a bunch of masochist when it comes to that and it's constantly in our face in what we age is we'd all like value and we like things that are worth ... we hate getting ripped off\nAnd when we watch Sunday night baseball we watch regular season baseball the leaves have been at least two good team so at least it's been worth the value but a lot of ways we hate being ripped off but\nWith major league baseball it's guaranteed ratings guaranteed ratings being guaranteed eyes on advertisers it means guaranteed revenue I Can't fight the almighty dollar I just can't do it\nAs much as I Want to\nAs much as I yawn Nineteen times during the season and during the postseason as well as much as I Want to I just can't there is some good thought and obviously some good drama that comes with Yankees Red Sox citizen historical rivalry I have to admit\nHowever\nThere's other things that we think are supposed to be great and they're just not that are supposed to be worth it and they're just not in dare I say you know what there is no dare to say it I'll just come out and said you better if you're Jerry

people calling in trolling trying to do that type of thing they should they should despise\nBecause what professional sports does college football rivalries are always going to be the crime Democrats are always going to be the best it's built in its traditional it's just so much fun I Love the ... records out all that stuff even though the red river shootout ... excuse me\nShowdown and not allowed to say shootout anymore the red river showdown Texas Oklahoma ... am Texas state fair you've got the golden cowboy hat the whole thing off said Michigan all that stuff it's built in beautiful iron bowl but in professional sports\nYou got to compete to have a rivalry especially now there was a time where you have blessed row and you had other ones that in regional scouting the services that where if you were in\nPittsburgh you took kids from Penn State took kids from West Virginia to kids for ... you know that type of thing if you're in Cincinnati there was more regional guy\nAnd so guys wouldn't make their home they were from there they went to those schools they got drafted by those teams and there was more region out there there was a ... obviously you know the main job green is from North Texas ended up being a great Pittsburgh Steeler there are guys who were from all over but there was a lot of guys who are local and because of the sport was different than you made your home\nIn the city that you were drafted by guys have lived in their cities for a long time in those areas for a long time\nNow it's so transient you're there for a few months out of the year and then immediately when the seasons and whether that's being in the post Caesar whether that's right at the end of the season\nYou fly away and we'll see you here coming up in the next so TAs and then some of the other scheduled workouts if you don't see guys stay so to have that type of rivalry 'cause there should be rivalries between Pittsburgh fans and Cleveland fans and cowboys fans and forty nine or ... there should\nBe that rivalry which got to compete to have an actual robbery\nIf Kansas City and the raiders both suck there might be a little bit of a history there with the fans players will care as much but if they're both plan to get into the playoffs are both plan for for to win that division Sunday Night Football that it it's so much better you go to years ago\nWhen Robert Griffin the third was playing wall and playing for the Redskins and they won\nThat division it was either late afternoon or it might have been Sunday Night Football against the cowboys at home and you add eighty thousand people at FedEx Field singing in unison hail to the red skins\nHats a robbery you got to earn it\nThese guys come from the same schools are transient that these guys got to win games and they have to be competitive so you want them to hate each other the only way to hate each other you got to be competing for something\n\nSo when you have teams taking pity on you other players taking pity on you analysts and fans that ugly you want to be hated John and Washington John you're next on CBS Sports radio [noise]\nHey how's it going hey John going well buddy go ahead\n[noise] so you're you're insured that thing about you lie and they can Berkeley and stuff like that yeah my outlook is kind of like you know maybe they have the quarterback and one and they saw Barclay as that you know he's not going to come around or anything like that for a few more years\n... threats you know our our franchise guy you know I have in the back one more year and then maybe they got their eye on a quarterback next year\nWhy you know I I don't like that John ... well it's not it's not a done deal I Can't say that what I'm saying is law here obviously it's always going to be subject to change if they draft the quarter back this year you can always say well they waited on their guy and they got themselves the guy but say Sam Donald ends up really really well say they miss their next quarter back\nYou have an in stadium argument there that's going to go for Twenty years between those two franchise\nSo are you saying that they're going to kind of turned into like rounds or [noise]\nYeah I mean ... if you don't take a quarterback because that was always the biggest fight with a lot of browns fans Jon is that when you hit new asleep pass up on a guy and they would take guys twenty second and they take guys later and they just never addressed that ... and John thank you for the call they never address that problem head on\nAnd that's what browns fans were sick and tired of and that's why they were accused and it basically were was the front office any way of taking over the last couple of years\nTraining on a number two well you talk yourself out of Carson was these are things you do as a fan I wouldn't need that guy anyway don't let that type of thing if you're a giants fan I don't even know if John John was if you're a giants fan don't let that happen\nBecause you will as the ... and you'll you'll talk yourself into bad moves into mental gymnastics and have galaxy brain to try to talk to yourself in saying that just things that don't make any sense makes sense like what the browns did for Twenty years\nIt's their take the guy if he ends up sucking up the room tech another guy your your job depends on if you're a general manager bigger may feel if you go out and be done after this John door she'll get fired the bronze will have to do it all over again\nBut if you're a general manager and the NFL how you wouldn't give yourself a chance with the quarterback is beyond me\nNow I think that they'd get 'em in sixty six sixty Seventy should have some time to go get himself a quarterback after all this and and hopefully we'll make it worse sake one Berkeley as well 'cause he's it immensely talented running back and immensely talented asset but when you have a guy like manning who's losing games\nYou have to do back in junior who's calling him out publicly and saint was galvanize the team we still lawsuit doesn't galvanize anything yeah patch Sherman or who's talking about you and post game leading off post game press press conferences talking about you so you can't tell me it's galvanized the guinea ...\nAnd when you have an old quarterback who's not doing it not getting over the hump even though I don't hold him very strongly accountable for anything today he's the franchise quarterback he lost he takes a lot of that ... that criticism and takes a lot of that place but I don't hold him strongly accountable for that but when you're one in four you're you're just spinning your wheels and wasting your time yet the number two overall pick\nAnd if you take a running back there you're telling the world that you can get over the hump with

Hi Mitch go ahead buddy\nHey uh because I just wanted to get your thoughts on the falcons man I mean we suck right now\nWell I mean you buy some ... summed it up right there I mentioned I mean [laughter]\nUm\nYeah I I watch this team I I tried to watch them every single week and the first week you know is opening day and you lose the eagles alright and all of their home whatever and then you get back on earth where the Panthers and who are just you you play teams that are good you've played schedules been tough\nBecause let me he had the seats on there it would yeah you have the bangles last week he just got blown up by the Steelers these are talented football teams are taken on and the Steelers it just was horrible that you went in against Pittsburgh and they were born desperate than you are and then ended up winning now they're now you're a woman for football team that was supposed to be in a tough division\nAnd you're on the outside looking at Matt Ryan has been good the defense has been suspect\nI didn't quit I think it's been brought into question over this and again I think you could look at\nYou could look at play calling I think people always look at play calling with Mitch\nBut again I still go back to are we gonna cry over call Shanahan being gone again here are we going to use this as an excuse one more time in Atlanta\nBecause when I listen to people in Atlanta I keep hearing about college Shanahan and ... he's not coming home it it it's done so you have an MVP caliber quarterback they have to go to the next level Mitch\nYeah yeah I I agree with you man I mean I'm ... and\nThose are just going to say I just wonder\nWhat was that envy piece season or result Shanahan you know when or do you think\nI mean he's he's a hell of a game plan or he's a good coach saw Mitt that yes he has something to do with that Mitch thank you very much for the call but I see what he's doing offensively right\nNow how much more can I ask format Ryan\nI honestly how much more can I ask from the sky\nYou look at the game logs and what he's done he's done I think he's done a fantastic job\nHis worst game easily happen in week one you're going to have always going to have a four week one ear and there you lose\nAgainst New Orleans you through five touchdown\nYou lose against Cincinnati through three touchdowns you lose against Pittsburgh you still wasn't that bad\nI don't know what else about Ryan supposed to do you got to get some defense going going to get some guys healthy but at one and for the season's over and it has to be a massive disappointment yet again it's such a roller coaster for the falcons urine and you're out\nOne way one month into the seas you're thinking about already you're thinking about the draft\nRichard in Erie, Pennsylvania your next up on CBS Sports really go ahead Richard\nHey how're you doing today done well for him\nOr you got a cowboys fan here on the phone call I think you brought up a lot of the quake but I I feel that way home from work and my question basically is skiing you know what is Dallas got\nGotta do to get better and I know your obvious answer is no Cherry Hill just decided to check in or you know get out of the coach in business but you know it all Sarasota defend them a little bit\nWe thought that a little bit of excitement of the last several years river roller tickets to the playoffs a few times when we at that Russia will call it Green Bay by that and I got into it over that he's a big Green Bay fan and then lastly you know the rookie or you know of a deck and that was kind of exciting I don't know what happened but\nPart of that I'll say I let me say this Richard I'll let you continue I say that a bit out of anger I got a lot of you\nOr I like Tony Romo quarterback I think he's a pretty good broadcast or even a lotta people disagree with me on that but that's fine I think he's pretty good and I think he's entertaining and that's what I'm asking them to do they have had some success and they had success with Bill Parcells was in charge of things they they had a little bit of success obviously when you go back to Jerry Jones or when when Jerry Jones was with Jimmy Johnson\nAny time somebody else has been in charge of that things why it gets so upset with Jerry Jones and the Jones Family any time they've let anybody else have any sort of power\nIt seems to have worked in their direction and now I look at a guy like Jason Garrett where you're putting on fourth one and basically the only thing I could say Jason Garrett's defense is that Jerry Jones has his hand up his backside and operates them as a as if he's his own puppet\nSo you have a Kim Jong un's situation in Dallas where everybody's just stay a subject for Jerry Jones hate me they want to Richard but that's the that's the beginning and end or what I think is the problems with the Dallas Cowboys but go ahead\nNo I was just going to say though you know it's been very frustrating because I ate the weight jokes there like when I was a little kid I grew up in Washington and you know first I looked at the cheerleaders that I became a cowboy state always welcome but what do we deal with\nOur Landry back in the day I couldn't stand that it took me a long time to really I really quit watching football for a while but now it's like you know every year it's like I get that excited or Dallas but it's like\nWhen they screw up and then you know like a you know what I mean but after a while you're right I mean it's like after a while I mean I ... into the billionaire but\nDallas like screw up and then you know like a you know what I mean but after a while you're right I mean it's like after a while I mean Joe billionaire but it's like you know how big is the man it go you know what I'm saying if I you know get out of the coaching thing and you know if the players just let them do their thing you know ...\nAnd they had [laughter]\nRichard Richard and Richard because I Want to try to get the Jeremiah to thank you for the call they've had a couple of good picks have had a couple of the draft classes\nLike Stephen Jones is done OK okay\nI just see a team that's supposed to be called America's Team they operate like North Korea\nBut not to literally let's not go crazy here but this is a dictatorship up like any other yeah there I Know there are an ownership it's it's a business got it all Dole orderly\nJerry Jones is a brilliant businessman and I underline brilliant when it comes to football I think he knows what he's talking about a lot of ways he's been doing it for a long time he has to do something about the game I Will give him that credit absolutely\nIs part of the entire through never anything hidden ... neither one that got

had to take a little time off during the pre season but it's good that you're traveling around again chasing this team uh so what was the best thing you saw from the tax ends on Sunday night\nThey did a tremendous job against as they go LA just totally shut him down he was leading the league and rushing average five for Nate yards\nHe had been doing well as receivers average for judge was before the dead ban so that was the gay boy it and then the driving force that growth Scott row and get a couple of big plays early Jewish drive ins but after the first quarter Amy and the last three quarters and overtime\nIs proof for only a hundred yards their defensive backs the Jacksons\nAnd men get towards the last two games they played their best game of the season and I think the biggest\nProblem areas they have they offered to line was one shot but watch one got hit ... times what a lot of ... because of the way he plays\nAnd everybody down ears friday's will end up in the hospital and uh but the secondary and in the way to defend it shuts down Elliot that was the best thing I saw\nHow good is it just seemed to Danielle and cloudy running around healthy he can be a force when he's healthy he in Jay Jay ... actually both healthy now it it changes that defense\nWhat came back quicker than clowning both ... season like had a cup of coffee in the ... in a a

get run down there\nThey're running game because the bags don't get in an office of wind is not very good they struggle and I think uh like if you don't put the shah ...\nIt in an office of lines is not very good they struggle and I think uh like if you don't put the shah walks under center the defense doesn't have to respect the snakes and then when they did put him under center and he did at a sneaky got stuff\nYou know he did as you say a lot to ... and John McLean with us\nFrom Houston after every Sunday Night Football is what the Houston Chronicle and are affiliated sports radio takes

know adult victim is something about the red red hair so there is a red zone interception by Dalton and then there was a missed field goal\nAnd they're absolutely no point to the bangles at whole mind you against the dolphins until five minutes left in the third quarter but the second half was a completely different story\nI'm not exactly sure what happened to Miami got shut out and I'm sure it's

presumption of innocence and that's kind of trade\nAnd she went on to say there's no corroborating evidence because she read everything and talk to everybody including the people that you said were witnesses they don't know of it so what do you want to do that didn't stop center Hirono the war one of the worst senators around of Hawaii from saying this\nShe said that to\nThink that the doctor for think that ... is our phone than things that are who they are very credible account and you think that that are calling is insulting to professor for what to say that to think that that the court said\nThat she herself or what if that is the focus\nWhich he said is she was so if there's something hitter but it's not Brett Kavanaugh and if there is we can't tell we have no idea so should we destroy somebody's life about something that did did he says didn't happen thirty five years ago and nobody else said happen except her\nThat would make her happy for one reason not for Dr Ford for one reason the seat stays open and they have a shot to win the Senate that I Hope people can see through Keith was a new study six five and a window keep\nGood morning Brian good morning which everyone yeah\nHey I Would love to see President Trump started in ... so to\nThe rank and file Democrats that are hard working historically you know moderate Democrats that are not just this less crazy thing and right now he started making a Democrat versus Republican and and and his policies actually benefit a lot of these people to get your your traditional\nManufacturing and union workers wages have gone up early\nAnd and he's got he's got to separate them from the small minority of these crazies and say I know that's not true you know you can even say I used to be a Democrat I have friends that are Democrats this is not who you are in and we we've got to isolate these these crazy\nThat to him you know uh keep that is genius I have not heard anybody bring that up instead of Republican versus Democrat Republican versus Democrat or the Democrats have today versus what they used to bake\nAnd doing it multiple times in may or may not have assaulted her and because he had a yellow or red so low cop that he of course was spiking punch\nA and getting women drunk and taking advantage of them and nothing held up Jonathan Turley used to have a student in my lab and I joined us right now what Jonathan\nHi how's it going\nA good idea how do you feel about which Democrat Senator Chris Coons just said\nWell you know what's interesting is I I didn't find the allegation particularly credible\nBut ah I did find it strange disconnect you know the Democrats came out and said that the accuser always\nOr should be believed and I thought it was interesting that when cones that got to the uh concluding line he said well the Republicans didn't believe her eyes so it's a strange politics of\nA sexual harassment and the me too movement for democratic uh coins was clearly signaling that he didn't believe these allegations otherwise he would have been objecting to the treatment but he prefers to save the Republicans didn't believe her a so there's this weird environment where we're living in instead of just saying look\nSexual harassment have a right to be heard not to be believed I everyone has due process rights and fairness right but for some reason a lot of the Democratic members can't get themselves to say that 'cause they don't want to appear that they're anything but totally in favor of\nThe me too movement and I think that ultimately this hurt the me too movement a bit uh I think that it's clear that this final allegation did undermined the previous to allegation\nAnd in the big picture to win Susan Collins gave that comprehensive speech\nShe didn't say I'm voting because I'm a Democrat or I'm voting and I'm a Republican I'm going to\nShe used to let me just tell you what went into this let me tell you how I insisted on this let me tell you how I came to this decision and when you listen to the way she liberated it's hard to say well typical party politics I I just don't you you could be angry that it didn't go your way\nBut as you see there when Kavanaugh was accused of something that happened Thirty years ago something might have happened Thirty years ago\nI'm not saying it didn't but when there's nobody they weren't rate the story how can we possibly\nTell this man he's not worthy of this seat or it's okay to destroy his wife\n[noise] well I I this is far I wrote a column recently in the hill that we finally reached this level of primordial politics you know we live where we engage in totally on limited\nOn the linking rage and ... you know politicians have unleashed this in the age of ... you know they we we now live in a time where people have been given license to\nBe rage full hateful and not consider any elements of fairness her empathy and there's lots of people that are waiting for that moment we saw that I didn't see that on both sides\nBut what's missing here is what you know used to be said about statesmen that the difference between a politician or statesman the politicians think to the next election we're statesman thinks the next generation where we really found out in the Kavanaugh confirmations are very few statesmen left in the Senate\nOppose me a lot you know I came to Washington as a page a fourteen year old page and when I was here giants walked those calls you know people like moynahan end and Humphrey in\n... and others you know they were Republican and Democrat they were institutional is they believe deeply in the Senate you know when I when I handled the impeachment ... last impeachment trial or in the Senate and it was last judicial teach mislead counsel\nI remember arguing I'm a part of the case and they took a break on the Senate floor and and center in a way a came up to me and said how so how do you feel that having these hundred senators as your jury\nUnless you know I just can't get out in my mind when I was a page because in a way was there with a page and I said you know there used to be giants here you know and when I'm arguing you these people they all seemed so damn small\nAnd in a way it got really sort of silent and he said I think about that a lot and the sentence changed and it hasn't changed for the better um and at some point or and a half to decide if the majority of the American people have had enough\nOf these people on both sides that seem to be trafficking in the politics of rage\nWell I'll give you an example\nI Susan Collins is as I have death threats and I have people praising me and she does Sunday shows you back away from the decision did sixty minutes\nNow ah people say Murkowski you're done we're going to run against you how dare you vote against them if you want to show that it's a new day\n... and understand it to Europe it's on your best interests to tell Manchin Murkowski in college I respect your decision now you're going to have to earn those Senate votes but don't alienate and vilify\nThis'll be the first test not just from other senators but from politicians and people do not hate Murkowski for not agreeing with your decision or going with her party you harder to make her own decisions well representing your people are and if not as an election don't make her enemy number one\nBrian I think that is just incredibly well said you know the I I actually wrote a column and Murkowski first came to the Senate that actually criticized her uh being appointed to the Senate or ... or ... um because of the\nUh the concern I have for ... you know that her father was a senator and I never liked that I've never liked the family yeah I the salmon Lynn itch but I have to admit I and I do so gladly\nShe is one of the most thoughtful senators\nAre in Washington I you can disagree with their decision on Kavanaugh but she's one of those senators that quite frankly thanks very deeply\nMost of these people I got to tell you are just grade D actors you know there I you know is the foreman is yeah the worst performance is when they tried to convince us they actually care of this stuff\nBut they're few and I think we're ... does care I really do\nAnything is you you you can't buy the Democrat too crazy to alienate Joe mansion scanning shame at him and ... and his party no he's representing West Virginia well being a Democrat and if you keep pushing him what is the endgame that he switched parties\nAnd what does he engaged with Susan Collins said she never ever deliberate Republican or not what do you want to say okay we couldn't convince or this time maybe next time\n[noise] yeah I think that's right and we're going to see another face it\nYou know not what do you want to say okay we couldn't convince or this time maybe next time\nI think that's right and we're going to see another face of this tomorrow perhaps\nWe're gonna see protesters tried to interrupt the Supreme Court proceedings that would be a new low uh you know the ... the ... the the Supreme Court chambers has always been a place of considerable reference they're much more strict in terms of\nDecorum in that chamber room all of the justices believe strongly in that and we're going to see if this is this rage full environment that we live and will penetrate the chamber itself and it'll be a new low if if protesters or interrupt those proceedings\nAnd we heard them interrupted the vote over and over again and the vice president demanding order listen to if we if it does translate to radio I Hope it does these are the protests are swarming the door at the Supreme Court cut thirty\nAn extraordinary moment of having to weigh\nAction ... ... ...\nAs a whole building our building in a restaurant I tell them that are on the part of the [noise]\nSo I mean that was crazy scene when the vice president walk walk back then he walked out again on the Supreme Court steps they which this crowd chanting angry things at him so you you've never you've never seen this before right\nI haven't and we were we've lost any sense of\nControl or decorum I've seen it with friends of mine you know I come from Chicago from a very liberal family and by the rage is overwhelming but what concerns me is I just got back from Chicago and I said this to some of my friends and family\nThat they're enjoying it too much that they they're enjoying the rage too much there's a sense that suddenly it's okay to say hateful things one person said I really hope that Mitch McConnell die that someone killed somewhere he died of cancer\nAnd I said do you do it if I played that statement back to you do you think that you will be ashamed and and she said no they said that's the point there was a day when we still have the capacity for shame\nThat that is a shameful thing to say but we've lost that capacity\nWell I mean look at what just happened to me or as I'm walking on the train so I mean that and I actually\nI think that's a great example Brian what happened to you what's an outrage the fact that there are people that would not only do that but then posted\nAnd people would congratulate them this nice are really horrible people you know there are such things as or they are yeah the the people that followed you like that are horrible people and they seem to have found their audience\nAnd they have a and

justice a big victory but let's you know how they the Democrats and the activists went down kicking and screaming we have video and audio of them actually kicking and screaming I'm not kidding listen to this as they were trying to take the vote here's a sample cut twenty nine\nWhy why did the wheels come off\nI think it's multi faceted one we have our trade issues which most people tend to focus on but also going on behind the scenes and doesn't get a lot of coverage\nIs the pervasive activities that they are also doing in other parts of the reason region what whether it's militarily whether it is trying to influence our political elections in the midterms\nIn including some other activities in in other parts of the world where they're offering basically loans to cash strapped\nAh countries that are barely trying to stay afloat and then when they can't repay them they're taking over key facilities such as ports and things like that in order to build a base of influence that's going to expand across the across the Pacific\nAnd we've got to confront all of these things all at the same time we'll get the trade issues worked out China has to work it out we are the largest economy in the world where their largest customer\nBut we also have to deal with these other issues and that's why the president the vice president's speech was so strong on that because make no mistake those were the words of President Trump and the policy of President Trump that the vice president was was espousing last week\nMark now that you're on the outside\nWhat er and we can look at

I think it's difficult because I still work on the on the twenty twenty reelection committee so I'm Still very well OK closely connected with with the administration and I'm I'm always one to uh to to save my advice for private council a\nI think the folks that are working and they're doing such a great job and they're working very hard at getting the president's policies are enacted or promoted\nBut I think the one thing we have to do and what we have to make sure we do and this is true for all Republicans whether you're in the ... the house the Senate the White House\nWe've got to make sure that we relate our policies to real people they don't pay attention like we do in Washington DC and New York to every other and that comes out of of politics\nThey're busy living their lives we've got to make sure that we connect with people and I think that sometimes where there is a disconnect as we talk about unemployment rates in GDP Growth yeah great things but make it related to people at home which means\nThere's a better chance your wages are going up your paychecks going up or because of the low unemployment rate\nThere's never been a better time for you either go get a

about ... is he right\nNow are the way it is the way I see it is a\nWay that people are as it is constitutional they voted a year down of a slave for Donald Trump so far we the people are satisfied I can say that because he's doing exactly what I voted for him for a he's been a force of the American people therefore has the way that people\nHas seen director David ... the by the demographic\nMentioning the just the United states the brain board who is a tough topic like did nothing wrong\nOperation of any time\nFBI investigate that is is\nSo he's he's not running you know he knows politically is to his advantage always instincts tell him to bring up what will happen if we lose the house what happens if you lose a Senate interesting tactic right\n[noise] yeah I mean listen he sees a an upside\nYou know answering the question like like he did he sees that especially with Republicans who are going to turn out in the mid term election um the fact that he delivered on Brett Kavanaugh and he got it across the finish line and and the senators did\nA is a is a big win for him and\nYou know you wouldn't know that if you looked at the week of coverage of it but once it happened I it was a promise delivered and it was one in which ah especially evangelicals and conservatives are conservatives all over the country were really pushing for\nYeah it's just so interesting because yesterday last week while you're away maybe just a coincidence but I think there's a lot to do with you being away they cut a new NAFTA deal\nYou were standing in line everybody knows that I got a new NAFTA deal they could they got together and opioids the president has ramped up his rhetoric against China which even unites them with Democrats on that initiative and with a lot of the EU\nSo now we're getting closer to a bilateral with Japan and you have a a Trump like reader emerging Brazil so there's a lot of people who are saying wait a second\nThere's a lot of dominoes falling in the president's direction right now what it on the economic numbers would even through a hurricane or the unemployment dropped now the three point seven percent\nAnd they don't ... yeah and the fed raises interest rates because he feels the economy is healthy for the long term kinda hurts the economy a little bit it hasn't stopped Colin Powell for a bird for taking a look at what the president has created I Want you what he said to freeze the carrier cut thirty nine\nAnd so America has to take a hard look at itself and especially the Congress take a hard look at yourself and see what we are doing to try to keep things things forces in check and put America back in the middle of all this as opposed to being sort of a reluctant player and trying to pull out of ... rather than helping make new agreements\nAnd you know he went on to say they do oh we're hurting alliances were insulting allies maybe if you look at it on the surface but what he does he pushes back he says he wants or we can figure but he doesn't alienate but I think his unorthodox approach is just never going to resonate\nPolitical success or failure with people like Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright and maybe the George ... of the world who used to doing things a certain way\nYou know I think you're right and it's definitely not a traditional way for diplomacy or dealing with trade deals but over time um some of these deals are he's big ones have come across and have you know I mean the the Mexico cameras thing was huge\nUm the south Korea deal on the precipice of Japan or who knows what to you is going to deliver that promise but it's you know if there's a new new deal\nI'm Wondering saying that they are all to the benefit of us if they reach structuring deals based on his problems with how they were structured before the devil's in the details but um I think a lot more people are looking at it and saying it's an orthodox but might be working\nAnd yeah I mean this is what I what I find is so interesting is that because he's Donald Trump they don't even give it they don't even attempt to give them the benefit of the doubt and I was one of the people read the Woodward book\nAnd I'm reading this and he's sitting down with generals and he's telling the generals including that is hey guys you would do this for Seventeen years why making me sick more money into this tell me about a plan that works come on army tell me and tell me you got to plan is going to work so it's characterized as the president doesn't respect his generals\nWhat it is is a CEO going up to his but his division presidents and saying produce more it's Steinbrenner looking at his hundred million dollar Yankees in saying winning by three games is not enough or trailing by three is not enough\nHe wants to get more but not everyone says well how can you be so disrespectful of the military but they people aren't even open to we might some of this unorthodox way of doing things in politics\nMight be necessary does that surprise you\nKnow listen I'm people and we traveled last election twenty sixteen bounced around the country people\nYou know listen I'm people and we traveled last election twenty sixteen\nBounced around the country people or most that we hurt the most from or people that were ... both part\nThey said Washington doesn't work it's trying to kick the table over and try something different well this is something different the operates in different realm he uses Twitter says things that don't you know it's not comfortable but\nThere is stuff that is happening we cover the iceberg that's on top of the water and the controversies that day but there is a huge iceberg of changes happening in Washington and different agencies including the Pentagon um that often don't get covered\nYeah it ... you know now he seems to have more of his people around him that my sale instead of judging him works with them instead of saying why is he wise you know fly off the handle wise you want to do five things at once they go to that I Know that guy that's what he always wants to do this is what you do\nIs they handle it you don't run to the Washington Post and say invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment I even sense\nThat it's the ways we spend the whole thing with a Rosenstein is working he\nLet 'em out let them calmed down let the story die a little bit and then they're going to go talk Rosen someone to talk right away that's kind of the way it works in business in our business especially\nYou know you're not getting the stories you while you're not getting that your your case break because you get all the stories you when you're not you're not being talked about this to this so maybe a maybe a new direction a little upset you know knows you a little upset gives you a week or two to cool out then you bring them in office on your on his time or time and then you talk it through like we're used to this world but in politics\nThey handle it just totally differently and\nAnd the president's not bending he doesn't care if it upsets people\nDrive is clear\nA hundred percent clear he\nDoes not care if he upsets people and um and we'll see we'll see how the country reacts or the next you know barometer that we can really measure is November sex and it'll be fascinating to see if if what Democrats are predicting um holds true or if\nThese numbers really don't line up to the sentiment of how people are looking at their own personal economy and the state of the nation\nI'm going to give you a good question for tonight or tomorrow that I think is really gonna

Republican in name only\nGuy she had been called that for years uh she was growing up in the room and kept so late it very sensitive issues on both sides of the topic and that that it's hard to do ... it really is but I think she nailed it a perfect speech for all know\nA big cause the animosity still language but I think she it was one of the better speeches I've ever heard at it in Congress\nYeah yeah I got a chance to uh finally listen to it over the weekend and and uh I was very impressed with it as well and and hopefully it does set a different tone for Congress and the and the Senate going forward so that we can get some\nSome bipartisan or a efforts accomplished here in the months ahead um we talked a little bit on friday Jim about the race that Senator Cruz is in down in Texas\nBoy it it feels like that tightened up even more over the weekend just simply based on the comments that that Cruz is making here this morning on some of the new shows he's trying to get back out in front of people and and and deliver a message\nWhile the key in that race cheer up from the political experts told me is the size of the Hispanic vote\nRaised chip from the political experts tell me is the size of the Hispanic vote\nA it has been underwhelming the last few years and especially in off the ... presidential election year if ah his opponent a\nA a galvanizes that vote he could be in trouble now vice president Mike Pence is down there today and President Trump is expected later this month to help him out\nRight and then senator Heitkamp on sixty minutes last night Jim boy that was a pretty revealing\nA interviewer conversation as well when I can be you know she wrapped it up by basically saying listen it was it was not politically smart to vote against Kavanaugh but it's something that she felt she had to do\n[noise] yeah that that's going to be an interesting one to see how North Dakota and voters who are very loyal to the north Dakota and so I figure it out I Would look for her opponent Kramer\nBecause the political types told me he has a habit of putting his foot in his mouth now at the overreach is on that vote that could come back to haunt him I I got you know it hasn't been done yet but I Would watch for that possibility chip\nOkay All right very good now a\nUs secretary of state Mike Pompeo was uh in Asia last week North Dakota and made a stop in Beijing a the Beijing stuff I think that was pretty telling of of the current status of the relationship between us and China\nYeah I think he he may be in China Today but when he heard their foreign minister Wang Yi he's yet\nHe has the Trump administration's recent action that said da\nDa da da da da da ... and cast a shadow over bilateral relations and palm pale responded and said there's fundamental disagreement with China a on a on a whole ... areas but he wants them to keep talking I think it's so visceral right now chip that\nThe only two people that can ... can get it on the on the path of bilateral good bilateral relations is Trump ... thing and that may not happen until late November early December\nYeah it's not going to happen until after the elections for sure because um\nShe wants to see how the rest of the country votes this in in where controls the Senate and the house is going to end up right\nYes and then if if if the\nIf the Republicans ... continue to control the Senate maybe not the house\nThen it becomes a twenty twenty election issue for a reelection issue for Trump and\nYou don't see grounds to give that much so this thing could be far longer lasting than what we initially thought going into what was initially skirmishes now increasingly looks like a major economic trade geopolitical battleship\nRight right okay or is it going to happen this week Jim are we going to get confirmation of year around availability of e fifty\nWell timed daily called me this morning and she said are we going to get it and I said I'm In the Ninety percent of the higher camp uh yeah I Do the ... the latest rumor in town is fat or they could announce it from me PA around two o'clock central time now you yeah I don't know whether you make up those those are a\nYoung adult time periods but it seems odd to put a time on it\nBut I'll tell you Pacific ethanol which is an ethanol from their thoughts skyrocketed on expectations of Trump and a BA what's going to lift the federal ban on summer sales have built a Fifteen ah so ah you know somebody's believing it in the marketplace\nRight yeah and and what are we what what is the ethanol industry going to give to get in this case\nWell it looks like there'll be some restrictions on trading biofuel credits those are the ... but I don't think it's that that's definitely not going to satisfy the crude oil industry and you know as well as I the ethanol proponents don't want to give anything plus\nThey want a re allocation of those ... of the art fs and boy I don't know if Trump were to announce that that would be big news I'm not hearing that nor is it being rumored a that would be the biggest news announcement\nWell don't you think that that's where the focus of the industry is going after we get the Fifteen announcement\nAbsolutely and it should be there shouldn't be a timeline to address that are you a waiver or an issue and maybe that'll be part of the call for public comments cars this year round be Fifteen in any changes to the rams\nAre gonna have to call for public comment because we're not going to get it done until next summer anyway Jeb so we've got time to comment on this but that's not going to satisfy the ethanol proponents who are already mad about those last bushels\nRight right okay us MCAA we've had a weekend now to let the thing kind of settle in a little bit what's the latest there you're hearing any more\nNow is this on how good or not so good to deal is\nMost people say that it's better than what we had before because it brings and the other topics that digital\nYou're trading et cetera uh it is not free and open trade because there are some managed trade and the auto sector but it's better than no deal at all it preserves the north American integrated market that's your bottom line and it could serve as a template uh within reason for future agreements with Japan\nYou pay a ... you and others\nOkay speaking of digital issues have you done this week of your computers mother boards looking for that tiny chip\n[laughter] well I'm an apple I I bought apple products before they were popular okay\nUh I'll side with Apple's officials I don't believe regretfully many people in this town anymore but I Believe apple because I've trusted their products and they've worked for me I still have my original apple computer by the white has gone down\nA so he's they're saying they doubled down today saying they'd rechecked and they uh there's there's no skull debris on on in in the ... area so I don't know whether others so Bloomberg is holding their story so since I was\nMuch like he said she said that we just went through on the Supreme Court and now we got to have evidence here because apple doesn't find it\nRight right okay so last week when staving off\nRoberts I'm\nAnd Collins came out of a negotiating room\nThey link darn what was that all about\nWell they can link all they want their art does this save issues on that are on a host of titles of course we know the food stamp area but title one there's a big bash going on between Conway and I and I think colon Peter since efforts to improve both the A. R. C. M. P. L. say I think they have\nGoing on between Khan away and I and I think Collin Peterson efforts to improve both the A. R. C. M. P. L. say\nI think they have to condense Pat Roberts uh and I think they're going to try to get data from USDA and CB all to convince him so we've got some work to do I do not see this are being done until after November ... elections ... but I Do think it'll get done before the under the calendar year and a new Congress\nAll right good stuff Jim thanks buddy will start\nTaking on friday anytime

gator during the violent\nJohn Deere gators the Baltimore utility vehicles for getting things done\nYeah boy that coup bought a tractor that uh that didn't hurt hurt that guy at all did it selling it twenty five something\nNo on consignment silicon out of the ... yeah it's eleven years old twenty three hundred dollars but I think like we may be touched on last week chipping I've noticed is for a long time ago boat has in good condition they hold their value out there so not too surprising to see that M. eighty five forty ... pretty well Saturday\nRight right yeah this weekend I was up a uh up in Wisconsin visiting some family up there and we just happen to we're heading for an orchard happened to drive by a little uh\nEnd loader and uh uh I I tell you what you know we all three of us in the vehicle made the comment Boyd be handy to have one of those around have you seen any of those cell recently\nUh [noise] uh ... uh an\nEditing you know just any of the little bitch daggers\nOh yeah well yeah we I guess nothing's pop and the Mayan specifically chip but yeah we do a get a ton of that data might be able to look over the break and see if I could\nPull okay that's a couple of sorry but uh but yeah a lot of demand for that kind of small a small equipment like the mini excavators and\nMan on the topic of many excavators I did one of those Saturday\nWas way out east fell out of New York a sale in a Whitney Point New York kind of south central and they had a a late model one at twenty sixty new on the eve thirty seven see many actually later I think you know the hundred and sixty eight hours on a total so it was like new approach thirty thousand\nThen I'm the same sale actually another ... to ... to him one thirty five gee X percent will assist a no loner fourteen hundred dollars that button thirty nine five plus scratching forty without the lower again them more proof there\nAre strong resell then they had a twenty sixteen case aged Seventy five utility a front wheel assist with a lower only a hundred and fifty hours I'm pro forty two thousand so again those prices were from southern New York so against fun to bounce around the country and see what's so spraying\nDifferent parts of the\nUsa yeah okay hey let's say over in that general area and and talk about a week they came out of all I Do\nI have to I saw the same too we are ... that you mentioned in your notes here Greg but a a heck of a leaner are forty to come by and he said he got his first ... made in this century\nYeah I loved it a plot or hunger Saturday\nChip and I saw the picture and then my ... and uh\nI retreated it because I think it resonates with you know such a actually a high percentage of folks out there that don't run the new equipment you know that's a big wide world out there not everyone runs the shiny big stuff [noise] so Mike there to pick up his first piece of equipment since the calendar flipped dissolves on um\n[noise] you know it's funny when we post pictures of that stuff tractors or combine stuff like that and good condition ship you know what the first comment usually is\n... ... people will say I liked the payment on that thing\nYeah you just brought that are forty to where they picked it up for it he doesn't have five years of big payments on it so I always makes me smile and and remember what my dad\nTold me about cars that looks like Sean what is the best a car\nAnd one that's paid for\nThe best car [laughter] yeah that's exactly right\nAnd what is the best a car\nAnd one that's paid for\nThe best car that's exactly right that's exactly right I dollars yeah two daughters got sick of me saying that but it turned it into their heads stuck it out but the least they'll think about it\nYeah yeah no I've always I always told my kids listen you know once you've got a car payment it's always gotta be hard to put money into bank [laughter] you you do your best to stay away from those payments no doubt about it so yeah you're on a piece of equipment like that of course you liked the payment plan\n[laughter] and if it gets the job done and we have the number of the owner combines I Know I had a\nCase like sixty forty came in the other day and really high price on it\nBut when they're nice you know you know dear tightened twenty something like that are ugly and there are forty two and you know they'll get the job done and they you know they just won't break the bank\nWell yeah and they always seem to get a lot of attention when there's a good piece of older equipment that's that is available boy they get the attention on those options\n[noise] yeah they do I remember a year ago chip I covered optional by Hastings, Minnesota ...\nAll the killing Minnesota had it as a to al ... tractors that I think they were there was a a Alice two hundred that's all for like forty thousand bucks but there was a combine on sale a lake\nNew and the six cars a series two or three but you just don't see them and it was like new and the chatter on the sale was amazing the people talking about you know the chance to buy a nice whatever that's the last like Thirty years old\nYet again it just doesn't gossip yeah doesn't cost so much a boy is worse into a balancing pretty well like you said\nIf it gets the job done and that uh we can't we can't a\nLoss of over that little piece of information to face there's got to be able to get

Ga is just too far off\nAnd uh and we're hearing the same thing really for most and in Illinois and Indiana so um yeah I don't think the u._s. Ga is is too far off in their estimates but you know it I take a look at the estimates\nAre for the trade guesses for this I'm a Thursday and they're all pretty high a corn ... and um yeah I think it's a difficult to um a B bearish or expect to bearish report when we're already getting such high estimates\nRight yeah\nThe one eighty one point three that we got from us ... corn yields last month you indicated that that may be in the ballpark are you liking that number\nYeah I like I mean we're actually at one point five of us the average trade guess right now is at one eighty one point eight hours slicing hairs you know I I don't think it really ... a bit of difference uh I I think the important thing chip is we need to understand some of the basics in this market right now I think we have a tendency to look at too many\nDetails and can't see the forest for the trees were worrying about reports like this because they just throw out a couple of rules of thumb you can markets always peek on bullish news they always bottom embarrassed news how much more bearish kind of be than what we've seen in the last two or three months this is how market\nBottoms are made in another old rule of thumb that I was taught forty years ago\nNever stores shore crop always store big crop so you know this is a market that we think it made major lows in September a yeah it could shop around here for a while\nThat you know we are today November soybeans closed at the highest price they've closed at since August Eighteenth that's\nUp trend you know I mean this market is trending higher and this is in the midst of all this bearish tariff news that's a huge story where the market's going up on very negative news and and I think you know that that type of action\nIs much more important than you know what this report is going to say on Thursday this this market's telling us it's done going down and we need to shift away from marketing strategies that have worked since the fall of two thousand twelve when being aggressive sellers work that's not what's going to work this year we don't think\nOkay I'll get into some strategy here with you in just a second now and and I get at the overall story here in in ... in particular is that the market is moving higher on negative news\nThe Rick how did how did it accomplished this how did it make this happen\nWell that the market is bullish on bearish from a specific price level\nI mean if you throw these same fundamentals at a market that is trading at ten dollars is going to be negative but we are throwing this at a market when the cash was already under eight dollars and so you you can't expect a bearish action wouldn't markets already discounted most you\nOnce news is known is no news at all and it's not the noon news that makes market prices move and so everybody knows that the battle on the terrorists everybody knows we've got a big crop coming so that tells you is built into the market so you know I Want to do something that everybody doesn't know I mean\nPeople are there are a lot of people I Know in the business\nThat are good bellwether that always get very when all the bears news comes out and and those people are really negative right now and they think the market needs to be sold you know here's another interesting statistic since Nineteen Seventy the cash marketing corn has made his annual high for the marketing year in October\nOne time soybeans have made their high in October one time since Nineteen Seventy corn was in Nineteen eighty seven and soybeans were in Nineteen\nSeventy four so you don't ever want to try and pick a top in corn and beans in the month of October history tells you you're going to lose Ninety nine percent of the time and so you know this is a market that you just\nYou know hopefully people haven't had the selling anything ah because the downside risk is minimal and the upside potential who knows what it is but that's not what I'm concerned about this point in time I I just don't want to have to sell anything\nThat you okay so\nYou said never uh never store a small crap always store big crop\nUh why why why\nWhy because at the top of the fact of the fall two thousand twelve beans or Seventeen bucks and corn was eight fifty yeah yeah there are a lot of people out there at the core is going to ten dollars what we found was we had a shortage of ... five dollar corn not eight fifty corn and so\nShort crops always peek just before during arrived for her was go back over history is happened every time\nAnd big crops always always bottom\nAround our harvests time because again the news is all known it's it's the unknown news that makes market moves the barest\nFundamentals as what's got us to where we are and so now we've got to start looking for because the only thing that can happen and these terrorist right now my opinion that will be good news is not bad news I mean you can't get worse than it is an instill overall exports\nComing commitments in corn are very strong Mexico's book more than they've ever book\nIn corn and soybeans were we obviously export a lot more of the crop uh you know we export and soybeans what is it a roughly fifty percent of the savings even though our our commitments to China are way way down our commitments to quote unquote unknown\nOr are up sharply and so that means that they have to buy or coming from somewhere and you know it could well be they're being put on ships to other destinations in the ... being changed see 'em you know who knows but I mean they're getting the beans and and I think this is remarkable on the market and assuming meal market\nIs as high as it is right now or in light of all this negative news and I think that is the key point here\nUh okay so let's talk strategy what ... what do you do\nAt at this time of year with with knowing what you do on your and your\nYou know it sounds like a conviction that you think this corn and soybean market is going to be working to the ...\nYeah I mean from a seller's point of view this is something I mean we don't want to do anything we want to be buying cash corn and we want to be buying soybean meal for for livestock feeders okay ah the last\nThe last good opportunity we had was in a Memorial Day and we went to eighty per cent price on soybeans the day after Memorial Day weekend well that was goes over ten dollars we did a thirty percent of cash contracts and fifty percent of Hedges the market class we came out of the Hedges and so now we're just sitting\nIn a soybean market with thirty percent are sold in the cash market in no Hedges on it and you know frankly chip I think we'll be sitting there come January\nAh I don't believe anything is going to happen extremely explosive between now and then you're probably looking at the next good selling opportunity in the springtime in of history repeats itself you won't get the absolute top and corn and beans until late in the summer\nYou know you you talked earlier in the show about um you know the announcement um that Trump would be making a Fifteen Percent ethanol blend Afghan\nIndustry needs that announcement uh\nI'm In a major way but still that's not going to increase\nWe'll be making a Fifteen Percent ethanol blend the industry needs that announcement uh I'm In a major way but still that's not going to increase the ethanol demand until\nThe summer of two thousand Nineteen this is not going to have an immediate impact on on on ethanol and ethanol exports to Brazil this year are uh I think the worst they've been in in many years\nUm don't I don't know if it's quite that bad but they're off sharply and so you know our demand side on the up and all is not good but you know I don't think China will ever by our corn\nOr to fuel their ethanol plants that they said they're going to build that they haven't yet uh but I think there will buy ethanol from us they made by uh\nUh other um um feedstocks from someone else but you know I think everything is we've got right now in China huge pent up demand and they don't have the products\nTo satisfy that demand and so we're building the\nBase for that you look back in history cheap prices result and increase usage of almost anything and you don't know where it's going but all of a sudden it's like magic or a corner usage goes up or sleeping usage goes a meal usage goes up and\nIn the next thing you know the balance sheet smack in the water it takes some time to work those numbers out at a bottom but you know you just you ask yourself basic questions I mean are we trading\nOr an expected price range from next twelve months are we in the top one third bottom with third or middle one third well I'll bet heavily were in the bottom one third right now and so I Want to be a buyer\nWill be a seller of of anything\nCool very cool All right we are talking with Richard Brock rocket associates in the rock record when we come back\nWe've covered a lot already on what the ... wants to do as far as marketing goes on the grain market but\nLet's talk about the counter seasonal rally at a wreck because boy that that's an opportunity right there as well we're talking with\nHere on a TV [noise]\nControl your destiny and challenging dairy industry and farm journal media's milk business conference November fifth through the seven in Las Vegas [noise]\nIt's only from a profit perspective I I'm not looking at that from a trend perspective a unlike hogs we're looking at that purely from a profit perspective and um you know the cattle market can take\nProfits away from you very very quickly and when it turns it does so broke loose so in a sharp rally like this and you know our philosophy is to sell a little bit as the market's going up\nGotcha gotcha okay um you know going back to some of the comments that you made in a in the first segment wreck\nYou you you made a comment that what we don't know it the obviously the market is already factored in everything that that we're talking about today but what we don't know about the terrorists is when we might actually see some progress made\nIn the trade talks whatever kind of talks you really want to call them with China\nIf we do see some progress made there Rick ... what kind of a market reaction would Julie stacked\nCorn soybeans and the meat markets what kind of reaction would you expect\nWell the reaction of corn should be mute because they're trying to doesn't buy or corn or I think it would be very positive in the so it'd be market\nI I mean you could just see the slavery market a catapulted the upside you know in ... some people it seems crazy when you know we could be looking at a carry over supply this year uh um you know just under nine hundred million bushels an astronomical number but again that's a number this known okay we already know that we have\nMore beans and we know what to do it so I think it can be very positive they're a and I think and the hog side though I think we're discounted a lot of potential bullish news certainly wouldn't be negative but I I'm not sure it's going to be a real positive either I mean the real reaction is going to be the swimming complex\nYeah yeah no question about it there are another comment that you made in in the last segment was we splitting the hairs are splitting hairs when we're talking about corn yields what if we would and job\nUSDA's at one eighty one point three what if we would end up\nSouth to one Seventy eight what that have an impact\nIn it at fifty cents for the price of course\nThree what if we would end up\nSouth to one Seventy eight would that have an impact\nYou know it at fifty cents for the price of corn won't ever ever think it would be very very positive because I think this markets or discount that one eighty one to when they need to hurry up\nAnd so any surprises there are going to be on the bowler side you know what if it comes in at one eighty six and then we got problems okay yeah and I I just do look for that big of a swing I don't look for\nA I don't look for the soybeans to come in at fifty three really maybe they could who wants to come into fifty five well then that's going to be a market shock if so a meal comes at a fifty five or I mean\nYou can't plan for something that an expected um you know you just have to make a decision at the time that kind of news comes out so right now this time of year you look for something that's fairly normal uh and I do think though that for those soybeans at least that are in the\nIn the field we've we've uh we've had some losses here we're going to have some losses and caught and ah I mean this hurricane is coming and I'm In\nOur office right now in Destin, Florida and uh they either hurricane supposed to hit us here on Wednesday and so Im everybody's going crazy down here trying to get when they go on I just decided to leave it in Islam or\nFortunately had a speech in St Louis or Wednesday morning so relieved tomorrow you know that\nIt's going to cause some problems in the Georgia cotton crop and I'm a I think most of beans route but a lot of the cotton is still in the field and so that showed up to date and the cotton market as well and so there you know they're still weather related issues I think that can impact is marketing\nYeah yeah I I I I think you're right there are no question about it uh I got to ask you this are you still long diverse\nOh isn't that great I mean I have a lot of St Louis fans listening this I'll ... I'll give them a year full of that the next two days instead of a ... anybody has got to love the team that is one of the Lebanon in a row a no matter who they are I think and uh these these this team has been tremendous to watch\nYet no question no question you'd say ... I mean they've got all the pieces this year don't they\nThey have they've got a ... and our managers doing one of the smartest things I've seen managers do no matter how good a pitcher's\nPitching after five innings he's pulled and you know don't wait for the pitcher to get in trouble\nAnd get one or two runs in pull them at the five aunts and we've got a deep bullpen and like last night they went through five pictures a ... of the built in and do you let them pitched one good inning and then you put somebody else in and you know and it keeps your book and fresher\nAnd it's really worked well for him and you just hope that everybody in the bullpen a stays a healthy and of course we've got some pretty good ...\nWell yeah there's no question about that and your defense it it seems like\nIt seems like all the pieces are are there and a and an operating as they should right now for the birds and counsel you're exactly right councils doing a bang up job Rick I enjoyed the conversation good luck to you and good luck to the birds and and we'll talk again soon\nRight chip I'm always going to be in the program next\nGood deal good deal that is Richard ... associates and the Brock report okay\nSo this cattle market we talked about it already Rick starting put some Hedges on and the cat also some day we're right up against that level that carry our tax has been watching for quite a while was she got on his mind next for cattle will cover it and that\nNews talk W.

I'm physically across them off as I\nAs I say than to at one in four and just for me\nWhat an incredible disappointment\nWhat a remarkable let down and I know that ... and you know the defense was going to struggle\nAnd not play well they are\nInjury riddled but to go in there and just get destroyed against the Pittsburgh team that as talented enough to get rolling but dysfunctional enough that he could play better football or even moderately closed football\nThey become a part of the seams is such a disappointment it feels like Atlanta season is over I was willing to be quote unquote bowl last week and say fine\nMaybe Pittsburgh going to turn it around one of ... a big hole in the last ten years of the teams that have gone on for\nIt doesn't feel like Atlanta is going to be among that one percent\nInjuries are brutal\nUh is going to be among that one percent\nInjuries are brutal\nAnd now they've got a schedule in Tampa Bay the giants teams you can be but\nUm don't believe in the football team I just am ... and Dan Quinn who I really like and I've told this story\nAfter the super bowl where they lost the patriots and and as we all know heartbreaking fashion I watched that guy go to the podium\nClearly with a heavy heart and just conduct comes up a lot of class and I just thought of the things he said the messages into his teammates and not assigning blame was it was ... and not assigning blame the couch and Alice classy I like to I don't know the guy that I one of those moments where\nTo experience relief or muscle cramps in your legs and feed used their works relieve\nThis non greasy film it's proven to relieve muscle cramps fast and reduce muscle ... stare works relief can also prevent muscle cramps before they start so you can get a\nFull night's sleep without having to worry about muscle cramps Sarah works relief only takes minutes to apply absorbs quickly and it works there works relief as a life changing product and you don't even need a prescription get their works relief today and the pain relief file at Walmart CBS Rite Aid in Walgreens pharmacies or their works relief dot com\nCommunity theater in northeast community college present scale madness in October methods do Thirteen system than touching story that you didn't\nHave that when the title fair and delicate as ... but ... small accent but Jared deep strengths and support each other just like event performances this week our Thursday Friday and Saturday at seven thirty at nor the community college ...

hundred market below that you still think\nHave a season that they will salvage eight five five to one to four CBS is the phone number teams like the bills the eagles falcons the Packers used in Lyons Dallas temp kind of that race that five hundred and below ranch eight five five to one to four CBS I Love this Bible Ohio where my wife is from Laurie from Lima, Ohio\nGoing to be there I think this fall a little a holiday time Steven lineup thanks for less than a man you're on a CBS Sports radio\nBrother\nAll American girl Lyme along good now may Giovanni killed me I Want to see it\n[laughter] that I really I really can't do that\nGiovanni killed me I Want to hear [laughter] hey I I really I really think\nAbout what we'll do what they call you back in the playoffs seeing from last year\nOr already this year so you know they were at I think it all off\nI don't hate that man I Can't I\nYou that would have been crazy talk a couple of weeks ago but they didn't like it has beat the Vikings they destroyed that football team in Minnesota\nIn Minneapolis in the brand new stadium that looks like a Viking ship from a distance is pretty cool by the way\nAnd they beat a titans team that I think I think the titans are ... there was this great I think there are really good football team and I think my ... is going to over time be a great head coach in the NFL you know Josh Allen's interesting 'cause he's so athletic\nAnd if you look at his base numbers is to touch down to five interception does not set in the world on fire but he's got I think three rushing touchdowns ... now and I know we have one over the weekend\nThere was an athleticism there and and obviously it's about what you do in the hole\nAnd so you add those three I think it's three to five and five and more to the point you get those victories case keen observers are not very good not going to recite them too because I like case he's been on the show kingdoms numbers aren't very good but case him let his football team to two consecutive\nGame winning drives and then he did the same thing for Denver against the cheese if memory serves in the homes just won't often no you know and and then he had the ball back and he couldn't get there but there was a drop in that situation and one of his teammates decide to do a lateral instead of giving them they were right on the cost of a spike the ball\nBut Keenan let down the field so my point about the John ... is is it's not just the numbers of the state as if you watch the games most you do with the teams that you love\nThere are some guys are just look good or getting a dome of the time comes and Josh Allen's been that guy times so as much as I Am not a believer in in the bills the way that I Am the lions are interesting to me all of a sudden I mean the Packers the Packers\nProbably not going to go Houston the eagles are good I don't know the bills that level I could be wrong a five five two on two for CBS Josh I'm Pennsylvania what's going on man you're on CBS Sports radio\nPretty good I just wanted to see what you saw the browns the rest of the year their defense been really good I think it bigger Mayfield doesn't make any mistakes of the stuff I think they could go ... five hundred this year\nI I agree man and the browns I mean the brown sugar beat in Pittsburgh and weak one that's a field goal situation slash and I liked I like is a guy tried Taylor but\nHe was not very good when he was a starting quarterback for the browns and I think\nI think beggars been really good I I think there's a and I said this earlier of confidence\nI I Do I I'm with you I think that's a good football team they have a quarterback who's not afraid and under Gregg Williams the coordinator of defense is pretty impressive now they almost lost that game 'cause Gregg Williams is really aggressive and\nWhen he was going to be a little bit better about mixing things up you can't have a bubble screen beach every single time in a high level situation because the opposing\nTeam knows the Greg let me just sending everybody thought Gregg Williams is a very good coordinator\nChargers are going to be a tough game of that games in Cleveland\nBoxer team you can be in Pittsburgh is a tough game your host the cheese you hosts the falcons you'd go to Cincinnati that's the schedule for the rounds going forward\nSo we're going to see whether or not the team that a lot of browns fans would argue should be fine you know really is that football team especially on the bakers in or whether they're not and the record they have is a record they should have all said is too\nAnd I know I'm a huge ... I'm not even have have you ...\nI don't hate him I just don't think you should be the head coach you got to head coach who's throwing his own sense of coordinator under the bus during the game with his body language and what he's doing you got a problem\nBecause it was a bad political\nToward the overtime the end of that game taught him the coordinator in Cleveland\nRandom trick play it was stupid\nHe ran a reverse was John\n... Jackson's on this field ... field shaking his head like you more on\nYou can't have that in your head coach that the guy who's so worried about taught Haley taken a job and the impressions of who's in charge those things they really they speak to something beneath the surface\nIn terms of a lack of communication and guys were ruined the same direction they Pittsburgh right Cleveland needs to have no dysfunction to overcome the fact they're not as talented as the Steelers few teams are\nA five to one to four CBS Stewart who's your team on this list or do you want to go raiders of team I didn't but I don't ...\nI I Am not going raiders I go to the eagles there are two and three they've only been out score by one point they've lost a bunch of close games I think it was by a bus by six built into Vikings by two so they've lost a bunch of close games I Know DEA jai injury hurts but I still think they can make a run in that division\nArts to going eagles\nNot raiders\nI'm proud of you to her I really am trace you can go colds who said\nI Will not go cultivated that I'm I'm I'm going to double down here I still think the Texans on this list have the most telling him any team may be beside the eagles but I think they're close on terms of talent will throughout the whole team and the division and individually ... is open and just I'm a little comes from a villa Brian's Play calling an approach that does scare me but\nI still have hope that they can turn it around you right in the easy division and get things going in the right direction I\nThink about this Houston right now is a game back\nAgain back to both the titans and the jags and I think the jags are really good football team\nBut there again back and they want a couple in a row I'm with you on Houston I use them I'm avoiding it because I've been below ... for like three years I build Brian's great everyone's wrong and this year just like crickets rather head writer has O'Brian crickets candidates or some of the raiders and said make from the Caribbean but we'll see we'll see what they're about\n\nYou're listening to the new CBS Sports radio\nGoing on the run or whether you're on the show a five five to one to\nFour CBS is the phone number going to go to one of my favorite people into businessman I Hope you're falling on Twitter at B. Campbell CBS combat sports writer for CBS Sports podcast do are extraordinary and again you can see on CBS Portage Jew and read and CBS board dot com\nWho was at us to to to nine Brian Campbell what's up buddy\nMy man thanks for having me back on and you you said a lot of things about this guy this was also a guy who was dead wrong about this fight despite all the craziness we're going to talk about a second bill shot out that it'll beep I was way off man\nThis is a tough one to call and I actually was going to get I was really mad at myself\nI was going to get a hundred dollars down on McGregor on the fourth and it's one of those beds and I was glad I didn't make right with your brother ... it was a hard one I was I was at home I was in Vegas hanging out and you came back parents were in town wants to fire with my dad was not a big USC guy was super into it\nWhat was your 'cause I don't mind what was your reaction when you saw McGregor tap out and the reality was ... just one via submission against Conor McGregor\nYou know it maybe could have been in that spot this whole idea of like wow this guy's not a magician this guy's a human being and it's not that we hadn't seen kind of McGregor lose before right I I was Kate side when he lost the nay Diaz ringside we lost a Floyd Mayweather\nBut I guess there's some justification than those losses to a certain degree with the different sports different weight classes this certainly\nThe initial feeling was wow you know I I Believe too much in the in the ... of Conor McGregor that there really was this magic in him that could carry him to the next level against anybody but that feeling though was quickly overwhelmed by just how\nCan I say damn on this show just how\nDamaging restive Habib ...\nWas and that everything he said he was going to do a you know then I'm going to smash year boy he did he controlled that fight bill not just for wrestling standpoint like we all thought could and would happen if this fight when you know three four rounds\nBut that third round when he stood up and went toe to toe with Connor and at worst\nFought on an even level in terms of boxing in the stand up and drops Connor around to what that overhead right that showed me that he didn't just dominate this fight against in the lead guy against a guy who had built a resume already as one of the best in history\nBut he broke and mentally like he absolutely dominated and he's the ... I Know it's a messy situation now we're going to talk suspensions and arrested all that stuff but he'll be even among them at off as the best fighter in the world\nFrank Campbell here on the show and as you reference Brian after the victory instead of staying in the octagon enjoying the moment that he had made his own against Conor McGregor as most of us know Habib jumped the cage and went into the crowd and some of the guys from his camp\nCame into the octagon and one sucker punch Conor McGregor let's just start ear I sat up in my ... on my couch and said a word that on my damn we cannot say here on CBS portrayals writer than you you were there you were in the ... what was your reaction as it unfolded around you\nAre my reaction at first was sort of sadness for hobby that\nThat he took this too far now I'm going to give you another argument in a minute that that it may have been justified right but in that moment\nWhen a when a guy will goes from being a sportsman to\nReally taking the promotion side of it too far and making it real I felt bad for him that he stole the narrative of his own moment and like I said the columns we all would have written would have been this guy might be the best fighter in the world who's going to beat this guy and he took that away from himself\nBy allowing you know this sort of may have to happen but bill that feeling escalated quickly into its outright fear and I'm going to be honest I had a seat one on media row right next to the cage for pointing right at that cage door where it all went down and there was a good\nTwenty to thirty seconds there where you're wondering if it's going to go in that direction of the of the palace brawl or of the Riddick Bowe Andrews a lot of boxing brawl in Nineteen Ninety six that we all watch on HBO back in the day where\nFans from both ... both countries you know both\nBoth fan bases of the fighters or just brawling and the crowd we got pretty close to that on the floor in fact a member of their monumental extended team was tackled by four police officers on my laptop\nRight after the fight at the table got pushed back I'm watching as people from both and bases are jumping the fence and getting into the middle\n... jumping the barriers or you know of the crowd and getting into the mayhem and you did have a couple of moments they're not just where you are fearing for your own safety but honestly you're fearing for the sport and this was sort of take I had after kind of McGregor is April attack and how he really wasn't punished by the U. S. C. for this\nYou're setting a dangerous precedent when you're allowing yourself to get that close to the fire because once you get burned it takes a long time to fix those problems once boxing had that Riddick Bowe and drink a lot of ... followed by the Tyson Holyfield brawl the following year with the air by\nAnd the crowd fighting each other and it wasn't on\nNow nobody ... Nebraska leaves the year until seven o'clock tomorrow morning gave you within twenty five miles north of Nebraska programming continues on translator came to nine zero eighty and one of my\nPoint nine of them say that they've gotten this far that they've just\nTwenty five miles north of Iraq a program we continue on translator came to know your easy and one of my point nine of them\nSay that they've gotten this far that they just signed a major deal with ESPN they could have lost it in one night bill\nIs your laptop okay that doesn't mean laptop made it ...\nIt took you know it took a bump there but those are the there are moments that you can't take back we are pretty close in April we got pretty close on Saturday because we didn't cross that line you if she's going to be able to cash in on this but I don't want to see the sport become that\nCame over here on the show Brian you said you referenced that there was a counter argument that you were aware of that you would be able to make for why would you be did perhaps made some sense that all the words in your mouth ... what is a counter argument\nYeah here they look the outrage people had right when that happened was you rented all over social media was that you know it'd be nice to be suspended he needs to be fired he needs to be stripped of the title he needs to be put in jail you saw pretty much the full gamut of that\nBut look this was unfortunately a culture the last six months that Dina white in the U. S. C. willingly brought on\nBy sort of allowing the sensationalizing of what happened in April with the bus attack and caught him McGregor jumping on a plane showing up in Brooklyn that you'll see two twenty three and attacking us not just filled with a B but you know with a centrally his coworkers this was a felony assault on his co workers\nThat his own employers did not punish them for and that was a very controversial decision we know Connor took a plea bargain to avoid\nA devoid jail time to avoid being deported but there was no slap on the wrist for this so by doing that and then publicizing this and then allowing every press conference on the buildup which by the way it was very entertaining\nBut by allowing it to go over that line allowing ... to insult this man's religion his family his political connections on and on\nAnd not maybe understanding the cultural differences of of being the monumental comes from of the kind of people\nThe pride that they have knowing that it's a very dangerous move to go into that area right there are certain salesman that can do that like a kind of McGregor and maybe not mean it fully 'cause they know they're selling it said it'll be this maybe it wasn't a game right\nSo to make it about that you're getting close to that fire like I talked about while I'm not here by any means to justify a big new rocket metal behavior which really was a black eyes to the sport\nDo I understand it might surprise by it absolutely not because this is a direction USC decided to go for the money and\nYou only have to go back to recent history bill odd was uh twenty ten when you have to find a Paul Daly jumped to jump the fighter that had just beat them ... just costs check the fight knocked him out in the cage he was fired on the spot that's the type of actions day in the way it used to do to make sure stuff like this doesn't happen by allowing counter to get away with it in April\nYou open the door for this type of activity to happen\nAnd there was a moment watching the find you've probably read watched it again and again so tell me if I just my journal and got away from me where\nWhen Connor basically gave his back\nUp to be even became clear it was going to happen after he tapped out and looked to me like it'd be wasn't shopping was that whole with his arm around his neck and you could sort of see\nThe rage do you think there is a ... year there's going to be do you think could be going to be able to be on better behavior when it's over come what may in part to\nYou would hope so you would hope at this point that a beep does understand\nReally the the the gravity of what he did and what could have happened from it you would hope that he's as much professional as he has been pretty much his whole career a man of honor men about respect you hope so I I think he will be fine I think you'll see understands that can still cash in on this he's going to have to face some type of discipline because\nThe ... the differences and these two situations is that what kind of McGregor did I I I guess you could say was out of competition it happened outside the arena and the loading docks in Brooklyn in April\nBut what her big democracy off did on Saturday was front and center on a pay per view broadcast in in the middle of Las Vegas and one thing we've learned about Nevada state athletic commission same commissioned by the way in twenty twelve that allowed Floyd Mayweather to de lay his own pending jail sentence\nSo he could fight in the ghetto kowtow so he could bring money into the city", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Norfolk", "day": "08"}
