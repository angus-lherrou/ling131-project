they have a double a running back to school\nAnd the difference is you're looking up every game would definitely buying without a heartbeat you never count breeds out because he's going to\nBasically kill you if you do so\nI I'm with you that I'm starting to I'm starting to be a big time believer\nI'm trying to remember didn't lose the Tampa Bay in week one we all were just like oh man that's I mean the the typical over reaction in the NFL early on its why and I'm not saying the eagles are going to win the super bowl but I'm just not ready to ride that particular team off\nJust yet at two and three\nIt's still relatively early the the pictures getting clear it's getting clear but it's still relatively early and it certainly was after week one that was also if his magic before it became

insurance\nYou know we're talking also buy or sell about Jason Garrett\nAnd whether or not he's going to make it whether or not he is going to survive\nAnd I just because it makes me laugh I Want to or\nI Want to circle back a little bit to this notion of Jerry Jones somehow criticizing Jason Garrett for not being courageous enough to go for it on for one and he should have gone for the fourth one\nIt's obvious it's over time it's time to play for the win but when you as a boss as someone with power over someone else\nWhen you don't trust them when you don't empower them well you don't create a culture where those people who worked for you believe that they are able to fail ... it's very hard to be successful in this world if you live in constant fear of failure\nTaking chances trying to think outside the box bean bowl mean go for a fourth one is the definition of being willing to fail\nIf you failed to convert you're going to turn the ball over going to give your opponent pretty good feel but this was a chance to go for the win that kind of bold and this matters Jerry Jones does not hire people who are all\nHe does retain people who are bold Jerry Jones looks foreign promote people who are\nGoing to lead Jerry Jones be as the song said at the beginning of the segment demand that the jury wants to be\nAnd of course in some combination of he hired a guy who he thought he could have some control over and\nHe probably has cultivated a culture where Jason Garrett has taught himself the muscle memory of sick of it and see and living in fear of Jerry eight five five to one to four CBS I Love that would you buy or sell then you call and you tell us that are going to buy are going to sell Terry Nevada wants to do it scary\nAs it relates Jason Garrett you're asking me a sports radio you buy or sell in\nOh so on on your man I've been\nI've been a fan for the cowboys since I was five years old this guy is horrible eight years she's had to play off for having done anything with them sell sell sell getting the hell out of\n... totally with you and the thing is normally\nIf a guy at any of these jobs there's not many NFL jobs in the world got fired we would immediately go to who is the right candidate who's the guy who want to get and you always think about just who's the best coaching candidate\nFormer head coach with some experiences on the market rising coordinator it's different in Dallas Dallas ... you got to hire a guy that Jerry is it going to feel threatened by who can also be successful that's really hard to do\nCan you imagine it and I would not for this guy job for Thirty years I was an NFL team after what he pulled\nCan you imagine Josh McDaniel coaching the cowboys owner Jerry Jones you get a reverse karma situation first McCain has agreed to deal with the cold and then no shows even though is the citizens were hired under contract then he'll sign a contract and Jared firemen weekend\n... what do you mean uh I don't get to make all the decisions I'm Jerry Jones be absolutely remarkable absolutely amazed I Would love everything about eight five five two and two for CBS Stewart trays or the\nOr the hot candidates out there right now it's probably a little early to figure out like who some coordinators in off the rams probably would have if you actually not really because the ... defensive coordinators the former head coach in Dallas and Sean McVeigh isn't is it got calls the plays for the hot head coach names out there\nI was saying to trace before it's funny because before this year crude and was always that guy was always that candidate that everyone's like oh they should hire him and now look where he is\nMaking a hundred million dollars running his organization into the ground I mean the other thing was I I Wonder if you almost have your Jerry Jones you're going to fire Jason Garrett if you just go interim and wait for other coaches to be fired and see us some guys with some experience\nJerry Jones you're going to fire Jason Garrett easy just go interim and wait for other coaches to be fired and see us some guys with some experience go down I Know people aren't clamoring for below Brian I still think in the right situation you can be a pretty good head coach trades you got a buddy of mine\nWell I Know John ... used to be the quarterbacks coach with the eagles last year I think he's off its corner now for the Vikings so he's got a promotion I think I'm sure once the end of the year comes around and black Monday comes I think maybe some coaches you know he can be one of those ... kind of the next McVeigh some teams could try to go after\nAfter pretty good one and and I've heard so many guys who want those job say there is a finite number of head coach in jobs and the national football league\nAnd you can't turn 'em down\nBut just like being a quarterback if you go to the wrong organization you're going to fail on for years that the browns or the perfect example that Jason Garrett was a highly highly regarded\nHead coach candidate when he got the job and he was the guy and waiting but when he got the actual gig with Dallas and it's under its it hasn't worked out for I think Dallas is where you go to ... head coach eight\nThe bright kill me ... weekdays for Nigel\n[noise]\nWill come back to writer than you on CBS Sports radio\nOn this Tuesday thank you for hanging out\nThey were spending time with us you could always\nOn the phone lines eight five five to one to\nFour CBS is the phone number eight five five to one to four CBS or\nHit me up on Twitter sports writers Ford's\nAri IT are the guys are on there to the trace Ryan Hickey Ryan underscore Hickey and the number three hence the nickname and sewer Kovacs the executive producer of this program on Twitter at Stewart Kovacs\nGo back and forth on on the old Twitter machine\nAlthough I Do like enjoy and appreciate the ability to connect with you to talk to you on Twitter that that's really the only thing I I I use it for I\nThat's not true I also use it as sort of a news aggregation source I can pick the things that I Want to fall like oh there's a trade sending out notes of Penn State and Notre Dame of the same time that's a very natural like peanut butter and jelly that's a very natural natural fit\nBut I'm not into like I used to be maybe I should be\nAgain a five to one to four CBS the phone number about\nThirty minutes from now\nWe're going to visit with Brian ... longtime former NFL coach now in NFL Network\nAnalyst will get his perspective on all the things going on around the NFL the rise of Patrick ... homes and whether or not 'cause we just talk about this he believes\nThat are on St or one of the best teams in football and they're obviously a very very good but are they in that class of the top one or two or three teams in the sport and those things tend to merge and revealed themselves as time goes on I'm always going to put the patriots there\nI'm a grandfather them in every single year and I don't think it's going to happen the pages could have gone to one and three and I will be like no patriots\nRight of the new power rankings there\nThe patriots could very well lose against achieves this week and I\nJust such an I think this weekend's game would say if Kansas City wins would say a lot more about the chiefs than it would say about new ... I'm not worried about New England and Edelman back Gordon's in the mix Edelman was an important part of the Brady off as this past weekend thirty\nSecond straight week that New England score thirty eight points first week obviously joined them and back Gordon caught a touchdown pass\nNow there's going to take time already forever to figure out how that's gonna work but that's a vast improvement to that often very very quickly\nI think I think new English will be just fine some of the other teams that are kind of interesting as we try to assess them our teams like the saints our teams like Carolina\nLike the Panthers or the bears legitimate you do you buy and believe in Mitchell Trybulski at a level that you think that as a team that is among the cream of the crop\nIn the national football league you've got an energies division that is really ugly so far is it Washington is a Dallas is filling the giants season seems to be over\nYou've got an NFC division that is really ugly so far is it Washington is a Dallas is filling the giant season seems to be over I still like the jags a lot and they need let her for that back\nIn ... is what we thought he was\nStruck the titans too and the titans at a a let down game this past weekend but I'm a big cable guy I really am eight five five to one to for CBS to go to Green Bay Brandon thanks for less than a brother you're on CBS Sports radio\nI think a curious as to your thought on the uh the current that as a Green Bay organization sure I'm personally I'm I think McCarthy has gotten pretty sale you often in general the sale um but I don't think it's just the here um you know every time that the Packers other back again wall\nRogers just kind of you know put that going on in the back and the problem's gonna go way although in light of the\nUm had coaching conversation I was curious as to than on McCarthy\nYeah I think with ... departure Brandon thanks to the coal\nNot of his own choosing longtime GM there's no doubt that Mike mccarthy is on the hot seat and Aaron Rodgers has not made that seat any cooler by some of the comments when Mike mccarthy not with the G I Know that the current GM was in the mix but not with the GM that hired him\nWhen Mike mccarthy has has has come out and say no no it's all good our relationship with their quarterback is is just fine then there's a problem\nAnd paradise I think my car there's very much on the hot seat in and this is an unfair\nThis is an unfair\nSituation but\nCan you imagine if Sean McVeigh were the head coach of the Green Bay Packers no he's not going to be honest not going to be part of the deal but I think there might be something to the notion that McCarthy is Dale ... the only thing I was injured defense of Mike mccarthy all say two things in the defense of Mike mccarthy one he was the guy\nThat navigate and I know all's forgiven now in Green Bay with Brett Farr as well she'll be far was incredible\nPart as likeable guy but that Britain is that engineers that chip on his shoulders and made for one of the best of all time also made them are really unpleasant person at the end of his career in Green Bay as we all know that was really really tough spot a really tough spot\nFor Aaron Rodgers to being as a young unproven guy and Mike mccarthy was the sherpa that kinda guided Rogers from that difficult situation with a lot of land mines success that you buy some time\nHe obviously has a double that by some time but the other thing I think maybe more\nRelevant to what's going on in two thousand Eighteen is that Ted Thompson's approach was never very successful I said a lot that I think that Rogers were did give his greatness and talent allowed a lot of mediocrity and I think it's a kind interpretation\nTo be judges excellence and it took awhile protest Thompson to get caught and get gone because he is not be able to put her rushed around Rogers is even remotely impressive\nAnd so what I don't know about McCarthy and I think what we are trying to figure out is McCarthy one of the guys who's mediocrity was misinterpreted for a long time for excellence because we're in Rogers\nOr was McCarthy an equal victim\nTo Chet Thompson not being a very good GM and not giving him as the head coach the tools that indeed I I don't know I don't know the answer\nIt it's a tough call and I'm bears fan so I I'm I'm all about\nTurning my own dysfunction in in Green Bay I just think that it's going to be one of those situations where McCarthy is going to be judged on this year regardless of what he has regardless of an injury strike that team regardless of how banged up Aaron Rodgers is this is it\nHis seat is and should be hot there was also always politics\nAnd when the new GM comes in and I know that new GM is not an outsider he was groomed he was raised in the Packers organization but when the new boss comes in and sometimes our new boss gets elevated you'd be surprised how much they want the wrong guy their own person their own vibe\nWe'll see what happens in Green Bay Wisconsin\nNow on like the cowboys job where\nIf and when and I think it's when Jason Garrett\nLoses his position as the head coach where's that's a terrible I mean it's a job and the ... goes up but it's not a very good job\nI think that Green Bay job as a great job and you have the best quarterback from the national football league you have maybe the most talented quarterback in the history of the national football league and so that's the other\nInteresting thing if you're Green Bay\nIf you can I can if you can identify that genius head coach that\nGenius next level not stale but forward thinking and innovative and entrepreneurial coaching mind it you can find a showing McVeigh if you can find a matinee Aggie\nIf you can find somebody who can take a mature forbid ski or juror golf no offense even those guys and find their best burdens themselves on magic and if you if you put them in Green Bay Wisconsin but yet to be able to identify that person got to be able to go out and get the right guy eight five five to one to for CBS and the phone number\nEight five five to one to four CBS is the phone number we segment

Pacific\nNumber Thursday Night Football continues this week was eagles giants on Fox NFL network and Amazon Prime coach\nThanks so much her for making some time for us\nTo do it\nWe're just talking throughout the course of the show about the remarkable accomplishment Drew Brees pulled off last night and not just the old time passing leader mark but a number of\nRecords he has said over the course of his career we've seen a lot of great to be the last ten Fifteen Twenty years coach where does Drew Brees rank among those guys\nWell I Hope I'll look we are to be at an age where we have\nSo many modified hall of famers and of course should be raised is going to be a first ballot hall of famer when the time comes\nOr there's Tom Brady whether it's Aaron rather than raw fish will distribute Drew Brees\nUm and and we've got a great group for young or actually it was going to come to step into the void on those guys move on but drew praise wants all said and done you know there'll be a lot of people talk about the greatest quarterback govern how do you judge that well whatever your mate for kids ... the top of most of those numbers and and the least so\nHe's been spectacular I guess the thing that job or you can post\nIt with a guy that you're in you're out I Can't remember a mother or about it's been called upon to be six hundred six hundred and fifty throw your guy meaning you throw in that scene on back right from the get go every now this year they've got a little bit more balanced and then they're playing really well\nBut Drew Brees six hundred plus throat guy every year and they have the\nExcept that he's had it's a it's just uh I I don't know that we'll see it again\nTry bill here on the show go St ... with the win last night go to foreign one in a really interesting and see where do you know earlier in the season but where do you place them right now in the pecking order the national football league\nWell everybody I think you recognize you know ... there's two right now the dominant teams\nIn both Kansas City in the Los Angeles rams are the rams maybe the most dominant league right now because the balance of off the fence but one of the ball that throw the ball effectively\nA an Indiana see you have a bunch of other good team that all are playing really well but all have also had moments where it's like ... ... you know where that comes from how did they lose that game that have shown some vulnerabilities are and so certainly the saints and what they're doing all ... they're as good as anybody in the league now defensively they\nDon't appear to be quite quite as well as they did last year that they can't get better\nOff and and they're going to be in the thick of this and not least of which in a battle in their own division with the Carolina Panthers\nSuper Bowl champion Brian building here on the show coach your reference to the two best teams in football the rams and the chiefs let's start with\nPatrick my homes it just feels like every week there's a bigger challenge in front of him and every week he matches ... said what has been your perception so far more homes what he's done and what it means for him over the course of what hope will be a long career\nWell you know I ... the key with him that but I I obviously he's a great athlete and you can do some things outside of the ... which that that's the key salt in the Denver game you got to keep them in the pocket\nOr if you let him outside I mean you're you're just you got no chance but even within the pocket he can do some damage you have a to me what jumps out is very very accurate they are the things the entire field is kind of a lightning quick release Marino at high release\nThat that's all he wants his phone it comes out of his hands ...\nUh and and you know obviously came out of the the gates just burning\nA can keep that up and say uh last couple of games kind of come back down to earth but obviously continue to play well put thirty points up on that jaguar defenseless substantial ah and then obviously the big game next couple of weeks with patriots the Bengal or you know we're going to find out just how real they our\nCoach who came up as an offensive coordinator when you look at what Andy Reid and his staff has done with Patrick moms\nHave they changed anything that has made him so efficient so effective I Know he had the two interceptions\nThis past weekend against the tub jaguars defense but in the homes of the gunslinger in college and he has been really impressive at protecting the football so far over the course of his young career is there anything just from an excellent those perspective that they've done in Kansas City to maximize his excellence and minimize whatever struggles young quarterbacks tend to have\nQuality of wraps assistant round that fits in very well and he has always been very inventive are probably more so than any the coach and Liz has picked up some of the ah the college principal\nAnd not fully I mean he is not like he's running to read option all the time and they don't want to expose the hit but the idea of getting the ball out of your hand quickly he's got some excellent talent to go through August with a calcium and health uh and then ... out of the backfield so\nUm you know he's got the weapons go with it and they're spreading it around and and letting him utilize that athleticism but there's both in and outside the box\nWhat do you expect from this cheese patriots game when Kansas City goes up to New England this uh\nThe hint utilize that ... both in and outside the box\nWhat do you expect from this cheese patriots game when Kansas City goes up to New England this uh this Sunday night\nIt's going to be very interesting you know the patriots event just brilliant was was you know there are small boat load as we know New England can can kinda\nShip from one or look to the other if they got to run forty times five they got to run fifty times no problem\nBut you just look at at at what Tom Brady is done over the last little bit I mean twenty eight out of the forty five attempts sixty two percent with were within ... yards away scrimmage get one completion for more than twenty five yards and yet they had three hundred and forty arts passing so\nThey're they're they've really got small ball going the combination of now with element of back\nAnd ... and whether in combination are opposite one another\nA defense the way they're going to be challenged by obviously that often of Kansas City chiefs this could be attract me you know we're giving away the profile of the two defenses this could be literally whoever has the ball the last\n... an NFL Network analyst you can see him every Wednesday on NFL playbook that the six thirty pm eastern time three thirty in the afternoons those have you out on the west coast\nGoats my bears have been a nice surprise this year the Viking to look good for the most part the Packers still allowed Aaron Rodgers and the lions of one a couple big games the last couple of weeks what do you make of the NFC North\nWhy it's all kind of come back to the middle of nowhere early on we thought it was kind of a two year or two team\nA division with Minnesota in Green Bay they both have stumbled along the way like everybody in the NFC short of the rams\nA you know there's times when they look really really good they look like he's we thought they were and then there's times you know I was at that Minnesota buffalo game it's like my God where did that come from a\nBut it's all that means is with Detroit playing a little bit better obviously the bears and and that defense is for real a ... a huge game obviously last weekend for the weekend before last we'll see if you could pick up on that uh but everybody's kind of moved back to the middle so it made a top to bottom very competitive division\nCoach I Know that when you're in charge of an organization like you were for a long time like every head coach in the NFL is now your job is get your team prepared every single week regardless of the circumstances but I Am curious\nFor teams like the eagles that are a little slow to the gate at two and three teams like the falcons that had high expectations have been a lot of injuries defensively that are one in four is there a point of the head coach where you have a team you think should be pretty competitive\nWhere you start to reach or feel panic mode is your record gets to a certain point a certain point in the season when what I'm asking is at what point I Want record just starting to feel like the seasons getting away from me\nWell you know you really can't think of it in those terms every coach where did you hear the monitor every week well it's all about who we play this week whatever we do begins with this week and that would have been a when you look at a team like Atlanta the concern has to be their injuries on defenses is unbelievable\nOver

Lincoln Park is doing a solo tour now solo album out now\nAnd uh\nHe's from ... everybody knows him from Lincoln Park so as as albums post traumatic lights out now and I came out in this uh you know late spring early summer and I tore anytime Asia and everything else that it's going to be a trip because I you know\nIt wasn't like we were great friends or anything with Chester but we you know we're friendly with and we knew him and we were cool whatever he liked us he liked a sports and uh you know he was in Arizona dude right math\nAny you're still seeing things for the cardinals ... he liked us and he would come on a show on top smart so that's but he loved his music and everything and so it's so sad that a a you know committed suicide\nAnd hearing this ban may are doing great things again and I are going to talk to them about it it's crazy and the album is is basically about what happened\nIt was good yeah everything that he went through after just a suicide\nSo let me ask you before I bring him on and you know Fifteen minutes or whatever is it depressing to you the album because I was listening to it with you and I got to tell you I'm\nI sat down at one point it was kind of Smokey like ah I felt like I was you know it was like it was almost kind of paying for ... like where it was like there was this trip the music on on on top of his wrapping it was really cool but it was it was a kind of smoking you know what I mean like it was as if I was smoking or something\nYou have different songs are different feel I mean obviously the California guys who got that kind of cool you know so far from\nLiving there and be a part of that in a lot of the stuff that he's done on a solo stuff before an outside of Lincoln Park has been more along that line at the Fort monitor you kind of how to feel to it so\nYou know it makes sense that is doing that kind of thing that with this and it's very it's not like hard core like come out you regret like Lincoln Park because a lot of heavy right you know raw emotions that he's bringing so it makes sense of that kind of flows not kind of style there\nThe like it or do you know there's a certain\nSongs that are better than others obviously certain ones are more you know connecting to me but I mean I think it's going to be a poor record for a lot of people\nJust want to be out like a band or something I think that's just himself he's doing all of a solo yeah I mean I still have a band like backing him on stage and stuff but I mean he plays guitar player but I mean I Know it was on the album he was up people yeah yet so people will get on it but most\nAll right I'm going to fill out of a belly backing him on stage and stuff but I mean he plays guitar player but I mean I Know it was on the album he was up people yeah you have to ... people will just on it but most of it was just I'm\nA\nI'm a I think it's very depressing\nAnd sixteen songs too you know a lot of\nYour records or you're an hour nine time the cheaper out he's gone all the way a lot of stuff in there\nWow well then again I have a tour you got a lot of music you gotta you gotta concert if you've got six games on she got Ninety minutes easy yeah right so\nGood for him but we'll talk about it so I'm for al ... is with us and I from New York We're watching believe it or not or the Yankee losing which is not surprising up but

that was supposed to\nGo out that was going to be the ones we lose the vibe bogus\nWhile yeah that's what they're recording this so there was no such thing but you gotta fight so that is not happening anymore so that's why they threw that I Want to\nGo to the bottom line is is that ... uh that's when you know you have a fight when fighters talk about it you know it's not true correct Dana controls everything including announcing fights right so whose name is going to fight now\nWe'll see if I ... I think that's that's a perfectly fine what honor McGregor you're already days now authors like guarantee that those two together before the years out now and then you'll have Tony ... could be for the title\nSo it'll be Tony burgers and against ... and you're telling me Connor against media trilogy I think so I mean that's the one that people want to see more so right now I'm going to be a New Year's eve type fight\nWe can go quickly depending on what the sponsors of the coming out from Nevada\nWhy would a Conor McGregor hurry that fast to fight again I he's been taken years off at a time waiting to fight\nBecause he's got to get back in the room where you can beat somebody who's got to beat somebody again but I really believe it needs to beat somebody again in a month\nOr two or three really you don't think just in the spring\nI think the quicker the better 'cause the last two things you remember about him right now that could be by McGregor fight and both were terrible\nAny way out in the middle of the um like he is McGregor because you've been very whether he needs to get back out there yeah he does\nShe like like say so fast you see it's like a perfect fight for that New Year's eve one that they do or whatever because that court always sucks like last year that it was terrible like they need like some juice and that goes a news even nobody cares so that'll bring some people are into actually walk either people or is it actually on New Year's eve not they actually\nTwenty ninth or something just run around and saying whatever we can do is ... believe that that's a good fight the trilogy fight do you want to see it I mean 'cause I I guess I Do I legs December twenty nine that's where my ... like when I don't they don't like each other I Know that I thought the first two fights were great\nI think it's a much better frogs and put them against giving them right away I mean he got dominance so badly at least the as you have one more even though we you know you and I both ... both parties are we to split this point are showing that he could fight against and that's a guy that will stand and fight with them it's not a garlic can\nBe taken down you know I listen or they'll never admit to anything the U.S she never missed a anything like that they had nothing to do with the uh the bottle drawing nothing to do with the gurney drawing nothing to do with anything they're just\nThey're just a absolutely sin free living the usa but they um they fix that fight [laughter] that's what that's all I Know that fight was that you know it's BS that's what it is\nGrowing worse and chanted finds out on the far side of the people that can be entering another son lives with us now by Henry and it's a touchdown pass authority to yards and a ... to nothing\nThe script cooks almost wheels looking pious town on Thursday nights of somebody walks you can't make it to the games listen to all the actual most excuse for online at one of six groups dot com started with the pregame show at six thirty raunchy by members of the sportscasters glove\n\nNews I'm Carmen Roberts hurricane Michael gets stronger and closer to the Florida coast and may grow to almost category four strings by tomorrow's landfall that would be nearly one hundred thirty mile an hour winds for the folks taking this one seriously\nBad traffic evacuating all day yesterday most people in this town Appalachian coal the southern point of the big brands\nThey're gone ... it won't get drunk putting an end to talk of her father naming her as the next UN ambassador tweeting today\nI Know that the president will nominate a formidable replacement for a basket or family that replacement will not remain\nFox's John Roberts President Trump says he's considering several people to replace you went about er Nikki Haley who\nAnnounced today she stepping down at the end of the year and the first African American drafted into\nNFL ...

Boston it\nBad nobody on and an out they got Salem Oregon unable pan I mean\nBut tens sorority Yankees they are absolutely lifeless\n\nSeriously mafia I Know you don't like the Yankees that's fine and I know I bet on Boston both last night and denies that documented\nThose grunt so I just bought them both night so I'm not like I don't bet with my heart but I got to tell you or I Am stunned\nHow pathetic they look to me that they that it's not even and I said this before but it's like they're playing as if it's not even a playoff game\nThey are playing like it's like may twentieth I mean they are it's just the most the static thing I've ever seen from a Yankee team I mean at a car ride they to me it's embarrassing and now they're given a doubles right here it is embarrassing watching us they are getting their\nAss beat that's that boom I agree with you a hundred percent I feel like the last two nights they've been completely ... and um\nWhat are they saying about um in like a ... like on the fan and on the tabloids like I don't I don't spend all day reading tablets and it was hard but it was hard\nYou know last night was a joke I mean the game was over and a third in tomorrow I'm the heat will be on tomorrow because it's the second night in a row where Aaron Boone made some questionable early evening or both ended\nSo did you think ESPN enjoyed the uh the twenty hours of a Red Sox highlights they ran that ad they just kept running them\nI'm sure they did you know that's that's great but\nIt is what it is you you don't show up you lose I mean you don't hit when you look at life with as they look at the plate the last two nights I Can't even pick one person who hasn't been a was given some good at bat\nNothing nobody at all by other than the fifth inning tonight where they scored the one run and they had a little bit of something going at home but on the road and again they won that was thought\nBoth games in Boston they I mean they got out they gotta dug a huge oil early in game one and they fought back a little bit they wish they gave you some life that one I didn't lose that game it was five nothing right out of the whole they lost five four they kept crawling back in ... and then the next night they hammered I'm with you\nKnow with with a lot of ... and what the hell I have no idea\nI I don't know what went on a but this\nWas it I mean it's gonna be a along all the\nWay it is unbelievable to me out depressing is is like it's depressing watching it like I'm just sitting here going I Wanna hold my teeth out it's hard it's hard to watch um I'll probably be\nI'm kinda like kinda gone right now really because I thought they'd at least give you a little heart tonight after last night\nYou said that last night that don't worry about it they'll show up tonight will be a planned Thursday\nNight the team I thought they were\nYou know I hate to say this I thought you were on the phone I bet against them both nights and I just want Boston because I think they're the better team I really do and I think the Yankees won a hundred games and they still didn't matter\n'cause I I like I said I think Houston is better too so I think they were like the third best team in in the American league\nYeah that's fair I thought out of the four you're probably Yankee slightly\nAhead of the Indians and then there were sure rocks and the ... were were better than the both of them I mean there's no doubt\nI think the Yankees were ahead of the\nTribe yeah the the Yankees had one advantage over the the Red Sox and that was their bullpen and maybe the bottom of their own of what the whole line of give you enough\nIn the last two nights nothing\nNot even like quality at bat but didn't even get in there and like write work I mean for some basically sat on a rocking chair for the first four innings tonight he did nothing\nRight know fight\nIs there anything worse\nRight I mean for some basically sat on a rocking chair for the first foreign ... than I did nothing right\nBut you know fight or is there anything worse a as a Yankee fan and losing and these guys the red Sox\nIf you're a Yankee fan not doing well here's the way I look at the red Sox just nope I obviously I hate losing to them there's you know it's the worst I there's nobody I Would I put ahead of them in terms of I Would want to lose to write what since all for like when when you lose that one\nYou know you can't ever be worse than that ... law what did that too yeah that was terrible I mean I was the worst thing I've ever seen in sports oh up up three oh after just absolutely\nKicking their teeth in game three at Fenway Nineteen eight and\nThen to lose the next four with a game for they were sitting there with the game one was Mariano won amount [laughter] you know it was just voyages granted hair at first\n\nThey made me sick to the steam I'll tell you what they're going to lose a I'm going to take Houston in that series I still think

you doing\nCobra thanks for coming back on I got to ask you um\nIs it a benefit for the eagles to be playing this a giants football game that they had no lot they'd have you know\nNo luck at all I mean I don't even know what to say about them losing on a sixty three on her after they had that big comeback but it's like they have no luck whatsoever are you glad you're blind them or do you not like playing a desperate team\nWell the eagles were pretty desperate to Scott I got to tell you and you know you talk about losing on a sixty three or your will they lost a giant that here in Philadelphia\nLast year on a sixty one yard field goal so you're right they just don't have any walk what drives actually play pretty well you know they got that often wrapped up for the first time in a while I think they broke that\nA drought uh thirty seven straight games where they didn't score over thirty points that's on I think or feel pretty good about themselves even though they're wanting

gave me a ...\nYou know you're you know it was in a powerhouse by any means there is no team with a winning record in it ah but it's still early uh these teams still haven't played a whole lot against

last line of defense\nYou're the one who has to set the defense so they're going to be asking a lot from them\nOr you know they're turning the ball over all I have seven stumbles which leads the league or you know in ... you know already they only had nine last year in Nineteen games counting the playoffs so you know they have to take better care of the ball they're getting off the slow start they always were seven points in the first quarter\nOr in their five games combined so there there's a lot of issues here\nUh I'm not sure I'm not as confident maybe as benefits are going to hit their

digging it it's cool it's a you know like a half hour every day of all the days action and you know really sports betting stuff\nAnything to do with games you know college pro NHL baseball playoffs all that it's on there\nSo\nUh I just wanted to say the red Sox obviously won the game and a four three it was the final I think\nSo or they beat him that's that\nAnd they're in the I think they're eleven and a A R A L see us in our history the last time they were and it was thirty when they won the world series so it's the Astros and Red Sox and they'll start it at Fenway because the red Sox had the best record in baseball so they got the home field right so uh that's Jerry's will begin [noise]\nUh what is it friday and a Milwaukee so I'm assuming Saturday and\nNot in Boston right I think that's what it boils down to so\n... what do you like and that serious I'm taking Houston to be honest with you I still think they're the best a team in baseball\nI got to use them too because while the Boston Red Sox who were great pitching ... starting wars we've seen now you know even in September of who's gonna grow closer from for many years\nThere have struggles and the whole time you know they had to bring in you know the the growth of stars that are going to the bullpen later in the game because they don't trust those guys I think Houston on the other hand you know you're ... you're going to go deep so you don't have to use open as much and there's just so much\nA lab generally they'll go deep or that Boston line up anything's possible\nEasier said than done but I've got a lot of success in the playoffs against Boston against everybody I mean the broker terms about what they're doing are starting to pick with them\nSo you're on used in using through\n... who do you like Houston or the red Sox and ... we guess that it will start Saturday and Fenway because they got the home field is it Saturday that they started a game one of the Yale or what do you like and that Jerry's\nProbably the Astros\nSo leaning Astros not eating national minute of yet no let me see how the pitching winds up I I think the Astros or you know the defending champ they're probably better they're healthy now for the first time pretty much all year I I think the Astros which should be a slight favorite I don't really care how many games the red Sox\nCould you believe that the red Sox were such big dogs and I was like plus one\nI\n... we should be a slight favorite I don't really care how many games the red Sox could you believe that the red Sox were such big dogs and I was like plus one dirty\nI I didn't it wasn't surprising to me with this Yankee teams or lose two games at home too of all the imports oh oh yeah I could see why Vegas made it that the that the line yeah I don't know I I really thought they did they really think that the Yankees were going to be gutless for eight innings tonight I weigh\n... better than ... right about now and I think that they should have been at least even odds\nYeah but that it did I got ordered the rain but they never intended no matter what happened on pitching in more\nThan four innings at the most ... own all those guys no matter what tonight that he wasn't in there to be the to go a long distance whether he gave up three runs or know runs he was coming out after about three or four innings well\nI Can't believe that they didn't take advantage of this camera guy being all over the place they did I mean they got three runs on him I mean stand kinda wreck the inning because you know he came up in a spot\nWhere there was nobody out when he came out there was nobody out when he came up and he couldn't even if he did something productive there and move some guys over it would have helped the cause I mean who knows\nI still thought that guy had a huge season what do you have three hundred and a hundred RBI thirty eight hundred\nSan ah thirty eight I think he came up just just shy of ... I don't think he drove in a ... you might have been right around it but um\nLook he he had he the problem was he wasn't great in in huge moments that was that was the the issue for him he piled up staff this year there's no doubt about that he had a little stretch where he carried them in early August\nBut um he had a bad play off in a really bad playoff and and your wife she's gonna he's going to take a lot of the the\nThe ... are they going to blame and Bart Jansen human Buena moon's going to him and Boehner gonna take it to anyone dirty eight hundred was it on and all you did get through a hundred and he went to a hundred\nAnd he hit a two sixty six or his\nOn base was a three forty three slugging five o nine\nO B. S. or was eight fifty two\nWhich is the on base and slugging combined right was it was about to look more like Carlos Beltran of two thousand seven the ... the ... going through the curve ball right or the swing ... you know badly at the the slaughter there did not look good at all\nI had seven strike out in the postseason Stan and one home run the mammoth shot\nAnd uh uh\nWhat was it the Saturday Night when he hit the man was shot down a left field line right that was huge\n... is that right what Marty hit that no one daughter down in the series but if I was in the wild card game against the age and the wild card game you know yeah you're right it was just sort of a hundred\nImages both ... you must be short yeah you remembered that are ... those were some good money\n... is the first inning so\nSo in the ninth camera walk three guys for base runners allowed to run a came in on kimbrell I I think that's what happened right\nThey had eleven straight batters retired before kimbrell came on but what's the difference they won who cares what happened\nHow it happened that's that Red Sox won it four to three so there you go stocks rose brewers Dodgers\nI got to tell you man I'm room brewers just for fun with it on a vertical obviously not\nRooting for the two American League teams I like to see somebody know give me the brewers I'm going to root for the brewers\nHad um two I'll bet I'm too about that I'll put a little juice behind it also\nI like I'm a I said that going into the playoffs on a show in front of ads I picked up ...\nYou did oh\nI'll take Milwaukee but I'm not going to deny the Dodgers can you imagine is there anything like I don't want to see the Dodgers and asked rose again to you I don't want to see that again\nI I yeah I ... I wouldn't want to go\nRound to with that I I definitely would not want to do that again\nSo there and believe it or not I know you're not that excited about it but the sharks beat the flyers aid to Keynes five three over the ... jacket five do over the asked how about the flames winning and smashed bill serene and I think over the predator is no one saw that gun and jets beat the games to one and the leaves win over the stars seven four\nAnd a to Buress again he had two more goals the guys had a goal and there's a better than a trick and now to bowl\nGame he's got six goals already but all I said ... goals as well he's got seven goals are ready to start the season so obviously a that came now three in one you get the bears on that team with ... now they got two star players and ah they're scoring lots of goals\nRight now that Michael J.

I'll tell you what baseball does the though they need a little juice here for this round because I thought that this round was awful all the force series were awful all four of 'em was there anything interesting about these four now vision series I'll give you that\nI I agree with you that it was all awful all zeroes I made it out of nothing good got a bunch of sweeps right brewer swept\nOr the Astros sweat and then the other two were four games with and they weren't really any Red Sox handily beat the Yankees and the Dodgers handily beat the Braves do raves got the one game six five right yeah the first game at home game three\nAnd that was that same face and then they turn around and got whacked six to\nKnow juice right now they need a they need these two championships series to get a little juice for them\nYeah I Would agree with that I think the baseball playoffs so far been a bad ... bad ... game drama no nothing I so ah the NFL or we were looking at power rankings\nAnd uh I Do some more of that I think on tomorrow's brown bats\nTalking about the difference between like ESPN has power rankings bleacher importance power rankings I was looking at a I like bleacher reports to be honest with you or they were different of their top five I think the saints were ahead of the patriots on a bleacher report right\nAnd then uh the SPN was different than the patriots added the saints so or the bottom line is\nIs is that at the end of the day the best teams\nAre in football are still the same as they were last week right it's the uh it's the rams are still number one I Do have a problem with that after the way they planning in Seattle they still won the game\nI think there's still the best team\nEven after like so what Kansas City then to the jaguars was not more impressive than a them struggling against Seattle\nI think there's just a part of me that still wants to see\nI get it the jaguars are are good defense let me see them going to Fox borough Sunday night let me see the kid in on prime time go in and be ...\nI don't think it'll be them I don't think he'll beat him either so you're on the path right there right yeah\nDo you think that the saints because they have the same three and the patch far do you agree with that the saints are better than the patriots\nNo I'm not going to go there the jaguars are best would that cornerback ... buying at

lost three straight after and joined us start their terrible\nWeek nine at around Cleveland has yet to lose at home if you can't even believe that the cardinals or at home Arizona's the league's lowest scoring team we have an ad the rams Los Angeles is also a need and they'll probably go\nUh\nNo I don't think they'll beat the patriots but if they do I say they win the rest of those games and then they lose the rams in LA\nDoesn't it seem like whoever plays at the coliseum against the rams is in trouble because they really light it up there\nThey then they have a by then they go to the raiders of the Kansas City last October I don't think that's happening this time ravens a lawsuit in their purse or erode games they play them and weak fourteen\nChargers we contain Kansas city's one nine straight against the chargers week sixteen at Seattle Seattle nearly beat the rams at home this past week and then they finish with the raiders Kansas city's won five straight and arrowhead against Oakland so Wendy they get ... against the patriots are against the rams\nThis week so this week that it ends\nAnd then what about you ... the uh Kansas City chiefs\nWhen at New England or do they lose their they lose against the rams do they lose that Seattle what what game do you think they'll have problems with\nOr they just want to be talking from I mean for some reason everyone that goes up there was a lot of problems winning ... starting to get things together it'd be a close game are they going to lose\nSo the rams have a clear path they got at Denver this week Denver nearly be Kansas City at home I don't know what that is the doing anything a week seven evidence\nSmoke rather just so it's not a great in them\nThe niners the weeks out of the LA one forty one thirty nine and

beat the saints in LA last year I think this change can beat the rams what do you think ... do you think this change can beat the rams in New Orleans\nI absolutely think the saints can beat the rams that the rams will not go undefeated either these two teams are not going to go on to feed we\nTend to Seattle Seattle one in LA last October that's a different game a week eleven genes Kansas city's also I mean we know that that's again we joined about we talk about a week week Thirteen out Detroit Detroit beat the Packers and patch at Ford Field\nAnd then a week for teen at the bears Chicago's doing at home I don't think they can be the rams eagles week then painted on Philly beat the rams in LA last December\n... this silly games now being that team\nThey just don't look like the same team at all\nAnd then we have seen that the cardinals LA crushed Arizona and their last three meetings week Seventeen niners LA lost the San Francisco on week Seventeen last season that was with Jimmy gee it's not happening with CJ bats are this time around\nSo I think uh I Believe it or not I say they lose the saints game at New Orleans\nI ah Jamie in Wisconsin and you're on CBS Sports radio\nI'll be

actually wrote I saw this that he needs to win another Super Bowl the cement his legacy\n[laughter]\nAre you kidding me\nLike really like you know what it is the problem with is a sports world we live in now days you know what the problem is is one is never enough for anybody you win but they always say right if you don't want anyone you nothing right you know buddy Dan Marino they never let him forget to do that\nSo if you don't mind one you're nuts and\nThen when you when one it's not good enough you got to win a bunch of them you\nCan't win one you gotta went to three or four five you gotta win five or six right winning one just gotten him cut the mustard right is there anything more ridiculous than listening to that that that guy needs to cement his legacy by winning another Super Bowl or do you actually believe that\nThis guy is going to the hall of fame whether he wins another Super Bowl or not is there any doubt that there is no doubt\nWas he not the best free agent signing ever\nOne thousand percent going in on skates I mean the guys I ... it and they love him I mean there's not a version of the world that doesn't love and no I Can't find a person who has a bad thing about Drew Brees on the line to women children media everybody everybody if you ever see the guy so universally like duck you can't find anybody that doesn't like this guy\nHe's automatic automatic some of the people that he needs to win another Super Bowl I people are stupid you saw this I did see it it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen I think he can win another\nBut some people that he needs to win another Super Bowl I people are stupid you saw this I did see it it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen I think he can win another one but I don't think he asked why does he have to win another Super Bowl of cement anything he'd already\nNever enough it's like you just said it's never enough if your ear then we're going to the line over here\nBut it and when you reach this line we're going to draw another whenever they kill us that drive you nuts drives me nuts if a guy wins that rain if he wins the championship mafia in any sport is he not solidified that he got it done you're just it doesn't matter because like Aaron Rodgers do they say that about him\nNo no no no\nAnd he's been hurt a bonds you haven't been here in the nearly as much he's won my rubble\nBurn through ... through brings ... every year when the parents are over here like ... you wrote in\nHer yard closer and closer to winning a second one breeze ass 'cause then they just go he lost that biking day and they would have been in the NFC championship right\nRight on my reply so when is a far they never get far any business no heat it all for only winning one wasn't done right on the graves nobody has won a single one I Know that I'm saying is that it's got to be with another one everyone is all over them Marino withdrew bruises good not just one\nThat's my point do you think that he's a but why do they give Aaron Rodgers no grief at all for winning one but they give and Brett Farr they gave them all the glory one one\nAnd then this guy wins wind but it's not enough I read I have a rare he needs to win more to be just a matter of fact as and I'm thinking no he doesn't\nHe does not have to do it for ... tang to cement his legacy gives his legacy is going into can with a bust\nAnd I'm not A Guided fence around all day if you ever hear me a over the last Thirty years you're not gonna sit here and do this whole he's a hall of famers stuff with every player that you know oh he's a lot lock stock and barrel automatic he's automatic hall of famer first ballot I I don't I Can't stand\nThat stuff can stand it every guy now\nComes into the league right like O L back on right he comes in ... and they got him in the hall of fame already\nI mean he's already all of them are I mean it's just automatic right I'm so sick and tired of hearing how every guy's a hall of famer five minutes after his career start how 'bout that guys that play their entire you know Fifteen Years in the NFL and they wait Thirty years to get in how about those guys\nYou don't think they should at least make somebody suffer a little bit honestly in and get in the nineties you'd be hard to get in\nYou know these ... member Jerry Kramer didn't they just get and finally now that he's dead\nI mean he's like what is he Ninety I mean what do you have to do it again and now they nowadays in in the media today this pathetic sports media today everyone's a hall of famer five minutes after they get the\nThat you know they get drafted I mean right isn't a make Mayfield already going at all I'm saying is any automatic hall of famer oh mom's\nHe's already she [laughter] the guy that just got done doing Randy Moss but he's already a carbon out of the he's got a silly buddy going in his office he's already working on the moms bust\nI mean come on for Christ's sake\nThe guy's automatically set for life\nHe doesn't have to win another football game and he's going to be the one of the most revered quarterbacks ever play the game a window of all it's not enough it's not enough you know it's not enough for the the genius sports media that that you know the genius or writers and and God that covered a leak thank God that I'm\nA what am I exhibited as on and on that we're basically an asset right am I not like the comedic reliever that\nA show\nI mean I did the show in the nude so I think that pretty much said to my point is I don't matter right thank God I don't matter because I just want to enjoy life that it'd be funny and have to have a blast and live life to the fall is right\nBut I don't think that I Am some genius acts we're like everybody else around here I notice though that guy doesn't need to do a thing you don't need to do its thing he's already done it it's already done the guy breaks a record last night for the most about the history of uh you know you need some are stats\nAnd not only that he's fourth on touchdowns without pay to go well beyond manning I mean are the biggest thing too is he's not getting all these big shots throwing

ask you this question a breeze stats or whatever he's a like look\nThe thirty nine year old has a team around him that could do it that they could actually you know this is a tough team they looked like a playoff game to me right so far\nI think they're you know the win against the giants on a road that was easy right thirty three Jane whenever it it it doesn't matter where they play it you know they put up numbers right this team scores and and they have a a they have down there and play a game last year they got burned by the Vikings right that was a terrible loss of horrible bad be right to lose on that day explained was atrocious\nBut do you believe Garber either they can bounce right back and get in the playoffs this year would that guy and do some serious damage having Thomas who

Super Bowl\nI think they can absolutely get there I think that they um they have a good enough team that defends hasn't looked great in the early going this year but\nI saw enough of it last year that I think that they can get back to that point so I think that that stuff will clean up and if they do they can get there why not flute player away from the NFC title game\nSo do you think they're done enough not being and when the super bowl the ... ah the saints do you think they could actually do it\nI think they are often several years and always has been the problem is always been put on the

goal to enter that he's got all these little cautions ladder to get across this time\nI'm not sure how it happened to him this time but unfortunately we've seen this\nNot just in hockey this is with all these ... with contact sports whether it's the NFL um or whether it's NHL seen a few guys in baseball either hit a wall in Oakland Frazier the Yankees had some recurring ones unfortunately some guys I'm don't recover well off\nAnd they come back to them very it doesn't take much but then again bomb to get another one you know it's\nAnd it's a serious thing and memories had a bunch now and that ain't good\nYeah because at three and four years is now a trend that's like a problem big time and number one and Crosby is to get 'em and everybody thought his career is going to be cut short\nAnd then he came out of it and he hasn't thankfully had any since ...\nRemember when Crosby is to get 'em and everybody thought his career is going to be cut short\nAnd then he came out of it and he hasn't thankfully had any since\nThen you think the league did something about it and warn teams don't hit him knows he was the ... they just let it happen I don't I don't think that that happens they don't interfere with any they don't tell people don't touch Gretzky don't touch lemieux don't touch Crosby\nI mean I wouldn't blame them if they did but I don't believe that the we would go to all these\nTeams and say don't touch certain players I don't I don't I Can't imagine ... last\nAs a goalie and the NHL with all these concussions he's having\nNo I don't either I think his career is going to be short I mean the guys always injured I mean it's unbelievable\nI mean he gets a concussion now it's like automatic right it's like I'm just waiting for the next one it's just crazy do you remember Patty Stefan trousers rather them number one at a bunch of concussions that guy never amounted to a hill of beans\nFortunately some guys that just doesn't go away it just doesn't score and they have to stop playing you can't you can't risk it\nSo I'm going back to the college about Michigan or one again they'd be Maryland forty did Twenty one and they are now finding one what do you think of the wall of arranged now that uh they're winning and no one gives them any credit or respect\nUm is it because they've only been Nebraska northwestern in Maryland and then we're going to find out in the next three weeks what they're made up of Wisconsin Michigan State in Penn State they just aren't buying who they'd beat and let's see them play the ... the the big boys and the big then do you think they'll beat Wisconsin and the big S.\nAre you gonna go badgers I Do think there'll be Wisconsin whoa I'm not a big believer in Wisconsin even with John Taylor and that his name not a believer\nMafia are you buying a Michigan football do you think they will beat Wisconsin\nOh about buying them earlier I thought they were terrible and the beginning sleep out as an adult hype and wasn't living up to ... you know to be doing about giving us Notre Dame ... and that was not in the top echelon of the division or of a conference general\nI'm starting to think that they will have a really good shot up also being Wisconsin but Wisconsin was you know coming out strong everyone thought they were gonna be like last year ... would be in the playoff mix where every person in the last couple of weeks\nThey're foreign one chewing on the garbage they lead the west\nOf the Big Ten and believe it or not Michigan's tied with Ohio State\nFor the east lead\nTheir boat three you know and they don't base it on overall record they base it on conference record they're both ran out\nSo if Michigan beach Wisconsin and then they go to Michigan State and when and then they go home and beat

...\n...\n\n[noise]\nSomeone needs to go to the show you the truth about what's going on they\nThought about it because all the time they were twenty four hours a day I don't care how long they

Neal and Oregon You're on CBS Sports radio\nMan let me show thing first thing I\nHeard you talking college football as far as they are or going to get upset Washington this week the Saturday and then uh [laughter] I don't know what could happen uh\nThen also I'm a diehard niners fan and I'm Wondering I'm what's up with all the injuries and and and that you think it's a coincidence that there's so many injuries on that team or do you think that it's just kind of a fluke and it's\nEvery team has a injuries are the entire season the NFL is anonymous with injuries or injury lists uh players being questionable or out or whatever banged up it just gets worse\nWith injuries are the injury lists uh players being questionable or out or whatever banged up it just gets worse\nAs the weeks go by and say lawn dragged out Seventeen weeks season and then the play offs and guys are injured from\nA pre season all the way till uh the playoffs are over in the super bowl so injuries to specific teams like the niners have worse locked in someone else's um you know kind of crazy when you think about it I mean obviously a key guys you lose garage below that's huge I lose your running back\nA breed that's huge so I Know there's a it would seem that they have worse off than everybody else but I just don't find that to be true do I think Oregon can uh be washing than uh well I mean they should've beat Stanford and they blew that game so\nAnd I think Washington is better than Stanford I think there are more incomplete football team\nI my guess is is Washington wins that game [laughter] now I don't know is the game is the game in a house and is it in Eugene\nYes and Eugene I I I Know you know I still don't think it\nMatters that much ah I think but it this way of the game was at a husky stadium I think Washington and beat him by by seven to ten points they plan in Eugene the game's going to be a little bit closer I'd say more like\nFour to six points I think I saw that number was that like three I think Washington was favored by three I get me wrong but I Do think Washington is a better football team in Oregon I think Oregon uh I still cannot believe they lost the Stanford game I mean what were they upped thirty points and they blew that game it was on the level\nOf the rough one man that was a rough one I don't know how to either I don't know how you recover from that I really don't\nI mean you don't limit down I Know that we're still talking about it so I mean we are still talking about them blowing that game so yeah I think Oregon can or possibly upset Washington but I don't think they will but that to me what do I know a\nJob they all do calls for a rematch with Conor McGregor after a two twenty nine of course that guy is thirty two he's coming over a and saying this after he beat Jeremy Stevens last July\nJeremy Stevens is a tough guy mafia that was a huge win for Joe's they all do put him back on the scene as somebody that matters or he obviously can't live with that Thirteen second defeat\nOr that Conor McGregor laid them out Thirteen seconds into their fight he can go to bed at night ... and his career and live with that he wants to find them again to prove that that was a fluke\nOf course I mean we we've been tough cars so that's a good customer you know going over the ... like that to be able to survive and put them down and also go

theories and were able to come back and win three in a row including their two games in the Bronx\nA lot of high hopes for this theories and it was the void of drama I'm not saying it was boring

still left early\nGame for on Tuesday night was the winner go home for the New York Yankees\nDrama for them to be sure I'd prefer a winner take all game but we'll have to wait until\nThe league championship series for that and there is plenty of potential there think about it we've got a red hot brewers team against the Dodgers team that has been there now three years in a row where this will be their third consecutive appear and so lots of wisdom lots of experience\nThat the national league championship series\nAnd then for the first time since Nineteen Seventy seven\nWill have two

you're yelling over me or you know [laughter] so at least a hundred and games\nTwo teams have never met in the league championship series with at least a hundred wins going back to Nineteen Seventy seven and then it was the Yankees and the royals if I remember correctly from my research\nSo that's where we are we are to one hundred wind teams in the division series that finished up on Tuesday nights everybody else waiting but we have our final participant in the in the final four\nAnd now we move on starting with friday National League Saturday American League and Alex pregnant will finally get what he wants\nHe's ... annoyed that the Astros haven't been playing primetime games and one of his examples that he used this is fantastic I feel like it's a it's going to be part of the

or it was too little too late for Aaron Boone steam\nDefinitely frustrating and and you know it's like one of their goals in the series was to keep us from the ballpark and [noise] and then coming here\nUm we're so good at that they were able to do it\nYou can hear the frustration in his voice as he speaks post game\nAnd for sure they wanted more now\nAgainst the red Sox they were going to have to go on the road and play a game five they could force the game five\nUh but they had won their endgame number two I think the worst part is feeling like they did it leave their best effort out there as dramatic as it was in the ninth inning and they were so close to being able to force that game by the fact that they had so many other opportunities and couldn't capitalize the red Sox pitching\nWas the the major advantage that Boston had and we had gone into this series as fans as viewers wondering how the Yankees starting pitching would hold up\nJay how was the guy who had done so

games were void of drama but you know winner take all games they have a little special something to him a little special tension and and the kind that you can feel your guts as a sports fan and so I was hoping that we would get one of those between Red Sox and Yankees\nIn Boston but we still got some drama in the ninth inning honestly there wasn't a ton of drama uh before that\nI probably by the the I don't know the first hour being done then between Red Sox and Yankees and it felt like the Yankees weren't going to be able to get anything going with their bats ah they\nWere close to having a big time home run from Gary Sanchez a that obviously would have could have potentially change things but definitely would have set a different tone a but from the start cc's about the uh he he struggled\nThis wasn't the the the the ... that that and you come to expect that we've come to expect in the playoffs where he just stinks Dallas deeper and and it's it's um more about that just personal toughness\nThis is a older guy but even in recent years\nHe reminds you why he's continued to be a starting pitcher in major league baseball it's that experience it's it's that refusal\nTo give in it's it's the tenacity that he brings to the mountain of course um the the pitching as part of it too but this was a different the different outing and he didn't have it from the beginning\nAnd so it was was in trouble early on manage to hold off the red Sox are from crossing the plate until a couple of innings it until the third inning there when they when they had\nThree guys that are across the plate and they put up that three spots\nBut even in the first inning the bases loaded against about the it was the shortest outing of his postseason career and could very well have been the last one of his Yankees career we don't know about that yet he's indicated that he would like to return to New York of course and\nAt the very least would like to continue pitching um but that's a question to be answered for another day so shortest outing for him he gave up three runs in those three innings and air it's definitely getting some flak for not pulling cc

Afghanistan but if we leave out kinda will\nUh and end up attacking us again and when it comes to Yemen are only alternative is just give it to Iran and how does that work out for anybody [noise] ah so those\nAre a few things are looking as Democrats tried to get going now Hillary Clinton actually has the audacity along with her husband Detroit seven hundred dollars per ticket to hear both of them speak\nAre you kidding and it it was a charity aspect to this is who was a Clinton or some type of legitimate foundation or you want to build hospitals in Africa\nNow you know we should say I can't believe they be doing this but they were actually looking just to add\nA deal looking to add to their coffers which is unbelievable to me\nHillary Clinton a little bit earlier or in terms of what Trump said about how records and I thought this was telling cut thirty four\nI guess that's where she lost she doesn't get it [noise] she never did it I knew that a long time ago Hillary never got it\nThat's why she lost and that was kind of thing you said about ... a very long time but she such old news now she's not going to run again she wants to be that we were left\nEven though that she is not in the left you know when she was a moderate I think she'd be more open because you know everything's so predictable the reason why Democrat or Bill Richardson so interesting is\nWhether he's retired he will say you know I think President Trump is right here and I think he's wrong gear makes it more interesting guest both Hillary Clinton there's nothing interesting about her if she would just take on Democrats in sometimes say these candidates are off for America's a center rich country\nWe want to get people elected center left instead she's about Medicare for all cheesy and she's about a you know guaranteed wage would ever\nMeanwhile the ... the United states is going to be welcome Kanye West or the White House tomorrow and I believe Jim Brown too and I think he's got to be talking about race relations as well as prison reform cuts thirty eight\nAnd Tanya west to get sick [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nBomb the greatest [noise] but they're coming up in the White House very shortly with an outlet a lot of talk about it but they get\n[noise] they do and a Jim Brown as you know I used to a radio show with him\nFriendly with him and he has done so much a poor black athletes the black community or when it comes to prison reform is American program and now that he came out a poor President Trump he is getting backlash people were talking about things and complex said he had domestically now people are saying well Jim Jim Brown is kind of lost it\nWell you know when he was he was somebody who wants to matter and could I get it get the time of day from President Obama and then you have the Donald Trump when he was first elected invite him to the White House and they continue to talk on a regular basis that is what batters cut thirty nine\nYeah I Believe was just coming to the White House he's been terrific guy you know he loves what we're doing for\nAfrican Americans job for so many different things median income as you see at an all time high poverty level at the best rate meaning the lowest rate so far and ... is a smart guy and he sees that\nAnd I do I look forward to finding out what comes out a Thursday although hurricane coverage will overwhelm at my house and we just Facebook Live for quite a long time today any comments you want to share\nTheir ally and many people who are um I think one woman said her husband was going to be very upset that he missed Inslee because she was on there for a while but yeah she was on the show itself on Iran actually going back here and to be with Senator Rand Paul she said Brian of always like do however you were really to Senator Rand Paul this morning after questions make your point\nJoe Lieberman I think would also be a good candidate but Rick Cornell also seems to be a front runner I Know he definitely buys into the Trump agenda what do you think\nWell Grinnell has experience working for John Bolton that the un so that in some ways with my son um then I think you I mean when you mentioned that lists I mean you also have already fallen good\nI think it's a little too soon to tell I ... I mean you know if president Donald Trump is a very good at kind of the reality show element of the presidency which is to say he's good at kind of you know shooting next week so\nI wouldn't be surprised that his name we haven't heard um all of those people sort of makes sense I think Lieberman will be excellent ah try to in that Nikki Haley tradition um and you know someone with that it's it's I think right now would be very good though I I've heard you know settling in Germany right now we're getting the ambassador I'm\nDina Powell is a little bit different um she has a lot of experience she comes from a different kind of part of the\nVery much a Bush Bush person right\nYeah well this is the first person she comes from the kind of she was very close with Gary Cohn I'm and she has different kinds of strengths and of course is to it she's I think less of that from that kind of American exceptionalism Reagan tradition but that's not I'm not against or I don't want to you know there are people can have honest disagreements you know\nIn general and foreign policy and on the right on foreign policy but it's a different a little bit of a different approach she'd be I think a little bit more a lower profile but you know I mean I think Haley really did\nImport not only did herself very good she's America very good at the un and uh we're all kind of waiting to see what she does next and I met and she will at some point reenter public life\nI mean I imagine you're not going away six years in order to come back and remember Rudy Giuliani weight and you never could get momentum back when Bloomberg took over speaking of Bloomberg key is actually going to be a registered Democrat yes to understand is there any doubt in your mind these in trying to run\n[noise] well I don't really have any insight into it and\nYou know I should say here you pay my bills are paid for my salary so at this point I ... I mean I don't know I I I Know that he's sick of it is obviously in the larger political stuff\nRight let's move on TALK about uh you say America's opportunity in Iraq what is our opportunity now in Iraq I Know that they liked the world with us as opposed to with Iran\nBecause our when we we became clear to them we weren't going to destroy their country and take their oil we actually we're giving them a shot at freedom things or do whatever we might have a window right now you believe right\nWell I I wouldn't say two things about this because I'm Glad you brought it up it doesn't get enough attention the conventional wisdom on Iraq is that it's the greatest mistake in Vietnam or worse and that is sort of you know a a constant refrain but let's look at\nThat Fifteen Years later there have been for success of national elections there is a constitution is real politics and free media in Iraq there are a lot of problems in Iraq there was a rise of ice and they're still the real threat of violence or carrying some similar kind of a weapon on but at the same time\nThey are further along now\nNow to regular elections having a constitution and they are demanding reform and here's another interesting thing about the moment that we're in right now the ... the slate of candidates the one the most votes in the election in may\nThat finally resulted in the government that was formed last week was led by somebody who is the problem is the fiercest critics with in\nThe Shia Arab majority community in Iraq looks at an outsider of the Iranian influence in Iraq so that data point number one data point number two is that over the summer and it intensified in September you saw\nReal protest serious protest beyond just you know marches and and and sit there with you know the Iranian consulate in Basra which is\nA traditionally very close to her on a since the fall of Saddam was burned by protesters people are furious at the influence of Iran and that country\nTen years ago ...\nYou know seen as almost a sort of colony of Iran ten years later in twenty eight teams Basra is maybe the ... center point of the new Iraqi assistance against Iran\nThat is something that I think bodes very well and we should not just assume that Iraq is going to always be a a vessel of Iran which is pretty much just some under Obama and I think\nYou know even at the end of Bush's uh you're just going to have to live with the Iranians there now that doesn't mean that the u._s. than a hundred thousand troops into Iraq and re fight the Iraq War that's not what I'm saying at all but\nIt is an opportunity for the kind of diplomatic economic engagement I Know that sometimes foreign aid seems dirty work but it shouldn't be in the case of Iraq where if you can use that investment\nUm to support the politicians that need to show their own people that they're independent from Iran America didn't really play an important role there and that is the opportunity that we have\nAnd it's especially as the Iranian economy itself is about to pay these crippling sanctions and here's a chance to really\nYou know potentially make it a a difference here and now and to prevent what we thought was the complete with that Iran takeover I mean how many times have you heard that in the last one of your rights well not necessarily so and a lot of the Rockies really resent Iranians right now I ...\nYeah I think it's a it's quite interesting we need somebody like Ryan Crocker who thoroughly understands rocket and understand to the power players are and have to be an ... right now I live right have a new bachelor author of the river yeah we don't have an ambassador there right\nNow we do have an a bath or I'm I'm I I'm Sorry not getting his name off the top of my head but but you know Crocker\n... I think was a terrific ambassador in and he understood he he by the way he negotiated times the Iranians you have to negotiate with a lotta\nAn argument for ... completely shutting someone diplomatically but it's understanding that it is that what we thought was inevitable if the Iranians were there forever and we would have to leave and stuff that they're going to\nBasically be controlling the political process they didn't control the political process to finding the permission to government their candidate did not do as well as they would have like in the election and now that we have the beginning of this new government in Iraq lets you know work with them and show that we can be just as good a partner\nTo what they want 'em and not that it's just a back burner issue and that we're trying to leave in ... you know it's yesterday's yes\nHi Ely lasted the Washington Post a Washington Post writer and there's the turkey believes he was murdered they believe they they said they can wind up the footage to show what happened in Saudi Arabia he tells the latest\n[noise] All right so it's a couple of words of caution here um I mean when it was just Turkish officials I was more skeptical they have put out more evidence the Saudis story it looks less and less plausible and we should brace ourselves for the worse this has very significant implications because\nThe Saudi Arabia the United states of an ally since\nThe Nineteen thirties and the strategic\nRationale for that alliance is still going to be there even if it turns out that they get this horrendous and horrific crime but\nWe also have an interest any rules based international system\nAnd that means that we cannot allow countries to kill Washington Post journalists were even abducted Washington Post journalist the way that the Saudis have just done\nThey have ... if this is true this is what the Iranians do this is what the Russians do this work the ropes of the world to the people who have an interest in undermining that liberal international order and in that respect\nSaudi Arabia does need to pay a very significant consequences detour them from doing that I Do not think that means\nThat we we think the fundamental us Saudi alliance as bad as this particular thing is and it does not necessarily negate the reforms of their younger crown prince who was finally doing a lot of things that we have one of the Saudis to do for decades\nWhich is allowing women to drive allowing halls have movie theaters are allowing some private investment and their oil companies and finally doing something about the radical hate filled Islamic\nFundamentalism that comes from a lot of their mosques and they're kind of clerical establishment so all of those reforms are a good thing\nBut it comes with a really ugly ugly side as well and this is not the first example of it we've seen a number of crackdowns of of of dissidents in Saudi Arabia people who do not deserve that treatment\nIt's something we see with you know a el Sisi and you can say you know we're choosing between some bad options but the Saudis need to understand that they've really crossing the line here to somebody who was an American resident went on an American citizen wrote for the Washington Post ... I mean as a journalist I'm nauseated by it and we can't happen\n[noise] yeah I think the president's got a step it up and get some answers because uh you know he's been attacking the press allies had

o'clock on Wednesday morning that means it's time for a farmer ... good morning and thank you for joining us again today\nPresident Trump did announce year around availability of the Fifteen yesterday in Council Bluffs Iowa and evidently\nThe anti ethanol groups were well organized and ready to go with their anti ethanol messaging all I've been hearing on the news channels this morning is our air is going to be dirtier in the summer because of the higher ethanol content\nAnd if I were you guys I'd get some mechanic training and open up a shock because evidently\nThree quarters of the cars on the road or about to break down\nIt's amazing to me how willing the big media outlets are to believe the ads I as an old messaging I've even heard a reference to the old food versus fuel argument this morning good grades\nAnd we'll talk trade agreements there has been some good news we got it and we need more good news and guys\nDon't forget this the tariffs on USA products remaining in place in retaliation\nAgainst us\nTariffs on steel and aluminum imports are still in place we'll talk about how this could impact the second round of the market so patient programmed payments and weather\nHarvest yuck we'll get\nBoth guards rubble Iowa\nWhere you're writing from bringing you are dealing with the wars and we want to be fair to the conversation\nIf you got a question or comment

that way I'll be sure to see it right now let's turn it over to Betsy given how are you a Betsy\nI'm doing All right Jeff how are you good wet soggy yup yup you know it was almost hard\nTrying to figure out what all I could put new today because there's so much going on\nOkay well we probably better get right to it then what are you ...\nYeah let's get to it first let's talk about these potential payment or let's start off here think secretary Sonny Perdue interviewing and telling Reuters that USDA's twelve billion dollar aid package\nThe Trump care if a program designed offset former losses from tariffs could end up shrinking after an updated NAFTA agreement at us MCA was struck\nAnd that that is what I haven't got my faith because the way a set up\nA you know there's nothing there but that market that we watch those are those illegal waiver why can't we get that back that's not that hard to do in that belongs to us\nIt will happen I don't\nUnderstand people\nEspecially corn farmers are\nSplit up their credit litter grateful and I don't want to keep it was a rather than like you know well what the green you wouldn't even have a broadcaster Phil\n[laughter] PJ what what I saw your name came come up on the screen I knew that this was going to be the issue it is a great issue that don't want to get to what the guys so thanks for putting that on the agenda buddy\nWhile I appreciate the up and the lady that you have\nOn and the farmer or um but yeah you know are the only one that I Will say hey out front\nAnd we need I Will keep it there was totally okay\nKeep it there he Jake thanks buddy appreciate the call in and get that on the agenda now let's bring in our farmers for the farm reform we've got five birds all for northwest Missouri how are you Bob\nDoing very well are you doing chip we do it okay to rain but we didn't get flooded out a feeling very lucky okay so how's your harvest progress looking\nOr fifty percent done thereabouts on corn or we didn't have any beans ready yet so uh we haven't touched to being yet there'd been a few beings cowed around but we haven't cut any\nSo how are the beans handling the water that you've had\nA ours was planted a little later tonight\nAnd but we haven't cut any\nSo how are the beans handling the water that you've had\nA ours was planted a little later and I saw some of the pictures floating around on Twitter this morning so I Do a quick field check because I figured you'd asking\nAre still looks to be in pretty good shape because like I said we wasn't ready to cut yet so they hadn't got dry down so I think maybe the pot a little more or less ... city and to um to where they're not\nUm getting beat around quite as bad as maybe what some of those that was about ready to cut a band\nThat's good to hear Dennis Bogart south central Iowa how are you this morning Dennis\nUh I'm wet [laughter] yeah very wet it's frustrating and and uh\nThan has been a tough couple of days so\nYeah uh how much you've you've got done Dennis\n... we we luckily we have gotten something done um amazingly with as much water as we do ... I've had I'm\nI'm about fifty almost fifty percent done with my bean\nAnd depending on\nWhat happens with some corn on the river bottom 'cause we got river bottoms flooded again and water\nVery very very close to the IRS I'm somewhere between thirty and forty percent done with corn so we're we're lucky to have even that done I think but um it's gonna be a while a long while before we're back in the field so\nYeah Dennis I'm a it matter of fact I just got another update on this or a ... a group text messaging that's going on between me and some farmers up here in northeast Iowa here this morning they're starting to see the sprouting on the corn I'm at the bus or the year are you experiencing any of that\n[noise] um I haven't seen it I'm ... you know the last two days on the corn so bad um we had some sprouting actually from the rain that we got September um I did find some um about two weeks ago\nUm where it had sprouted just a little bit on the bus of the year um the the worst things the beans right now the beans or him in bad shape we're\nWe're seeing a lot of pods breaking open and I'm a lot of um a lot of beans that lodged I'm from the big rain in September um early September um they're those beans are just going flattering flatter and\nI I got I got beans that probably work that we're going to yield a bushel that are almost land flat on the ground and I'm not sure how I'm going to pick them up so um\nIt's it's it's a sad Dean I it's sad\nYeah because it was such a good crop and now you get when you get to the point that you're questioning the integrity\nOf the pot and whether they can hold on to the bean long enough to get it into the combine that's when you really start to get nervous about feels last\nYeah and you know I even so far away so far yesterday to start looking at the um I I don't really want to have to spend the money but I went to go look for a grape or had yesterday to thinking well maybe that's that's going to be a way to get some of these beans and um you know it it's it's only going to get\nWorse as as they dry out I think they're a pop even worse and um and then there and we've seen beams on the top of the plants I'm you open the open up the the pot and and their sprout and then the pod so yeah um it's just it's not it's not pretty around here\nYeah guys all of you know Dan is you know what kind of a guy is he's not the guy but Dennis you can hear the frustration in your voice over this ... that it's heartbreaking over\nWhat's going on with that being proud let's bring in Steven Alice out in Virginia a Steven when you hear the guys in Missouri and I always talk about rain do you kind of grand\nOh no I don't ever want anybody to have a bad time for a time but\nYeah we we we've been getting a lot of rain also um [noise] we um we had over fifty five inches now when the growing season\nAnd um so we lose ground it out a lot of crops\nBegin with and then it kept all rainy and but we were able to get a Cornell which we start earlier than most in August and um so we got done with that a week or so ago started on the dean's knocked the\nIn those real early beans are the ones that had damaged for us if we can get through them the um double crop beans of course to at least on them up till now so they're not going to be damaged as much as you know but we've got four or five hundred acres that were pretty bad shape\nYeah Stephen tell us about Hurricane Florence or what but it was like going through that because it it was just torrential rain on you up there wasn't it\nIt was but we were\nJust a hundred miles further north than where they really you know caught it wrong\nWe had um we had you know two to three inches of rain and all that but we had had multiple four and five inch rains all summer so I'm not one that when we don't remember as well as some of the others that you know this cane down thunderstorms that just came down you know in streams through\nTime and you drive fifty miles in either direction and wasn't quite as bad and the crop showed it to you know I Wish spread over fifty miles in the crops were from a standing to completely devastated you know\nRight right I Want to go back to the dentist on this because I Know that he's very are active in the er bio fuels and in a supporting that uh uh we got the Fifteen announcement Dennis but\n... you know what the Jane was talking about on those waivers that is an issue that we still need to address isn't it\n[noise] yeah it'd be really nice if we could um if we can get some resolution on that it's it has affected the um [noise] the or fs and and the biofuels industry greatly and\nUm you know the Fifteen I you know it's I it it's good news but um it's it's kind of a band aid that a little bit I guess to\nUm you know I'm not sure what how much you Fifteen going to help this whole situation in biofuels but um they need to they need to take a hard look at the waivers and and figure out a way to fix this because it's it's not helping the industry right now\nYeah no doubt about it we do need to fix those waivers and and I think now Bob that we've got a Fifteen now don't you think that the groups will be pursuing some some resolution on the waivers\nI with thanks so you know like everybody says that's been the biggest drawback and it was kinda sneaky they way they got 'em down anyway so hopefully they will get in there and get started on it but it may be one of these steel since the elections are so tight they're not going to do a whole lot to make any oil\nAnybody that's in oil country and get maybe get them in trouble so it may be another one of those things it won't get a lot and for it until after the elections are over with\nRight Steven what do you think about this announcement on e Fifteen\nI'm going to take a little different note just because you got the cover is um I I really am glad that they've done it of course but if we could\nI'm going to take a little different note just because you got the other covered is um I I really am glad that they've done it of course but if we could just get the um adoption of it in and then have you know five percent more than I used\nI think it would fix a lot of other problems also yeah um [noise] I think it's gonna be a slow process as often as she gets you know two sons that all the stations using he'll once that happens if we can you know literally you know jump the usage of fifty percent and of course that'll help in the long\nAbsolutely it well and I want to talk a little bit more about the adoption and the messaging that is out there in the market right now will do that next on the farm reform heroin agra talking\nAnd farming getting things done early has a way of setting you up for success like using corpus for an early season when over weeds tourists keeps even the toughest weeds from gaining a foothold\nA soil more fluid where it'd be easier to blend in wintertime would help them out as much as anything\nYeah you know one of the suggestions diverted blended with a little bit of ethanol\n[laughter] editor improves the the blending\nSo I don't know that'd be great\nYeah would no doubt hey let's go I'd switch gears here a little bit let's talk about those markets association payments are starting to show that she was telling us that\nThat uh a secretary who had an interview with Reuters and in the interview he was talking about re evaluating the second tranche of or the second round of payments under the markets association program\nNow as as I read the article\nRead it as this is only pertains to\nThe second round of payments the first round of payments that are expected\nDon't think they're touching those those are going to stand as have been announced is that your guys read on that let's start with Dennis\n[noise] yeah I I guess I haven't heard anything otherwise on the first tiny but so I\nI'm Still going kind of going with a function of the first round of the payment is sticking where it was and quite honestly I I wasn't you know I wasn't hold and hold my breath for the second round payment I was hoping it will be there but if it's if it's not I wasn't\nYou know I mean it was kind of build as a you know if it's there will pay up but if not you may not get it kind of deal anyway I guess but um I I guess I haven't heard anything any different for the first round\nEight Dennis edge set aside here you are talking about looking at at Draper\nNow those ... those muscles that you might be leaving out there in the uh in the field\nThat would reduce your M. S. P. payment as well because it's best known actual bushels\nDefinitely and that was one of the reasons we have we had beams down in the river bottom and as soon as we could drive through you know we kind of knew we were in the sweat spell as soon as we could get through the river bottom here about two weeks ago um I went and combine the two hundred acres or a hundred and eighty acres of beans and the river bottom\nAnd there's there's a lot of water sitting on that river bottom now so I'm you know I'm Glad I went and got those beams because\nUm I I had a neighbor that had been down there and we were talking about that you know if you don't go get them and we don't get the water pumped off you're not going to get that payment and and so I mean it's yeah and all those beans or losing um that's that's you're not going to get the payment on so\nRight Steven is that your read on on a produce comments that it can get there won't be any impact on the first round of payments but this\nIf we would see some progress towards lifting the terrorists you know and the thing that bothers me though is that secretary produced said something about us MCA having an impact on those payments when in reality

crude oil futures seemed to erase buying interest for much of the market for today's trade\nThe the memories kind of flash through your mind my first year my freshman year at Iowa State on October tenth we had snow in Ames, Iowa\nOh so you know it it has happened it's happened before but you know I I mean you can't look back at history and and the fact of history and and fight climate change or anything like that so you know [laughter] you're right\nNow as the sun will come out now I'm sure you know the beans will be okay right now I I'm really avoiding going and drive around and looking at him because some of the reports I've had is that they they push the beans down pretty hard and their land flat with a bunch of snow on them but I I don't know being bounced back after snow or not it was one of those things I didn't really hoped to find out\nLike farming career but I guess I'm going to ask you are yes you are you doing\nThis this crop west of the Mississippi this being crop let's talk that first because it it's gone through\nSince it drop leaves and got ready to harvest it's gone it's been through a lot already and some of that is starting to show up in the quality and and uh the harvest ability as as being crop\nAnd you know you're right it sure has it's amazing how it's flip to\nAnd I think that's why producers west of the Mississippi River so frustrated with this cold wet jury whether because during the late summer we thought we are going to have such an early harvest yields you're going to be good we're going to be done with everything in October and be able to enjoy the first snow and [laughter] sure\nSure the heck isn't the case here I think I had a speaking engagement on September eleventh and after I said yes to it we got a little worried in his office like what am I thinking we're going to be harvesting by then well we've got about fifty acres of beans out so far and that was like two and a half weeks ago and haven't moved to combine sense so there's a lot of harvest to go out here\nYeah there there's certainly is and you know I don't mean to rub salt in anybody's lanes here\nBut Lee leaving beans on the ground in a bean field this year\nYes it hurts because of last year old but when you throw on top of that that M. S. P. payment the markets association program came at a buck sixty five on fifty percent of the beans\nAre and it's actual actual production it's you can't count the beans that are laying on the ground out there it kind of it ... it kinda knocked it twice\nIt kind of does doesn't it you know ... you know we're talking about this crop as if it's a disaster and of course like you and I both know it's not it's got a heck of a good crop out there but\nLittle bit further to the west west of Aberdeen South Dakota we've got some guys that don't have much of a crop um they're the ones that have harvest it so far because it was dry down early due to drought and you'll to twenty to twenty five bushels an acre those poor guys need that payment more than anyone and they're not going to get much because it's based off of this year's production like you mentioned\nEverything that's going on with this being crop and and when I say everything I mean everything let's let's look at the market let's look at the harvest conditions was look at the growing season everything that you guys went through up in the northwest production area this year ... what does it mean for next year or what's the attitude going into next year on a ...\nAnd the attitude is pretty important I could have thrown a phone call they took 'em a concern that's for sure um\nBut I I don't know if it's that horrible you know that it's farming right we're not\nWe're literally not supposed to make money every single year because we sell something based on supply and demand if we made money every year means we produce more of it and it it's just it doesn't work that way economy does not work that way so\nNo honestly if we can get out there and we will will get this crop off you add that payment then they're the yield that we're looking at\nIt we will be okay so in all the additives aren't that bad you know as far as the acres go for next year wow a lot of question marks and I I mean obviously people aren't crazy excited about beans and they're thinking corn but gosh you know they switched from corn beans last year in North Dakota and\nI don't know a lot of questions of what's going to get planted I Know the only worse job than a broker today is probably that seed salesman that's\nDriving around this time of year trying to get guys devices eat today 'cause I bet you that didn't work very well in my area today [laughter]\nYeah no question about that no question okay let's start to get everybody ready for tomorrow's crop production supply and demand report here the wind the average straight guess on the being ill\nAh this is a cording to a Bloomberg I'm a let's say I'm Sorry no this is a writer survey of analyst\nOr soy beans the average ... fifty three point three bushels per acre USDA back in September was fifty two point eight bushels per acre a crop\nFour point seven three three up from four point six nine three you know there's a forty million Bush will add on onto that from from that increase in the ... you'd like those numbers\nOr I don't like 'em but I don't think there are far off in fact that a lot of the talk this morning on the trade was that that half of Bush will increase that Reuters have isn't enough um [noise] I think it might be closer to one point zero bushels an acre increase so I'm going to put out like a fifty three point eight Bush will maker for tomorrow's report\nYou take that ad in the new stocks that we've found from last year's crop and\nSadly that production numbers swells a little bit more than that Indian stock that's already a record gets even bigger doesn't it I I'm\nPushing does it get all the way to ... billion under that scenario\nOn on mine it doesn't quite a hundred and Seventy you could just we'll call it a billion dollars yeah\nYeah absolutely what do you what are you thinking on usa because ... Jim ... former policy analyst last week on the free for all alone agra talk asked me well but what about crushed capacity aren't we bumping up against crush capacity already\nI and my answer was you know every time that I think we're at capacity we do better in the next month\nOr so came we crushed more than ... were crushing in the Eighteen Nineteen marketing here\nI don't know I Am a little bit more but I'm with you I I thought we we should've max capacity back in July when you saw how much they were making use you should be ... operating at full capacity then like you said we tend to increase it about ten or five million bushels\nEver report I don't think so I I guess us day last month the editor what two point zero seven billion I'm going to leave it there for a city I I don't think we can crush anymore every crush a little bit more great but what five or ten million more bushels are they going to be a drop in the bucket\nSadly you know and in this crush number for the uh Eighteen Nineteen marketing you're doing\nIt it doesn't seem like there's a lot of movement that's going to take place in the crush the number I don't care if we end up at fifty one we could still be a two point oh seven I don't care for at fifty five we could still be a two point oh seven\nYep I agree with you I I think that number is just going to stay there that the question\nFor at fifty five we could still be a two point oh seven\nYeah yep I agree with you I I Know that number is just going to stay there that the question is comes in with the exports um yup and up tomorrow I\nI don't think they're going to change it tomorrow but I understand the bears and the trade saying that it sure could are\nI mean what China basically digging in their heels and of course we are as well that's our big buyer out there I Know are replacing China right now with different countries buying but I I'm just a little bit nervous that they're buying just because it's such a good deal right now building their supplies [noise] I don't think we can really replace China so\nEventual we could drop exports you know fifty Seventy five million bushels\nWow that that would hurt\nThat would hurt or if if we do all of that if we would do that obviously that you are over a billion bushels on your being Terry\nRight Yup I end up with two columns I ended up with what I think tomorrow is going to be in my book final and yeah the final I I got exports lower end my end in stock above above that dreaded billion bushels market share to tackle that\nIs what do you what do you have in there for your final being you\nKnow even though you're not going to ask you well sure sure\nNo absolutely that's the name of the game and we'll see how wrong am I I'm an increase of tomorrow by that one ... and then I think it's going to get even bigger than that I I I don't know that's\nThe deal that are coming in and out a place like Illinois or just huge I've got a fifty four point five right now well plus or minus maybe I'm wrong but it just it wasn't shocked me if it was fifty five bushels an acre\nYeah yeah man I tell you what a when we were out their third week of August taken a look at a corn and soybean crafts on the pro former corrupt or when we came back\nWe were awfully impressed with with that being crop as as I think everybody you know we we were very impressed with it I just feel like well there's been crop has gone through the last couple of weeks and here I ...\n... you know that it and I agreed join and I do agree it is hard for late season issues to take\nA lot of the being crop into being ill [noise] but I just wonder if this doesn't knock\nA half a bushel or Bush a lot of Iowa\nKnock a bushel often Nebraska knock a bushel off of Minnesota and whole that whole that a deal back\nAnd keep it close to fifty three so anyway okay that's means we got to get to corn we got to get so we were going to do that next with Wayne Bucky right here on the [noise]\nCurrent price times one thousand acres carry the one of these days it's hard to make\nThe math word for your ... feels to be a chef liberty when system with liberty herbicides\nBut those terrorists that are in place on us soybeans going into China there they are in retaliation for the two hundred and that that that\nSection two thirty two terrorists that we put on steel and aluminum coming into the country if we wanted to get rid of those tariffs on us beans I mean the first step is left in the tariffs on steel and aluminum right\n[laughter] probably but I think that money that our our president is not going to do that they think we're we're at a battle Europe who's more stubborn near a poet us or China and I [laughter]\nI'm a little worried how long it could tape to figure it out earlier in the summer I thought oh by fall will get it figured out and maybe we still will if you've noticed lately China's soybean futures market\nThe soybean meal is actually at record highs now and there's soybean futures are following rather closely because Brazil though the beans and and they need more beans right now and\nThey're too stubborn to buy from us so prices have to go higher you know that's all supply and demand work so [noise] hopefully that put some pressure on their domestic\nSupply or their domestic need and maybe they push to get a deal done but I I don't know it doesn't look very good right now do that\nNo it doesn't and and uh the the other thing that we need to keep in mind is we've got to watch the the people of time we need to watch the level of civil unrest that is going on in China and if\nIf the African ... takes a big enough bite out of their port supply or or pushes a pork prices high enough or whatever and now they've got bird flu that they're having to deal with two ... those are the kinds of things that that I think could get the two sides back together and talking again\nAnd to deal with two ... those are the kinds of things that that I think could get the two sides back together and talking again\nI don't think it's going to be anything that President G. or President Trump do or the trade teens it it's going to China may have their hand forced by what's going on among the populist in China\nI I agree with you a hundred percent you know we got to wash their stock market to if there's dark goes\nDown and you know then maybe their their hand as far as like the here's another thing we've got to watch Brazil's weather now right now they look pretty good for starting Clinton soybeans but what happens if they start to have some weather problems with this supposedly just another record crop we can just time stamp but now All right I don't know mother nature's definitely due to say something about this\nYou know maybe they don't have to buy or beans they can wait for self my what a South America doesn't have a record drop them they might have to come to deal with us\nYou know a few people have mentioned that\nOkay and I've always been a it's too early it's too early it's too early to be taking too much about a a Brazilian weather\nBut because of the sensitivity that we are going to have to the Brazilian production level this year because of what you just said Brazil's out to be ... anyway uh we're we're going to pay very very close attention to what's going on down there in South America this year\nIt seems like it's a bigger deal every year but that is true this year because of the situation I just mentioned I mean men if\nThey they can still raise a record crop that's fine but what if somewhere in between they start to get dry for a two week stretch here boy I bet you China would start to get really nervous about hey I thought you said don't worry just wait till Brazil comes what if they don't have a crop and and all hell could break so it's I don't know it's fun times in marketing that's for sure\nYeah yeah no doubt okay a look bottom line this week in the last minute and a half that we've got here so uh what are you thinking there all week\nI you know when you're probably not a whole lot of changes in the one change that that I could see coming sadly is I Would totally understand if you as they would back off the exports because\nWe're way behind pays we keep waiting for Russia to fall out and we're just not seeing if we did have that sale to was a Bangladesh or something earlier this week it's nice to see some sort of flash sale\nSo I I Am afraid that uh export demand might back off like twenty five million bushels\nAnd carry on still high I mean\nObviously we're still going to be over nine hundred so I don't see any big market changers into we report tomorrow the\nBigger thing might be to watch is like Australia will they drop their production because I think they should um Russia or will they drop how much they're really going to export\nWe'd I'm Talking like it's all bearish here but I'm not a seller who here I'm more of a buyer because of things like um the bubble mentioned earlier the money flowing into commodity that I think we closer to a bottom here and and could grind dire\nOkay um you know we didn't talk a whole lot about what bubble was talking about what bothers been talking about for quite some time on the show is every Wednesday and that is that the rotation of money out of the equities and and into commodities you do you buy into that\nI absolutely by and do it because I played the markets long enough to experience how badly they can make me a fundamental trader look ugly especially in soybeans soybeans I talked very bearish in the first segment here about soybeans\nAnd but I don't think they just fall out of bed here and go to seven bucks I think they're stuck in a trading range all the way from eight twenty five to nine Fifteen because of money flow but what I'm saying is we've got a huge supplier so if we get a rally to nine Fifteen on nearby futures\nTake that time to capture the carry in the markets sellout to July because even if we get a trade deal done ship we're all going to have a record amount of soybeans here\nThere you go that is a great way to end it right there when you get a pop and the market the way\nYou got to be take you got to be looking to take advantage of and that means having your orders in place and ready to roll on at the wind I always appreciate it have on shoveling snow thanks a lot of that story and the up
