and Robert ...\nYour organization\nEarns its way to the postseason earns its home games in a playoff run\nIs totally ridiculous an unacceptable that when you're on the west coast when you're a west coast organization\nThat because of the market sizes of New York and Boston and filling your fan base doesn't get the opportunity to see you play has a take off work as a pulled the kids out of school that there is a burden on the west coast teams that doesn't apply to these costs let me explain\nIt makes me pretty angry the Dodgers today for a lot of like oh early game on the east coast cool five o'clock\nAnd I love I Love living out here the world's is not revolve around the east coast it's a great big country the Dodgers are based in the city called Los Angeles California there on this thing Adam Silver or she's me Robert Mann credit called\nPacific time it's two o'clock in the afternoon on a Wednesday\nHave season tickets or really they share season tickets and you get for refusing to buy playoff tickets well they had to pull their kids out of school I think her fourth grade school we got to make that choice you have to take a day off work most of us can't do that that is ridiculous and obnoxious and if you watch the sort of the game today\nSo Dodger Stadium empty in huge parts that is an unfair reality for the Dodgers it's a noxious of that fan base it's a notch that organization\nCan you imagine if Red Sox Yankees was on at two in the afternoon on the east coast on a Thursday help people would freak out in New York it would dominate every single\nESPN northeast based media conglomerate be on every sports talk radio show\nSome of the shows and this network would talk about it for three or four straight hours peddling their show there'll be outrage nobody even gives a damn that it's the west coast is obnoxious and by the way it's not just baseball one of the things that I thought was horrifying Lee unfair to the war the warriors of oracle arena\nHave such an incredible advantage with that\nFan base is electric in is it's really cool those fans are into it\nAnd every year the finals take place on a weekday\nThey start the game it's five or five thirty in the air yesterday it takes two or three hours to get from downtown San Francisco to oracle arena if you're on the wrong side of the water if you have to cross get on the bridge go across to Oakland\nAnd there'll be times where I Would show up in the second half of driving the second half covered again are becoming familiar to me two hours to get there an oracle arena would be three quarters full the times when I went early I didn't have a radio or I got out early\nIt'd be tip off in the place to be half empty hardworking\nFans people again it's been a bunch of their own money\nHad to try to get off work early couldn't do it and had to battle traffic trying to sneak out of four thirty to make it by six thirty four or five o'clock tip off what a joke it's a joke Adam Silver Robert Mann Fred the fans in those markets should come first before your TV numbers figure it out man\nSt per Yankees antique advance should be able to watch games at six or seven at night local time\nBecause they've earned that\nAre being the brewers five one right now but the fact of Los Angeles Dodgers\nWho are in the in the ass and throw it to the mound the best picture of his generation at home at Dodger Stadium one of the iconic sports venues in America six years in a row that they have\nWon their division they were a game away from the world series last year something now that the Yankees nor the red Sox and claim and they've got to start at two o'clock on a Wednesday during the school year are you kidding me\nThat as a joke that is ridiculous it takes way home field advantage it takes away fans opportunity to see them in person and it's disrespectful to those markets\nFigure it out NBA scheduled differently figure it out major league baseball schedule differently\nAnd I live I mean I live here I live on the east coast it's pretty nice for me oh five o'clock pool I can watch an hour before the show starts watch while I'm doing radio but it's not about me it's not about New York it's not about Miami it's not about Charlotte it's not about Boston\nYou're a west coast team and you are in the right to try and win a championship you should be able to play games at the local time they're supposed to play that I find it really really are putting in really obnoxious and out ... and again this is not a shot at New Yorkers not us out of the east coast\nBut people here would not insured would not stand for it if it happened in New York City\nI mean forget Yankees Boston Yankees Astros at two o'clock on a Wednesday people will be losing their minds\nIt is a double standards it's not just by the way that double standard should should not apply Milwaukee, Wisconsin it should not apply and Kansas City Missouri it should not apply in Houston, Texas it should not apply it to ... to make a run in Oklahoma City Oklahoma but Los Angeles California in San Francisco California\nLA is the media capital of the world the second biggest market in this country San Francisco is the ...\nSan Francisco California LA is the media capital of the world the second biggest market in this country San Francisco is the technological center of earth of this world is one of the five biggest markets in America are you kidding me\nIs a noxious by Adam Silver is a noxious by Robert Mann Fred and somebody should be offended on behalf of the people who are out there who are fans who work hard and beyond that beyond just like the insult to the market and I I have a particular affinity for Dodgers fans 'cause I did radio there\nDodger's fan and like every every place in America has rich people and poor people right like I Know there's there's people that go down to see their trust individual that go to work all the Dodgers fans is such a ... and I love going to get my ... I'm a cubs fan but first games ever took my kids to dodger's games I Lived in LA and there were\nSo many kids so many families families to work really hard and we all sort of spend the money we have a we make choices right a lot of families in Los Angeles make the decision to spin tickets spend their money excuse me on season tickets to go to dodger's games or split it up with\nWell it's not whether it's right or wrong I mean I I just think that uh you know some guys I mean listen I threw the guy running out of the first base line through ball the stands and I've done some crazy stuff that I regret um I don't think he's a dirty guy I just think he's a hard nose guy that when he gets a chance to kind of\nA lead his mark on yet he's going to do it and that biking somebody at second base or you know clipping you down to earth baseline here's how you stop it his team and you can't do it in the postseason uh so you're going to probably wait till spring training or a another chance\nNext year you have to police that and that and that's your opportunity to do that on the heart of white that up and within the team I mean that that\nIf if I had dark but let's say Eric Davis didn't want to hustle or very Larkin didn't want to hustle you were a little beyond that guy so hard for the next week two weeks until he ran out every ball is orders he could so\nThat those are all things that could be fixed if his teammates or ... and I I don't know bill I've been out of the game or a I don't think there's a lot of teams that really you know get downright guys like that I see with Gary ...\nAnd the Yankees not runner falls out are Bryce Harper and the national or you can find these guys but they make so much quality or you can our discipline them but the only way to do it is to have the guy's a leak themselves in that locker room and if they're not going to do that then you know what\nThen then you're never going to see that stop you're going to have at least ... that he doesn't want to ... but you know I saw him hustling scored the winning run last night so he hosts or needs to\nRob people here on the show did did you gave up a home run to a guy let's say as many Machado and he's doing the money's sign is your perspective I shouldn't let the guy hit a homerun or is your perspective next year and the regular season I'm throwing in that guys back\nNo I mean because I didn't hit that many guys I I'd much rather strike you out that it's you but\nMy perspective would be just enjoy it because you're never going to hit another one and I would I Would be damned if I let somebody hit another one off the so\nFor me it was more of a personal thing you weren't you weren't embarrassing be you know but if you're an embarrassment to like him then I have I have to really you and that and that comes out you try to hurt my teammates whether you're hitting\nLet's say or her size or when he hit three ... three times one game yeah I came in I hit like arts and he didn't hit Eric again\nA or if it was a dentist Martinez kept hitting our guys he hit three times and again we hit him every time he got up there like you know there's ways of picking guys stop doing stupid things or trying to hurt a guy second base like one time a guy like dark our second baseman in the hip\nYou jumped into them and he basically did a karate kid you know next time the guy came up we drove them the next time I went to their place I drove them so it's it's a question of you know on your team a respects you enough to protect you and I think that you know in years past you know it was no question now there's guys are just they're they're not able to do that anymore\nRobbed nibble here on the show dibs what do you make I Want to get into the brewers sort of approach in terms of their pitching staff and I want to start it was the surprise today why wait Molly goes out of the announced starter\nThrows to one better ... walks him obviously gave robbers and the Dodgers did their line at the Dodgers in particular around the idea that Miley was the guy they were going to face for at least a few innings and the brewers\nAnd obviously the robbers and the Dodgers did their line at the doubters in particular around the idea that Miley was the guy they were going to face for at least a few innings [laughter] and the brewers pull them they're gonna start him on friday ... what do you make of that kind of gamesmanship for Milwaukee that kind of approach\nWell they they've been doing that opener thing now for a while and so from other teams and and it you know if it works and you get to the world series it's great\nUm I thought what was amazing guy basically through six innings any good about what our guard\nOr the other one is ah or see a a throwing the ball away and and led to another on her run but you know they've got some are that open that could be starters but other than that trying to get a right handed heavy wind up up against ...\nAnd then bringing in ... um\nI thought it was great Greek gamesmanship if it works um you know\nSometimes it does sometimes it doesn't it right now uh with the Dodgers I don't know what the latest was five pages on your hands down\nYeah it just doesn't seem to be working on one losing the game so yeah it looks great Tampa Bay did it for a little bit\nBut it's how long can you keep doing this in a seven game series until the arms fall off the receivers and that that's my biggest worry\nAnd you're you're you know putting a lot of these relievers into you know career threatening physicians\nEarlier than they should be and a lot of guys are going down injuries a lot of guys are burning out quicker and you know the managers in upper management those and really care and that that bothers me because I had an injury plagued Jordan career so I'm more worried about the relievers and the long term effect of doing this open or stuff\nSo ... what would you have done if you were you were closer with a hell of an arm if you were in this generation and management came and said look man here's the deal in the playoffs in particular you are going to come in and the second to the third of the fence and we need to go if you can a couple innings you just take them out and that's the deal or ... would you push back privately\nNo it wouldn't have bothered me because when I first came in uh in my early ... I started for two years and I had a great arm and I could go all day and throw up in in one of the reason I got kind of putting the whole thing was it took me ten pitches it gets sent pitches or less the warm up and\nYou throw in Ninety five miles an hour and it was terrible at least to throw you miss the boat and\nBefore game you know so they they were at that time kind of transition into the guys had read arms\nWe'll put them in the pen because of the big leagues you know we had a lot of great storms and resurrection city so I I just think that you now have a a shortage of starting pitchers and I agree with that and I think the the fourth and fifth guys and a lot of patients\nShould be the major leagues and I think you know it was great when you're home with the five main rotation when\nYou know three or four of those guys are pretty decent and then ... you were great\nNow it's about five guys and you're both in our great arms in about three guys the rotation are really get arms and then the other guys are just kind of in their holding their placed on the ... you know there's a big shortage in pitching if I if I could do it all over again\nOr I Want to have my son left handed and try to get them or to pitch left and playing football and and lacrosse but no I mean you know that's what they need the major leagues right now they need pitching they need guys in a you know have interests but there's just not a lot a lot of talent out there I mean look list David twice I mean\nIt doesn't matter if you pay a guy two hundred million dollars a year once once it's crunch time is that guy can't perform for you it it doesn't matter how great his arm is\nTalking to a robbed nibble here on the show ... let me premises of curves on through a gym today yelling God the Dodgers a three to ... I ... I Love I Love watching them play\nBut the guy is not been very good in the postseason relatives over the rest of his career and whenever I Am of Afghanistan who are ... inclined they push back pretty aggressively my perspective that that's a reality for Clinton and it's probably going to move him for his legacy to overcome that\nWhat's your view on a plate and ... and just guys in general and whether you believe in the idea that some guys just don't play as well and the pressures on versus the regular season\nWell and you and me are on the same wavelength because if you look up a Andy Pettitte jumped small groups showing this to be the greatest season pitchers ever\nAnd if you look at a Clinton per show up David Price Tom gladman Greg Maddox\nA WD below five hundred or way below five so I I I think it's a question of when you get to the post season now you're facing\nA maybe seven or eight guys in a line up that are no longer just\nA easy targets in out although they are striking alarming rate there is also game changing guys they could still hit home runs\nA opposite field a like a GED Martinez so you know a guy like that if you make one mistake and I don't care if you're ... Shaw or ah you know Christian Bale or anybody you know we have a lot more game changers I Believe in the game today than when I was playing so uh my money\nIt's a question of you know what are you looking for in the postseason\nA guy is effectively while which I kind of light like shelling or he could he could get away every now and then so ...\nSo you had uncomfortable with that I don't think Chris show makes you uncomfortable in that he chose a lot of strikes David Price you doesn't make you uncomfortable when you're up there much every major comfortable glove and neck regional up so about seeing three hundred three hundred and fifty when\nI'll be it was amazing during their careers and got him into the hall of fame or you know what makes you will lead to like a jak mores or a child smokes or an Andy Pettitte is what you do in the postseason\nRobbed him all you're on the show just I just kind of ran through on this and I'll be very here's your perspective you you and I met in LA you lived in the on the west coast you obviously played in the majors I don't know why man it just it annoys the hell out of me that\nWhen the warriors are in the finals they're going to start games at five o'clock and their fans can't make it and the Dodgers had her first pitch on a Wednesday with the best pitcher in the regular season baseball at two o'clock and I probably a little angry 'cause I have friends whose kids couldn't go to gain their tickets 'cause they were in school\nDo you think major league baseball needs to do something about the fact in Los Angeles is the second biggest market in the country and they're starting games so early that Dodger Stadium is half empty at first Beijing a playoff game\nGet all your opening information that could save you thousands of dollars a year or a month depending\nOn how much you owe direct the more you over the more you can save all you need to oh ten thousand dollars or more in credit card debt medical bills or department store debt to qualify so cool for free debt forgiveness information now at eight hundred ... seven eighty five fifty eight that's eight hundred to oh seven eighty five fifty eight\nDiscovered the secret to having your credit card debt forgiven coal eight hundred ... seven eighty five fifty eight eight hundred to a seven eighty five fifty eight\nCBS Sports radio is on and northeast Nebraska on AM seven eighty five point nine FM news talk W JAG north of\nSan\nJuan hard evidence signed least sound like Sarah Fox news the pressure is mounting on Saudi Arabia for an answer as to what happened to a journalist you among show gay turkey claims lab recording that was murdered reports\nToday that he was butchered alive during that gruesome execution inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul audiotapes allegedly revealing 'cause she'll get was\nThe head it and then dismembered one tape has the Saudi official declaring quote do this outside you're going to get me in trouble another voice responds quote shut up if you want to live when you return to Saudi Arabia well the president said today he has asked for any tapes that do exist Sachs\nHas that Henry show he contributed to the Washington Post with a critic of the Saudi monarchy Texas cat Ted Cruz no fly zone and the central part of the state offering assistance to local official from my\nPerspective in in in my office at conveyed to the judge in ... in both judges that ... mile but stands ready to to assist in work with them to\nPeople confirmed dead in the flooding National Weather service has more flooding as possible and that is no rain in the forecast where the biggest budget deficit in six years President Trump pushing his cabinet to tighten your belt President Trump is requesting each cabinet secretary\nTo cut five percent from their budgets next year and\nI think if you can do more than that\nWe will be very happy there are some people said that they can afford you know there are some people that can really do substantially more than ...\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell in a session which reporters has increased spending was part of an agreement to secure more funding for the military a treasury department report this week sure they hired deficit for the fiscal year that ended last month revenues were up slightly\nAfter the tax cuts passed by Congress sock to shout house Britain Washington ...

last night game for between the Dodgers and brewers pitching was the dominant force as LA one by scores two to one and Thirteen ending\nThe Dodgers became the first seem to ever have no extra face it isn't a playoff game the last ... or more in the the one it was also the seven postseason walk off RBI Dodgers history aside from the game itself alive is made of many Machado kicking\nThe leg of brewers first baseman pages Aguilar and being called out by Christian yell at you for being a dirty player\nI mean and we've discussed this on the show\nTalked about that do agree he played a\nCollege in major league baseball for thirty nine years as we've ah we've we've we've infused with a new biography\nRob people actually did play at the major league level early on the show I around easily said that that sounds about deco played in college and it turned out not sure I don't know why I thought that it's your athletic bearing and what I thought was your humility and not talking about all the time\nBut you did you did play at a very high level high school\nAnd you do not think that the child is anything wrong\nPlay first base at very low level I Do not think much out in the wrong and robbed ... just on the show a few moments ago and he didn't think much out a really did anything long and it's a competitive situation\nAnd I think the short version is Aguilar yet you're freaking foot off of the fact that is the runners territory\nNumber three last night the red Sox okay two to one seriously over the Astros as they won by scored eight to ... to the scores tied at two heading into the sixth inning but it was all Red Sox after that as they scored six hundred runs including our grand slam by Jackie Bradley junior in the eighth inning off of Roberto sooner\nRally junior was one for Seventeen before all the eyes but the bases loaded in this past regular season here just as six postseason grand slam in Red Sox history first since shame victory noted into thousand and Thirteen\nYeah we just had a crazy place speaking of the series obviously Astros need to win and what you guys I miss it because we are doing the show who actually hit the homerun that was not a home run that became a double\nIt was a hose out today and they called him they called him out originally and I believe it I Believe Tom cramming for among I Believe they called them out\nCold on ... yeah they called ... parents they called it was it was a double originally he was on second to the ball came back into the field there was not caught that that hair and it will not touched by fan in play at all it's a terrible call yeah\nThat and that's a series changing clothes bet to win back right and tried to basically steel like make a play in the stands and he closed his glove and the ball actually hit us close glove I guess the argument you could make as it was going up against the fans outstretched hand but it's not the thing was\nMoving in between that glove and the ball is just a natural sort of like contact the bats made with the fans very very bang bang\nThat is a big called him out on that play out it's an absolutely\nTerrible call in with two teams that are this good anything can happen to the world series but clearly the red Sox and the Astros I think the general agreement and I agree with that they each of the ball club or markedly better than both the brewers and the Dodgers you're playing for very likely the world series in the series and with\nThe red Sox up to one of the series national looking for a way down to ... to tie that game that hold on what a

Adams is the second round her rental car with a third round or they got him ... this year and then their defense has always been\nNow doesn't mean that they've hit on every draft pick but their defense I remember preparing for a game to play against the Packers and two dollars and Fifteen\nAnd fifty two out of fifty three of their guys were drafted by the Packers\nThe only one who wasn't was Julius Peppers and eleven guys and they're like all of them were top for around ... so that the support that Rogers has gotten a draft wise and kind of hitting on draft picks is much different than Andrew Luck I mean Andrew Luck has had\nEd as bad of a roster to work with as any quarter back in the NFL you could probably argue say both off into the anti defensively in the last\nFour years or so so I'm no errands made up for some flaws with the ... of Andrew Luck is is certainly been kind of I guess you want to call wasted or at least from the lack of people that they've put her on him much more than air and in my opinion\nDinner last few here on the show Dan another quarterback who's been sensational and exhilarating and fun to watch Patrick homes in Kansas City when you look at the tape as you've watched him play this year what do you see in terms of what defenses can will maybe have started to do to try to slow them down\nWell right now in the homes in Kansas City is the perfect storm it's the perfect storm of quarterback plays a warrant you're taking a kid that is super talented and obviously a good player and you're taking him you took them and then you've got to that and then behind a guy like Alex Smith\nAnd there are the sets the opposite that he had he was\nHe was able to learn so much more of a ... Alex not a super talented guy he's the guy was always had to learn and\nBe fishing and throw the ball on time and understand carpet to understand pressures and so then Patrick homes got to sit behind Alex and learn how to do all that stuff and so then he got that year under his belt\nAnd now you've put them on the on the field so you're taking this super talented guy that got to learn from a very successful guy that does it a totally different way than he does\nAnd then you put them with a coach you as an absolute grasp of how to get quarter back to the plate I Level I mean if you look back there it's almost impossible to find a quarterback that did not play well under Andy Reid so you've got that variable and then you've got this off and that is absolutely loaded and so\nIt's the perfect storm of a guy that can play well you know to be honest with you bill he was just you know this kind of\nFree styling big arm super talented kid but when you watch tape he's playing quarterback and I've said this for a long time that there's a difference between being a thrower\nAnd playing quarterback you can find a lot of guys on NFL rosters that can throw the ball that can make every throw it doesn't matter if you can make every third you have to be make be able to make the appropriate throw what I mean by that as\nFit it into this window take some temple off of a ball change the trajectory of a ball sometimes\nSometimes it's you know taking a throwing the go route it as a back shoulder that it's almost you know some temple was taking off of it rather than driving as hard as you can or thrown eighty arts make the appropriate throwing so that's what's really stood out for the homes and\nWhen you're looking at it as a defense\nYou can't play them in men demand that often because at some point they've got ... they've got semi Watkins they've got Kelsey they've got their backup tighten dimitrius Harris good player they've got Kareem Hunt they had the Anthony comments and they've got Chris ... seven guys that you feel are pretty darn good players\nYou don't have enough defensive guys that play men demand against those guys you just don't there's not enough defensive backs are going to match up and feel good shows a defense according are going well I don't feel great acclaim man against these guys\nAnd then if you play zones are all kinds of mine is good enough and where they can hold the ball and some launches down fields so they are matchup nightmare and then you pay to do with the kid that is playing so well it's it's a I've said this it's almost impossible to slow down\nAnd down that that often the best so far and football this year\nDoes not have a particularly impressive defense on the other side of the equation it can rely on last year I Know a different thing different quarterback with the chief started five and a last year and faded a little bit down the stretch they won the division but they weren't the dominant team they appear to be the first five games of last season\nWhat do you think this year she's looked like down the stretch do you buy them impenetrable homes being able to make up for those defense of wools and be one of the best teams in the AFC over the course of the season\nYeah I I absolutely do\nHomes being able to make up for those defense of wools and be one of the best teams in the AFC over the course of the season\nYeah I I absolutely do I think that indeed is a very bright coach um that is is I'm hopeful he's learned from last year and what they didn't do well enough\nI also believe that and everyone knows that we're in an era now a days where a points are at a premium and if you can score him go ... how much how many of these scores the other night forty against New England and very easily could have been fifty four fifty fifty seven you know a couple of Mrs here and I've read don't pick their\nAnd you're fifty seven and so I truly feel like this theme is built for the long haul also know that they didn't play with\nYou know just in Houston and they're very weren't on the field is two best players and so um if you're if you're really looking at it and going okay once you get into the gritty of things\nAnd you get into the back into the season where did you really going to ... when you pick them against all the other teams and they see is there a team that you can sit here and go they got no shot against no there's no team\nThat you can't put them against and gone they can go hang and they're only going to continue to get better they're only going to Patrick mom's is only going to get a better grasp of what the answer is doing against them to sing with any rate so\nI Know their defense has laws um but uh I Believe that there often is good enough and once those two guys Houston and Barry get backing healthy you can figure out ways to get off the field on third down to get a turnover or something like that and they're often they'll continue to click\nDinner Laskey um my Chicago Bears went out and hired and you read and she's all kinds of coordinator and Matt nagging and now he's come in and obviously the bears despite the last weekend I think it's been a lot better a lot quicker than people thought Cleo Mac doesn't hurt in that respect\nThere's some disagreement in Chicago about what ... is or is not going to be how good he can be as upside when you look at the table you look at ... no one we know about quarterbacks and sometimes golfing other guys that can take a while to sort of find your rent them and find the right ...\nWhat do you see an image of ... in Chicago this season and going forward together\nThere may not lobster bisque you this year I I I I was very outspoken when they made some of those books in the aughts Aggie Allen Robin I'm Gabriel Trey Burton I loved it and I was like man this is going to make profound\nProgress for ... and then you could cut on the tape and the first two or three weeks as the biggest thing was\nMitchell needed to get to the point where he was just able to settle down like\nYou know you have to go back to last year in a race it and understand that you're busy he's really back to being a rookie this year 'cause he's running and all new system with a whole new coach all new players around them right so it's really freaky all over again\nAnd if you watch them on tape it was just like hey you just need to get to a point where your trust the coach and his political and the people around you and really over the last you know you go back\nThat's because the glass door and just think it's for the best thing city for a job and it looks like those are rising mortgage rates are starting to hammer the outgoing market or good soon construction of new homes thinking more than five

I was just ... a guide and I drive an air that the Dodgers three straight out CSS and they're going for two straight World Series they mean business they are a good team and now they're up\nDo you think that when one of the ... games in Milwaukee\nHere they have to fight like they did here I mean they're doing it in a very ... way I mean keep\nKeep in mind there like second and hitting home runs through the regular season behind the Yankees\nYet in this series especially at Dodger Stadium its quarterly one run over the first Twenty one in any of those first two games at Dodger Stadium\nAnd they were doing it now not with the home they one double in like the last two or three games they're doing it all scratched engulfing solid base running so this is a Dodger team we're not used to seeing and because of the way the Milwaukee Brewers are pitching them in this series\nThat's how they're pulling it off and I think a lot of people have their eyes open because again the Dodgers are doing it with a single\nSo let me ask you a curse Charlotte gray today but when he didn't look great I couldn't believe the amount of abuse seen tanks from Dodger fans Boyer they unforgiving I mean this guy is the best\nThe great I couldn't believe the amount of abuse see tanks from Dodger fan boy are they unforgiving I mean this guy is the best thing that ever happened in the Los Angeles Dodgers\nI think ... I mean basically if you look in their history or he's one of the greatest they've ever had I mean let's face facts\nIt's like Sandy ... for them and they treat him like garbage did you see that the obesity duck\nWell the problem with that is he is great during the regular season he's great during an early playoff\nBut in the ... and through some parts of the playoffs he just hasn't pitch like late in ... the one we're used to seeing throughout the regular season and he comes in with what losing\nFive out of a eight games or in the\nPlayoffs and Dodger fans are a little bit on edge especially because now ... could very well opt out at the end of this year and the ... they're wondering whether or not he could very well be making his last starting appearance in the Dodger uniform at Dodger Stadium but I'll tell you about this\nWhen you go seven innings against this Milwaukee team you strike out nine you allow only one run this is the guy they wanted to see in the postseason for years and and first shop put it together and Dodger fans certainly now breathing a sigh of relief but I can and a sense see why they were so nervous\nI'll tell you what do I honestly have you ever heard of the other team's going to this is the post season this is your playing in the playoffs for the right to a win a World Series that none of the teams that are in it or or like some ... organization they're all in there for a reason because they were good all year and their top screen top line that's\nI think Dodger fans are still bed\nIn the sense that they think this guy's most of the line every time he pitches and throw a perfect game I mean I really do feel that ridiculous tell me the bank a review will pitch while in Milwaukee on friday\nI think so because he doesn't let the outside stuff bothering me just goes in and pictures of solid performance is one of the few Dodgers especially toward the end of the year that has really been able to put together some solid starting appearances Kurt shot certainly is getting better and better and he was just awesome today but\nWere you got to start in the first series a against\nAgainst Chicago and are they just or should I say I'm the first series that they've played in against Atlanta and he just pitch really really well and I think a lot of people were surprised that the Dodgers went with Rio over ... for the number one started during the playoffs and he delivered so\nWe should do very well against a team the question is\nWhat's Milwaukee going to do or they some of the guys going to snap out of a cold slump Christian yellow tj\nHe's been in the deep freeze at Dodger Stadium in fact a lot of the guys who grew up in LA you know the the Christian yell at the new stock is is the Ryan Braun they really didn't do much at all coming back home if you will against the Dodgers\n... and bad I have to ask you about China how are you going to tell me that you didn't think that was a dirty play the other night 'cause I mean to us here he clearly it would appear to may ... uh I think he tried to hurt him\nBut he didn't kick and that's the one thing I heard originally a lot of people were saying you kicked him what he does he dragged his foot\nAnd as you could see on the replays he\nDragged it and as far as gee I didn't know where to put my feet because the guy was on the side frankly\nI don't buy that I I don't know how much of a dirty player Machado is this season for the Dodgers but in that one play he didn't look good the the look was not very good for him and as a result I don't know if they released it yet but major league baseball ended up finding them anyway so\nWe don't know how much at least last time I looked but uh baseball Saudi\nHe did it on purpose and ... it's hard to argue when you're looking at ...\nI Know it's not smart thing to do in the postseason but if I'm a brewer is I Would have beamed and I'm going to being in the first time on tonight I Would have thrown right at him because\nHe tried to hurt him and that's all there is to it\n... but he tried to blow out his ankle he tried to blow out is is leg I mean it was that simple let me ask you this\nAh ... start up a would this game in Portland I Know everybody's excited about it I think Saturday when they play on ... ... what do you think that the euphoria over LeBron and the hype that the Lakers are suddenly the team\nThat's going to challenge the warriors in the last say you really buying that\nWell keep in mind past Laker history they brought in Shaquille O'Neal uh they drafted Kobe well they didn't draft Kobe Bryant but they brought him in and the trade a this is the way they got Kareem Abdul Jabbar if you want to go that far back\nThat Laker fans are used to bring in big time guys do their program and delivering pretty immediate results so\nDecember loser minorities eagles football on one of six six just was Logan near perfect\nYou're Lyme disease ... revisited viewing I'm thirty nine

buyer eat with ... money and action than what you've done for the Jerry ...\nHe kind of thought it was a you know because of the slam dunk and it turned out to the deeper he got into this thing it it the day hurts reservation they have reservations about selling a historic will lead to a un American businessman\nYou know they had reservations about do you know\nHis what he was going to do with it you know how he's going to use it the NFL all those things\nAnd they just started getting too cold feet and he said did he talk to people you knew inside what was happening and and he pulled out before they said no one of those things where I'm a ... it's like the head coach you interviewed for the job\nAnd today or day before the other guy gets it\nIe withdraw you know quote unquote withdraw is his name from consideration that's really what kinds of doing here he pulled out\nBefore he got turned down the thing was going to go to a vote I think two weeks it was going to you know two weeks from now and ah he saw the writing of the wall and realize he wasn't going to get it so he pulled out and he's going to you know he left open the possibility of make another run at this thing so\nWho knows what he what he does down the road that you know I Know him I think he might look for other ways of tapping into that market\nOr someone they ask you a they're playing the tensions and ... and had allegedly this collapse long I don't know anyone can deal with that and play in the NFL\nBut the jaguars what is wrong with the Jacksonville Jaguars besides a blank Bartels like ... and everything

duty you know ...\nAnd ... down\nTo the top three tied in so you roll all that in to gather and it's a bad combination and the rest of the line is\nBanked up just in the last three weeks alone they've added\nA three guys practice and five guys off the street\nSo that just don't often\nThough I tell ya I mean just the often decimated ... kind of guy\nYou can just throw a bunch of you know St free agents around him and go hey\nYou know make these guys ... you know Aaron Rodgers and that Tom Brady he needs to supporting cast so we all know that in this report cast his is banked up very good so like morals is natural struggling or the question at least after last forty seven debacle in in Dallas is\nTo the defense you know they they were shell they the you know they get out in the on the ground and and big play after big boy they're not getting pressure\nThey're not making tackles there you know letting guys run free let ... be lead you know like Coby looked like Randy Moss in his prime or that they were shell of themselves\nSo all of a sudden you got the often socks and now the defense socks and all the you put those together and you lose by thirty three points\nTo a pretty mediocre Dallas team so it doesn't look good and ... right now and they go come out today and dug Rhone says forget preparing for the tax and\nWe're going back to square one and he had a training camp\nIn jak so right now and they go come out today and dug Rhone says forget preparing for the tax and we're going back to square one and he had a training camp practice in week seven it's unheard of they went they went back to training camp went back to the fundamentals\nSquare one basic safe tackling\nBlocking I mean it was crazy what the the things they were doing and the kind of practice

sudden you're going back in and trying to start over too late for that\nIs a genuine Ramsey doing any special interviews or doing any appearances are taught and is he talking bad about anybody this way because I just wanted to say how bad he shocked\nAnd dad I just wanted to point out like that guy would demand smiling and he never shuts off any humiliating can solve by saying that average guy every colleague every person that sent pro football player in the league socks accept him\nIt really is it's almost laughable isn't into this clown I gotta tell ya\nYeah notice any and you're not alone everybody says the same thing it's one thing if you're going to talk the talk and then walk the walk and those guys that\nYou know say what you want to say if you can go back it up and you're not backing up anything right now you know he doesn't ever pick\nEasy you know doesn't have a ton of tackled he's not planning and all that well you're gonna bomb the uh you know so all of that you know yeah dip it and that's what he should be doing ... and and wait till he's his play picks up but from what the things he's done in terms of talking\nAnd and the talking the talk is unbelievable this year ripping quarterback wrong a rip in a ... ... hill a you know he didn't have much to say much good to say last week about the the Dallas receivers in you know they pretty much shut him

radio\nLongtime listener for route for federal color hey man what's that one I'm an avid uh while I'm a national fat I live in northern Virginia but I watched a lot of oil\nGames and you know Mary but charter much too good to be behaving like that but he he's done a joke you have a lot of dirty quite but what bothers me the most is out while he goes around the bases on Ron it's basically a wall and I'm surprised that one of them yet I think it's coming though\nI'm surprised they didn't ban him than I from what he did that on our ought to be honest with you I don't know if I can say with any certainty that I've ever noticed that he's been a dirty player when he played Carver high in Baltimore I never knew that I just I've never thought of him as a dirty player I never even thought of him as a lazy player\nI just thought of him as a high price guy\nThat really\nUh it's kind of a a kind of a narcissistic baseball player right it's all about his own stats have you ever made anybody around\nHim better he certainly didn't make the Orioles better did he he was the best thing on the team and Adam Jones right fair to say yeah absolute but did you ever known to be dirty or lazy\nThat they've labeled him now both well I think that the lazy stuff uh definitely has been something that's kind of been around him for a while really the only thing that I remember with him as far as a dirty type of thing was\nMember you had that that big fight with the red Sox a few years ago which puts Roy slid into second base and the red Sox got all mad and it was how he slid into a drawl yeah I remember put joy was like\nYeah I got nothing to do with that when like the rest of the team got mad at the droid and care I remember that was Machado sliding in or that night so that the other than that I don't recall anything\nWith Machado as far as is dirty or anything like that so I don't know what he was thinking about last night I really don't I think the bigger outlier with China right now is the\nThe comment that it you know I don't I don't really care I'm not going to hustle you know it's pretty much that I have a bigger problem with that I don't know if this this dirty player stuff it was bad as it was he will one thousand percent was drawn to step on um last night but I don't know if he has a pattern and a history\nI don't really either I don't either ... but the other problem giving him a letter you got to make three hundred million dollars that's what he wants to make\nSomebody who didn't give it to them\nI Do not think he's wearing that money and I think you're going to get a beat up all ballplayer where these days he's got bad knees\nBlah blah blah and satirize that'll only six years old he's a young age ... operations\nYou don't think you get more\nYou know it happens the more you know six hundred bats every year see what that does the\nI mean the back end of all these contracts are bad you have to know that we're going in\nSo I'm you know going back to

Mac and um but he said that there's got to be a little bit of a a you know put a pause on it here when asked\nAbout him he's up there with all of them are Lawrence Taylor or he was baffled and and offended you said wait a minute we're talking about Lawrence Taylor now\nA said below jak who's a passage that bears that soldier field so I'm not putting anybody in Lawrence Taylor's class put everybody I mean that is just awesome as that but everybody down below that with a lot of respect to a lot of good players were talking about lord Laurence Taylor and that Taylor later we had what he said\nBecause he knows\nHe obviously love Taylor encouraged him of the giants and the eighties\nPainter but there again seasons and at a hundred and thirty two sacks nine all pro words he was inducted into the ... victim in Ninety nine I may play his whole career like high dude and they yeah I mean he was just I mean we get confirmed that but yeah\nYeah we get the guy didn't massive amounts of blow\nCareer like high to to me yes I mean he was just I mean we can't confirm that but yes yeah we can the guy didn't massive amounts of\nBlow and loved it and drank like a fish and got plenty of leg around New York I can tell you that much\nAh he's been on my show or many times he came over to Howard Stern and did the show with me and I was scared to death of him like he just the most imposing guy the nicest guy now he's just a really nice retired a hall of famer now but\nHe was the most intimidating guy like I have never I I mean like I'm a Lambert guy and I mean Joe green guy and there's no one ever going to say anything about those to those who are already and can and that's it you're you're talking about dangerous man they're\nVery angry dangerous man but there is no one on the face of the earth that I've ever seen played football\nAt the at the height of sheer fear and violence as Lawrence Taylor right I mean no one you can even begin to try on these stupid sports radio stations there's five thousand of them that people argue they will argue about anybody right they'll tell you you don't know what you're talking about about every Blair\nThere's not one that's going to win an argument about Lawrence Taylor\nThat's it there is nothing to say negative\nYou could talk about um doing below drinking the DUI everything else he doesn't even care about that do help beach harass okay but when that guy play football when he played against you on a Sunday in the NFL it was absolute fear\nThe quarterback was scared to death\nEvery NFL quarterback in my opinion that went up against that guy was afraid of him they knew what was coming and they were scared to death and they don't want to admit it but I Would be absolutely shaking in my diapers if that guy was coming at me all day\nThere's nothing like him you can't even tell me\nI I think a little ... really good right\nAnd I do I I respect this game for sure\nAnd uh\nI Know he's got an ankle injury going into this game um\nThat he was on the field for sixty two other Seventy eight snaps on events I guess last way\nBut there is no way you can tell me that that guy ... you know not yet anyway he's not even within earshot of him if you ask me like he's really good I won't deny that but he is not Lawrence Taylor and that's just it ended up story Lawrence Taylor\nIs so far above that guy is not even funny people talking like he's close to pass and Lawrence Taylor you are dead wrong you have no idea what you're talking about you need to stop talking you needed to stop if you think that guy's better than Lawrence Taylor you're a moron and that's it I didn't want to talk to you\nI'm with ya I I don't think that and it's no disrespect to Mike Rogers there's no disrespect to cook them act saying that I mean and this goes for anybody who's played in the last twenty five thirty years I'm Sorry\n... he was a just a get a different kind of game record I get that Mac rex games too but what else to ease the stuff that I'll do that on the field is just\nInsane the stuff that he and like you said for the most part um he did a little accelerated to ah with ... with what he was on the right some of these games but he was just\nHe was so feared a by every often said he stepped on the field again and I think that it's just the way to spell checks edited I also made me laugh because\nYou know you don't you never get anything out of the guy right nothing out of ... which is for the standing goes what we're talking about Lawrence Taylor like he gave you that same like just dead and ballot for a given year but I thought he was spot on I think it's crazy for anybody\nThat gets big strong as fast as a lot of power he does a good job of power rushing and fast enough to get to the edge as good ball where it is your job to job going to go back to you as a to tackle them as a chance to get the ... good ball awareness and can strip it out\nI don't know I honestly anyone that talks about like they they talk about how great he is they say man ... match planned and I he sure is great but have you ever really are and then they want to sit there and say I'm scared to death of that guy on the football field life scared of him on 'cause I'm telling you\nThere were two things in life that I saw with my very own eyes\nThat Lawrence Taylor put the fear of God and people that showed that the eighty five Chicago Bears\nThat was it when you play the bears and eighty five you were the quarter back on the other team you literally probably before the game in the night before when you're in

that's that's pretty impressive right it's more than ... more than half\nThe winning more than half of the games at home I mean that's that's crazy I'm sure there are just a home ice is a proven to be a a comfortable place to try to win Corey Crawford uh I didn't even know he's been out ten months was concussions\nBut it looks like I'm just trying to make his return to the ice for Thursday's game against coyotes ran out with concussions forever two hundred and thirty career wins twenty three shut out\nOr help the blackouts choice the Stanley Cup twice\nA year and made very ... section of his seventh ... seasons with the team was very stable and not before the injury he went sixty nine and two to shut out at a Ninety two percent say percentage and the two two seven goes against in twenty eight games this was before\nHe started having these concussions he's coming back that's going to help the black boxes and then having this guy back you think or do you think he's got a lot of rushed\nI mean besides him having a lot of rough I just don't think that their roster as a whole right now um is that good I I think that they're going to be looking at you know the same as last year this year\nTom Wilson is having is I'm hearing his appeal hearing tomorrow in New York I think that'll go for the head hunter\nProbably not well 'cause Boise a dirty player I don't care what anybody

fifteenth time that you try to kill someone it's just you know they're gonna they're gonna get your eventually wow\nUh so do the red Sox won three straight in the series and they have kicked the Astros ass\nIn this series if you ask me there are three one now they are laughing at the world champs and they beat him in both games in Houston now tomorrow night is that game at nighttime right yes so in prime time tomorrow night in Berlin or does it when\nIt's over correct I mean I don't see it I I don't see why all of a sudden they're going to start playing good baseball because what they've ah had happened to him is that the red Sox have just out played them in every facet of the game there's nothing that they're winning and nothing\n[noise] I don't think that it's not like these games have been blowouts the red socks of one hundred percent out played them\nBut the Astros have gone into the later innings of all these last three games with opportunities to tie take the lead or they or their bullpen and blows like a student at the other day that I think the Astros have been a little little I'm lucky though the home run coal in the\nFirst I thought at the big story you're right about that after the game it's not that they lost again is that uh that whole thing happened they they did not object the fan interfered who knows which one it was there was like three guys standing there guy in the\nRed shirt is the one that they specifically penny orange shirt and when that bridge or\nA ... it should have been a home run and you'll see the major league baseball come out tomorrow say it should have been a home run out they always come out the next day I don't go though don't they always come out the next day and tell your calls were wrong\nThey are embedded they never changed the game ever know Barry Sanchez not available and trades or do you like that that cash when they ... you know they'll work with it a tie ride Taylor ducked questions about are being asked are about are asking for ... do you think he wants out there and wants to go somewhere else\nYeah I think he wants to play he's not going to play now the bakers in their fulltime\nSo did you know that Peyton Manning you're starting a new TV series\nA Peyton Manning all those eight episodes of the basically the Kobe Bryant detail show that he does on basketball it'll be a Peyton Manning football

have him already\n'cause I think um [noise]\nI just say it I think would and it's just a disaster and that terrible they should have Peyton Manning in there\nI actually really got to hear a lot of it on Monday Night 'cause I was I wasn't here and usually when we're here I don't get to really hear witnesses types of torn those guys do the game um Monday Night I was listening to it and\nIt's really bad like it's really really bad it is bad so uh speaking of\nBad what do you think of the game tomorrow night in Arizona between the Broncos and cardinals\nDo you think the Arizona State Stanford game will be better\nI mean this Arizona Denver game is clearly like one of the reasons why gambling was invented I mean that's pretty much what you're looking at here is this is a game for the gamblers the game doesn't necessarily mean much in the scope of the football season right I mean for ... Arizona fans at this point and you're almost you know\n... you're both properly going to be picking the top ten there's a loss of his game could be huge down the road\nA show or do you know David Price just starting a game by tomorrow night in Houston and he's the epitome of bad luck in the postseason although the gaming pitched\nAt Fenway they won he didn't win but they won the game is is so at least just jinx seems to have been halted there but there is no way do you really think that guy can be Burning Land or tomorrow even though I think\nThe way that the Sox have been going into Syria that they can absolutely under tomorrow night\nSo going back to the hockey the Canadians are beat the blues and I read too in Montreal there now for more than one I'm surprised about that the capitals

three doing on about they're taking on the foreign to get up she'll beat the pain was coyotes and blackouts we'll see if a proper starts Oilers in Berlin's tomorrow and I should be a really good game it evidence in but uh the Bruins play denied you wonder what kind of legs off islanders kings\nIn lipstick city so the owners have to turn right around and play the dust than the kings tomorrow night that won't be fun but the games don't look good there two three and one and the sharks savers\nTomorrow night now one of the things about it\nThan the kings tomorrow night that won't be fun but the games don't look good there are two three and one and the sharks savers tomorrow night now one of the things about tomorrow night that's interesting is that LeBron is playing against Portland and the mother the first game and the seas first game tomorrow night at Portland and all eyes will be on that game just like\nOne of the you know the ten forty five TNT game it's just like the late night a\nWell timed it is just automatic that that game's going to be a on TV right and so on TNT there showing a double header bulls Sixers at eight ten dirty Lakers blazers will be all over that one will

modern baseball game and he joins us now here on after hours Roberts die right in 'cause I Know this is the kind of stuff that you really enjoy\nI'm not sure ... council expected that he used to

series\nWell we're sort of seeing this new philosophy this new paradigm of both pending as Brian Kenny has called that I'm pushed to the limit\nAnd I'm not saying it can't work I I think the booze or a tremendously intelligent organization Craig council of the creative guy um so\nI don't think they would do these things for granted some of it's been\nNot voluntary but a lot of it has been I don't think they do these things that they didn't have a a well\nConsidered plan but it is also true that they are in uncharted territory here to some degree and you can't plan\nFor every contingency so it it does throw up open the the\nThe possibility of just being done by unforeseen circumstances are of that said also though I I don't\nI again I wouldn't criticized them for it I think that they are a bit undermanned against the Dodgers even though they had the better record in the regular season and it may may make sense to me that they try something worth ... see if they can uh\nMaybe change the equation in some fundamental way that makes them a little better than they would otherwise be on paper\nWhat is the philosophy behind that not using a starting pitcher deep into a game like say what we got from Clinton cursed shocks or even in review in the first series for the Dodgers not having a quality star instead piecing together a few innings here in a few innings there\nWell the the the essential explanation\nThat with the exception of the few outstanding starting pitchers\nAnd basically the bruised don't don't even have one of those guys maybe they maybe they had or have one but um they're not well stocked as say the the Astros or the Dodgers are um [noise]\nYour starting pitcher typically isn't going to be as good in the fourth or fifth inning\nAs an average relief pitcher would be so and that's it's taken a long time for teams to admit this and adjust to it even though the data been available for I don't know a decade or so making a pretty good case for just that um but\nWhen you've been doing something the same way for as long as baseball teams were doing it [laughter] centrally trying to get as many innings out of your starting pitcher is you could\nUm it was difficult to change that mindset and of course part of what's happening now to his\nThe next generation of TV contracts are going to look like if the game continues as it has\nLost that when he was

actually so lonely inflicting pain on America's pastime\nYou ever heard the phrase death by a thousand paper cuts now like Robin saying danger is not imminent the game is not collapsing anytime soon but is it loses four percent of its\nViewership or four percent of each attendants every year I think about where it will be in a decade don't know that that trend will continue but that's got to be a

quarterback and so they offered\nHim a boat load more money than what the Denver Broncos did\nAnd and to me I'm Sorry but to me four or five million dollars is actually a boatload more money and so here's ... while they're still kicking around in the NFL he's gone from Houston to Cleveland back to Denver now he's in Miami the main feel earning a paycheck\nI I Will compare him to a cockroach but

things like that\nHe can do and I quote he just can't throw\nIs that all I mean there are some quarterback for the NFL who can't throw\nDon't know yet to whether or not this is a long term injury

it is I mean it's happened with other teams and other coaches in the past Nobel checking the patriots come to mind\nOf course teams and coaches want to keep their injuries to themselves as long as possible but the NFL mandates that they are honest and open at specific points during the week about the guys who were injured and about what the injuries are this is not hockey where you can say upper body or lower body and\nI suspect that it has a lot to do with the betting lines but I mean what do I do\nMaybe it's about the competitive playing field either way there isn't a ton of

had so many twists and turns that I feel like you could get sea sick with the number of momentum changes\nAnd\nMe use that to underscore this point\nAll start here and worked my way backwards I Do not believe it was fan interference period after watching the replay over and over and over like all of America\nI don't believe the fan reached into the field of play to impede ... attempt to catch a ball off the bat oppose al today\nOkay so I I Believe all too they should have had a home run or the very least a ground rule double that that's not how the rule is written\nBut that's not what Joe West called\nAnd I do appreciate is that the replay officials did not undermine the umpire on scene by overturning a call without indisputable evidence\nPay so I don't think he was saying interference looked to me like monkey's arm was breaking the plane so to speak was in the stands and yes the sand in touches glove however\nI think if a player reaches into the state is just like if a player goes tumbling over a ... trying to make a catch a foul territory or does a somersault into a dug out or falls into the stands along to the third baseline\nBut that's fan territory so have you reach into the stands it's not them interfering with you just you trying to make a play and they happen to be there\nAll of that to say well I don't agree with the call\nThat was made in the first inning a Red

were trailing one to nothing\nAnd it looks like if they\nCouldn't get that run across they were going to pinch hit for Clinton gr shock understanding time is up the essence here we have to get the tying run even if it means pulling our pitcher who was in a grew\n\nInstead though right before Clinton ... shots at bat\nAustin bar and had a seeing eye single hit the mounting cut to balance it up the middle and Taylor scores game is tied and courage shot that goes in bats for himself\nAnd not only does he pitch in the sex but he pitches in the seventh\nAnd he allows just one ride on three heads and a couple of walks but he has nine strike out in the seven innings soul qualities sharper Clayton and exactly what the Dodgers needed after Thirteen getting a fair in which they use every last one of their relievers the night before\nAnd that that victory for Clinton ... put the Dodgers within one game of now returning to the fall classic where they still seeking redemption\nWasn't as

strangely enough\nI don't know that this has ever happened in the postseason I Wish I had the history books in front of me so I can check it out\nBut strangely enough it'll be the same starter for the brewers in game sex as it was in game five weighed Miley barely had a chance to stretch out he throws five pitches he walks one batter\nThen he gets pulled now I think he was probably pull both for credit counseling tendon because there were backed by them but they were the pitching change with no runs no hits and one batter\nDown that's it went down by down I just need one one a be into the game\nSo he was probably pull earlier than he was going to be but Craig council says I mean we were always plan and to have him go back to back\nSo we're going to do all along the way they're going to

mean men ... that it just makes you sound like a fool okay\nI I don't I don't think that they um they got the call wrong I'm eating in a barren says in the parents and you really see it ... on the wall then it's just been on the ball was the right call Joanna\n... it'll run about whether or not there was contact made with the glove there was clearly contact me with the glove that's not what anybody's just shooting it was about where it happened did you move back to reach into the stands similar to say a play along the third baseline of the first baseline where a guy goes\nFlipping his way into the stands are into the dugout like Steve Pearce said later in the game it's about where it happened not that it happened it's obvious that the fan made contact the to make contact\nBut if it happened in the field of play that's one thing if that's reach into the stands then it's not on the fan\nThe the the one great thing that they did catch those uh security go in and over that blocked the actual your probably could have settled back all walks of Raul\nYeah well and I do appreciate that the major league baseball replay brain trust didn't overturned it without irrefutable evidence at the very least that's how replaced should be utilized if you can't\nLook at it you know for sure then you've got to go with the guys who were on site otherwise you're undermining you're official so whether or not we agree with the call the fact is they couldn't see enough to overturn Joe West ruling so they should've left it alone\nWhat I'm looking forward to and I think it's going to be a great game Berlin has been pretty much light so always has been able to be back in with Troy is when we had to play him but\nI I just feel like these boxes that momentum behind these kids having fun\nAnd they're just making it fun and it's fun to watch you know you're at the sea it's an exciting game and and I did a great time of year you know a Boston in in general not just a a Red Sox fan but the

Boeheim and\nWe're joined by attorney and author simply Powell do offer some thoughts about what is now appearing to be a brutal murder of perhaps and interrogation that somehow when bad although\nRight off the bat the Sydney or if that is going to be the official explanation offered by the Saudis there is no form of interrogation in any civilized country which could ever have this as an outcome\nOh you're right about that gym but as we both know there's nothing about that country that I wouldn't call civilized\nIt's one of the most brutal and barbaric regimes in the history of the world I think from the way they treat women to the way they treat people like this like this journalist and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood as I understand it\nOr at least a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood the reporters really does not seem to be the most a\nSavory character or a on the planet but again but there's little about that peninsula that is a a twenty first century and a and its

why I think it could very well have been a deliberate message that they sent them they're sufficiently arrogant and just barbaric to to do it that way either that or if they thought nobody was going to find out because it was on their property\nAnd other than you know him not being seen walking out I'm probably expect that everybody inside to to keep it quiet and I'm not sure exactly how what happened in their late down all of that I've heard that the\nThe minister their tending the consulate has said that you know there's a tape of him thing or somebody telling him you better be quiet you better shut up or you know this is going to happen to you back in Saudi Arabia centrally\nAnd there are questions I gather about the uh the technical means used to a a record of various things that are attributed to the possible demise of the of the journalistic question again the bottom line I suppose is that we are promised an explanation\nBy the Saudis since this was Saudi Government property and I'm not sure who else would be in a position to really uh offer information about what was happening on their property the problem is of course\nThat a salary explanation to say the very least a cannot be taken at face value\nIt cannot I mean they're certainly not government oh yeah we send a wet team in there to chop him up while alive but that's exactly what it sounds like happened and they they did it\nWell it it would certainly so appear uh that that is the case now that given the fact that the Saudis have been useful in that part of the world in standing up to Iran the most the stabilizing single element in the region\nAgain it does not excuse this kind of behavior but if you look at the options that are available in the Saudi peninsula there are no Tom ... a or a John Adams was walking around that peninsula the choices they live if\nThey did and they wouldn't live if they did the choices are pretty much the Saudi royal family brutal but more or less friendly to this country or\nAl ... or ISIS equally brutal and very unfriendly to this country in other words the notion of destabilizing the entire peninsula just because we're upset strikes me as a very

Julian how are you today\nGreat\nI'm doing good thank you for asking Julie it's never going to be talking about Bush's for children because this recently um Bush's for children has launched the boat kids Nebraska for the ... elections so first off you know tell us about the vote kids in Nebraska for twenty Eighteen\nSure so voices for children ... is a nonprofit nonpartisan advocacy organization um although we don't endorse or oppose candidates each election year we do work to make sure that the issues that affect the rest of the kids are at the top of mind when when voters are at the ballot box\nUm so so that and we work um to create a questionnaire that candidates can respond to with a couple of key questions\nUm that that are coming up or that we have been working on to see 'em where for folks and and I think especially this year and twenty Eighteen knowing that there are so many seats up for election with many um\nYou know new and you can and it's um this is a great time for voters to be talking about these issues and to be learning more about about ways that we can make the rest of the best place to be a kid\nAnd I guess you know with with this questionnaire is this something bad to voices were children that you guys have done before in the past when it comes to watch and\nYeah we try to do this every election year and for as long as I was in voices we we've done this project\nPerfect so then I guess how does it all worked in when it comes to um the candidates or do you guys just send them questionnaires and there's like do after the deadline I guess to turn it into all the answers are available for promoters to to read or how does that work\nAbsolutely so how can we send out the questionnaires I'm In print and then also via email with an electronic submission option for candidates and we we do this for each candidate in um a legislative seat a state legislative seat and then also for the governor [noise]\nUm and we give them I think this year we gave them about a month and a half to respond if\nIf I'm remembering correctly and then we put them all up on our website and published them in a PDF format um\nAnd then we you know we we're still accepting responses but some some candidates it's it's getting really close to the election so we understand that folks are pretty busy at this time of year\nYeah no absolutely and so then with this um questionnaire with the with the survey results that you do have from some candidates ... an online for for voters to read\nAbsolutely they're available at our website um voice for children dot com slash folk kids and on the website we have a responses from the candidates we have a tool for voters to use to figure out if they're not sure which district there in\n'em and if you know if their ballot if they're on senator is not on the ballot this year they can find contact information for the current senator and ask them questions about what their priorities are in twenty Nineteen and they can also find facts sheets that\nI'm giving you information about how kids are doing at a district level and then finally there is a piece about ballot initiative for twenty seven which is the the measure to expand Medicaid that voters can find information about\nThat sounds great and you know with this being done every election cycle whether the reception been like than from the the voters would would have the when they said about seeing these questionnaires available\nAnd I think you know our hope is that voters find this to be useful we know that you know this is of not everything that that folks need in order to germs determine who they\nWant to vote for but I think that this is a really important issue that everybody cares about and you know that's the same response that we've seen from candidates we all care about kids and we all want to um make sure that our systems are set up in a way that that ensures that are next generation is happy healthy and thriving\nAnd so it's been a it's been a good response all overall um permit from everyone\nThat sounds great so we are losing today with a Julie as she is the policy coordinator for voices for children and what was

purchased internationally\nThat is the former vice president of the United states Joe Biden on CBS or talking a little bit about the president and his assessment of how he's dealing with this disaster this political disaster over in Saudi Arabia and turkey regarding the missing Washington Post columnist\nOr the president loves his autocrats so what's he going to do is it going to crack down on Saudi Arabia let's deal in rich Lowry he is the editor of National Review a friend of this program a friend of mine and a friend of yours rich morning to you\nHey Steve at a uh how's it going it it must be a lot of pressure big big shoes to fill\n... kill made out of ... yeah it it doesn't like left I was just hoping you know what am I going to do for the first twenty four minutes and tell a rich Lowry comes on to\n... yeah okay All right ... yeah [laughter] so it'll be radio magic now I I\nThink so far so good I'm not sure what do you think about the president and how we said you know let's not be too fast to blame the Saudis regarding the missing guy\nSo I I don't mind you know the attitude let's wait and see all the facts what I Do think the president has the could be too eager to accept 'em a cover story from the Saudis yeah no I don't I don't think that's the appropriate ... hot here\nI don't I don't think that's the appropriate ... posture and a apparently Pam ... reporting in which was quite tough\nAnd his private meetings with the ...\nSo I mean this is the difficulty it it seems clear they deliberately set out to murder this guy and the most hideous way you know out of the Clinton Tarantino\nMovies yeah and you say should condemn them\nThere should be some sort of consequences\nBut you don't want to destabilize the regime because this although I think the Saudis are bastards is is probably the best we can help or um in terms of the government and Saudi Arabia and to their an important ally and you know forced to choose between the Iranians and the ... which we are you know on a daily basis you go at the ...\nEven though they're imperfect and repressive and murderous but I I just this is such an addition to being a crime that such a blunder I Know you're going to come into your consulate and not leave and no one's going to notice well\nAnd and it makes you wonder has this ever happened before this happened to guys who simply aren't where an apple watches and and somebody's road tape on and\nYeah I mean well they're they kill dissidents all the time or they just usually don't do it and there's a brazen a man or a overseas so it's bad you know the the reputation of the crown prince will never be the same\nUm but you know where we can't overthrow the Saudi Government and create a liberal liberal government they're just the conditions aren't there for that that we have to deal with reality as it is and that's where I think you know Trump has represented a correction to an over emphasis on idealism\nYou know in the Bush years he just has to guard against going swinging too far in the other direction\nShort and of course everybody's hanging on everything he says because we are less than three weeks away from the midterms and you know the Republicans are terrified that they're going to lose the house there's certain it looks like they could actually pick up some seats in the Senate but that's another story\nRegarding the midterms what is on your radar as something that could break a either way for either side and the next three weeks\n[noise] I I don't know it would would be inherently in some sort of surprised what about the Caribbean um\nIt it could yet could could help energize the Republican voters um did you see the question is clearly that the gathering the cabin off by was galvanizing Republicans increase their energy which is hugely important and transformed um a couple of these\nSenate races where it looks almost impossible to me now that Republicans could lose nominal control I think they have at least you know the worst cases fifty fifty wear pants tie breaker\nUm but the question is does that energy you know last that the next three weeks so if there's something like you know crisis over the care of and maybe that\nHelps the problem in the house is just the these districts that Clinton won that are occupied by Republicans are really endangered the ones where the Republican incumbent has retired about eight of them are basically gone even Republicans admit they're they're gone and that gets you you know eight eight seats towards\nJust twenty three they need that that's holding the house will be the Republican somehow management it'll be near a miracle and I'll do it you know by cedar to\nWrite a we had Eric Trump on Fox in front of this morning and he said look if the Democrats when they're going to be a lot of investigations into you know\nThe Trump Administration the Trump family everybody he said but then again when you look at what the Republicans have been able to achieve with a Republican president\nTheir records his body you know the president really wanted to build the wall the you know they're barely building the fence or you want to get rid of Obamacare So it's not like a Republican led Congress is helping them\n[noise] yeah so they did a tax cut which is which which is a big deal step but otherwise most of the important things to have happen through executive action and through\nYou're after he got families you got its end or the other thing I Would like to quickly say\nIs Fox on line to get some proof raiders or they need to check out what what what did we miss spell\nIt out there's an article about the judge that black so I think the last thing\nWhy like salt and sorry is it lack solved yes\nIt was about the Clinton server and that's a very important article and they've got it mixed up with the farthest large photo\nA server and that's a very important article and they've got mixed up with the farthest edge photos\nWhen you know what are we will pass the word along folks are to the people in the computer department to see if they can fix that Maureen thank you very much for joining us today from Orlando\nChop the only time it's been happening they need to watch it\nMade it yeah there's a lot going on or who knows it could be just one of those darn grim ones are ... technological stuff can help him one of my kids were kind of a\nKey choices right now he or she is in a Clinton, Massachusetts Keith thanks for joining us on the brink ... radio show hey how's it going\nIt's going okay what do you what do you make of one of the other things we were talking with a rich Lowry about a little while ago is what's going on in Saudi Arabia and it looks as if\nThey could be covering up the fact that uh the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered that he's hit men decapitated and take the fingers off of and then just chill or this Washington Post correspondent rather a columnist in Turkey\nWhere do you what do you think about what is going on with that dynamic because so many people here in the United states teeth are asking the president in the United states to get tough and do something about Saudi Arabia\nWell and what happens unfortunate if it happened we need to get to the facts of course however\nI think applying sanctions and the situation would be rather inconsistent I mean if we're going to do it the one we should do it at all I mean just this past August we had Iran order seven journalists to be jailed and flogging the wake of their coverage\nChina just in February detained relatives at three United States journalists Andy you ask a green card holder for their coverage a serene a sham she was an American journalist who in twenty fourteen was killed by the Turkish government\nThe drug and regime after the two days after they accuse her of being a spy\nUm I mean in fact turkey under their German regime\nThey've been one of the worst offenders when it comes to journalism direction now are we supposed to really expecting honest investigation from like the turkey is though that would be akin to giving credibility to Russia's investigation into the poisoning of Sergei scrape\nOff what do you make an interesting point ... you know the president's in a pickle it's it's um damned if you do damned if you don't we're going to have to see what he does keep thank you very much for joining us here in the brain kill me show\nOr a meanwhile over on the news maker line we got congressman Rodney Davis he serves probably the thirteenth district of the great state of Illinois he's a Republican and he's on the house committee on agriculture and the chair of the subcommittee on biotechnology congressman or thanks for joining us here on the brand kill

about it it's not just a choice between your congressman and his phone but also it's a it's a choice between two futures in Congress has shows me the truth of the matter is that the Illinois\nThere may be the district that decides whether or not we ever Republican majority or whether Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the house and the next Congress and I just knew in my heart here in central Illinois you're going to choose results you're going to choose\nMore prosperity and I know in my heart the people of central Illinois are going to support Rodney Davis [noise]\nWhether you've got the vice president said some very nice things you know congressman so many people think oh Illinois a that's a completely blue state that is not the case there\nAre absolutely not downstate Illinois decorative of many states throughout this nation where Republicans are are winning re air winning seats in areas that that even Democrat or legislators drew to a lot of Democrats and we've got to get those voters to the polls and it's humbling to hear\nA vice president and say those words I was there when he hit it of course but to hear him again a cut of tears me up a little bit but it also it puts a perspective on the ... and we're fighting a veteran Nancy plus a rapper gets set speakers dabble with that\nAnd I know that is one of the things you're saying out on the stump what when you talk to people that I Know you've shaken a thousands of hands over the last couple of weeks or trying to get out the vote for November the six what is the is there one motivating\nFactor for Republicans or independents who lean your way who are Democrats even who who may vote for you on the first Tuesday in November something that's going to motivate them an issue in the news right now\nWell a lot of it boils down to the local issues issues that affect each member of Congress short sale when I go shake hands and in whatever town that I'm blessed enough to represent I meet folks I just sat down with a group of senior class students at Morse in Illinois and the issues that they are most concerned about are usually ... to them\nBut when you you look at the national issues that they move on to backs and a lot of it has to do with fear fear of Democrats taking over and what is\nWhat is Congress going to look like it's Nancy Pelosi as speaker if Jerry ... is chair of the Judiciary Committee because I don't think there's any way with the flood or left wing dollars coming in by the billions he landed a by district that they're going to hold off from teaching the president\nIn ...

pictures up by a wife and my kids and used it in a negative I guess you could say whatever you want about me I stood up and ran for Congress to keep my kids that's just something that cross the line and I don't think any candidate for Congress Republican or Democrat deserves what what happened there\nNo kidding you know um that is over the line and that's just one of those things that so many people are disgusted by uh my wife is a cancer survivor as well and\nFor instance on this book to are so many people have come up to her and said I I ... story I just want to give you a hug I'm sure you've gotten it from your wife but she's not the public figure and she and I I don't know of any Republican\nCongressmen who we're talking about it as we try to do something about our health care situation to get rid of the uh pre existing conditions are provisions that are are insurance companies have\nJust in conditions a provision say our our insurance companies have\nNo none of us are in no as a matter of fact the American health care act has has a lightning says that nothing in this actual take away preexisting condition coverage in the bill and it's been scored four Pinocchio fact checkers and it's just an out that\nAt my own it or allies have doubled down on the sly and it offends people like my wife\nBecause health care isn't just a political talking points to us it's just

for six cylinder sedans and SUVs out there\nAnd I see this is an opportunity to proliferate eighty five\nThat's why I'm passionate about us and all and that's why we're focusing on ethanol here today so\nUh if you got a question or comment for us the today show give us a call at eight five five for talk egg that's eight five five for eight to five five to four if you'd rather let us know what you're thinking via Twitter just include hashtags agra talking the message now right now let's turn it over to Betsy given\nSome of the smaller more independently owned ethanol companies\nAcross the country um the larger companies are not members of ours we have a sort of a grass roots flavor to us a lot of farmer owned plant and a lot of farmer investors belong to our group and we try to mobilize you know grassroots support for public policies at the state and federal level\nAnd we also do something unique when it comes to trying to develop relationships with a gas station owners marketers wholesalers joggers 'em\nAnd help them identify the benefits the economic benefits of blending ethanol in gasoline or retailing ethanol blend fuels to consumers um and that's been a part of our focus for very long time is that\nRecognizing that retailers are really our customers right and we need to make sure that we're marketing our fuel to them in a way that makes makes sense for them in a way that they can make money\nYeah absolutely and again uh I encourage everybody go in and take a look at your website because it is just fantastic you have stories on there ah from said ...\nAh there's a lot of just him for graphics on there that are are very useful uh interest to learn more about ethanol an e Fifteen a really fantastic stuff now\nWhat opportunities UC Brian for ethanol beyond this year round you Fifteen\nSure we spent so much time it seems like focusing on year round the Fifteen and the technical and the legal intricacies of that\nBut I appreciate the question because beyond that we know we can and should be using significantly more ethanol not only here in the United states but around the world and so our efforts have been focused\nShould be using significantly more ethanol not only here in the United states but around the world and so our efforts have been focused\nMaybe I'll say first worldwide on making sure we are reliable customer um to those trading partners who want to reduce the greenhouse gases of their transportation fuels who want\nA lower carbon lower price fuel and so the last two or three years the industry has really focused a lot of attention on being that reliable supplier to markets around the world whether it was China prior to the escalation and tariffs\nCanada who has been a strong reliable purchaser of our ethanol for a long time Brazil um that is imported ethanol despite some trade barriers they've erected\nUm but developing markets and other places like Mexico which is likely to come on in the next two to three years is a pretty strong market for fuel India ah places in Southeast Asia\nSo working to make sure that we expand market access for product around the globe\nAnd then here at home beyond the Fifteen it really comes down to focusing on the high octane low carbon qualities or fuel we believe Ted long term\nThat automakers are going to want higher octane fuel to um be used in those those high compression engine that they're making those heightened Russian engines require more octane the trouble is the high octane fuel on the market today right as premium\nAnd nationwide that's what fifty cents a gallon on average higher than than regular and so yeah yeah customers aren't going to buy that so ethanol if you get it in the range of twenty to thirty percent\nCan deliver that octane in a low carbon way and most importantly at a price point where auto makers are convinced consumers would want to buy that fuel for those vehicles so we're really focused on that high octane market in the future\nBrian I have a very large smile on my face right now and we can't see because this is radio but this is exactly the cart that I feel like I've been trying to push up hill for last few years now I I don't know if you heard my intro to the show but\nI just don't understand why we are not pushing the eighty five more I mean yeah the thirties grape\nEasy five or ... I I have a I have a vehicle that I've done in the eighty five conversion to\nUh and when I'm running ET five compared to Ninety three octane not only in my saving a dollar fifty a gallon but I'm getting Seventy two horse power at the rear wheels and I just I just got a new car after my old one got smashed up\nI'm been since you point O T a to point or turbo charged which is a very very common platform and amongst all these auto makers out there\nI wanted to hundred and Seventy four horse power\nWhich is nice I wanted more of your head I like I like him fast cars right\nI looked at the needy Fifteen can Bernie eighty five conversion and I'm not going to do it quite yet because the boys the warranty really makes me angry too but that adds another thirty five horse power and the thirty seven pounds toward\nWhy aren't Cadillac why aren't Lexus Mercedes Benz BMW for all of these two point oh turbo charged all the force fed a super charge to recharge engines out there why or why are they not offering ET five conversions at the dealership\nAs a sports upgrade because that's what the consumer wants\n[noise] wow you've put a big smile on my face tab because I my favorite fuel is he eighty five as well and I I use it Ninety five percent of the time I'm I'm a big believer in the benefits of the eighty five so I appreciate you you saying that\nI don't have a great answer for you on why there aren't more\nConversion abilities at the dealerships I Know that there are\nUm you know aspiring mechanics who are aren't I should say entrepreneurial mechanic who have been able to a ... a nice business converting existing vehicles over to eighty five\nI'm ... and people really enjoy that we've been pounding on both the EPA and the auto makers to make sure that the the flexible fuel vehicle continues to be produced so folks who want to use the eighty five can um so I I think that's an important part of this\nIf you talk to retailers today they are most interested in the eighty five they're not they're they're interested in e Fifteen absolutely and if we get this RV pie things fixed they're gonna they're going to offer a Fifteen but the focus for retailers is on the eighty five because\nThe price point pain octane price point yep\nYeah and I've got a list of retailer or a while you were saying entrepreneurial mechanics that will duty five conversion I live with the doing the problem with that as the boys my warranty I Want to be able to do it from the dealership\nBrian let me know who I Need to write congressmen senators auto makers I Want to get this change is something that it's just so blatantly obvious to me\nThat it's it's what the public wants lower price point higher octane more power this is such an awesome opportunities that I see three eighty five and it just it frustrates me that it's just not\nFinding any sort attraction so you know I I I I I really want guys like you like your your your American coalition for us and we'll\nLet me know what I Need to do I'm all on board with this because I think it's it's really the next wave of of what we need for our automation industry for farming industry all the way round I think it's just it's necessary and I just it baffles me that we haven't been able to find more traction on that\nYou know Ted if I may I just spent the last two days in Detroit meeting with automakers about eighty five and flexible fuel vehicles and high octane and fuels and high compression engines and I think what we need to do my organization I'm your listeners\nIs we need to make sure that we are writing the CEOs of these auto companies\nWe were told by auto makers that they get inundated with letters from people who want to see more electric vehicles and they argue one reason it's not the only one because there's a lot of government subsidies and mandates out there for Iraqis\nBut one reason auto makers are turning the e visas they they perceive there to be this consumer demand out there I think there is as strong if not stronger demand for eighty five vehicles for flexible fuels vehicles for higher compression engines and so I Would encourage folks to take the time\nTo write a letter or an email to if if you love for ... write a letter to the Ford CEO if you're if you're a Chevy guy right two GMs General Motors or or Chrysler whoever use\nIf you look for ... read a letter to the for the IAU if you're if you're a Chevy guy right two GMs General Motors or or Chrysler whoever you sort of support but uh or purchase but let's let's start\nSort of a grassroots effort to write the CEOs of these auto companies to tell them to be eighty five out there those flexible fuel vehicles\nBrian I'm going to do just that when we're done here today thank you Brian Jennings the over American coalition for us and up next we'll be talking to Robert White vice president of Indians industry relations with renewable fuels association\nCurrent price times one thousand acres carry the one my these days it's hard to make\nThe math word for your soybean fields to be a SF liberty links system would liberty herbicide makes it easier to start with the two plus bushels per acre you'll damage\nRealize that the eighty five it's something that the public wants and it's also very conveniently and to their sort of a game plan here which is smaller displacement engines force fed so you know higher combustion\nI'm more power on smaller engines so eighty five is is a great way to do that I mean how how do we grow eat eat five demand Robert\nWell you know despite what the auto makers have have done the last couple of years when they lost their no cafe credit\nAt least a level that they enjoyed for many years now we've actually seen the number of stations continue to increase we've seen angel demand that gallon sold the eighty five continue to increase\nSo that's been positive obviously we like it to be at a a quicker check I mean I heard the end of Brian segment on the phone and now we it was three years ago or we sent a\nMember of this fifty or sixty thousand postcards to the auto makers are saying you know filled out by individual consumers thing that they wanted flex fuel vehicles and as the opportunities of\nYou know or the president has adjusted our plans to formally adjust the CAFE standards corporate average fuel economy standards that were put in place by President Obama\nThose are all opportunities free eighty five so if the auto makers need to make changes but they don't have to be quite as aggressive as they were in the past can we can we feed back some of those Cathay credits\nTowards the eighty five and you know they don't need as many ... that they thought they might or in any eighty five of the good example of how you can lower emissions are utilized more renewable fuel and especially a domestic and cleaner burning fuel\nYeah and correct me if I'm wrong Robert but you know I think the problem that we had with flex fuel vehicles in the past is that\nThey weren't making the adjustment for when you were running ... versus when you were running eighty seven octane meaning they were burning eighty five just like they were burning eighty seven acting which means they're running way too rich for fuel mixture and that was part of the reason why the ... miles per gallon was taking such a huge hit\nIf there were vehicles that had a hops witch and the fuel tank and was adjusting the CPU to a proper few on air mixture\nYou get more power and you get much better fuel mileage than than just running a ET five like it was eighty three octane still not going to get quite the same fuel mileage as\nA unleaded gasoline but it's a lot closer eh what can we get to to\nTo take to get the auto makers to take a more advanced look at this rather than just saying okay we've done the fuel lines and the fuel tank you can throw eighty five minute it's not going to do your very good for miles per gallon is not going to do much as far as the host power bomb\nBut you can put it in there I you know I'm I'm kind of looking at this as sort of a um a an a luxury option or or performance option for a lot of vehicles out there um and I think that's something the consumer really wants rather than just having the option to throw in a cheaper fuel\nCell you're absolutely right I mean we've seen in the premium or any five vehicles that reproduce from Mercedes and and a jaguar or in their ... Land Rover you know all the ones that all your former listeners by on a daily\nBasis I'm sure but the the the premium or eighty five option always allowed in eighty five just to be the\nBest proposition after I made the difference in price alone from ... to\nThem could be half and and not on top of that is a higher compression engine that can capitalize\nPrice alone for me eighty to bring him could be ...\nAnd and not on top of that at the higher compression engine that can capitalize on that I ought to be eighty five\nBut I mean we've seen examples especially if they're turbo charged or in the eighty five and really make some gains and of course and I know you've done some of this that we're talking more and more to the tune her crowd better you know I always make the joke to have a laptop in the past your state and\nInstead of their significant other but they are able to\nMake those adjustments on the fly based on what's coming through the fuel lines to the engine and they can make up a some that fuel economy lost and they and most of the time it or eighty five of the cheaper dollars per mile even without that special ten\nBut I think what's important to consumers and how they unfold on the auto makers is they they have to tell their elected officials that important to them we need Congress to be involved in the conversation we need the auto makers to know that you want them so\nMhm I understand that if you go into a local dealer and they don't have them a venting their frustration there doesn't always work they are a long distance from the auto makers and who are making those decisions so\nAs Brian said that we've done in the past make sure the automakers themselves know how important that is you because just like any of the hundred options you can get on a new vehicle today\nI personally would love or one of the boxes to be that that we could check is to flex fuel\nAbsolutely Robert [noise] we've run out of time unfortunately man I've still got so many questions but it sounds like we're gonna have to start writing some letters me to get what I Want which is\nForm adoptions in vehicle but I think for the American farmer it'd be a great idea to do so to see if we can really get this ethanol demand going All right thanks again Robert not next we've got Mike O'Brian vice president of market developed for growth energy [noise] come on back to

it is a really sunny but all but Chris Thursday Afternoon\nHere in Chicago and a man it has been a while there was a lot of right on the board here today uh as far as markets are concerned I've had kind of a fun day in the meantime because I got the host agra talk earlier today and talk about one of my favorite things which was up and all so I'm Still kind of\nWriting my eighty five high from earlier but a market certainly did not like it soybeans who fund are quite a bit of pressure\nI'm kind of taken corn and wheat down with it but uh it was before we get into it I Do want to say if you get a chance I I'm kinda partial because you know uh I really enjoyed the show but if you get a chance to listen to the agra talk from earlier today if you haven't already um we're talking about up\nAnd all I'm very passionate about eighty five I think there's some applications for eighty five that we're ... we're just sort of missing 'em and my guests were really fantastic and basically we all kind of came to the conclusion that we need to be writing some letters to car companies and lawmakers asking forty five to be offered\nWith new cars but not just as flex fuel vehicles more so as a package a so that the vehicles that we're using our our converting that he eighty five correctly and not just trying to burn it like like eighty seven octane fuel because the benefits are really fantastic and the losses of of MPG aren't really as bad as what\nMost people think so anyway so we get a chance to check that out in the meantime\nLike we talked about markets weren't ideal today I think there's a number of reasons for that I'm In you know we're going to be talking to all day about that we've got Steve [noise] ah Gregory uh from Allendale yeah they were going to be talking to you and ah\nYou know he always does a great job I'm very curious and British to see what he has to say in the meantime said ships out so it was Davis so guess what we have given here for the news um so without any further ado let's go to Betsy what the news\nHave had a long time now talk ... right I Know I miss it for about an hour to\nGo back to whether you like it or not I do I like it it's good how are things that you're afternoon and do and\nYou know I'm a did agar talk went back to the desk so how how much beans were down ... ... yeah no say something to go on [laughter]\nSo I'm excited to talk about that but it's definitely not eh not the right we want to see on the board\nNo not not fun but I you know we just kind of a one day thing we had a number of things kind of coming together that that puts the pressure on us so uh hopefully it'll be a different story tomorrow\nAnd ... with not only that but also meal meals been strong lately and kind of supporting beans and\nYou know and I think that kind of tip the hat not only that I think you mentioned it in the last segment to adjust to the idea that we're going to get back harvesting again the slow pace isn't going to just continue as slow as it is we've got an opportunity to get in the fields\nAnd as soon as these fibers farmers can move it combines they're going to do that now we're going to pick the pace back up again\nYeah are you hearing much ah you know the guys that had been stuck there for two or three weeks up in ah Minnesota Dakota north Iowa or are you hearing guys going now at this point are they still waiting\nThere are still waiting I talking to some guys just in south central Minnesota and I got to tell you you know it's it's still what a that they're very eager to get going but it is still a little wet so but the next couple of days will probably really tell the story but there'll be in there soon\nYeah so yeah I\nI've heard some guys that have been a getting going on corn a little bit they really want to get half of the soybeans but just haven't been able to get in yet so we would be great you\nOut there though but I mean the ... have been fantastic for those guys that are running but you know it's just a having a dry out a little bit and then seeing seeing how long it's going to take to get it and go get it\nThrough a big part of the reason that we had the strength coming into Monday Monday was sort of that that are into the death of the whole whether concern and damaged concern you know we heard any more about damage from the soy beans you know a rod ... brought his rounded pod\nA loss of bushels a how realistic is that or or or would that's just the CERN and now we're moving past it\nI think that was just more of a story a yes you're going to have those areas that are in concern but for the most part when you look at what USDA's given us as far as numbers we got a massive pile of beans out there and we just need to go get them and so there's a point where it becomes a farmer problem versus a marketing\nProblem and I think that it is something though that we did have a lot of ah\nYou know we we had a lot of people coming in trying to buy this market on Monday and and good support and so not only that the seas analogy of it that it's October ... we tend to rally in a month of October when we had that and that we had that push to and and I think that that was just kind of fuel for the fire but now when you look at the weather forecast over the next week week and a half\nWere going to have opportunities and I think that's what given us the set back I don't think this is just completely fall out of bed\nBut it wouldn't be wouldn't shocked me to see this or maybe grind a little lower here as we finish out the week\nAround but uh but overall I mean I think prices are going to hang in there yet\nYeah and so my hang in there I mean I get there was none of my followed that much before you see you know with the seasonal high or is this just are we going to be a little bit of set back here to find the strength again and then kind of had higher into the end of the calendar month or counter year um or or just D.C sideways mean what do you see between now and in Denver\nYou know I I I think we can get a little more sideways there becomes a point where soybeans or just a value right when when we get these prices to break a is is sharply as we've seen and you get to a point you know everyone's looking at this carry out your over eight hundred million carry out right now\nAnd when you talk to guys and you say OK eight hundred million care we should have a seven in front of beans yeah there's a reason why we don't because there's a point where there is value\nBecause you've got South America there being prices continue to go up China we know their demand there becomes a point where that value is and and we don't necessarily have to go down and make new lows yet\nBut how do we grind hire at this point maybe the last USDA a acreage or guilt number that might be the largest that we see if we continue to struggle getting these beans out of the field\nNow ... yes and that's where I think that you look at this number\nJust carry out number that USDA has given us it's that's a huge number that might be the largest that we see as well and so for the next few months we're going to try to figure that out that's why I think we could still shopping very sideways range but that range may be sixty to Seventy cents\nYeah well and you said that that ... number might be the largest number we see a in that very well be true from a production standpoint\nYeah and I think demand is a big question mark in the cancellation that we saw and soybeans here today\nThat's got to be concerned for the market um you know what if the U.S he still overstating exports in what if you as the still overstating Chinese crushed demand a yeah I mean in my mind and there'll be potential for this to get two billion which will carry over so\nYeah you know I guess my question is you know with the balance that we've had off lows shirt and then and now now running into the last three days that we run into you know all kinds of adding up to today what do you what do you think producers should be doing this right now specifically the guys that don't have enough storage to put everything away\nRight or you know if you're not going to Stuart can store it you know you're going to be making those sales but there are opportunities to find ... ownership you know when you said as far as ... as far as just exports that is a scary I mean you see what happened today\nWe're running three percent under last year right now and when you look at that or I should say it's it's Twenty one percent under last year my research guys just through some numbers at me\nMom so it is something that that is a very very big concern or the pace that we're currently on what USDA has a son I should say we're well below and so there's going to need to be adjustments as far as exports sales and beans but\nYou know the big thing is I guess are we going to shake hands with China are we not is this demand gonna grow Argentina says hey you know one of China's gonna keep buying our beans\nI'm going to go to the U.S by him there and do it there's there is this this this thing so this is the carry out number ... ... it's it's a it's just to have you called pencil weapon or whatever at this point I think\nNobody really knows at this point I'm\nSo I'm actually kind of bring me and my next question are we going to get a deal done China or no\nYeah [noise] I don't know [laughter] you know I'm not in there but I got to tell you the million dollar question right yeah but the way it feels I mean if we shake hands with China\nWe're probably going to rally a dollar very very quickly ... you know if if we do and I think what it is though is that you get enough stories in the media we've seen how fast the markets moved just because of some kind of a tweet or something hits a news wire\nAnd the market goes nuts and I think that we're at this point right now we're we've got to continue to watch this media very closely and it's not so much cannot deal get done is that are we working toward a deal right or is it just cold turkey forget it we're not doing anything with these guys right so\nThat I think if we get some more positive stories this market will find some support from out\nYeah and so we do have Trump and president Xi's sitting down and uh the G ... meeting on November twentieth\nWe'll find some support for about\n... yeah and so we do have Trump and president gee sitting down\nAt the G ... meeting on down wherever twentieth down when SARS Trump's had a history of of getting things done when he sits down with world leaders face to face or do you have any optimism or on on that meeting or do you think that's just sort of a a a fodder or or just you know for for a photo op basically\nYou know I I think it's a good step right I mean is it something going to happen and we're going to shake hands will be buddies again\nProbably not but you know we look at what's going on what's happening here the farmer has become a scapegoat out of the entire thing and so being prices falling apart the thing is though is that China needs these as well we see what's happening with the China's with China's economy\nWe have a stock market our stock market here that's been a flourishing but there was over there they're struggling and so is that struggle going to continue or are they gonna have to step in and do something different\nAnd I think that by them shaking hands or at least sitting down together as a positive step\nAnd I think what that positivity that could be some support in this market as well we always say try to come in and just say you know what I'm buying us beans and that's kind of far fetched year at this point but you know it'd be great to see 'em but I I'm not sure if it's going to happen that fast\nYeah yeah I I feel like there's a lot of guys that are going to be holding onto beans tightly as tightly as they can for the heart of it in hopes that we get some sort of deal done 'em and who knows maybe we will but I just I think we're really running out of time to get it done during our key export season I I just guess\nI Would like to see that happen now I just I I think we need to kind of soften the blow or or get guys prepared for the idea that it may not happen or angry with what you said I I I Wonder if maybe a marketing strategy for soybeans this year is\nUse stale use cash sales whether it's you know now are poor contracts\nTo manager downside risk but then the Rio ownership opportunities are pretty fantastic and you can do a fairly cheaply so and you ...\nYou can do the other thing is that you may want to look at something that's out a little bit further maybe past march okay I guess we're going to get into that acreage report or you know we're going to take a look an acreage at nice price levels kind of\nWhat we're saying right now so if we don't get a deal done we need to be careful because we could see we can see quite a few less acres next year and that may show this press two so\nAll right hold that thought the we're gonna be coming right back to talk after the bell talking more to be George [noise]\n\nWe're live on the red carpet waiting for the next generation credential soybean\nMom but can it be that fifty numbers up to fifty million bushels I've heard higher than that even um but I think there needs to be some change though as far as infrastructure change soap pumps that can do it\nUm we've got nearly two thousand new stations that are going to be offering this though within the next two years and so it it is going to be a bigger deal for the marketing seasons ahead how much of that is going to change\nI don't know I'm I feel that it it could be a bigger story than what we're trying to make it out to be at this point okay you know if that demand really kicks in or if we see that happen\nI I think that we could see this demand a little bit bigger than what they're trying to make it be\nOkay so I tend to agree with that no you know we talked about until he means or what do we think the seasonal highs are in at this point or something like you might have a little bit of a different opinion on corn ... is that I Do\nYeah I Do like I said I think there's a bigger story for corn um and I it's just when you see beans that that could stay in a range like they are it's time to say hey guess what corn should be at four dollars we should be an eight dollar beans right so right it is something though that I think there there is probably quite a bit of support underneath the corn market\nBut if we can hold this three Seventy area and technically if we can take out this three eighty\nHi well I think these funds the bigger managed money may come in they're short roughly about forty thousand contracts but may may try to come in and and not that everything has to be so bullish but what it is is that is just less\nFor short roughly about forty thousand contracts but they may try to come in and and not that everything has to be so bullish but what it is is that is just less bearish right so let's get me out a and you see them to become more of a flat position\nAnd so I I think that that might be the stand that we see her moving forward we may get some more liquidation fund money that could help us gravitate a little bit higher as well\nSo what do you think produces should be doing with that at this point especially with Bush will that they are going to be selling or do you think that we should be trying to store corn as much as possible like we have in years past\nYou know farmers loved to hang on corn you know this\nYou know and you know and they tend to sell it off to combine or you know you try to sell the beans off a combine a stash the corn wherever you could put it but I think this year though you've got guys that are storing a little bit more beans and maybe making those sales for corn you know but I think if we can\nGet if we can get these or we can get corn took to gravitate a little higher if we go about three eighty your next stop is maybe three Ninety four dollars for December so that puts your may contract though sitting at\nFour Fifteen um you know or even July out there it sell it look at making some sales I think you're going to get opportunities for corn\nTo make these sales but you got to pull the trigger don't get married to the crop hang on to it but sell it and I think I think those opportunities could be coming here within the next few months\nYou know right hey let's move on we what are you thinking about I mean we've been in sideways range between Bible five twenty five ... Chicago where we go from here\nYou know I really think we're probably still ranch about 'em and and the reason for that sure export sales that was actually I mean we have decent sales today compared to what we've seen um the problem is that we just have so much we we've got a lot of weak globally too so\nYou don't have that story that that could generate more buying out of the sweet if this thing with Russia if we start seeing export whatever you want to call it delays are stationed limitations\nPerfect you know it's that is something that is a story you can hang out too and we probably will start getting more demand you've got to watch these export numbers if we can if we start exporting it fantastic this market can get exciting because we tend to do that\nBut overall right now we're missing that excitement you get a good story you run a higher and then all of a sudden it starts to give it back because of whatever else\nAnd so I Believe that we're probably going to be pretty range but right now until you get that story till you see some problems but\nExports where it starts\nPerfect now we're sort of running out of time here got a little over thirty seconds but uh you know quick to take on cattle a camera on the report here tomorrow afternoon you guys I mean we're looking for a bears report but your guys that's estimates are maybe one of the leaf spiritual out there uh where do you think you had to go from here\nYou know I I think cattle probably can gravitate a little higher the thing that gets me though for cattle you got the funds that are long Seventy five thousand contracts right now for cattle we've got to be careful with that if we do get a parish report you may get them to grind or or get out of some of those positions but I think longer term that propels an opportunity for guys\nI think right now if we do get a little bit of a break for cattle you can find some support for the cattle market maybe work a little higher so we go to the coming weeks\nOkay fantastic yeah you know the thing like you said big large ... physician out their turmoil in the stock market and you know we were down sharply earlier we tried to come back yesterday down again that makes your your demand both a little nervous so you've got to keep an eye on that\nLeave ethic job buddy thanks very much for coming on the show had a great time uh the\nJersey everybody from a ... a great guy great to talk to you um have a great day so are we coming up next and uh we got a special guest here for the fourth segment we're going to do some things on there is a coming back to talk\n\nFox News Sunday Sunday mornings attend a news talk WG a gee\nWe need to go canoeing John you couldn't you better be ready downtime Dixie she's before they become problems with the service inspection that green equipment winter just around the corner you know in mobile equipment ready to get your heart you couldn't take advantage of banking services that can get the third screen\nNo insurance no payment ups and downs in July first twenty ninth team that you went into the down\nSome restrictions apply the green and it wasn't that company\nA world of relentless change the church brings a message that causes some to laugh\nAnd others to stumble however is the message that gives life and who\nDid those receiving insane ... won't Hoffman says we preach Christ crucified this week on the Lutheran our\nThis Sunday seven thirty AM and twelve thirty pm on W.

you're on the program\nFive five to one to\nWhat are the teams being under appreciated underrated undervalued\nBy the average sports fan by me just in general a bunch of good teams I did not mention let's get to a pet and Vegas what's going on about a year on CBS Sports radio\nHey how you doing I'm not even a family of this team to I'm a big time cowboys fan at which I don't expect them to get any respect 'cause they really don't deserve it but just one team that I see that gets absolutely no respect right now is the bingo they're doing amazing\nYou're not wrong path and I I don't know you know actually I Do know a lot actually I don't know why disrespect them openly consistently but I actually do no idea that because their head coaches never won a playoff game I\nCan't get past it and it's not like oh I'm all for two it's been two seasons I'm going to get over the hump you been to leave like Eighteen years man you're the second how are you the second longest ...\nMean guys win Super Bowls and get fired three years later that happens in a fairly that now that ... that can that can go back and go down you don't want you never won a playoff game\nYou never want to play off game but your your rights they had been very impressive they've won some big games they've\nYou never won a playoff game\nYou never want to play off game but you're you're right they had been very impressive they've won some big games they've looked pretty good I probably should get behind the Andy On the ... machine I probably should start to believe in this football him I just\nHaven't gotten there yet and that's almost certainly my bad there I think six in scoring their defense is a lot better than I thought I was going to be and the bangles certainly our team you could make a case for eight five five to want to for CBS is the phone number Allen, Texas what's going on about a year on CBS Sports radio\nHey how you doing man met a man look\nI'm shocked man I'm I'm just shocked man up\nOf all that you mentioned you didn't even mention\nOne team and that's the Baltimore rate has ... it's the them out\nThis respect is probably the the first answer is probably the the honest answer um I I think for me\nThe quarterback is the primary response and I know Flaco has some receivers finally this year and I understand that that as a team that has looked really really good I I just\nAnd I haven't seen the ravens play as much as I've seen a lot I think I was telling the guys earlier today I just you got you guys have gotten a good look right one of you said earlier that you have have you a ton of just literally just like with ... with his massive strength like a former major league or\nWhich he's not a rip the microphone from All right all topics as a matter of I Want to have you seen the ravens play much this year\nI've seen a little bit then they played a Sunday night game against the Steelers I Believe two or three weeks ago um they look okay I mean I think their defenses really is really impressive some impressive players on defense it's so hard to kind of trust Joe Flaco\nAt this point do in my opinion it was something I don't know your own strength I'm Still broken in here and I contribute I'm holding them right now it's ... or the ratings have the number one\nDefense so far they just absolutely abuse Mario to and Flaco is having a pretty good year I also like Alex ... even those numbers aren't that great I think he's like three point three yards carry but their ground and parenting is working because black I was playing well but that could end any second\nYeah I I'm not a I'm not a believer and Joe Flaco and I I was there I wasn't there physically but we all remember when he got absolutely\nRidiculously hot I think it wasn't a twelve touchdown no interception run when he won that Super Bowl and he also bet on himself which I guess I should probably have a total of respect for back in the day I just don't buy it\nI also you look at their schedule they crush the bills they lost the bangles they beat Denver they beat the Steelers they lost to the brown and they beat the titans and so\nI I'm not sure what I make of Tennessee anymore I watched their quality when I I mean I guess I guess it's the Steelers but they were so off kilter and I'm probably the short version Alice I'm probably wrong I'm probably wrong or CBS Sports radio so for ... five five to one to four to seven its punch the bike and go\nEverybody here's a quick way you can save money switched to a guy go\nDean homeowners runners a motorcycle journey to get it all guy go dot com\nOr dot com I Love Geico I use it I have not check whether or not there is a microphone insurance that I Hope if there is it sounded vendetta as it's\nBecause the microphone is so broken Chris in Houston, Texas thank you for listening and brother appreciate you man you're on CBS Sports radio\nHello what's up\nYou know so I had a quick question I Know you were talking about too that we haven't talked about or are under the radar but I wanted to go back to the Oakland Raiders I'm a lifelong writer fan and it seems like they've done everything they can to make sure they don't win this year\nWith a little closer if they paid a ton of money for a which I feel is that still over a a rated part about it he's paid so much for an asterisk Wayne against a team that he had coached fears before the\nFirst thing he does and he tried to weigh the number one defensive player in the league in my opinion and it seems like they did everything they they felt was necessary in order to start all over I feel like that's his that's his whole point in the season is just to get rid of everybody and start all over with everybody he fixed so he can truly making his team\nI mean I think it's just sort of I think the writers and start over completely as well now including with the guy that made a hundred million dollars to but they're probably not going to do that they won\nAnd still loves it when I just do the some of my head I think they won't twelve games two years ago twelve games yeah well games do that's where you weren't raiders their car was arguably a top\nAide quarterback in the league that air yeah he was definitely tops and then yeah yeah you have to have five at a point but he was great you didn't dominate top five\nI think he was a top five and VP candidate actually that's a fair that's fair those can be different things that I can be\nStew a loving his raider situation is really feeling it let's go to Ryan in Anchorage, Alaska Ryan what is going on buddy you're on CBS Sports radio\n... one of them are I was only in Texas have I don't know how that talent cowboys their second illegal going to go out they have they're better than going to be\nComing back there Charlene is only the older gal as deep as they get you know Charlie well jolly and been injured and they've been counted yet eighth and Byron don't tailing it play out of their mind tell me how ... you know like they're not allowed to do now\n[laughter] no [laughter]\nI don't like your I mean yes on both of those high you you are in the mail me I'm going to be wrong I'm going to be wrong I think on Dallas they have looked really really good you're absolutely right they are second this year in the few in terms of points allow perfumes points allowed one is the ravens too is the cowboys\nThree is in the ... the score points the titans\n... turn the times even in such a good defense the ... and ... look really good at times I've just been down that football team you're absolutely right and I probably should include Zeke when I'm Talking about\nThose running backs that can make your team still much better in fact he's I I wrote a girly earlier like if you know if you're on a team that has the wrong head coach in bed all sense of line and quarterbacks not reliable and your ...\nHe'll make it to ... I probably should have gone up Zeke 'cause that's exactly what he's doing I I Do think Jerry Jones is a not particularly impressive GM slash involved owner\nAnd Jason Garrett is is not the guy that I Would turn to virus hiring a head coach or if I had the second choice or if I had the third choice or the twentieth choice than league so probably it's gonna be hard for me to get there\nOn the Dallas Cowboys but you're absolutely right they played really really impressive defensively they've got ... and they could surprise a lot of people in the division is not particularly challenging I'm\nMr he'd been dead or anybody that I'm leaving out the you want to you want to throw into the more respect for the times for me I don't think they don't get enough respect I think there's a chance they could be better than we think they are\nAnd therefore I won't show those get outta here stop it come on you are listening to later than you would bill later what's\nGoing to build a writer with the team or the weakest broad bipartisan\nThis week team is the Boston Red Sox have for splitting the first two games\nOf the Arabs see as against the ashes at home the red Sox have gone on the road to win two straight in Houston given them a three one series lead Boston is for no all the time a navy three one lead in a batch of seven series rocky by Ferguson\nHey trade pros Fergus is proud to be a part of what you do with over one thousand one stop shop counter locations expert associates an on match selection of old EM repair parts learned more at\n... dot com told this throwing the show one of my favorite people in the business loved watch him when he was playing really\nReally glad that I got to know the guy good do smart guy Jerry ... junior joined me right now from the west coast Mr Jerry here's engineer the real Jay here on Twitter what's up buddy\nBill what's going on how you doing a good man so what's a\nIt going by the way it is an exuberant 'cause this this this this fan base has\nBeen here so many times and obviously of late has not gone that World Series ring is not going to a championship how how's the mood out west\nMood is great you know I think getting up in our series three games a to\nA really helped change the mood for for the better I Know we were down two games to one a few days ago the mood here was a kind of nervousness or anxious or worried\nBecause we do the birds are pretty good book a great bullpen really good manager and credit counseling there there is a good thing but the last couple of days the Dodgers are found a way to win a you know the first four games or series I don't think they played their best baseball really struggled to hit the ball\nOn especially with runners ... composition but your game five but by claim her show pitch a gym\nUm they're able to ... uh uh get some heads together with runners a score musician and the Arabs away and so are the most great\nJerry ... junior here on the show Dr went off on this rant yesterday I'm curious if you think I'm I'm overreacting around right and you know you're not you're from Chicago suburbs originally I'm from Iowa and lived in the ... we both lived in ... when we were kids\nSo I'm not like a west coast or by birth but I I Love living out there and I just got really enraged that the Dodgers had to play\nThe Dodgers have won the last six years in a row where I gained weight from the world series had to have a two o'clock first pitch on a weekday when families can't get out there the traffic's bad in LA I just thought it was disrespectful for major league baseball Yankees fans will never stand for it\nAm I missing something here do you think based on\nYour data you you are get on that can't happen\nUh you know my my son who is in Arizona He he's he was in class at two o'clock and no you know your your bones and he's checking checking the score even tax me during the game he asked me why the council pick up my alley after one batter you know what I find him with ... are doing on my way in our class\nJust started laughing so I said just pay attention class you're allowed to do uh just to see what's going on as far as the game because it's the playoffs you know um but you know and it's great here during school\nUh you know people are at work men and women are at work and you know a lot of people had it had to leave work uh early to get to the game so those two o'clock start aren't fun\nUh but that being said Dodgers hacked the place uh yesterday a ... a sellout crowd yesterday for that to hug game it was loud a it was a fun atmosphere to be around so\nYou know the Dodgers fans are where the best fan bases and all of a sports than they used they prove that once again yesterday\n... and look at it it would not be acceptable over Houston or or Seattle or Phoenix\nLA's the second biggest city in the country I mean I just Jerry ... junior on the show I'm Glad to hear that it's not just me being a right to a radio host it it made me really angry Jerry one thing that was cool to see we discussed this yesterday in the lead up to the game or actually has the game was underway just\nThe pressure on Clinton curse all the excellence he's showing the regular season and the questions about who is in the postseason you said that he he pitched a gym is it a point where that matters damned you think he has a sigh of relief after the game or do you think he's utterly confident every single out in the postseason and his struggles in the past or his struggles in the past and he's not so\nI I think that in the past I think they're they're just\nYou know the couple of times the struggle a ... it's been blown out of proportion you know he got beat by really good things\nSeemed to have a I Believe went on to the when the world series or so you know there are only a couple of struggles in if I if I say this\nYou know yesterday mark Craig her shawl eight not third not for a whole season start with one ... runs allowed in three or fewer hits eight that is the most by any picture in postseason history think about that for a second now Roger Clemens not I'm not sure\nThree or fewer hits eight that is the most by any pitcher in postseason history think about that for a second now Roger Clemens not I'm not sure if you're not Pedro Martinez not just in Berlin and Tom gladman Greg Mac doesn't matter\nLake Herschel stands alone\nThing about eight postseason start with one or zero runs\nThat incredible so all this postseason narrative you know I I think is blown outta proportion because he made a couple of Bear Stearns but guess what\nTheir other super stars that have had bad games that's just the nature of the ...\nNow ... year until seven o'clock tomorrow morning within twenty five miles north of Nebraska programming continues on translator cage to nine zero Eighteen Eduardo fine point nine FM\nRead in the big leagues from a lot for a long time you come from a baseball family\nYou know you're talking about when it comes to the rules and the code and how things actually work\nIn a baseball game at the major league level what did you make of a man named Charles play at first base\nWhere you know I was on air uh after that game are doing the post game for the Dodgers here and it was probably one of the most difficult things or to express the feeling that I I really had because I was I was saddened by his actions I was angry I was disappointed\nI'm because he's too good of a player and I was probably the one guy clamoring for many Machado when Cory Seeger went down because I came up in the Baltimore Orioles organization or just like many Machado did\nA and I've watched his career is uh friends over there and I wanted him the opportunity to play out in LA and Hollywood play in the postseason and kind of showcase themselves to the world\nAnd when you're on this brand stays at the end all cs or hope for the world series everybody's watching not just fans not just um scouts or teens kids are watching\nYou know kids that look up to you and you know that's one of those places that I still can't believe he did it you know whether he was frustrated whether he's angry I I don't know I I Can't I'm not a mind reader but that ... that play can't happen in the game of baseball he could've hurt Aguilar he could've hurt himself\nUm he made no attempt to to avoid him he drug his left leg a and hit at you are and I think\nYou know once you look back at the video and saw that he was embarrassed because well I didn't realize that did that so you know I I've spoken Emanuel channel quite a few times I really liked him he's one of my favorite players in baseball he's unbelievable talent but stuff like that um\nYou know a lot of teams don't like to see that and it's unfortunate and hopefully they'll be relaxing last time that happens\nYou know Jerry whether people agree or disagree I'm curious just from the the tactical perspective of of how it impacts the Dodgers come what may over the course of the rest of the postseason moments like that\nThe the money sign on the on the home run saying that he doesn't like to hustle or those things that Andrew Freedman on the Dodgers aren't going to take into account when they decide whether or not to bring him back and pay them a lot of money or in their philosophy do those things matter a lot less than the dollars and how that what they think they're getting their the value they're getting for that money\nBill Bill you know what I mean in your friends you understand I played for nine different organizations nine now three nine okay so I have a lot of friends brought made the baseball a lot of them are scouts a lot of them are a couple of them are systems GM's\nUm a few a few of them are coaches managers are a lot of my buddies are managed credit counselor Alice core agents they robbed a strong is in the post season I Will tell you that I Can't speak for the Dodgers I I'm not spoken to them as far as in regarding many Machado\nBut I Will say this the last twenty four to forty eight hours three people\nThree different teams organizations are said to have you know what we're going to kick the tires on many Machado a they're out why that kind of well I think you mentioned the reasons are they going to be settled can Rosenthal look the way she played the game\nI'm the one thing you can do with how so he's a super star player I understand you can also all the time because if you buy hundreds these games sometimes get it wrong to second base you're going to be angry upset slender pat or pop up and then you gotta then you run okay I understand that part but when you voice it\nYou know this is your free agent here so teams are saying this is what they told me okay if you're not doing it in your ... year we're going to give you a boatload of money\nAre you going to get better are you gonna get worse\nYou know so I really believe he it's unfortunate 'cause he's top five player to me he effectively offensively unbelievable I I Wish I had that terrible and ability um but\nYou know the one person said hey if you want if I'm going to pay that much money I Want guys like Derek Jeter bus all the time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Norfolk", "day": "18"}
