tomorrow that would be a number London game London's calling nine thirty were you east coasters eight thirty central or like my buddy Jose like say seven thirty in the Rocky Mountain time\nAnd six thirty AM out there on the west coast\nOr the eagles and the jaguars which both forty years started a lot of people might have suggested this could be a Super Bowl preview because those two teams both played into put balls final four last year shoot jaguars had a lead over the patriots and the second half\nA but of course came up short in that game eagles went on to win the seat and to win the super bowl is well\nEither one of those two teams look like a Super Bowl contender do right about now are taken from a guy watches eagles weaken awake out and how they blew a Seventeen point fourth quarter lead the jaguars to the Carolina Panthers last week Blake borders getting lifted from the game back in as the starting quarterback\nFinally uh just went off about how he gets critique done a week in week out basis if the jags loses his fault if the jags when ... was good the random ... really well a nobody ever talks about Blake bore those little defensive are we\nThe jags loses his fault if the gags when ... was good they ran a ball really well ah nobody ever talks about Blake boy those\nLittle defensive are we\nTo those to think that's a really bad sign for your football team ball to those two teams went on the up and to\nAnd I'm not talking about on Sunday between the lines I'm Talking about in quotes leading up to a weekend game boy does try to defend himself and saying well with me anytime we lose it's my fault when we went in to everybody else is doing except for mine that's not a good sign\nWhen a really important member of your team certainly the quarterback being won a is defending himself and looking at everyone else and questioning everyone else bad sign\nUp for the eagles won the player was that coach\nDoug Peterson who this week was asked about some of the calls that were made offensively in the fourth quarter a eagles couldn't protect that Seventeen point lead went would both be prevent defense and to prevent ... couldn't get a first downs allowed the pay up as it's called three straight touch downs and and given the chance\nTo steal victory from the jaws of defeat get a forty five yard pass interference penalty which gives them the ball in deep and Panthers territory with under a minute to go and carts and went just quickly went over for a had a ball that I actually don't was picked off\nBy read in the secondary they overturned the call and said the ball at the ground I saw a bird this we have the game out here in the studios on CBS Sports radio looked to me like read sand was under the football\nAnd that if a touch the ground he actually had possession of it they overturn the call and called it an interception so what went just as an incomplete pass\nAnd cars and went went on to throw three more incomplete passes and eagles turned a football and the game was over the last Twenty one to seven when asked about some of the play calling this week Doug Peterson went down the road of\nWell when you guys don't watch Eighteen hours of film like we do come down on the sidelines with me on Sunday and make those calls with the play clock ticking a ... if you're going to ask those kind of question All right yeah go ahead\nIn other words don't second guess me on the coach OK I'm the co Q. or not you're not allowed to second guess my plate going [noise]\nGranted he is a Super Bowl winning coach he is the guy who delivered the first ever Super Bowl victory to the city of Philadelphia and for that the eagles fan base will forever be grateful but earlier this year Doug Peterson it said\nWell this is the new norm now we're defending champions and we have to act accordingly he acts like a spoiled child when question this week doing really not life your three and four dog\nYou're the defending Super Bowl champion and your three and four yes some people are going to question some of the calls that you make that's the way it works\nI couldn't believe what he said this week I was offended as a a member of the media and be as an eagle bad\nHow dare you as an eagle ban in the media is our conduit to the team for the fan base\nOr you don't watch Eighteen hour film like we do you don't ... standard down on the side lined up to the pressure you know what else they don't get paid eagle fans don't get paid you get paid millions of dollars to make those calls to make those decisions and deal with the pressure that is being head coach in the national football league\nShame on Doug Peterson so early in the morning if you're up you're going to be watching NFL football\nYou want to talk about we gate and the NFL we can uh NBA stuff the world series college football you make the call get on my lines wide open we'll get some calls in here before the top of the hour before we are joined by Brennan grossed out eight five five to one to four to seven\nAndrew from Maryland up on CBS Sports radio how are you today Andrew\nThank you for taking my call um I I think you're right in with the wrong and trading up for grabs the ... eater and even though he says they were caught on I think it's the ... name\nWell he's got years left on his contract right he's he's more he's already signed so it's not like you were just looking at him as a rental so if there's any concerns you're concerned because he comes in as a somewhat disgruntled player is that the reservation you're kind of hinting at\nI Would almost rather trade were one of the raiders layer rooted in a ... driver and her brother is I Know we were in the running for a minute or but the one that was the first they uh when we outlawed it and I loved it and I think it was because of brotherly love 'cause\nWe ended up getting a first for Cooper injury prone and\n... the I Would have been bad but I I I Would have rather go after like one of the raiders line then like Rodney and just play with a ... or\nYou know the rest of their known or injuries on the line during the middle and late evening\nOil wide receiver because it was encouraged out at the end up coming game oh hurts that might have another a knee injury and he might be out I really think wide receiver might be a huge question Ira ruin about Mary I'm at\nA you think that they don't for you I'm not sure\nIt'll it all depends\nOn the Redskins could use an upgrade ad wide receiver I agree with you there or they could also use an upgrade a quarterback so that's why I Would understand them having interesting Peterson um it would depend on the price as you say Peterson is going to be at first I I don't think there's any question about that would they ask for a first plus\nAnd even though they play different positions\nI firmly believe that in a given season as you lead up to a trade deadline and oh by the way\nThe NFL trade deadline is an actual thing now because for years there was nothing because they had it like the the last week of September and teams reticent to change that ball club give up on the ball to admit that they had a desperate need for a position or something along those lines that early in the season\nThey are basically got no traction where they trade deadline and they wisely continue pushing back and back and back\nGet all your

your Denver Broncos which are also my Denver Broncos\n'cause actually pick them to win the ... the year I didn't know what are the young quarterback intensity was going to be I said before the season if he's as good as advertised\nAnd can hit the ground running gathered keeps them deemed to be but I Need to see what my own eyes swell now we've seen it new cheats on the team to be a but I actually don't Denver can be competitive out there don't seem to you and go was a little overrated and when the Broncos won their first two games on steel I'm real good about my cell\nWas a loss for in a row come back and beat up the cardinals the way they were supposed to beat up the cardinals last week but where are the Broncos that\nYou know that's a good question dirty Mac has picking them to win the division wasn't that crazy when you looked at the personnel you looked at in case Keenan with what he did in Minneapolis last year and thought okay it's a division or the raiders are certainly going to have challenges with John grew and especially once they moved back\nA challenge to just ... Henry adjusting to life in the NFL in reading that right or the chiefs switching from Alex at the Patrick ... we saw in the home start the final regular season game here\nAnd had seen that arm talent in the past but then you see that the NFL level like okay this kid's just different and out of the game is expected to be there's going to the charges came on strong late in the year and said he thought okay\nKen the chargers or when the division or will the Broncos jumped back to the top spot and there was that Jesus died at all since it's been\nI was a really remarkable or their defenses wanna exactly what I thought they'd be I thought they'd be one of the worst defenses and football and that was with Justin Houston and Eric Berry being on the field with those guys not on the field figured they'd be even worse and that's what they aren't with their office has been so good I hadn't really mattered now as the what the Broncos are I think we'll have a pretty good sense\nBy this time tomorrow night I was a little bit earlier with the game being uh an early\nKick in Kansas City I I think that the Broncos\nSeason in a lot of ways rests\nOn tomorrow night's gay or tomorrow morning game a depend on what you're watching it I guess one tomorrow's again uh and\nAnd like I say that the seasons not officially over mathematically the division will be lost tomorrow if they lose and no one's picking them to win especially in Vegas right the double digit underdogs if they when they turn the season around that come one game closer to\nKansas City is still has two dates with the chargers or at least one or I'm Sorry one more day with the chargers and been plenty more football left to be played\nSo uh I think the game in arrowhead is going to mark the bronco seat and you have to have had a team they are I don't know we could break it down\nA I think they're better than what we saw in the last of the jets I don't think anybody is as good as they ...\nYou know they were so much better than the cardinals but that's not a realistic we get in week out expectation they did hold the chief twenty seven points and should have won that game on Monday Night or a few weeks ago and weak foreign in Denver and they played the rams pretty tough the rams were really impressed with the Broncos did defensively there just wasn't enough often there that day\nHow they going to add to it you usually think of that is just a a positive but sometimes minutes get changed in guys roles get change like and they don't always handle it well how's Denver gonna handle when they get some of their injured players back\nWell and you didn't mention will the thrill bart and who they gave a nice new contract to who\nWhen you look at it on the surface here like this guy looks like he could he be that guy when you're at the rec center plan pickup ball that nobody wants a on their team 'cause he takes every shot but he makes all these crazy shot he's turned into a really nice place for them so Barton they know how he fits but you're right Isaiah Thomas a talking with folks around the nuggets they say he's the perfect guy\nFor that locker and because his personality is completely different than anyone they ... their best player to mom or in Gary hairs are right there and we'll set by the sea the highest paid the veteran guy he'd been it all started when a playoff games but I said Thomas who hasn't even stepped on the court yet\nAnd they don't have a an exact timetable uh I was told this by a really high place nuggets source a pretty recently that\nHe comes in at breakfast Iraq because everyone's got into that down but you know just quiet somber hey guys what's going on like he's that guy he's the\nThe spark plug that gets them going so if it's on the court I think you'll have to have the ball in his hands that's what would be most effective and we're already seeing where like uh my mom wants to play Monday Morris kid at Iowa State of point guard and let your mom or you go back to those natural position to to go a little bit more\nAnd ... and get it they can both handle the ball but you've I T the ball and then he'd\nA demand obviously some attention that all out civil Murray maybe get more open\nOPEN LOOK Michael Porter juniors icing on the cake that kid if it's back to hold up putting it on the court this year at all or next year and be anywhere close to a hundred percent he's going to end up being the steel to draft maybe this side of the mass trading for Luca Dutch because\nHe's a freak show you know I I went to Kansas and I have to keep

liquor Rick when he came out with the great adventures slick right now this is definitely montel though I can tell you that he thinks about\nFriday night Saturday Night and we are back here on fantasy football taking your phone calls at eight five five to one to four to two seven eight five five to one to four CBS\nUh during the break I asked Dave hey can you give me to start that each position a physician real quick and he'd never responded so I'm going to be a good friend and a good co host and just just throw them into the fire they can you give me two starts at each position real quick with\nPleasure let's start a quarterback where you know all the studies that are out there I'm not going to waste your time with Aaron Rodgers and Patrick ... homes\nBut I Am going to waste your time with Michel ... who has three straight games with over three hundred yards\nAnd at least three touchdowns in each he has achieved\nMust start status and I think Andy Dalton going up against Tampa Bay loving outstanding game the bucks give out a slew of as he points to opposing quarterbacks\nAnd Dalton that home in a get right spot it it there is no exception where he talked a little bit about Philip Lindsey but now that he's the main running back there is no rice Freeman I Know that the vote that Booker will have a role but I think Phil blends who's going to see a career high and carries yards\nCatches receiving yards he's going to have a monster day I think everybody should get him locked and loaded into fantasy last and I think people should do the same with Chris Carson I Know he disappointed in his last game it was against the raiders he should have had a monster game he only play three quarters and the game\nAnd the fourth quarter told garbage ... that's why we're shot penny had the work that he did so I Would go right back to to Chris Carson at wide receiver I'm I'm going to keep writing the Bengals Tyler boy the number two wide receiver they're going to play in the ... a lot against Tampa Bay\nHe should be able to score this week and I think John Brown does the same thing and because I'm such a nice guy I'm going to give you another wide receiver drawing I'm Alison expected to make his return for Green Bay against the ramp should be a high scoring game adding Aaron Rodgers likes what he's gotten a ... and I think he's happy to have him back tight end\nDavid a joke it's been hot you're going to keep writing him OJ how it's been great\nLikes what he's gotten a ... and I think he's happy to have him back tight end\nDavid a joke who's been hot you're going to keep writing him OJ how it's been great to win there hasn't been quite as many headlines about OJ Howard but he continues to get decent garbage and you can find the hands on and you know Jim is when some like Selena on his tight end and Jared Cook I think it's going to be the biggest benefactor of the uh Oakland Raiders\nWith a mark Cooper no longer on the team Cooper's gone targets are going to get spread out to everybody but I think jerk cook all see a lot more and it's not a bad match against Indianapolis they're starting safety or banked up\nAlright listen people or if you listen to our podcast you know I've already said this we've already said that surround them all Allison is under own Dave just called them sneaky start he's Seventy one percent or to CBS Sports icon exist on a low ownership percentage I think it needs to go up there is no chance she'd be a free agent many of my colleagues I pick 'em up\nOr he's had anything let something like sixty four to eighty yards in all four of his games two touchdowns in four games he's talented he's in a great all fence\nAnd uh I think you're going to regret it if you leave him on own so please pick up John ... and I've got a couple of more bold predictions I gave one about ... most dirt and his fantasy owners in our first segment I Will save my next to for our third segment right now I Want to hear from you at the at our

reference I Love it\nOh man I grew up on flickering he was he was the first um bad album that I bought [laughter] 'cause you know when you're when you're a kid in my area in which you're listening to its bad uh it was so good\nAt all you gotta look Mona Lisa is on\nThat huh [laughter] oh okay I'm In ...\nThat that's a was when my child Jordan track okay so my question is I have a a for a number to running back as attentive people fight PR league\nAnd I have a yelled in Carson or a chart if you don't like any of those options I could take a\nUm either Aaron Joe or or um more or whatever his name and\nMost are ready most are right here in ... I don't know if you have to stardom but you drive your job yelled in for Aaron Jones right now\nA hundred percent what I was about to say the jails and it's going to be limited to a passing downs role and that's not bad for the PR league like here's Greg\nBut I think Aaron Jones says more upside the rest of the season that's what you're looking for and ask you this week I think the best running back to that you should go with is actually Chris Carson he doesn't catch the ball out but I like the matchup against Detroit even if snacks Harrison plays\nThe run defense is not going to suddenly turned into a shutdown unit and the sea hawks I've actually done a nice job running football they're often one is playing well they're coming off of a by I think Chris Carson is your best bet\nDylan in Pittsburgh is on a five five to one to four to seven Dylan what's going on in\nThe thing for taking my call guys I got two questions for a standard oblique her cousins are Jared coughing and Greg Olson or ...\nI'm going to go go off of her cousins all nervous about cousins\nNo game for Nixon ... cousin top five\nYeah I think you're going to be I think you're going to be off on that one I I think at the same defense is going to play a little bit better I think the addition of Eli Apple won't change them\nInto a great unit but I think it will make them just a little bit better I'm the one thing that we didn't really talk about on the podcast is would you lie apple is being reunited with ... and ... they were all teammates at Ohio State I think that'll help them get comfortable quicker in that defense and cousins just hasn't been able to bring the touchdowns\nAnd a lot of his games lately so I'm a little nervous about him I Would go with golf\nHigh scoring game great often said he's and he's going to do fine\nAnd I'm going to go with Iran over Olson but I'm not in love with the broader as I was earlier in the week and that's because the return of jak to oil I don't think he bronze gonna lose playing time because of oil playing there but Doyle is going to take targets away from him\nAnd it kind of makes you feel like he touched on a bus type of tight and I don't know if you're legally do trades that at late nights on Saturdays early in the morning on Sundays\nBut if they did I Would tell you the trader ... brown while his values still fairly high just\nFor the record I Do have some questions about how much you lie apple plays in his first game he's expected to play yeah expected to play but I don't know if he's going to get the full workload is actually like I said with with daemon Harris and he like apple or is also scheduled to play Seventeen games this year the veins have already had thereby\nSay Iraq has a long criminal history here in South Florida dating back to Nineteen Ninety One he's been charged with criminal fraud selling steroids even making a bomb threat\nSay our faces five federal charges in connection with the mail bombs he will make his first court appearance Monday This is Fox News [noise]\n\nKnow Eugene chief sky watch whether the whether our weather's clear\nSkies and quite tonight with a chance for scattered rain showers lows around forty one\nNorthwest early wins ten to Fifteen miles an hour tomorrow high of sixty three forty one tomorrow night clear skies I mean you're all ... for news talk W.

I mean I Know that we don't know when let me on belt will come back but letter for net when he does come back we'll not be the every down back for the Jacksonville Jaguars might leave them in carries a Carlos Hyde it's going to have a role and they're not going to let TJ yelled and language on the bench he will see some third down work and you're getting OJ Howard as well\nSo then I I'm Sorry I think you're you're kind of ... and the other team\nThat I think it's like a six I don't think it's that bad and and I think it has to go through it's not available\nWhat if I could have one pilot rocket\nThat have been better not really I think you've got to do better than lock it doubled one\nI don't think that you're obligated to make a trade that's perfectly fair that the one on the ... the day of just debuted right away [laughter]\nI don't think you're obligated to do that this look this is a bad trade and you're clear I think you're clearly winning it but I see a scenario where you aren't you know it's not it's not ridiculous so I don't I just the sense of traits happen they're not veto of all\nI'm Sorry to the rest of your Li like you're winning the straight and and that's that\nBut I think Dan's doing the right thing he's the commissioner of the league to be impartial or unfair he doesn't want to rule with an iron fist she's opening it up to the rest of your league I think the best thing for you to do Dan is put it to a vote let everybody sleep on it tonight\nTomorrow before twelve o'clock eastern time everybody should have to cast a vote on whether or not the traits fair or not and it's the majority rules if it's in your favorite greatest not you're going to make a better trade\nWimps aid five five to one to four to two seven Korean Pennsylvania what's up Corey\nHey I have a um start to question for Chris Keller Gabriel ...\nI'm going to sit strike one and I know that a couple\nOf weeks ago he had an amazing game that was the Drew Brees right\nYou're ... or ...\nI'm going to sit strike one and I know that a couple of weeks ago he had an amazing game that was the Drew Brees record breaker game uh but I'm not ready to buy into him as a as a reliable\nStarter or even at a match up where the Vikings that past events might not have ... roads I'm not expecting roads to play does not matter I don't think that he's a good start here I'd rather go with Gabriel and goblins\nYou rank Godwin ahead of Gabriel I Do okay uh eight five five to one to four to two seven Benjamin in Pittsburgh Benjamin you're an eye on fantasy football\nHey get ... ah first off just wanted to say condolences for the city of Pittsburgh yeah horrible horrible shootings [noise] um so next uh I have a trade that everyone in the navy pulled the trigger on just one of what you thought\nI'd Michael Thomas and ... on your five hundred ... it's a ... point and also you get a point per completion for a quarterback\nSo the guy awful um the shell a carry on John ... where the and also lock 'em for Michael Thomas is that too much um you know we do you think that's a bad trade ... ah that's a great tree I think for me but what are you guys think\nYeah when when people offer you like\nMoney on the street or like gold Leon they just say here have this this is for you usually you don't want to be employed you want to take and that's what's happening with your deal here Benjamin somebody is loading you up\nWith the straight and Michael Thomas as good as he is he is not worth as much as Sony Michel who's apparently closer to blame than we thought carry on Johnson Andrew Luck it's been a great fantasy quarterback this year and it's a point for completion goodness she's going to be outstanding that lead and you get Calvin really on top of it I don't see how you ask that he asked\nIf um if he kinda backs outgrow it gives me three which three would you go for if I had to pick three this\nIt depends on what your receiver deaths is eyedropper ...\nI have that number two for one year Orleans sings\nA trick question is you mean yeah that's it that was that now I have and\nI have um killed called ... as it were out for me\n[laughter] but then I Would drop Andrew Luck no no really I I think if if you have to cook really out of the deal then that's what you do Benjamin but then this precipitation another trade where you're getting Andrew Luck you obviously have a quarterback on your team already that's not Andrew Luck maybe a trade him for the best received that you can get just to get that that's back at white out\nYeah I'll just say quickly 'cause I say we have another caller from Pittsburgh where we're obviously on in Pittsburgh and and uh it's been a say it's been a tough day it's been a tough week uh it's just terrible and um I guess we'll just look to sports into fantasy\nTake our minds of it I'm so sorry for everybody in Pittsburgh everybody affected by it we're all affected by it for sure uh chatting Austin's on the line Dave

to go cop and good when NPR but ...\nGoodwin has been terrible and he's got it yet an amazing match up last week and he did nothing and now he is a tough matchup and I'm throwing good went out

if it's if you are the gentleman shorted the way to go\nI think the fact that he's caught six balls and three of his last war games means something and I think you'll see a couple of added targets

I was setting you up\nTo sing to carry I don't you go to ...\nAnd I am going to say carry on Johnson I think his workload will be the largest of the three I think his match up is probably second best of the three but because we don't know how many carries Jordan Howard we'll get nor how effective it will be with them I think Johnson makes a lot of sense to be your number two running backs\nEight

thirty two minutes ago this is our president\nWatching the Dodgers Red Sox final innings it is amazing how a manager takes out a sure who is Lewis in dominating through almost seven innings ritual the Dodgers and brings in nervous relievers who get ... act\n[laughter] [noise] four are in the league\nGoal on managers do it all the time big mistake\nThen I just say that was that that might opening

win the game nine to sex and during the post game I was watching that one I was watching Fox whatever channel the game was on but after\nThe game but every channel the post game was on and I'm watching burn card or they had on ... bat I sat on a one other player I forget who at the top of my head off that Frank Thomas David Ortiz than Alex our biggest the whole crew\nAnd engage with that and I also have my Twitter open on my phone and I'm scrolling through Twitter and I see a tweet from the president of the United states and Donald Trump\nAnd usually when you see a tweet from Trump about sports it's something from five six seven years ago\nThat is just being re tweeted now that could still be used\nAnd people say oh there's a tweet for everything but then I started to quickly read that sweet and I go man there's no way that this could be from four or five years\nOh there's a three for everything but then I started to quickly read the sweet and I go man there's no way that this could be from four or five years ago and I go on\nVisit from eleven forty six PM eastern\nSo there was a tweet from the president of the United states and I think you'd have a little bit more important things to be doing but he's watching Dodgers then Red Sox\nLike many other people were and he was annoyed with Dave Roberts just like I was and just like many\nPeople listening more\nAnd you know maybe that sometimes you could actually agree with the president of the United states on something I Want to get it too much politics but here was between from the president watching the Dodgers Red Sox final it and it is amazing how a manager\nTakes out a pitcher who was loosened dominating for almost seven innings rich hill of the Dodgers\nAnd bringing nervous relievers who get\nShut lacked shut lack about that\nFor only gone managers do it all the time\nBig mistake he used the word shell [laughter]\nThat's great so after the game I don't know who the reporter was but credit to the reporter he goes up today Robert to the post game press conference and he basically laughing when he's asking the\nQuestion he goes Dave I don't know if you're aware of this but [laughter] I get nervous they laugh and waiting to get to the question that goes but the president of United States was tweeting about some of your decisions in the game\nAnd this is how the manager of the LA Dodgers and Dave Roberts responded to the president of the United states who was critical\nOf David Roberts polling rich all\nThe presidents of the [noise]\n\nUh I'm not used to it again in watching the game\nI don't know how many Dodger games he's watched a\nLittle peculiar privy to the conversation [noise] um that's one man's opinion\nPersonality please Dave ... are you already totally did a terrible job on the field and after the game and I got to be serious that you just lost like you took that question way too seriously\nTo say it's like it's one man's paid and you're like it's a fine answer\nBut I thought what the question what the question was just\n... minutes of put you on over to Dodger games that he lost\nI Would have just laughed at the entire question and be like oh well maybe we'll make about pitching coach or something\nAnd four or five years that that\nThat would have handled it I\nWant the response from Dave Robert but why you guys looked at me like I have Fifteen had\nThe guy just went down three one in the world series yeah boy one you just let your show saying it's over there is no way the Sox are that lady said you want him to have fun with a reporter's question about the president's only mining being come on ... if\nIf you were the manager let's row play right here you're the manager I'm a reporter from some LA newspaper hey Ben or the president of the United states just tweeted that you have no clue what you're doing and he said that you should've never pulled the rich Phil\nDo respond [noise] I don't tell the president had to do his job I Hope he stops telling me how to\nDo my ... and that's why maybe that in that condition it took a some press lessons from\nIt was just born or am I get so Dave robbers job after he loses a pivotal game for to go down three one in the world series mind you the second World Series if they're about to live in a row and you want him to be concerned about entertaining you\nI'm not saying you have to be so jovial about it but the question is is funny and it's all on\nThe other opinion on yeah it's funny that the president later aces sweating but today I really hilarious he he's supposed to find that funny I don't think he's finding anything funny right tickets hilarious [laughter] I'd fire is right Robin\nGone up and the fact that he actually seriously answered the question like I Would rather just had it and say\nYou know what I'm not talking about this this is ridiculous to just move on I\nThought maybe our project coach or something\nIt's really not the time for laughs when jokes are now mind you had not got to take this stuff is not ... well if you're gay did a horrible you in the game I get that if you were in ...

Shaw and sales go up against each other game on who would've thought or a chilling Rodriguez would have been\nBetter than current Shaw sale\nBut it was thrown pitching match up standpoint without they perform\nBut what I'm going to get to hear and gave number five\nIs how concerns or the Boston Red Sox with the health of sale because I'm not just by and that you want to pitch David Price in this game\nJust because it's not a big pressure situation and what this postseason pass no the red Sox have been adamant about their support of David Price\nAnd as of late he's been money and the post season and his last few start where in the ... and the Clinton game he was brilliant\nThen he was really good and gave number two so if anything I Would not be afraid if it was the game six the taught David Price out on the mound especially at Fenway Park out when it for one for one second\nSo that's why it's confusing to me and maybe the red Sox as sale is on full rest he pitched in game one that was\nTuesday game too was Wednesday at an all day on Thursday then games three and former Friday Saturday\nSo he is on Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday yeah he's on full rest so I'm not buying that everything's All right with Chris cell and he could probably still pitch should be needs to\nWhat was being up thirty one Red Sox clue don't think it's necessary and after the gate and I said I just want to pitch a game six he's fine everything's fine but remember there is a shelter history within this past year now loom or lonely he discovered the red\nSox it as a former Red Sox flare up in Boston for NBC Sports Boston he uh shares the same sentiments as me he says I'm not buying that sale is fine if price was going game five but wasn't ply them why wasn't sale in the bullpen pregame three\nIf you are behind on your bills than this messages for you how would you like to have a large portion of your credit card debt or medical bills forgiven\nNational credit card relief would like to give you free information on a proven debt forgiveness program it's not bankruptcy it's not consolidation this special program actually wiped clean the portion of your debt that is forgiven Gulf\nOr your free forgiveness information now eight hundred to no one six six seven new that's eight hundred to no one six six seven oh don't wait call eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh not available in North Dakota [noise]\nCBS Sports radio is on his northeast Nebraska on AM seven eighty one oh five point nine FM news talk WG a G north of\nBoston [noise]\nRockets out [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nJust chilling sounds of a synagogue shooter in Pittsburgh I'm don't Walters Fox News police releasing the radio calls in the moments of the massacre\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nWhen the shooting stopped eleven people inside the synagogue were dead six wound it can't happen during a baby naming\nThe last time off\nWhen the shooting stopped eleven people inside the synagogue were dead six wound it\nCan't happen during a baby naming ceremony a gunman reportedly shouting all Jews must die before opening fire at the tree of life Senate gone in Pittsburgh squirrel hill neighborhood went to his ... director of the Pittsburgh department of public safety\nIt's a very horrific crimes and that's one of the worst that I've seen and I've been on some plane crashes it's it's very bad\nThe sense that guy genocide is forty six year old Robert Ballard is President Trump says he should face the death penalty ...

I Wish you the best of luck and thank you for your honesty thank you so much for calling let's go to Kevin in Grand Rapids Michigan next up CBS Sports radio morning Kevin\nMartin or are you doing today during Greg go ahead\nGreat so what I find to be\nAlarming frankly with Merrill logic um you know after studying engineering and number things like if\nI'm so yes okay you have your sample size that one hundred and eleven right and it's going to be a ratio to some point and the deviation is probably not going to be that large I mean of course\nWas the only seven thousand it could be you know you could have less of a percentage than the one hand out of one eleven but it's not going to be like eye popping Lee huge difference from that ratio in my opinion\nUm that's just that's just a a map matter of principle you know what I mean if if you have that sample size\nThat I mean that's going to be relatively close to that which puts the number very high end extremely eye popping and\nBut once again I think was fair about that and I I don't know if the numbers are true or not from what he was saying but that's what he said and he did the research on it and he he wrote the book and he used people in it that that also a lot with science and and all that and doctors by\n... you can't just say all all former ... it's all out of all former NFL players because hey not all former NFL players are dead and not all former players donated their brain to be study so that's why I thought that was misleading a little bit\nIt wasn't very misleading because like you said\nYou have a sample size to work with you study that sample and you have one town out of one eleven you're trying to he's trying to say that oh we don't know because there's twenty seven thousand yeah\nA new door wait call eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh not available in North Dakota\nIndividuals and businesses with tax problems listen carefully if you all over ten thousand dollars in back taxes arrive on file tax returns\nUs tax she can help you take back control the IRS ... is your paycheck close your business and filed criminal charges our team of tax attorneys couldn't stop collections and get you protected us shield offers a price protection guarantee quote to get you protected today us to actually ... plus rated with the BBC so called eight hundred Bible\nNine Seventy seven Ninety six us tax shield eight hundred by one nine Seventy seven Ninety six\nCBS Sports radio was on in northeast Nebraska ... am Seventy eighty and one oh five point nine FM news talk W JAG Norfolk\n\nSunrise now just hours away in the city changed forever I'm Del Walters they continue to mourn in Pittsburgh side of this nation's latest massacre forty six year old Robert Bauer is accused of opening fire inside a synagogue in that city\n[laughter] directly\nAt least releasing the audio from dispatch tapes late Saturday evening the shooter identified as forty six year old Robert Bauer is charged with wanting on federal charges eleven counts of murder ours is now in stable condition after being wounded in the shootout meanwhile Pittsburgh is a city trying to make sense at all I'm devastated\nI'm hurt I'm angry and I'm really anxious about\nWho is to find out who the victims are 'cause I Know a lot of people who are members of tree of life and this is just so\nHurtful Peter Gilmore speaking at a vigil Saturday Night you'll more among the hundreds who gather to pay their respects that attack being called the worst attack on Jews in us history election day now a little more than a week away but millions of Americans have already made up their minds and voted\nExpected about forty percent of mid term election voters will vote early and in states that have opened voting centers of weeks before election day that figure will be even higher earning Michigan is director of the Fox news decision desk insist the trend means campaigns need to close earlier\nAnd it means that the messages have to be more carefully tailored um to get that vote but it's it's a trend that I think we're definitely going to continue to see\nMichigan says it's unlikely early voting can build a new support for either party but I can guarantee likely voters are definite voters in Washington ...

tackle football if you would let them in your opinion and also if you want to give your thoughts of the interview you can as well and they buy buy two on two for CBS we have one\nCaller did hang on patiently through the break who had to wear to carry him over from the last segment so let me get to him right now before we get into a little college football will go out to Cleveland and we'll talk to Kevin Kevin our you\nKnow do good in that are sort of quick question about concussions how can we never hear about it from a boxer and I'm a fighter will get chicks impulse that constantly and but there's no talk a lot of it cost them\nWell you you do hear it in other sports are hockey I understand it's something that's been talked about\nOver the years um with boxing in that manner and may I it it's a fair point um it's not something that I watch is frequently so hence why we talk a little bit more about football but\nTomorrow's point yes there are other sports where this does happen where there are high impact collisions such as the mayor such as a box and so you're right about that\nYeah 'cause they don't wear helmets or not and they're just getting kicked in ... constantly which you don't hear about it costs them as much as you do not feel\nI'm sure you've read up on it and if you Google it that you will hear but right now the also another thing with the NFL is it was ignored for so many years that like if you watch the movie concussion the NFL ignored this topic for so many years and now they're finally embracing it and they're finally admitting that\nYes there are problems we have to improve the game of player safety with X Y and Z so that's also another reason to be fair why you hear more about it right now but I Do appreciate the phone call Kevin thank you so much I we got to get into college football because we're coming off the college football Saturday also get you ready\nFor a big NFL Sunday where a game to kick off in a few hours\nIn London between the jaguars and the eagles and there's a whole lot going on with the jaguars and their team will get into all that\nBut let's get into the college football yet two teams in the top ten go down and that of course we're taxes to they did lose to Oklahoma State thirty eight to thirty five and in Florida goes down through Georgia and on the Georgia Florida game\nGeorgia when thirty six to Seventeen it just shows you where the two programs or at least\nIt's down to Georgia and on the Georgia Florida game Georgia wins thirty six Seventeen it just shows you where the two programs or at least is a building near for Florida with the new head coach and\nGive them credit they'd done a nice job this year but they're not on the same level\nOf Georgia right now and that was displayed and what we got to see Saturday and a lot sided score thirty six to seven TNN at times it was closed for the Andre swept made it be a little bit more lopsided to maybe what the score does reflect but Georgia's a team that they will get back into the college football playoff conversation\nI don't know if they're going to get into the top for by the end of the year but they're in that conversation with only happen one loss\nAnd you wanted to see how they would bounce back from the last Dallas you\nThey bounce back within a very nice to Europe against Florida Florida you continue to attract them along the rest of the way but I'll be curious to see what that program is this time next year and then with the Texas Oklahoma State game\nAnd Texas I never thought they were the six best team in the nation but with the record that they had\nThat's where the they were going to be so you have them fall back and they're going to drop out of the top ten and so it was Florida but at the end of the game and I didn't watch this game live but I saw the highlight of it the Oklahoma State quarterback is taking a knee\nAnd yet at Texas player Russian very hard and it led to a ...\nAnd it led into a little bit of a a scrum right there and watch it at right now ... comes running onto the field Tom Herman was outrage but it was just player who was aggressively Russia on a on a kneel down\nAnd gun than just puts his hands up in the air and at the end of the game the two coaches did embrace it and they talked it out they helped it over and everything was fine so those\nAre two top ten match up the teams that did go down and we'll see who does enter now the top ten\nYou have to consider Ohio State they did not play this weekend but they only have one last night was to Purdue Kentucky could go into the top ten and maybe Washington state could be I think those are three teams that you would consider\nA potentially going into the top that only two well because Florida is going to fall back from nine and Texas going to fall back from six outside of the top ten and how about Kentucky they played in Missouri that spread was funky\nIt was a seven point Missouri was the favorite as good a Kentucky was and we took Kentucky all of a sudden the show plus the seven points but at one point I was like Missouri's get when they were going to cover the game\nBut Missouri's all fence could not get going and the second half and you look in Kentucky at one point their defense have forced eight three and out of the Kentucky often couldn't do anything\nHave over twenty five years of experience

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHe's glad you're still here no bus to the sec guild show [noise]\n... show right here on CBS Sports radio\nWe have a football Sunday Coming up later today as I say right at the halfway point so next week I I think it's a good time to just look back and see where everyone is the national football league what surprised us in a good way and what surprised us in a bad way who've been impressed about and all that so we'll do that next week but\nHey you got some good games this weekend Packers in rams saints and Vikings ravens in Panthers and even some good divisional matchup swear yeah teams are going in a different direction but you always do with the visual matchups\nThey're always usually tough game and you have one with the Redskins and the giants and paid for the giants should have no business being in this game because they can't block and the Redskins have a good from seven but this is a good test game for the red skins who and three out\nLast for weeks they have victories and they're only last word to the same and they beat the Panthers along the way\nI had a victory up against the Packers so there's a Redskins team they beat the cowboys last week they're moving in the right direction but if you're a team that is going to be in the conversation to win the seas and now may be looked at as the favorite which you could something that debate\nOn who will be the favorite of the NFC depending on what Philadelphia does in a few hours and if you're still believe in the cowboys they're not that's up to you\nBut at the Redskins won that continue to be the top dogs in this division keep on winning and I and I know that it's just easier said than done but you look at their schedule Amy a tough game of really tough game that the red skins had\nThe rest of their way on their schedule because there's not a game on the schedule the Redskins that you look at it and you say oh the Redskins they can't win that game not that they're going to win them all\nBut they took care of business the last four weeks three times\nThat the giants they had the falcons at home that Tampa other home against you sit in Houston's improving so that's a very tough game than there at Dallas there at Philly and their home against the giants so you gotta when your digital games\nBut it's not a very typical schedule and that the team that's already foreign too so we'll see if they could take care of business or if you lie and hotel in St Paul and they have the game and that's at ... stadium Brown's instills another one of those were the Steelers should win the Steelers are catching that read them right now\nAnd I think we will see something different than what you saw the first time between these two teams where it was a tie\nBecause I Believe the Steelers are going in one direction\nAnd the browns are going in another direction this is a building years still for the brown and we've got a sided with the browns early on\nBut after that jets game they choke it away up against the writers they come back they beat the ravens and they lose the charges and it was to the box so this is a continuous year where you're learning when you're Cleveland you can't go from ... to sixteen at all\nOvernight or even the tendency so there's going to be some ups and downs but the brown schedule gets extremely tough act Pittsburgh today at one PM then you're playing the chiefs yeah the falcons go down three and four after that when I'm On the football against the giants and thereby week\nSo that doesn't get easy then you had to buy with the bangles the Texans the Panthers\nNot an easy schedule San easy schedule whatsoever so the ... start to come down\nBack to what they actually are but the experience these players are getting these young players and the time they are getting right now will be very valuable and you look at the browns maybe next year as a team that could potentially be one of those wild card spots in the AFC if they continue to move\nThis trained in the right direction ravens that Panthers last week Panthers\nCome from behind that that dramatic when in Philadelphia they started the fourth quarter down Seventeen after they win the game Twenty one to Seventeen and the ravens lose on a Justin talked or miss the extra point\nTo the New Orleans saints ravens in Panthers\nThis is going to be a game them go love to see him go up against this ravens defense which is an excellent if the ravens can force turnovers on camera Newton and protect the football with Joe Flaco in the wrong it without Collins they can win the game but that's the key here you have\nTo force turnovers with camp\nYou have to force those turnover so you want to see if this Panthers defense\nCan progress and improve because it hasn't had not been as impressed with his Panthers defense compared to other years but\nIn this case it was extremely impressive what they did last week in Philadelphia up against the defending champ down Seventeen out they come back and score Twenty one answer and it's something that makes you raise an eyebrow when you look at the Carolina Panthers\nHackers at the ram the rams to me and I'm saying this for weeks and you don't need a PHD in football to say this but the rams to me are by far and away the best team in football this year\nThat does not mean you win the Superbowl though\nAt the end of October you got to continue to stay healthy you got to continue to play good defense play good often have a great coach and McVeigh but right now the rams look so good but you have the\nFactor in here and if you let Rogers hang around he could come back to bite you in the you know what so Packers at rams the rams should win this game\nBut it comes down to the ... Rogers hang around and if you let 'em hang around and make a mistake that sort of come back to hurt you\nAnd then a saint that Viking\nWe all know this was a playoff game last year in the division around the Vikings have the Minneapolis Miracle where at the time it was seen them to to find digs but this is the to me the marquee matchup of the week this is the best match up of the weekend\nBecause you at the same team that is cruise in right now we're Drew Brees and you have a Vikings team that's playing good solid football right now after a slow start\nAs this uh biking seen I think will be very dangerous add some problems early on what the defense Mike Zimmer was not happy was clear\nAs this uh biking seen I think will be very dangerous add some problems early on what the deep end Mike Zimmer was not happy it was clear that he wasn't happy\nBut this often says so much potential\nI think this is going to be a high scoring affair I lean towards Minnesota 'cause I think the Minnesota defense is better than New Orleans but I can see there's been thirty something point back and forth really fun game and I liked her cousins\nIn Minnesota and dealing continues to be a star each and every week he ... and this guy has been so good\nHe's been ridiculous with this quite an ad in the ... and that symmetry synergy that synergy with feeling and her cousin is dangerous and they've only had\nSeven weeks\nYou are listening to the sec guild show [noise]\nEvacuate show right here CBS Sports or radio\nTime to get through the pick\nAnother week in the NFL week eight let's get to the ...\nRegain National Football league I\nTo call it a hot streak because the minute I call the hot streak I Will start to regret\nBut I Am six said oh the last two weeks and that is put me in first place now in our picks which I don't know if I should be proud of that uh bent Horowitz is James ... you are now both tied your game back of myself so let me ask you a quick question\nAre you more annoyed that now I have a one game lead on you\nOr your more annoyed that you're tied was ...\nThe answer to that question I'm not annoyed and neither\nYou still topic I think everything is going to be with yourself\nThe truth is the way I've been taking and he can look at look at my record when I'm actually here mhm if you do the splits compared to one yeah yeah yeah yeah for me was one on the air if night and day\nTo be a game back after the weekend McKenna I'll take that any day\nWhen he did while they're in college football for it and here you complained about it then\nI have an out of losing college weekend yet I suspect has got to complain when things are going his way so we don't know Ben yeah\nNo bank to be oh and sixteen and the ... and he was still tried to spin it just look at the football team you root for April tries to spend that from week to week no way to spend\nThe listeners can tell you I'm not going to hear it on the line for the giants they get around the law that they do [laughter] lot but enough with the trash talk 'cause you're only as good as your and this upcoming weaken the games will be decided today so let's get right to him coming up bright and early\nWaking waking nine thirty AM Easter yeah the eagles and the jaguars inland\nThe spread is three points in favor of Philadelphia\nI'll take Carson wants all day over Blake board will both these teams are not flying as good as they should be\nThe loser this game I don't think will make the playoffs\nI think Philadelphia the better team I think they won the game but Jacksonville\nHaving four players\nAnd no charges were press\nJust screams to May of a dysfunctional team\nAnd a team that has a lot of problems right now\nIs better they've had some heartbreaking loss of hitting this game as close and the fourth quarter Philadelphia will pull away and they'll be able to hold on\nGive me the eagles lie in the three over the jak\nI agree with your pet I disagree with your assessment

losing streak fifty seven to nothing in the first time and combine that with the fact that they scored fourteen of your points most games I think the eagles jumped out in front early I think that

be\nWhat you guys just said I'm going with the eagles lie in the story\nWhat are you guys Christopher\nI Am taking the eagles mhm but for a different reason it just seems like Jacksonville is way too much drama going on there talking about their quarterback getting benched they're talking about the offense in fighting with the defense and the quarterback insults Conan was calling himself a

Gurley they do it that way they want a beach in the air well guess what we got cut off in three headed aerial attack\nAd in the fact that Aaron Rodgers is empty and he's facing probably the best pass rushing the league as they come home for the first time in a month give me the rams I think they went by double digits easy\nUh no no no no no\nThey had done go they had two weeks to prepare for this game to come up with by yeah you're going to give me the best player in the league\nWith a near double digit line\nThe best player in the fields Rogers I don't care what anybody says you know brain doesn't play until Monday Night right got ya\nThe bet you're giving me the best player on the field with a near double digit line\nEt cetera and I go back go\nWell Jerry ... your ... you\nOh stop it don't you'd be disrespectful to Jerry Kramer\nAlright game number three final eight twenty ...\nWe have New Orleans\nA rematch of the division around\nIn the postseason from a year ago where we all know the Minneapolis Miracle\nMinnesota now is the new quarterback\nNew Orleans though\nEven on the road is a point and a half they break\nIt's tough to pick against Drew Brees right now\nIt really is I pick them last week the nice job of against the ravens thank you Justin doctor but I'm going to pick against Drew Brees and the same here\nI think Minnesota just a more complete team\nThey don't have the better off than where they sell the damn good often with Kirk Cousins digs\nFeeling can colonel Rudolph please get going that would be nice for my fantasy team but nobody cares about my fantasy team I get it\nI just think Minnesota's defense makes they stopped late\nWins this game band I think it's high scoring too and you like that\nBut I Will take Minnesota plus the one and a half getting one and a half\nAt home quick question for you mhm and that it's not to you like off\nYou said I think Minnesota the fans get to a stop late yeah who won that defense is making a stop considering how their defenses outright I just think they make a stop ...

Rodrigues both for dealing they both much better than Kurdish on sale and getting number one it was a great pitching match up\nAnd the bottom of the sex Dodgers put up for runs but then from there where you start momentum shifting it's going to be tied up and to to prove it went right out the window as\nIn the top of the seven day Robert started making mistake after mistake after mistake\nBecause rich shows on the mound he's dealing only allowed one in the game he allows the walk to bow guards Nunez get to strike out but then they pulled rich hill\nWho gets the walk by Alexander they bring in ... who's been terrible absolutely terrible he gets jak you'd rather junior out then more lean heads\nWith two outs of the red Sox have been ... and say you should on this postseason with two out and this World Series Marlin gets the home run to make it for three Red Sox down and run but the bad decisions did not end there for Dave Roberts as in the top of the aid and I don't know why by as isn't available\nHe fits the less pitches the Jansen and the game\nFrom before and I don't know how to handle them all year long I don't know what the analytic say if the world series this is a must\nWin game you cannot afford to go down three one to one hundred and eight regular season when Boston Red Sox so I Need all hands on deck but by is wasn't available so Roberts goes to jets in in the aid after\nThe night before I don't want to ... and the ... the solo shot tied the gains of ...

and guess what it's two out magic appears gets a base clearing double making eight for Red Sox tack on one more Dodgers put up a little bit of fight in the bottom of the nice but it wasn't enough too much insurance for the red Sox\nAnd the red Sox are now one went away from winning their fourth world series since two thousand and four so much for the curse of the ...\nWhere Babe Ruth so much for that and no no no not in the play and all that the red Sox are on the cost of winning their fourth world series since two thousand and four and let me tell you something usually I Would be the person that would be\nOh I'm is there don't do it until the series is over don't touch the money until the monies in your pocket turn out the light the party's over\nThis series is over there is\nNo way I'll make a bold statement for better or is there is no way the Boston Red Sox show\nThree one lead in the series this thing is over they Roberts was terrible absolutely terrible\nLast night\nAnd I get it sometimes in this that's managing part of\nWell I think all sense of le they've got to create some big plays that's one thing we haven't seen coming out of that often but I really liked the way the defenses plan I Believe the right guy I think there\nAre in the lake and it's been the biggest area of upgrade from a year ago or ... now in his second year has got some really good football players drawn pain Jonathan Allen\nA temp settle we got some really good guys up front they can rotate a pretty good I'm Out through other defensive line the line backers have been solid and the secondary we've been able to keep people help your biggest difference between this year and last year on the fence on the ball\nAnd I've been in ... from seven of the Redskins as they continue to get better each and every week\nYeah the giants coming up later today for your red skins and this is a giant jumping the line that we know is not good enough manning is only getting older and then you sit down with you always have to target so how about this from seven up again it looks orange giants often\nWell I I really think that that's going to be the key to the football game obviously the giants are struggling trying to protect you I I think they gave up for socks and the first half of last week\nUm sake once one of the best running backs and again but that one of the best proceed earned shepherds another one you know he just can't give you an opportunity to make place because they will stretch the ball they will go down the field\nAnd are the worst thing you can do is play one in six foot ball team you know when you play a team that doesn't have a good record in the national football league it's the scariest games to play\nWhen you play somebody said like last year last week against the cowboys the cowboys I had quite a few more football games to that so you realize you're in a contest on you can't let your mind\nRelax and say well give just one sec such a team that has a lot of talent it put up you know thirty plus points against the Carolina Panthers and the Redskins often hasn't come close to put those kind of numbers up so you know to me it really boils down to the guys up front on the fence where the Redskins and the guys that are trying to block 'em ups on the giants\nYou're taking a look at the end of the Senate you still have to beat your opponent on the schedule but the Redskins or in a good spot right now in foreign to when I look at the schedule\nI don't say hey there's an automatic last for the red skins on it and when you look at the right to the Senate seats forget about the giants but how about the eagles and cowboys and those two teams is the biggest challenge here for the Redskins\nWell I'd say the eagles I I think there are they understand or who they are outside Jeffrey snakes such a world of difference in that football team I think the sense of ... he goes a little bit better on that side of the ball they have a good so far this year but we know what they're capable of doing defensively\nSo you know I think the cowboys are how quickly will they be able to assimilate I'm Ari Cooper into their own sense are they looking for a receiver to be able to make plays for gas can\nMean Zeke you'll have twenty yards rushing and I think against the Redskins and that's just not going to cut\nThat whole often has to go through was killed al ... and ... year when he needs to do to be able to move the football so yeah I I think the cowboys still aren't going to struggle with the eagles to me would be the ones that you have to keep an eye and read that but there's a whole lot of having all half of the season\nI mean we're not putting anybody in the super bowl yeah we're not putting anybody and championship\nGames like you've got to earn your right to be in there but I Do agree with you I think when the Redskins line up there isn't anybody on that schedule that I don't believe that they can play toe to toe they're going to be a sixty minute football team\nI'm Still he's still without Jamieson crowd or last week you're still without Christopher she's going to get better football players and your damage to him\nI think Jay current has done an excellent job of trying to manage the injuries he has increased opportunities for the often to at least somewhat effective\nTalk of the joke died been right now on CBS Sports radio let's get to the first game\nOn this Sunday late Joe it's an early start in London between the eagles jaguars both of these teams off this low starts and both of these teams did a whole lot of talking and the off season with the gym I'm Randy stopped an eagle saying this is the new norm what does this matchup come down to\nAcross the pond in London\nWell the jaguars deeds and has it been anywhere near what we saw here go and ... uh I was watching him throw last week and it almost looks like that hit just come back in his ... and ... that caused problems\nFor him earlier I I it's a big game for Blake from a confidence standpoint of course obviously for dogs as well you know you're going to\nStay with them or you're going to make make the switch 'em I ... the quarterback has to be able to play golf bubble to support the defense in Jacksonville you don't have to be great\nYou just can't make mistakes I used to have a sign that I that sat on my locker every game day and you know as a reminder to me one simple thing and it went like this never have to be the reason a team wins just can't be the reason it loses\nThe more they basically saying you need to play sports football\nYou know everybody athletically at this level can play the game that your head that makes a difference is that the ... make it the quarterback position or make a difference at every level the college level high school level pro level does it matter and in this case I I think the Jacksonville as to get some kind of confidence that they're also\nDon't get a job ... been right now Joe you looked at the state of the position of quarterback in the national football league and scoring zone but you have longevity up against early success greedy Ben breeze rivers and then you have some of these youngsters with lots of them all home just about the state of the quarterback position right now in the NFL\nBut I I think this is a great year for young and usually the quarterback position now over the next couple of years we've got to think\nThey're going to be looking in Jacksonville you basically have to believe that because you know Blake his struggles and this is the first time so they're probably going to be looking down there you know the giants open looking you know New England actually look you know that\nYou know if you know a possibility New Orleans fight but they may feel for Taiwan certainly not sure you got San Diego where it's still a perverse so you and then you have other teams that just don't flat half the quarterback that I think they're looking for so we're going to need another year at least of infusion of young guys\nIn the next two coming up so we really feel like the league has a solid foundation of ... really young stars and who's going\nAnd another team that could be in play for a new quarterback could be the raiders with Derrick car because I don't know how many more years he has left around newer games he has left with the raiders and they can be looking for a new QB after moving on from ...\nAnd also treated I'm Ari Cooper this past week\nOh there's no question there explain for his job but I think every we can go out there to play for your job but he doesn't have the luxury of having the experience behind him I think you have John decided to go back to coach and obviously a hundred million dollars if you will be one reason\nBut he was he wasn't going to go back and coach who told me this personally unless we could have had it felt like he had a quarterback I still believe he believes he has a quarterback and Derek caught 'em and you're All right I'm Ari Coopers\nHe could have had it felt like he had a quarterback I still believe he believes he has a quarterback and Derek caught 'em and you're All right I'm already Cooper's ... gone but it it's a great opportunity for the next guy you know\nA team doesn't fall apart for the rest of their tires assistance because one player leads or another player leads it's an opportunity for that next guy to step up and say look you know I feel like I can play at this level now you have my chance and I think that's what they have to do in Oakland I mean and and really\nThe ... deal Ninety million dollars guaranteed I think would have strapped raiders among he's a\nContract next there you know it's like ten Fifteen million dollars same thing so it's an opportunity for John to build as football team and I think the most are smart I think economically you couldn't afford to keep the people you get to go in the direction you want to go\nYou know I didn't like the ... Mac deal just because the generational talent daddy is I understand I'm Ari Cooper a hundred percent but a lot of these guys they're fighting for their jobs and I could sell itself but how does John grew to go into that locker room and still sell that they're still trying to win some football games this year but do they traded away\nWere you know John it's going to want one when football games no ... you know\nKnow coach stands up in front of his football team and says well you know and I'm just here and uh it's really nice job and I enjoy being a part of it or you go out and put together game plan to invest\nYou know every coach puts in darn near a hundred hours a week getting ready for the game for the next week they put it in the effort they put it in the time and the players you're right I think the big thing is this job and you're playing for your job\nAnd if you don't think you can play first of all if you you don't play to a maximum effort susceptibility to get hurt is great and that's one of the most important things people don't understand you can't coast that's why I don't think you could we won't see lady on that\nI I just I you know that'll be a year we saw what happened with a little Thomas in Seattle\nYou miss time you become very vulnerable and you have you roll the dice and it becomes a very expensive game uh when it comes to injuries\nBut every coach out they'll simply say look you know we have to play for ... we started only five I'm very familiar with the situation so we started with only five Nineteen eighty one when Joe Gibbs typical\nAnd we couldn't ... eight and Cory next year when he won the world championship and the next year we went back to the world championship and the next year we wanted to do this so you know we have to sort of look at the early part of a season\nWith a little bit of patience and let's not like you know the giants like I said they could get like\nThey get say Kwan do and they will get right and that's the big thing you have to hold him down\nAfter sixty five years of fighting like\nWe've arrived at a game changing believe\nInsurance and treatments leads to look for lung cancer\nAnd how people were affected by many different types of\nLeading cancer is in our plan\nLearn more at ... dot org\n\nI'm might be off about Pittsburgh synagogues Saturday Night vigil mourn the eleven lives taken by suspected gunman Robert Bauer is\nI'm devastated I'm hurt I'm angry and I'm really anxious about\nWho to find out who the victims are I Know a lot of people who are members of tree of life and this is just so\nHurtful Peter Gilmore vigil attendee Bowers faces twenty nine counts of crimes of violence and firearms offenses trouble at the Texas voting booths Fox's Anna Kendrick\nThe Texas Democratic party is accusing the secretary of state's office of not doing enough to warn voters that potential issues the machines manufacture is defending product\nTexas voters having troubles with mechanics of the voting booth they require voters to know when\nTo use wheels in Boston's fishing screen\n[noise]\nNo sky watching whether whether our weather center\nClear overnight lows around forty two\nNorthwest early wins ten to twenty months\nThe JAG sky watching whether the whether our weather center\nMainly clear overnight lows around forty two\nNorthwest early wins ten to twenty miles an hour clear skies and quite tomorrow daytime highs approaching sixty three tomorrow night oh stepped down to about forty one\nYear old just stare kite for news talk W.

that Boston is one game away from winning another world championship and baseball and the fact that I doubted Boston as much as I did is completely on me\nI've watched enough baseball I've been a big enough baseball fan my entire life so that was good team when I see it\nBut I although I I I'm only going to put it this way maybe watching Boston boat race everybody in the regular season made me

talking a little bit before the show today how managers make the same mistakes over and over again and I would tell you that the reason they do\nIs because they don't manage anymore\nThey read

about spreadsheets it's all about well history indicates that Seventy two percent of the time you want to make this move\nThere was a time\nWhen the last time a baseball manager ever held up pen in a game\nOr looked at a piece of paper was when they filled out to line up before the game because most of the time the bench coach would go and adjust the lineup card\nPosted in the dog out a lot of times it would be the bench coach that goes over to just that during the game most of the time coaches do not\nA baseball manager leaves a coach to do that coaches are adjusting to the baseball manager just sat\nWatch the game got a feel for it and then made their calls that way\nThere are those of you who are slaves to analytics you'll love it you love everything about analytics analytics

and that's OK the closer we grow to God the more victory over ... we can have let's listen\nMany times have you tried to overcome a habit that you would do about anything to get rid of both for some reason or another you just don't seem to have the resolve to do so\nAt principles for living we spend a lot of time teaching practical Christian living skills\nSo how do we handle ourselves when we stumble our development for a healthy lifestyle as Christians hinges on our understanding of the practical ways in which we can learn to walk that tore us ally\nUnfortunately our development is an instantaneous it takes time maturity doesn't happen overnight\nHow do we handle the highs and the lows of the Christian walk without giving up\nFortunately the Christian life isn't made up of the patients that leave no room for failure that's what forgiveness is all about\nI have all been told people that I Want people to use me I Want people to take advantage of me that's what I'm here for just don't abuse me\nThe love of God is intended for us to take advantage of\nWorks that good to use all that God has for us the problem lies is when we abuse God's love that means we take his mercy for granted we abuse God's Grace when we think we can live any way that we want and God will forgive us\nI Want to talk about that forgiveness and how wonderful it really is\nI Want to talk about two different forgiveness is that we experience and the Christian life the first forgiveness is the one that makes us wider than snow is the forgiveness that comes at the time of the rebirth\nThis forgiveness is spoken of in Isaiah one Eighteen come now let us settled the matter says the lord do your sins or like Charlotte they will be as white as snow though they are as red as crumbs and she'll be like well\nI Want you to understand that when our sins become as white as snow is because the blood of Jesus has cleansed us from all under righteousness God no longer sees our sins when he sees us God sees the blood of Christ which plans as us\nIt's a once and for all deal\nEach one of us has to be born again to receive it but it's permanent once we have it it can only be obtained by our death to south\nThrough repentance and then you'll remember ourselves to guard by believing in Jesus and the Spanish work on the cross\nThere was another forgiveness that I Want to talk about here however that forgiveness that comes to us after we're Christians when we love someone we don't want to hurt them\nAs Christians we don't want to hurt our father God but we know it hurts him\nWhen we send any seasons for thirtieth says and do not agree the\nBut we know it hurts him when we send any seasons for thirtieth says and do not green the Holy Spirit of God with who you were sealed the day of redemption\nEven though we're sealed until the day of redemption were still living\nDown here now are sin will have an effect on our fellowship with God God is a forgiving God and he wants us to take advantage of that forgiveness but it's abusing that forgiveness that hurts us the most\nAs Christians were going to stumble at times but we render ourselves cripples when we think we can continue or in our sin and serve God at the same time when we try to do that\nWe end up serving with the arm of a flash and we lose our effectiveness we also bring along with that crippled service Abad witness for Christ others are confused by our bad witness and begin to thank\nGod will not be bothered by our stand but the truth remains there are consequences that come with sending\nThat come our way if we're motivated by bringing God's glory\nWe will find it much easier\nAfter we stumble and fall\nWe're going to have tens of discouragement in our lives but Paul tells us how to respond to those trials in second Corinthians chapter four versus sixteenth rate team therefore\nWe do not lose heart do outwardly\nWe're wasting away yet inwardly we're being renewed day by day for our light in momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory not far outweighs them all\nSo we fix our eyes not on what is seen about on what is an seen since what is seen as temporary but what is unseen is eternal\nTheir lives in eternal glory that is coming we have to be patient and wait for the things that\nAre eternal to come to us we will be given our glory in due time\nIf you are down and out then you had your hope taken from you and songs forty to find that says\nWhy mice so are you down Cass why so disturbed within me what you're hoping God drywall yet praise him my savior and gone\nLosing hope is the worst thing that can happen to us as long as we have hope we will be willing to try again it's one we lose hope that we get down and wants to stay down don't let that happen to you you\nCan eventually remain standing if you're just willing to keep hope in front of you I've had many times in my life when I felt there wasn't any hope left for me to lean on under those types of situations we're all feeling like quitting\nBut God is eternal and his power is endless he wants us to have joined in our lives that much we can be sure of but it's just\nNot going to come to us on our terms in business there's been times in my life where I was tired of trying I didn't want to try anymore I just want to stand on the sidelines and rats\nThat's the way we feel many times in life we just want to give out we're tired of having a hope that is left one thing\nPicking ourselves up after we've fallen can be a very difficult thing to do when we pick ourselves up time and time again we do it and hope that one day we work with falling I Want to encourage you\nKeep trying no matter what we may think this time will be like all the rest but everyone they ever had a victory over something in their lives had failed all the way out to the last time\nBut if they had the victory that means they didn't fail anymore after that last time that means the ...\nBut if they had the victory that means they didn't fail any more after that last time that means eventually they achieved the success they fought so long to achieve\nHad they not tried one more time they would have not been able to experience the\nSweet taste a victory we may be tired of suffering that we've experienced in our journey towards a victory listen to what policies in our sufferings\nPaul centered Romans five versus three through fine we also glory and are suffering\nBecause we know that suffering produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope\nAnd hope does not put us to shame because gods love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us\nI Love that suffering as productive it produces something that something is perseverance that means are suffering producers in us the heart to say\nI'm not quitting I'm going to keep on keeping on I refused to stop trying I can do all things through Christ do strengthens me\nThe last part of that scripture says that hope does not put us it's a shame that means we don't have to be ashamed rubber failure because one day we will have the victory if we don't care about and want you to learn this principle fact\nOur wells are going to be influenced by her most recent understanding concerning or a problem\nThat means any given time we can begin to understand something in a way that we never understood it before\nThat last understanding maybe the very thing we need to push us through the victory so we need to be seeking for that treasure of understanding that will make all the difference in the world to us and we'll push us through to victory we will never find what\nWe need we don't look for it is common when trying to pick ourselves up from our latest fall to think that we need to try harder but trying harder isn't the answer\nTrying harder is only about reform and south well what I'm Talking about here is the wisdom that come from seeking God\nAnd his understanding and Matthew seven seven it says ask\nAnd it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the dog will be open to you for everyone who asks receives the one who seeks fines and the one who knocks the door will be open\nIn closing I Want to encourage you to never give up if you persevere you will find the secret of understanding that helps you turn the corner anything worth having is worth suffering for ... fourteen\nForty one and forty to assess returning the third time he said to them are you still sleeping interesting enough\nFor some of the man is delivered into the hands of

report that vacuum or who deliver sandwiches for Jimmy Johnson Columbus in his Nineteen Ninety One leader of a car received a new sport utility vehicles on Saturday from Jimmy Johnson founder Jimmy John Leah doubt\nAnd so I'm like okay like like give me a ticket and so I Do not watch it and she just like flip\nIt over without taking any of the peace\nIt okay she's pretty smart [laughter] one of those ... ... yeah\nYeah and it slipped it over and then you know flipped at all the pieces were right they had to get it so she did do it super fast and I remember having an internal debate with myself and like I just cheering on right now and just move on and\nFinish doing all the list of things that I have to do or do you I really like want to take this moment in and make it a teachable moment and teach area like that's not actually like you can say you did that but that's not actually the standard on how fast you put a positive get it you have to like take the pieces of pie and\nAnd I took that was a hard choice and it took more time and ride try to be a little upset 'cause she thought she did something great and I had to say like you know you did do it but that's really not the standard and it really is just in that moment got really taught me like\nThis is going to be the case we're always going to have to teach them to raise the standards like you know short cuts and know like just because I got it done but did you do it the right way because you had to take away\nIn terms of the culture today yes and how kids grow up flipping the puzzle over yeah I mean that's the metaphor for life for ... parents that make it easier too easy for their kids they don't challenge their kids to think differently or to do the tough stuff so that was the lessons she remembers that\nShe remembers that yet and socialize because I was like man this was supposed to be a quick\nLook [laughter] and instead it was a half hour but Johnson you\nOr you saw your daughter may be a different daughter I'm not sure but uh in the book you mentioned how you could see her moving from knowledge of God to a relationship with God yeah every parent raising a boy or girl or we're interested in that what was that experience and how did you see that in your daughter\nYeah it's actually my oldest girl who's now fourteen and um there was a neat experience because I prayed for you know all of my life and then even as we got married before we were pregnant I prayed for my children and just pray that God would just\nDoing them when he did me and um it was neat to watch my daughter she had actually just come back from camp and just share with us or that should give an electric crisis how old was she ... she was probably eight I'm guessing and uh\nSo we are actually a church service and uh they did alter calls already told us should go to Christ and you know if you go for the Christian home and you really like for me is I don't remember ever a day not knowing the lord like I gave Melissa Christ on several occasions several different church services and all that right like\nThere was this clear um I think broken is I think in her where she was realizing what God has actually done for like she knew it knowledge wise but there was a clear broken and she had on the Sunday in service just as we worship at some yeah and I was just shocked at I'm just the vulnerability that she had that moment and she was in tears tears just cry and those are real heart\nExchange not just a a a knowledge show\nAnd I asked her I said is everything okay and she said yeah and I said to or your tears happy tears or sensors and she says happy tears\nAnd I mean it's been really since that day she was baptized shortly after that but it was really since that day that we've I mean she's not a perfect world by any stretch but the reality is I've watched her have a heart for the lord that's cost her um just to see coming repentance to seek them in relationship to see him with all over\nToo well and that's what's so critical and I think as a parent that's what we want to see in our children is ... how are they responding to the gospel we take 'em to church now if you had boys you'd quickly learn the church is boring dad I mean really we've got to go to church I guess\nSo that's usually the not enough action figures version of that from the girl singer but ...\nKennedy's principles that I really appreciate it in your book she is yours um what are some practical ways to bring God's word to the heart of your family\nYeah well I Would say first it's just getting them into God's presence so for us oftentimes as a family one of things we really tried to do and um I mean I learned this as a as a kid myself listening to focus on the family but just the reality of just spending time in God's word together as a family so whether it be the dinner table or before bed or in the mornings\nI mean we start our days every day with prayer and we're always intentionally trying to get our girls into proximity we can't really get them in the relationship with God but we can get them in the proximity\nAnd it's their choice to choose the relationship but I'm just spending as much time as we can intentionally bringing them into the proximity of God's\nAsk you this question 'cause again and John jump in here with three girls have your own uh for me Jean and I will often have this discussion about raising boys and\nYou know instilling in them a spiritual lesson in a moment usually means you're actively doing something with them you're on a hike you're driving somewhere and you just start talking about a spiritual application\nIt's rare I think being a father boys to actually be able to sit down after dinner and say okay we're going to have a thirty minute study and don't fidget in you know Boyce just they have a lot of energy physically and they've got to be moving usually in order to hang with you have you found that\nDifferent raising girls do they set for you do they are they a little less ...\nIn order to hang with you have you found that\nDifferent raising girls do they set for you do they are they a little less ...\nNot at all well\nAnd we said all over like you know family devotion and always have to clarify like it's not like this pretty\nSit down church service you know where John ... a little message and we've got a scripture written up on abortion and ... it's not that at all I mean it is chaos and it's you know so it's the end of the day they had used to get you know had to sit still most of the day actually ended in ... they are wired um\nAnd so it's not pretty and it it it it's not fun and sometimes it causes us to you know we're we description like oh wait guide you talk you actually try to teach us something right now but it's just something that we still feel that um the importance\nOf doing it and I pray that grows will see the pie already that it is for our family and that that becomes a priority for them because of the work that's required\nThem into the focus on family broadcast will continue in just a moment [noise]\nFocus on the family has help for troubled marriage we came here with broken hearts

as parents and families thrive\nMore I don't think I'm a family dot com slash store [noise]\nThanks for listening to focus on the family\nLet's resume now with the balance of today's program\nJonathan being a father of four girls\nUm how do you express heavenly father loved to them\nTo help them identify with their life in Christ so often we hear about absent fathers or know fathers at all and the detrimental impact that has on girls particularly I think both boys and girls obviously but girls seem to struggle with a healthy identity then and we so often here\nWhen they grow up to be teens they will look for love and all the wrong places looking for that father affection\nDescribe how that can really\nCommunicate a heavenly father image to his girls\nYeah well first I Would say\nThis really what what I Try to practice is just presidents I think president is more important than anything else literally being there being there in the moments when they're happy being there in the moments when they're sad being there just as many moments as you can be there you'd be there and what I said be there it's not just be there like you're in the room but it's intentionally\nLetting them know that you hear them that you see them that you value them and it's difficult for all of us I mean I talk about I think in the book a little bit on this reality like for me I Love listening to radio talk radio conservative talk radio liberal talker I just love listening and just hearing people's perspectives and\nSo it's easy for me to put my ear buds in his own cleaning the house from moving around and just literally to ignore everything that's going on around me and I had to make an intentional or effort to take the bugs out and just be there in my home you know what I'm doing dishes or when I'm sleeping a floor just they're just being around so I can hear what's going on their lives and aside from presidents and just being intentional\nI think it's tailor made a depending on because all of our girls are different having four daughters I Know that\nEvery girl is different 'cause my four are absolutely different from each other every one of them and they all received of different ways so just being aware enough about what sparked them what makes them tick\nUm you know from my oldest daughter she really doesn't need a lot of conversation she likes to be in the room she likes to sit in my lap she likes to you know it's really just being there for my second daughter it's a lot of interaction she's very talkative she wants to tell me about her next to him now six moves and show me the gymnastics moving them have me help run an extra ... so\nThere's just this reality that there are different so like if you have more than one daughter it's really you know telling making what you're doing with each of them based on their personalities and based on what you've learned because you are there\nAnd you are aware of what's going on again the point being that critical love connection so they see a father's love and they can understand it and we hear so many of the negative stories where it didn't happen and it causes a young girl to go off the rails you know and that's a good thing for dads to be responsible for\nAn eye on it and I've not done it perfect by any stretch and one of the things I really love is having not been a perfect dead for fourteen years are just recently just this week I was looking at 'em an article that somebody did on my twins at their school and they said who is your hero and they said my dad something like All right I'm not doing it

[laughter]\nSo you can be normal weight but if you have a ... distribution that is mainly in your middle\nAnd your waistline as opposed and your hips and buys for women an for men that conveys an increased risk and so when you start gaining weight I'm even going from normal weight to higher weight which often happens as we get older I'm puts women it even higher risk\nHow important is activity especially postman upon\nSo when people ask me what's the most important thing I can do to prevent heart disease if there are smoker that's number one number two is physical activity and the reason I say that is there's such\nA deep and broad strong evidence that it makes an impact not only for cardiovascular disease but for ... and for bones and for osteoporosis and for preventing falls and being strong so physical activity is great [noise]\nThe other part is it's never too late to start physical activity we actually have scientific studies that say that women who start out at walking program over the age of sixty five actually reduce the risk of heart disease from the nurses' health study so it's free\nIt's not sexy however and it's a hard habit to adopt if you hate exercise as some of my patients do you feel like your patients are getting the message and are trying to become more active in mid life\nSo I think women are so busy and one of the things so that the answer is yes but ... but I think getting back to why I'm women don't take time to take care of themselves\nWomen are raised in a culture rated to be caregivers their moms they are you know they're the group's leaders there often even if they're in the workforce there the moms at work\nAnd and so often when we ask women even who had a heart attack why don't you make this change or eat healthier exercise\nI don't have time 'cause I'm driving my kids um my husband wouldn't eat that healthy food so I'm just going to make it\nAnd so flipping it so that they know that if they can do those things they will accomplish those other goals I e caregiving and making an altruistic thing which can be very helpful and that's been my biggest success in helping people frame it when I don't have time 'cause none of us have enough time to do this thing's its priorities and\nWe've talked about uh the the major risk factors and how important it is to keep all of those under control and exercise is extremely important let me ask you about a couple of other things with regard to heart disease prevention or there's been some recent controversy a baby aspirin a day\nWhat's your feeling about that in women who don't have a history of heart disease\nSo that's an important distinction to make because nothing has changed in terms of our recommendations if you've had a heart attack a stent or have a have had cardiovascular disease you should be on a baby aspirin unless your doctor tells you otherwise [noise]\nFor individuals male and female particularly older individuals who are otherwise healthy don't have diabetes don't have other things\nThe risk of taking aspirin and people don't think about that they just because it's non prescription or actually grader or outweigh or at least are equal to any benefits at one time\nThere much stomach bleeding mainly in\nDomestic and other types of bleeding because it it tastes the stomach but also you know wading into your brain and women and everything we do and every medication and every intervention and cardiology women bleed more so if it's a risk for men it's a bigger risk for women or it to shore\nUp this year it was very popular I'm a five or six years ago until we started actually having data from randomized clinical trials\nSo I I asked if I have somebody come into my office and their own fish will ask why are you taking them 'cause there are other reasons and heart disease you might take fish oil but I tell him to stop it yet\nBecause it's really not been shown to have any primary prevention benefits are really even secondary prevention if they don't like fish and they think I don't like fish will just take visual tablets so probably doesn't help because of the recommendations is he finished a couple of times a week\nAnd eighty percent of those who do develop them are a symptomatic we sometimes find them unexpectedly when looking for other things but we just leave them alone and they do find\nSomewhere around twenty percent of patients will develop pain we called bill Eric colic and this is a\nVery typical pain that comes on fairly abruptly over five to Fifteen minutes sticks around for a prolonged interval of a half hour to several hours before resolving somewhat gradually so\nAbility or a colleague however can then Rick or if it's developed one so that's when we start to entertain intervention a small portion of patients who've had bill Eric colic will go on to develop more serious complications of ... where it's a pain for this\nThe gall bladders very inflamed and removing it is I'm less selective in March and\nSo I Want to ask you about the risk factors for developing a gallstones when I was in medical school it was a female that forty and fertile now I don't know whether you can still say that maybe they've changed the words but is that still true\nThat still true women developed gallstones twice as often as men because of their millions of estrogen in protest and in the bloodstream\nWe know that a certain ethnic groups developed a gallstones much more often American Indians Native Americans or the probably the highest prevalence of gallstones Hispanic populations fairly high Caucasians below that and and African Americans are less than that even\nSo I'm uh ethnicity is important family history is very important probably a\nTwofold are threefold increase in likelihood of farming stones\nAre overweight states especially with the BMI over thirty the risk of gallstones is quite a bit higher\nUm and multiple others that are gradually less important fertility though the fertile part to having a pregnancy is a a high risk factor for developing stones or gall bladder sludge a precursor to stones\nA sludge often resolves after a pregnancy and stones tend to stick around so if someone's had multiple pregnancies their likelihood of stone's is much higher\nIn this mostly diagnosed because there's pain presence is that what bring patients in\nSo most gallstones probably go undiagnosed um but the ... of\nPatients have all variety of symptoms that may or may not be related to stone and then they're usually fairly easily diagnosed by ultrasound so identification of stone's is generally straightforward except a small proportion of tiny tiny stones\nUm but then the attribution of symptoms to the stones is sometimes a much more difficult issue\nI can tell you that there are outliers in I Am one of them female that forty and fertile and none of them and I had my gallbladder out and is a pain is extreme\nOr in fact I was in the emergency room three times with the same similar pain and since I don't fit the bill ... diseases took them a while to figure that out\nBut the good thing is you can take it out through the laparoscopic it's relatively simple straightforward surgery or in what overnight and really I didn't have to change my diet at all so that the surgery is absolutely remarkable are there other treatment options besides surgery\nWell other options have been developed over many many years but with the advent of laparoscopic approaches to surgery\nOr many of the other options became less realistic less cost effective ... less than they are less effective uh themselves so ... is really the only realistic option for the patient who can undergo surgery is a surgical candidate\nAlright ...

them to the president's\nRhetoric is separate and apart from I'm not I'm In no way [laughter] and I've gotten a in some fights on this network about this I'm now and nobody's saying the president is responsible but do think it's possible that it's useful to say that these events happen in a particular climate\nWell look Chris all across America hardworking middle class families are still telling us that their wages and salaries are not keeping up with the cost of living my Republican colleagues is your do not have a voting record to run on that it's actually prioritize hardworking middle class families that's number one\nNumber two as you look at the data Chris with what you put on the board there well I never look at any one poll data on our side momentum on our side the energy is clear\nEarly voting is up all across America as long as people continue to turn up and vote we will do well\nThe other thing is we're making sure that the American people know about the voting record of our Republican colleagues when it comes to health care\nVoting to take away protection is for people with preexisting conditions and moving an agenda forward that would have actually slapped in age tax on people between the ages of fifty and sixty four\nResulted in increasing health care premiums deductibles and out of pocket costs of the American people that's what we're running on it again an agenda anchored around for the people and around our candidates\nWe've been talking this hour about the tone the ugly telling our politics has taken and I want to play some ads that both of your

terms working for the CIA in uh Iraq and Afghanistan in Iraq with the CIA and then worked in the administrations of both presidents Obama and Bush is a constructive to call her of all people a liberal extremist\nWell you know I think ah I respect the this locked in service to our country and the CIA\nAnd in the administrations but A People's views on the issues are legitimate and there are contrast that we need the wrong so people understand what folks believe and I think it is fair to say that she is not in the mainstream of uh of Michigan politics\nCondos Luanda here is an ad that your group that you're sharing the dean triple C ran against Republican Congressman Mike Kelley in Pennsylvania\nTwo thousand ten current either my Kelly's elected to Congress and while I'm there and his net worth increase by millions and so it's no surprise he'll give special tax breaks to car dealers like himself\nThe congressman the specific group you cite for making that report the center for Responsive Politics says in fact his net worth has dropped dramatically during the time in office it hasn't risen\nWhat looked trips when we see our Republican colleagues voting for a tax package dubbed by the American people as a tax scam that was prioritizing corporations and the most wealthy in America over hardworking middle class families were going to call them out on the record\nHighs you're asking question but served that's his record I'm Talking about is not worth and that's a fact\nWhat looked to the point of your question I think that all committees and all of ... out there that are investigating\nCampaign ads across the country that they need to be respectful of tone but I Would agree with Steve that when we're looking at voting records that I think that that is fair game as well and that we need to make sure that we're all looking to see how we can make sure that we're having a better conversation with the American people on whether it's the last nine days of this cycle are going to next election as well\nAll right I got a little bit over a minute left and I want you to share it equally so you've got about thirty seconds you you've talked about the economy yes we have talked about healthcare immigration but to what degree is this election really about Donald Trump either pro war against a Congress in ... and you go first\nOh look Chris I think all across the country are candidates are not really talking about this president much\nThere is no one is going to talk more about Donald Trump and Donald Trump\nWhich gives our democratic candidates the opportunity to connect\nWith their personal stories and talked about an agenda that is built around for the people and how we're going to be able to help lower prescription drug prices lower health care costs move a strong infrastructure package and clean up Washington DC with all the corruption our candidates are doing well and it's because of our candidates the Democrats will win the majority in the U.S house of representatives\nOr German Stivers you have thirty seconds\nWell I think this election is about results versus dysfunction already talked about our economic success we have more to do on infrastructure lowering healthcare costs\nBut uh the dysfunction the other side would bring their healthcare agenda when kick a hundred and Seventy nine million people off their insurance and bankrupt Medicare on day one it's they have an agenda that's outside the mainstream they want to abolish ice they want to not per se caravan of people tell me\nAll right uh jak I knew we were going to

honestly because we have as women age they they have gotten this boost perhaps a protection ... compared to men of about ten years they get about a ten year grace they presented with high blood pressure and heart attacks on average about ten years later than men\nNow there are some exceptions to that because women who are are diabetic actually it eliminates all of that advantage but um for instance women's blood pressure tends to be lower than men up until about the age of ... around age fifty and then women's\nBlood pressure starts going up men stays high but it levels off\nSo it is a time in life that is both a change related to changes in hormones\nBut I think pointing out it's not an abrupt change an abrupt uptick but think about other things that happened to women around the er at age fifty fifty one which is the average age of medical us\nOff and they become empty nesters they have changes in jobs changes and physical activity they get a bum near plant or ... and they get less active there a lot of things that come around that time that can confound and worse and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease has a special time [laughter]\nAnd she's got a free and I just feel sorry [laughter]\nJust estrogen help protect the heart [noise]\nSo complicated question um we believe so\nUm the endogenous or the estrogen that is in our bodies in during the pre menopausal state we think that that is because they're estrogen receptors on every blood vessels in the body and it keeps women's blood vessels um elastic and healthier\nIt's more complicated though in terms of and I don't want any of the listeners to hear that yes oh that means I should add estrogen back\nTo protect my heart after menopause so the women's health initiative showed that at least an older women who are a few years past menopause adding estrogen back didn't help them didn't help their hearts\nIt may be and this is the the the question that continuing it at a low dose if you're gotta already healthy heart I'm early after menopause might be something but the general rule is we don't recommend adding estrogen back after menopause laws to protect the heart at this point\nSo let's talk about the distribute the risk factors are gonna do the same for for men and women under the same risk factors essentially for wrecked all dysfunction Alzheimer's disease interestingly but so diabetes obesity\nHigh blood pressure smoking smoking a sedentary lifestyle lack of a activity cholesterol\nGot cholesterol triglycerides and women so lip it's as a whole um it [noise] um the standard total cholesterol we've kind of moved away from and just saying well over two hundred you have quote high cholesterol because you can have other factors in your uh cholesterol that put you at higher risk\nUm particularly for women elevated triglycerides um which is another fat in the blood that is more influenced by dietary sugars 'em and carbohydrates as opposed to fats and genetics [noise]\nThe other is where you put on your fat\nSo disappointed [laughter]\nSo you can be normal weight but if you have a ... distribution that his mainly in your middle\nAnd your waistline as opposed and your hips and buys for women an for men that conveys an increased risk and so when you start gaining weight I'm even going from normal weight to higher weight which often happens as we get older I'm puts women it even higher risk\nHow important is activity uh especially posts medical and\nSo when people ask me what's the most important thing I can do to prevent heart disease if they're a smoker that's number one number two is physical activity and the reason I say that is this such\nUm deep and broad strong evidence that it makes an impact not only for cardiovascular disease but for Alzheimer's and for bones and for osteoporosis and for preventing falls and being strong so physical activity is great\nThe other part is it's never too late to start physical activity we actually have scientific studies that say that women who start out at walking program over the age of sixty five actually reduced their risk of heart disease from the nurses' health study so it's free\nIt's not sexy however and it's a hard habit to adopt if you hate exercise as some of my patients do\nYou feel like your patients are getting that message and are trying to become more active in mid life\nSo I think women are so busy and one of the things so that the answer is yes but okay but I think getting back to why I'm women don't take time to take care of themselves\nWomen are raised in a culture rated to be caregivers their moms they are you know they're the group's leaders there often even if they're in the workforce there the moms at work\nAnd and so often when we ask women even who've had a heart attack why don't you make this change or eat healthier exercise\nI don't have time 'cause I'm driving my kids um my husband wouldn't eat that healthy food so I'm just going to make it\nAnd so flipping it so that they know that if they can do those things they will accomplish those other goals I eat caregiving and making an altruistic thing which can be very helpful and that's been my biggest success in helping people frame it when I don't have time 'cause none of us have enough time to do this thing's its priorities and\nWe've talked about uh the the major risk factors and how important it is to keep all of those under control and exercise is extremely important let me ask you about a couple of other things with regard to heart disease prevention of there's been some recent controversy a baby aspirin a day\nWhat's your feeling about that in women who don't have a history of heart disease\nSo that's an important distinction to make because nothing has changed in terms of our recommendations if he's having a heart attack a stent or have a have had cardiovascular disease you should be on a baby aspirin unless your doctor tells you otherwise\nFor individuals male and female particularly older individuals who are otherwise healthy don't have diabetes don't have other things\nThe risk of taking aspirin and people don't think about that they just because it's non prescription or actually grader or outweigh or at least are equal to any benefit that one has\nAnd people don't think about that they just because it's non prescription or actually grader or outweigh or at least are equal to any benefit that one has pretty much stomach bleeding mainly on domestic and other types of bleeding because it it irritates the stomach but I'll tell you can get wading into your brain and women and everything we do\nAnd every medication and every intervention and cardiology women bleed more so if it's a risk for men it's a bigger risk for women\nOr it to show\nUp fish oil is very popular I'm a five or six years ago until we started actually having data from randomized clinical trials\nSo I I asked if I have somebody come into my office in their own fish will ask why you're taking them 'cause there are other reasons and heart disease you might take fish oil\nBut I tell him to stop it yet because it's really not been shown to have any primary prevention benefits are really even secondary prevent what if they don't like fish and they think I don't like fish so I'll just take visual tablets so probably doesn't help that recommendations is he finished a couple of times a week\nAnd eighty percent of those who do develop them are a symptomatic we sometimes find them unexpectedly when looking for other things but we just leave them alone and they do find\nSomewhere around twenty percent of patients will develop pain we called ... colic and this is a\nVery typical pain that comes on fairly abruptly over five to Fifteen minutes sticks around for a prolonged dinner of all of a half hour to several hours before resolving somewhat gradually so\nAbility or a colleague however can Enrique or if it's developed one so that's when we start to entertain intervention\nA small portion of patients who've had bill Eric colic will go on to develop more serious complications of ... where it's a pain for this the gall bladders very inflamed and removing it is I'm less selective in March and\nSo I Want to ask you about the risk factors for developing a gallstones when I was in medical school it was a female that forty and fertile now I don't know whether you can still say that maybe they've changed the words but is that still true\nThat still true women developed gallstones twice as often as men because of their Emilio estrogen and pro Justin's in the bloodstream\nWe know that a certain ethnic groups developed a gallstones much more often American Indians Native Americans are the probably the highest prevalence of gallstones Hispanic populations fairly high Caucasians below that and and African Americans are less than that even\nSo I'm uh ethnicity is important family history is very important probably a\nTwofold are threefold increase in in likelihood of farming stones\nAre overweight states especially with the BMI over thirty the risk of gallstones is quite a bit higher\nUm and multiple others that are gradually less important fertility though the fertile parts are having a pregnancy is a a high risk factor for developing stones or gall bladder sludge a precursor to stones\nA slide you often resolves after a pregnancy and stones tend to stick around so if someone's had multiple pregnancies their likelihood of stones as much higher\nIs is mostly diagnose because there's pain presence is that what bring patients in\nSome most gallstones probably go undiagnosed um but the ... of\nPatients have a variety of symptoms that may or may not be related to stones and then they usually fairly easily diagnosed by ultrasound so identification of stone's is generally straightforward except a small proportion of a tiny tiny stones\nUm but then the attribution of symptoms to the stones is sometimes a much more difficult issue\nI can tell you that there are outliers than I Am one of them in the mail that forty and fertile and none of them and I had my gallbladder out and that's the pain is extreme\nOr in fact I was in the emergency room three times with the same similar pain and since I don't fit the bill for having a goal bladder diseases took them a while to figure that out\nBut the good thing is you can take it out to the laparoscopic that's relatively simple straightforward surgery or in what overnight and I'm really I didn't have to change my diet at all so that the surgery is absolutely remarkable are there other treatment options decide surgery\n[noise] [laughter] well other options have been developed over many many years but with the advent of laparoscopic approaches to surgery or many of the other options became less realistic less cost effective a lesson there\nPrescribe approaches to surgery or many of the other options became less realistic less cost effective less they're less effective uh themselves so\nClosest to me is really the only realistic option for the patient who can undergo surgery is a surgical candidate\nAll right Dr ... and ... just talking about gall bladder

moving down the field nicely here and right now poised to put some more points on the board\nLet me ask you about this game today or to to better teams are either wanted us to go down to the Superbowl at the end of the year I'm from ... just listening to it on our TV monitor at the newsroom and what I've seen in Twitter from a couple of people mentioning\nIt sounds like Green Bay and I think the string and said ah go ... go is a ... a change you can hear throughout the crowd I'd seen at least one person speculate that it's near three quarters filled with Packer fans out there in Los Angeles\nWhat more can the rams to\nTheir undefeated they're playing the best football and the national football league and they can't fill more than a quarter of their house that the opposition and it is it like you're playing another California team you can't get on a plane and come in from Green Bay and I'm sure there's some Packer fans in the LA area but\nHow does a home team with an undefeated record not be able to control the crowd in their own out\nWell that's just a I think it's just been a long time since football's been there and oh boy that was there and Donald I think it was bought a sack\nBlindsided on Aaron Rodgers as he went down and went down hard uh but he gets up okay but it's it's ... look it's been a long time um you know the coliseum is outdated\nOr and you know I don't know what kind of drive it is on a Sunday from parts of LA I mean obviously traffic in LA is always a factor but you know maybe that that's part of it seems like a beautiful day to be at a football game will tell you that\nSo since Packer fans are taking in airplane into town wherever they are staying they can deal with the traveling from narrowed down to get to the stadium but actual loss Angelenos don't want to have to deal with the traffic to get back and forth\nFrom well when you're making the truck what's another couple of miles\nOr our ways in your life feeling in bumper to bumper traffic\nExactly so but you know I I don't have the answer for you unfortunate as you look both LA teams are playing well er and again you know the look to where's the ... center is what twenty eight to thirty thousand for the chargers right now the uh the coliseum is you know what eighty Ninety thousand\nMight even more but you give your more chance to something comes in Iran's aren't selling knows either now they're selling them but there is on the Green Bay Packer fan so uh and or anybody else who comes in and the chargers from what I understand are even worse\nThat the opposition even know there aren't a ton of tickets\nThey come in and completely take over the chargers are certainly out of the two teams in LA and I don't know that there is a number one team but the second team is certainly the chargers that a as a a a town they have an adopted the chargers as a football team just yet did we need two teams\nIn LA no not even close I I didn't think so but you know obviously it has the\nNation's number two ... media markets but you and I've been doing a the sports talk thing forever\nFrom the day the L. A. or the rams moved to St Louis I said well what they'll just do is use LA as a threat for relocation for the next year two years five years that I didn't know it was going to turn into decades of not having a team in LA but that was always the threat\nTo get the new stadiums built to get the municipalities to stay to wherever else\nTo kicking money to help them build the to defray the cost and they're like oh yeah if you're not gonna give us a tax break if you're not going to give up its\nProperty rights and we're not going to do this that and I think well will relocate the team we've got this major market out there in Los Angeles that is dying from football team if you're not going to help us with the building of the new stadium and we'll just take it out to LA\nWell they finally got called on the carpet San Diego said All right you want to go to LA guess quite go that\n[laughter] and they let him walk out the door to St Louis they didn't reverse thing I Do in the ... the the ... not good enough anymore I go back to LA\nAnd yes they got called on the carpet for years all the individual teams that at least used LA is a thread where able to get a good enough sweetheart deal to get their new stadiums built in stay right where they are at some point they were going to have to put a team back in LA you knew was coming\nOr the problem for the NFL is they got caught with two teams trying to pull a bluff at the same time and both at the end up in the town at the same time at a ally is big enough that it shouldn't be a problem but judging by the fact that out of town fans but last stadiums\nAre you or someone you love one of the nearly one million Americans living with Parkinson's disease there is no known killer\nThat you have the power to help the teams that played dissipating in a clinical trial the Michael J.

certainly be a part of the ... scenario some work out a lot possibly er at the same strip went and that and then\nThey said look just ... next week they play at home against Iran's then they go to

twenty nine that's quite\nAll right so again as second nine they still need to get a first down to\nClinch it but at the very least the Packers could get the ball back with about forty five seconds\nLeft me very interesting to see how these next two planes go act you know the rams are gonna run the football here they do get no yard a just a matter of fact lose a couple of yards on the plane so they're going to be looking at third and long\nAnd gang clock is going to take it down close to a minute there will be time left on the clock they cannot run out the clock here on third down third in the lab and\nYou're going to throw the football you're going to take a chance to know and try and win the game I wouldn't I wouldn't either you gotta more importantly is to take another forty seconds off the clock you believe their line kicks the field goal now Rogers has to go the linked to the field with no time out in under thirty seconds and scored a touchdown not get them into field goal range\nMe thinks they're going to run the football here and started down as well\nI mean you have the best back in the league and Todd girly\nAnd right now they take it down to one second left on the play clock and uh I don't know if there was a penalty or I don't think it was a live game because oh ramps call a timeout right there so\nI'm so right now the rams with a twenty nine twenty seven lead right here and after they have the ball on the Green Bay Twenty one so or they could just go ahead and take a field goal here if they want and\nNo not no you you gonna run up there you don't want to play here and try and take the forty second class but which went down to twenty five now that was their last time out\n... so they can't do the running down and take the time out just before the shot clock or the shot clock the clock and gained ... um\nThey have to have their specialty team ready to run after onto the field and make sure they are in line in time to get the feel go attempt up

the team in NFL history than Tom Brady ... against the bills as he continues to pile up numbers after numbers and wins after wins I mean you just marvel at at\nThe quarterback play in his forties now doing what he does\nAnd also the fact that you know proving that\nLook for as good as the chiefs of been that you know that went on Sunday night\nNow nobody ... gene or building a brand new leaves the

least you get the or at least the page [laughter]\nYeah well I mean if you know if it's just that that I'm On the I don't think the patriots really want anything to do with their SAT outside ... so that's you know\nThe the patriots are definitely have some competition this year but yeah it's amazing what Tom Brady not only the fact that he's forty one years old and really is showing signs of slowing down\nA mountain got joined Edelman back now that they have Josh borders in the fall a growing housekeeper when he he's a healthy came why is it really looks a lot better now um\nBut it's like every week to the game does come out friday\nOr established a new record or or uh some amazing career milestones\nFive hundred touchdowns are the most wins of all time or you know it's like every week you saying and you're right I fell record so uh it's just amazing to me that Brady is just get didn't get it done after all these years everyone kind of roll their eyes were sitting here for a forty five foot like I'm I'm getting the point where I'm not going to a\n... you know if you said that I also believe it at this point because he certainly has proved every one wrong up until this point\nRight let me take you back a couple of weeks or they lost the game in Jacksonville uh at the time people say well I'm a giants are ah my ... year any AMC championship game in Jacksonville we shouldn't be shocked by this we probably pretty shocked when he lost the lions the next week\nIn Detroit by more than to touch down to some people wandering wow has the end of the Patriot dynasty come\nAnd they report for shrink Wednesday raptor and look dominant to know one of those games was there a turning point did somebody get up and turn over a table and get nuts in that locker room what may be all all of a sudden ... patriots\nBack to the independent uh indispensable a patriots\nOr I don't want to say that didn't happen because you never quite that was the patriots that's pretty good at keeping the house but I'm pretty sure\nThat wasn't it the patriots definitely know not to get too upset over how this place hamper or they set for years\nThat the temperature is really an extension of the free season for them they're figuring out the roster and their personality how teams are attacking them and how they can respond and not have enjoyed element those first four games are really affected Tom Brady that just guy that the security blanket ... work in the middle of the field\nOr a crack house he received the whole team games white or was having difficulty but even he used to seeing double team so having Edelman come back and be able to have Josh Orton fall on their last as well I mean you know sir on bringing the third talent he looks a lot better now so that's that's a tricky\nWas terrible no doubt that that was a terrible night for them I I don't think it's been a dramatic improvement they put up a lot of points they one case but\nYou know having all of them to choose the teacher was there one big tested they certainly emerged but boy what did they win that the ... the a and the cheese are still kind of running up and down the field on that by the self or otherwise you know the heating up on Miami in Indianapolis\nEven last week the pears I don't know how great of a quality without was for them\nBut so the pictures definitely saw some issues especially on the defensive side of the fall but they've got an authentic it brought up a lot of forty so it looks like every game's going to be issued offer them a lot of often said not too much to\nDo with ... the Boston Globe recovers New England patriots as they're getting ready to take on the bills and the Monday Night game tomorrow night or the trade deadline is this week in years past the rarely saw
