twenty five seconds to go at\nThe rams take the time out come back out and run girlie off tackle a nice block by his uh left tackle springs him on the edge he's into the secondary he probably could have walked in to the end zone\nBut he wisely just slowed down and allowed the defense they catch him\nHe was even close to the sidelines any smartly to show their back into the defender and push

Sox\nParents with a huge home run last night another one tonight takes courage shot at Dodger Stadium before the sun goes down so early to nothing lead for the red Sox and the top of the second inning should be very interesting to see how this plays out tonight or the one of the baseball story\nI wanted to pass along um Darwin and put this into one of his updates and when he said it I said wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what did you say it's the checkout CBS Sports dot com or and a CBS Sports dot com put up a story\nOn a Michael Kay\nYes quote Mike okay the voice of Yankees on their television network the YES Network um does a a show as well they're center stage I think they call it where it gets important sports guests on and uh like\nUh anyhow Scott Boris on apparently this week and in interviewing Scott borrows Scott borrow said that uh where is where I was asked where's Bryce Harper going to land whoa which way do you think your client is going when he gets free agency which all by the way is until\nA week to ten days after the world series I forget it for was weaker Twenty one or the other but no one is officially a free agent until after the world series ends I'm\nHere was Mr Barr says reply to Michael Kay's question about where is Harper I'm going to sign this off season a ... ... according to bars he says well we know who the\nTeam is it's already completed in done but prices Bryce has told me he wanted to tell you personally\nSo it's pretty damn apparent that he just jerking around here that he just won and with Michael Kay he's been putting them he's like yeah I'm going to tell you first things first\nHe can have a deal in place with any team other than the Washington Nationals if it was found out that he did\nBoats are Bryce Harper and Scott bars and specifically team of scientists him would be looking at a massive suspension slash fine slash punishment for major league baseball 'cause he's just not breaking the rules of baseball\nYou can't legally talk to any player yet who's scheduled to be a free agent they're not pray there still under contract to their former team in this case it would be the watching the national\nHe can still talk to the national right now the only team he can sign what is the nationals 'cause he is still at this moment the properties are if we have a problem with that word um what do you use the property of the Washington Nationals he can't find with any other team so now when he does\nSign with another team every sign from the other team which I think you will um somebody's going to ask the question well what about what you said on the Mike okay show that you already had a deal in place let's say you signed a three hundred million dollar deal with\nThe Yankees picker team any team whatever team that we got a Yankee fan and ... says he wants no part offered\nThat part um the Dodgers the red Sox any team whatever team other than the national\nOh there'll be a call from the commissioner's office going and when exactly then you have this deal in place because we heard to Scott borrows operas agent then you add this deal at a time of the world series ever ended as a matter of\nFact I think it was all just in fun I think that this was done just to pay some people\nUm so uh we shall see but CBS bought into this or decided to try and make a story out of it I didn't and that's when I saw it I said what are you talking about this can't be the case doesn't make any sense well uh I don't think it does I think it's just a a a\nScott Boris tempting to have some fun at the expense of Michael Kay end or anyone else who was silly enough for foolish enough\nTo take this story seriously or so I don't take Bryce Harper is going\nOkay and nor anyone else who was certainly an opera foolish enough to take this story seriously\nOr so I don't think Bryce Harper is going anywhere anytime soon I Will find out one free agency starts and the reason why it's it's so fantastical is borrows is the biggest negotiator on the face of the planet\nHe almost never resigned with the team's feet wet\nHe will take his player to free agency purely to get leverage and create a bidding war as best he can to get the best possible deal for his client which he showed that the job and he's very good at it\nAnd nine times out of ten Ninety nine times out of twenty he gets his guy the best deal possible and oftentimes deals that were reset markets and above and beyond what most people expect\nEvery once in a while he pushes the envelope a little bit too far in his plane ends up on the short end of the ... not often why we're in Ninety six Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of the time he does the best deal possible or as a client and he'll do the best deal possible for rap a Mr Harper mark my words\nSaints go right down to field a play eighty one yard drive stick in the end zone they grabbed nearly seven nothing lead against Minnesota David Price was able to get out of the bottom of the first inning would know for the damage after the David ... home runs so I'd to one\nSocks over the Dodgers if we moved to the second seven inning second inning excuse me and the saints early seven up and lead over the right things in Sunday Night Football what is it you want to talk about hit me up on the telephone lines\nOr first call I got to give them process called yesterday said he would call back again today he's here\nHe's Jose from Philly what ...\nWhy joy locked\nUp for months while it up there you go up shop huh\nOh are you doing a walk up Schwartz be with you and your guests to walk up what up\nSo you so you just ran my guy wall right off the field\nWho got\nIt missed the wall pushing a button somehow you got the though involve do is doing the updates landslide is nowhere near the joint tonight\nOr up with the wall\nLego wall W A L like John Wall point guard or the other day ... bought up John walls\n... okay let's move on uh what else you got for me than I Do say\nOther than that I'm not get to the ... [laughter] yeah that'd be nice\n[laughter] yeah I Know it will be fine um I said well no one believes stadium today you\nGotta know watch some football at nine thirty in the morning\nYes I did good are you\n... took care business in London for a June\nOsama bloopers and there were some moments ... hearts and went through a pass bounced\nOff somebody completed its own self and got a first town out of\nThat is right to say that it always nice for the fantasy football player out there who gets the completed pass and catching you ought to get in one fell swoop\nYeah no I think therefore for laying Johnson came away with the spring spring that's not good so um they've got to buy their recover but because they got to um see how lame is coming out of their body\nAnd they could have used a a Redskin loss today the giants actually hung in against the scans but the skins beat him so the eagles still alive ground to make up and the debate\nSo yeah um they got to take care of business the rest of the way here they have no room for error from this season for\nNow correct I've got five divisional games laugh they have to win a minimum of four and they're probably gonna have to sweep the Redskins if they sweep the Redskins and I got to tie breaker against them they could finish in a tight with the red skins they got to win both games against Washington then I got one more against the giants to against our they gotta win at least two out of those three\nYou got to take care of business and stuff that by we um second um once again\nThe raiders or your raiders stink I put them in my six pack this week I've thought about colds who are overrated now John grew is overrated\nAnd the sentiment in Oakland is the same and you said a he's becoming becoming overweight it you know\nThey they can't get into Vegas fast enough ...\nYeah I yeah I Know that and not only that we pay the niners CJ\nThey can't get into Vegas fast enough Jose\nYeah uh-huh yeah I Know that and not only that we pay the niners CJ that for in Santa Clara or the battle of the bay area\nOh God rattled rats that that's almost as bad as nine years in the cardinals today\nYes I Know I Know this\nThis has been a disaster yes a bird I'm\nA looks like they Robert searchers\nStuck with the pitcher before putting into relief picture they were out themselves types jurors no instead he\nDecides he decides to\nPlay

doesn't even have to show off from work to get a shout out anymore\nGeorge for malaise up on CBS Sports radio hello George\nJody Mack how you doing buddy good do you\nUm get a lesson that was very unsettled ... played by taught girlie I was very impressed with that the most guys went around and they wouldn't you know what I mean and I I I was impressive and or the rams their defense they got to clean up their secondary there there are a secondary defenders but uh besides that all kinds of still very good\nIs probably the Green Bay ten points they still aren't going to a game and and we've got a tough when uh\nI think these rams team's pretty special dirty\nAs to why I'm and yes there\nDefensive secondary is a missing a key to lead who was a big acquisition warm during the off season in without um they're just not as good Aaron\nRodgers puts up yards against everybody so a given up a bunch of yard staring Rogers is not like giving up a bunch of yards to a rookie quarterback um but they're they're secondary could be better or if they had to leave I Will agree with you there\n[noise] yeah and um besides that I'm Still impressive make bay is typically the fence and the special teams happens airline back as a great relief because he's a very good kicker and uh I think that game next week or I mean things are going to be a very impressive game\nYeah we're getting all the best teams in the NFC playing each other this year during the regular season which is nice we can get a good grasp on who actually is the best team before we even get to the post season\n[noise] yeah and I think it's crucial for the rams to try to hang on all built advantage there and the coliseum my secret like all those Green Bay fans there but hey if they fill up the cause in okay you know thanks Jody\nYou've got appreciate called George thanks for checking at Thomas from Oklahoma city's up on CBS Sports radio oh anytime is\nWarhol ... very good new south\nI'm I'm I'm dead nice higher up I Want to touch awesome NBA is that okay please do so\nI'm\nOK\nCleveland is two years removed from winning a championship and they fire their head coach he after all when they start please tell me that everybody across the world agrees with me when they say that Billy Donovan as the Oklahoma City had ... should be gone\nDown the here's the difference between the two um and I hear what you're saying the under oh and for I think the cat is in the thunder the only two teams yes the only two teams in the NBA I haven't won a game yet the cabs Owens six\nAnd that's part of the reason why they fired Tyrone mood\nToday I'm One of the big right let me let me finish my point and you couldn't respond or take another direction the resistance Tyrone who was hired as the head coach was basically because Brian James dictated he like blue\nOr they wanted to keep all Bryan happy they hired by the European guy a before and LeBron decided to sign on with them he stayed for a season or brown said yet it doesn't really work for\nMe so they bring in his hand picked choice of Tyrone new well LeBron ups and leaves so the mandate from little brown is no longer in place and it blew isn't doing what they think he should be doing then they just going to bomb out that's exactly what happened at all in six now\nKind of tells ya that LeBron was that team it almost makes you want to go back and re vote for MBP last year because you see how bad Cleveland would have been if they didn't Abdullah Brian games\nBut I'm not shocked by that Billy Donovan was hired by the people that were still in charge in Oklahoma City it was in like someone else who was hired Billy Donovan has no longer there\nSo the new people in charge can say well we want our choice if you're not doing a job but he's losing we can move on from um no they hired this guy they put their stamp on the bottom line is guy they believed in this guy so that's why the ... you're not hearing any rumblings about Billy Donovan job being in jeopardy\n... well I'm not one of them people that believe in\nAll the ... I Believe that this man should have been gone after the playoffs last year and I also believe that under should do everything they can in order to get more action as a head coach that's just me being a Homer but I think Billy Donovan is possibly going to\nNinety six us ... eight hundred by one nine Seventy seven Ninety six\nIf you are behind on your bills than this messages for you how\nWould you like to have a large portion of your credit card debt or medical bills forgiven\nNational credit card relief would like to give you free\nInformation on a proven debt forgiveness program it's not bankruptcy it's not consolidation this special program actually wife's clean the portion of your debt that is forgiven Gulf or your\nFree forgiveness information now eight hundred to like one six six seven oh that's eight hundred to knowing one six six seven oh don't wait call eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh not available in North Dakota\nCBS Sports radio we saw in northeast Nebraska ... am Seventy eighty one oh five ...

year but a off doing okay start\nAt three and two so far are so well\nSince we don't seem capable a bunch more up I Will do a lot of the regular telephone numbers\nAnd allow you to check and if you want to go and be a you can if you want to go in a different direction we can do that too I'm meaning get back over to the national football league and we ate in the NFL or the world series with the red Sox up to the one I'm you know that I've been on this Red Sox bandwagon\nBoth for the year started\nI picked the old Theo Epstein World Series\nOr the team that he's currently the President Jimmy ... that would be Chicago Cubs and of course the team did he was previously a the man in charge of that was the Boston Red Sox so I picked the red Sox and the cubs were for the year started\nI got the red Sox home they did win a hundred and eight games in the regular season and the cubs I'm not going to say the cubs was an embarrassing pick because when you finish the one hundred and sixty do regular season a hundred and sixty two game regular season with the most wins in your leak\nTied for the most wins that was with Milwaukee yes they lost the tide breaking one hundred and sixty third a game but they did a threat is tied they've costs lost that game so they had to play in the wild card game and we know that they lost the wild card game the Colorado so yeah they weren't really\nAnd solidarity with others\nSuspect Robert Bowers is believed to her spewed anti Semitic slurs before killing a loving people there'll be important tomorrow also in court phase are say the man accused of killing more than a dozen bombs are prominent Democrat\nFamily members are describing him as trouble for many coworker say they were simply flat out crazy these arrogant on Fox News Sunday\nThis is

calm tomorrow eyes around Seventy one mainly cloud tomorrow night forty four year old just airtight for news talk W. J. A. G. A.

[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSunday night get together you're on CBS Sports radio journey Matt Geiger would ya uh we'll still try and brunch up our buddy\n... more from the action network to talk some NBA whether that's where I didn't want to come back nickel difficulties we're we're trying to get a hammered out as smoothly and as quickly as possible uh the NFL stop a Vikings and\nA change in a good Sunday night showdown between two of the best teams in the NFC and of course the world series a Red Sox and Dodgers David Price or into the uh do the first three innings a very interesting decision to get David Price or as the started tonight\nI mentioned this earlier I it was funny I didn't get to see it live because I was a\nCommuting all uh so I watch it after I watch the replay of the game and then the post game stuff\nAnd Alex ... the manager of the red Sox\nAre answered all the post game questioned about the decision to be made in the game and\nThe ... finally waking up in the last ... to put up a nine spot and everything else and then as he just about to get off a from the podium he says oh yeah by the way dead prices starting tomorrow\nEverybody in his brother daughter was going to be Chris Sale because these threats that they said he was on regular rest and look primed and ready to start tonight's game five\nAnd for some reason the manager decided to go with David Price and he sat back down in the explained his line of thinking which I'll be honest with you I still wouldn't quite understand why\nAs of right now David Price who's got the red socks on top two to one he was able to ah negotiate after a lead off home run by day reprise the Dodger line up since ah so again I haven't always understood the moved by either were the two managers on his side\nI'm I'm been confused by both of the managers and are trying to figure out exactly what they're trying to do but\nUh it's working ... because he is I had three games to one at this stage uh and they were ... says that the other night job of handling the Dodger line up so far tonight to one Red Sox there in the top of the fourth early today and the national football league gadgets I was up early so yes\nI was watching football at nine thirty am from London or the eagles beat the jaguars twenty four Eighteen\nIt wasn't they highlight game for either of the two teams are unless you're talking about the eagles ability you got to be quarterback and I did learn a lot in the first day I actually kind of felt bad for like ...\nBut he was getting pummeled as much as he was an eagle up into line is defensive line is actually kind of beat up and decided to Fletcher Cox not being manned by pro bowl level by players but they dialed up a couple of villages in and bought off just crushed\nEarly on beagles were able to sustain a couple of\nTouchdown drivers both do their red tide in court touchdowns today's experts in Dallas Goddard a big screen passed out back real from window small would uh accounting for the three eagle touchdowns eagles stay in the mix\nOr after disappointing loss of the previous two weeks they were able to get the wind up they had to it was an eagle home crowd day in the eye and again you just judging by the volume on television it's not always easy to do a when we stadium huge stadium a lot like the coliseum out there in LA\nAt the jaguars our\nSense I don't want to say banished but it's kind of what it is a but they own it and they got to deserve it because they don't show up their own games in Jacksonville they are chosen for a London games more often than any other team\nSo because they've done it several times already and their fans have gotten used to it you would think the Jacksonville would have a slight home field advantage oh no no no it was an eagle crowd\nOr the Philadelphia faithful went over in droves to uh Europe and uh now I don't know it was quite\nA Lincoln financial field like but it was certainly an advantage for the eagles as far as crowd noise goes and I got an important when over the jaguars today to stay in the mix\nThe NFC East is the NFC least\nAh the Redskins are on top but I don't think the Redskins are real good book club the cowboys is doing the ... they're on their by week this week\nOr so they'll sit at three in for the eagles get back to apply Bernard at war and for all your defending Super Bowl champions but you wouldn't say they're in the midst of having a great season the optimistic ... fans are going to say yeah we'll get together once we get into the playoffs once you get into the ... anything can happen\nWell which is of course in ah the exact opposite direction of what are your parents or last year when at home field advantage to out\nIt happened well which is of course in ah the exact opposite direction of what are you going to last year when at home field advantage to out oh we're going to win and go to the super bowl because we don't feel advantage and then they made a battlefield advantage stand up beating the falcons and the Vikings and ending up in the bowl against the patriots\nAre so eagles got it when they had to have\nThe campus got a little bit of an eye opening when\nUh putting up thirty six points against a rabid defense which I thought was one of the better defenses in the national what bullied certainly top ten or some people might have argued top five didn't look like today came do not a good day both throwing the ball and running the ball so Carolina stays just off\nNew Orleans is flying in the NFC South\nAnd the ravens last means the Steelers\nAnd I believe this even when they were struggling early on a or the team to beat in that division I believed it all along the bangles got a a needed when\nUh they almost bullied against Tampa today but they did hang in understanding say yes the Bengals are still a factor my eyes tell me they're not still is deemed to be James Caan it at a big day on the ground\nI don't know what to LA beyond bell is thinking\nI thought for sure maybe I'm bell was going to come back prior to them by week so he could get a nice big bad eight hundred thousand dollar and change paycheck for not actually practicing during the week\nIs he going to sit the entire year\nI Know he's got to come in with at least six weeks to go for it to be counted as a full NFL season service wise if he wants to be an unfettered free agent next year maybe he thinks the Steelers won't franchise tag 'em again next year\nThat it doesn't matter whether he plays or not if he's willing to sacrifice entire his entire year's salary but they're just going to cut them at the end of the year\nWhy would they why wouldn't you just throw a franchise tag on a guy and go oh yeah we're still continue to try and trade ya we tried this year nobody come close to matching the price that we asked we didn't do it again next year so I have no idea how this\nWhole lay beyond bell thing is going to play out but it hasn't stopped the Steelers from jumping the top of that division they beat up on the browns um that the brands of course tied them you remember back the week one of the season when these two teams play to a tie a I got some great so some brown fans and I like the browns\nSaid and uh some glowing things about the brands each year but we've got a good a Cleveland affiliates we've got a bunch of listeners and tweeters and the like who check in and if they don't think I think the Brown's praises enough they get on my case big time\nAll the Cleveland is what they are they're they weren't improving team their team that's still figuring it out\nJohnny Mack what's happening today how I buy\nAre doing really well you know back then I heard Jose earlier talking about how this Thursday night prime time as my diners versus just writers\nFor more\nThan ... debate needs to shield it ties from that one\nIt gets even worse back in November the twelve Monday Night football spiders to get the New York football giants\nFor all of all\nThat that's bad too that I don't know where to nose to match jobs is less appealing\nUp those games one of those games are going to be one of your picks back and I met ...\nAnd that's something that the prime time that's a that's a primetime game\nThe wait waiters the raiders and the forty niners are are a Monday Night next week\nNo the giants are for the giant November the twelve is the giants versus the forty niners on Monday Night\nOkay prime time makes it worse so you're saying we went to these wars yeah giants nine a giants against the forty niners is probably worse than you could you can bury that other one at four o'clock east coast time and yeah everybody will find something else to do\nA you know what man I cannot wait I I don't know what they're like Jerry Mars is going to be out what you Saturday before that game but I'm interested to what his comments will be as far as the ... historical perspective of the niners and the forty niners not up to nine or ...\nOr excuse you know the forty niners and the giants not to get this year but historical bottles\nTrue that's very true Montana against parts cells they are there some a championship games played between those two teams you're right there is a good history between those two teams just not good present day competition between those two spots\nIt was played between those two teams you're right there is a good history between those two teams just not good present day competition between those students go watch\nYour back and and you know what a quick the world series I think the two young pitchers shuttled out they gave up a couple of home runs but I think they're going to get through and it's two to one socks right yeah\nGood game boat a curse sure you're right ... and a price got touched up early but both of settled into a groom as we move to the top of the fed up with the red Sox up two to one side\nWe've got a couple of minutes here to walk NBA basketball I always enjoyed doing it wouldn't matter more he's doing it these days for the action network and he ... with us here on CBS Sports radio how are you know\nMatt ... man how are you\nGood preaching your coming on board uh I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions you probably weren't expecting a just cause they generated by coal is earlier in my show today\nDoes Billy Donovan job deserves to be under the microscope in Oklahoma City we saw an NBA to go get fired today and I explained that one as well to branch out around to say ... who should be the go to the game anymore and that's why it's not\nA ... home of Sunni under also up to a slow start the only do we lose teams in the NBA\nHow would you evaluate the job Billy Donovan has done as they head coach of the ...\n[noise] yeah that was really good data and sixteen he was really up and down and then he he I thought he had a great job during that run in the playoffs when they got to western conference finals and almost knocked off the warriors [noise] um I think since then they've been trying to cobble pieces together\nA I think last year he had the right idea and things went along but if I wait on him where his whole approach going at camp was\nYou know look at great defense and we can work on the often later ah except that you know it was just on a lot of weird things happen to start that year and start to come together and then Robert and went down and this year I think we're seeing the same thing which is you know okay see without Roberson isn't the same defensive team and so all of the time that he spends on the event\nWinds up being wasted because they don't have the personnel\nAre taught us another one was wild ... and so the defense is bad and the all that bad um I think part of it is your ... I think if you have a hard time coach in ... so it's it's hard to evaluate them because the thunder will be better if Westbrook at this point I I was fine with what he did in sixteen and Seventeen or when he went after\nThe MVP but this year as one last year and this year ones where he needs to focus more on being a guy that makes it seem better and he has done that and I don't know there's a guy and there's got to cook coast that would be able to get through the Westbrook like\nThat that's exactly what I told my caller I said have you I really don't know where that's one thing he suggested mark Jackson would somehow be able to come in and real world to see and I say I don't know that there is a coach out there that can go to Russell Westbrook\nYeah yeah and like with Jackson you're going to run into a lot of like just ice oh plays and real simple stuff and so like I Do Casey's problem is I've been playing are you bringing more jak new guys don't play our because he gets you guys to play the great motivator\nUm the thunder play hard they just don't play as smart as they need to um I think that there's good things about events I think I can tell Robert and get back on it gives them time to get there and make it you know if it spiraled out of control his job could be in jeopardy but\nA lot of it when we talk about because the NBA where everybody misses his look I'm five you want to talk about foreign couch but you better be able to tell me who you're going to get this going to be better than that guy and the only time I had a lot of success\nIn college he took a team to the western conference final ... teams have made the playoffs every year you got to be able to tell me you're going to get a guy that you know it was better than Donovan I think the harder than people realize\nThat I tend to agree there are we talking to 'em or body from\nThe actual news network a map more talking MBA with us here on CBS\nI back to the guy who was fired and you don't usually see coach fired six games into an NBA season\nWhen I got to admit I'm not surprised Tyrone Lewis given his walking papers because as I explained earlier to the caller\nLeBron kinda dictated is hiring LeBron's no longer there and being a general manager and not seeing eye to eye and euro in six yeah things like to go get fired six games into the season happen unfair to Tyrone Lou or completely understandable\nDecisions ridiculous um you know there's there's reports about\nWell he wasn't planning young guys okay so why did you why did you sign Kevin Love to an extension why'd you keep JR Smith interest hoping this summer why didn't you end up to fire sale and get young assets and then that's one of the team was losing too badly okay fair enough but if that's the case\nYou know if it if that's where you're at why not do this you know several months ago\nI mean you can't predict the team was going to struggle I thought they'd be better than they have been\nBut this isn't completely unexpected given their schedule them and what they have left um I don't mind the firing or will but they're going to do this they shut down at the summer you know he wasn't the guy you're starting over let him go\nYou know come back with you know trade trade everybody that was left over I'm veteran contracts trade day our interest in ill and laws get yourself as many assets possible bring any young coach\nA young up and coming assistant to bring some energy and supplies and you've got like a really great rebuilt going on but now that the cats the cats have to go out and say we're going to try and split the middle we still want to be competitive we don't want to try and be a relevant\nUm and then when he gets here now the firemen you\nKnow now they're talking about ... and ... a longtime assistant has a lot of respect in this late but he's not been a great head coach and it just seemed like they keep wanting to never settle on what direction it and that goes above management that go straight to Dan Gilbert and this has been the case it was the case when LeBron left the first time before he came back\nThey had trouble constructing the right Ross when LeBron did come back like at some point that the problem is not hire on low the problem is not the roster the problem goes higher\nRaptors routed a gay sex you know a wide Leonard is playing very well\nIf you are the powers that be in Toronto\nDo you put a call into a Mr Leonard agent and go listen he should be love and what this says we're loving him we want to get married does he want the absolute max contract we can give 'em 'cause we'll sign him today or do you even want to open up a can of worms\nThey can't do it because of the how the money with Egyptian where it's going to wait till the summer to get the best the the only way that this makes sense for him to take the most money this time it's the only scenario financially that makes sense for one or he could do an extension but he can't do the kind of extension that were given the kind of money or security\nThat way until the summer go so they're just going to have to ride it out and that's what's have about this is you know yes now everything looks awesome everything's going terrific but he had to remember Bush this isn't about winning it was never about winning HIV quite Leonard\n... if winning was on there quite Leonard ... selling a San Antonio for the most successful franchises ever or this is about a lot more than that depending on who you ask it changes I think that at the end of the day a Leonard has gotten off to an absolutely phenomenal star like I'm In a deep dive I watch all their games today\nI'm doing a deep dive for a column and like there's just nothing Toronto isn't doing great right now like every single phase of the game the raptors are phenomenal at it at this point in time but we just don't know what it's going to look like at the end of the summer and if they get to their ear\nIt could mean that this is a place that he was meant to be in a changing his mind but he had he had reservations about going there and as a whole year\nDumber and if they get to their ear it could mean that this is a place that he was meant to be in a changing his mind but he had he had reservations about going there and as a whole year has any of that changing his mind to get him to commit and believing that this is the right place for him\nNo we didn't take ball George are going to stay in Oklahoma City so you can't discount the possibility that he stays in Toronto but you're right we got to get through the whole season first\nOr the New Orleans Republicans out to a good start at four in one everybody wants to talk about a potential Anthony Davis trade or the public can go to go there and will will they decide what to do with Davis based on the way they play this year what is de de future down on the value\n[noise] [noise] I have a sympathy for the falcons who continue to respond to all the trigger is by being like we're not the ones reporting that like we are not the one leaking this what you hear when you hear about trade rumors is ooh this will be interested in ... oh this team it's harder to Anthony Davis who this team would love\nTo do a deal is willing to part with whatever for anything Davis not want to hear from the falcons yeah the falcons would take ... now

seems to be the good intentions the I promise schools the things that he tries to do right in the community he does try to put on a good luck and try to do good public works you can't take that away from this isn't\nFrom the bitter standpoint of what it said he he really does try to make a difference in and that's commendable\nPublicly socially those things that's commendable thing there are times though when you watch him throughout his career and especially in the times he's in Cleveland\nWhere it gets very cantankerous very quickly he becomes better he becomes ... he becomes angry

I'm a chef right now I haven't seen it\nBoys you lazy pigs are you kidding me you ever seen this television yet I've never can I've never heard of it the only thing we have\nYou ever heard of making a murder you take in film you take in television do you never heard of this\nI it's not even one of those things where I heard all rice and can't or I'll give an update later because I I've only seen a few episodes of the season to I'm getting a theory going I haven't looked at any spoilers\nI got a theory that is going for season too and I think that somebody else in the death the family might have done it I think that the possibility with Stephen Avery I'll bring that up later on later on in the night we got to get going with we ... we got to go with all the Bronx stuff eight five five two and two for CBS to make the suit will join us we'll talk major league baseball in the world\nYou got to get going with we get we got to go with all the Bronx stuff eight five five two and two for CBS in my case the suit will join us we'll talk major league baseball in the world series coming up in twenty minutes gamut Canada he leads us off his first step on CBS Sports radio hello cam\nGood evening Ken how are you cam I'm doing a wonderful brother take her away\nRight on okay so I was just going to give my take from the north here on the Brian adult I loathed him like I loathed him\nIf he beyond description of how much I loathe them as a rafters found [laughter] ... yeah things\nWhen he spun the ball on the block out\nThat that I'm In the class and then when he did the backwards or the bat turn to Kelly on that to a real honest player and did the cross over there I to me that was just disrespect for the game so I don't like him but he is the greatest of all time I would not be fairer true to sport if I didn't say he is the greatest\nOf all time I mean this guy just stuff like magic he does stuff like Karl Malone he's unbelievable the only thing I wanted to say was that\nYou're giving them a lot of credit and you're right but let's remember I think he burned this thing to the ground in Cleveland in ... I Know you talked about guys don't want to play with him I heard Paul George wouldn't go there I heard from George\nBasically told the cabs don't bother and making them move for me 'cause I Will come and it hurt butler had had um intimated to that\nTo that level as well so I don't know if that's true I'm not an insider on that the only thing I wanted to say it I think look Ron intentionally burn this thing to the ground in Cleveland as he didn't want this thing to eat or whatsoever when he left I agreed to make a maniac maniac and and I think he burned to the ground intensely\nI ... I tell you I I think that they were doing a camp I Can't say your theories completely wrong and I thank you very much for the call my friend I think that they were doing everything they could do a piece in while he was in Cleveland and what that means is that you're robbing Peter to pay Paul the entire way through but\nSigning Kevin Love to a long term deal they're trying to win they thought that they were trying to win and now you're two weeks in the season and now you're going to send them an arrest them because of his foot and now you're already listed in the trade conversations good luck with all that\nIs the weather hasn't even truly change to winter yet you're talking about listening to trade conversations that's not on the brunt that's on the cabs that's on Dan Gilbert\n\nYou let go David Griffin has done a very good job a couple of ... here and there you go David Griffin who's done a very good job you're bringing Kobe Allman or that's still not on the brawn\nFor LeBron ... it was still do as the brunt says make sure the bronze half the do let him send all these messages it was very dramatic during his time in Cleveland\nVery dramatic and it's a lot of that is still on the Bronx\nWhen he goes to LA you see what it is now it looks absolutely justified it's a total dumpster fire and part of it might be true he doesn't like Dan Gilbert and it shows you that it's not all the way wrong but when you're bringing up Paul George which you're right on him when you're bringing up\nA Jimmy Butler when you're bringing up a lot of other players here there there's a conversation to be had about what these guys want to do on their own right Jimmy Butler might be aloof he wants to do it on his own from what it looks like right now you might still gonna lay who really knows what he's going to do but for ... George hey there might have been a conversation there\nIf you can't get a guarantee he's not going to sign long term that's the way she's going to go and he had a chance decided to stay in Oklahoma City what's that telling you these guys know you you don't play with LeBron it's not a partnership you play for the guy\nIs everything for him and you can win a championship that way and we know he's the greatest physical player of all time but\nWhen we hold it in legacy when we hold a two two overall greatness there that relentless pursuit has ended\nTo get to the post season and if he doesn't get dispatched in the first round he'll certainly get dispatched by the Golden State warriors and all of the end of the year we'll see if they're the strive for greatness everything else that lies dormant and so what I see today makes that decision that much more disappointing George and Clemson your next up on CBS Sports where they go at George\nGeorge George\nGeorgia's Johnny wanted to talk to me about ... eighty five five to one to four CBS eight five five two and two for two to seven yeah that's that that still where I Am on the brunt\nIs that I Know how great he is and I know that he'll continue to put up with an incredible numbers they'll have incredible performance is done like crazy and they'll still lose basketball games and they'll still look about five hundred\nAnd them they might make the playoffs with the Lakers and again you immediately get beaten by Golden State he used it might be a little bit of a mix you immediately get bitten by Golden State and if nobody joined you you'll continue to lose and that'll be the end of it\n\n[noise]\nThe he's the kitten Carmen show\nYou want a piece on fees you I Want the whole thing on CBS Sports radio\nHey I've got some great news you could say Fifteen Percent or more when you switch to a guy so that's right fifty percent a mortgage just by switching the guy who got a guy go dot com or give a call the guy's going to Fifteen minutes you could say fifty percent or more on car insurance coming up with eleven PM Easter we got ...\nNFL dot com around the NFL we'll talk we gave him John Powell joined us NBA dot com coming up and just about an hour we'll talk about the Cavaliers making moves\nLook broad and just how good things are up in Toronto with the raptors right now but World Series game five and it looks like it's getting ready to come to an end as time goes on because they just added another one did the Boston Red Sox and to speak about all that\nMike ... joins us on the show CBS Sports baseball writer find him on Twitter at my ... my thanks for joining us that I'm a friend\n[noise] sure I pick them up\nOr you have our score who is able to win a world what possibly I don't want to jinx it possibly what a World Series that his first year John Farrell was able to win a couple Tito won a couple\nJust so Borten our managers in in the modern era baseball\nOh there are obviously very important I Do think the role as absolutely changed and just because there's so much input from the front office\nA and there's just so much information given to these managers now their job is not so much to the public eye is no line up and make a bold moves it's taking misinformation\nGiving it to the coach is giving it to the players explaining it explaining how to use it and and these days what salaries are with you on that you also manage the egos and that's that's a big part of it you know even with all the analytics and all that managers are obviously incredibly important interesting job took the job description is changed a little over time\nSo what changes now at least what might have led to the change to pick\nOut coral ... score from John Farrell and and what was their overall goal because obviously it's it's going to work out pretty nicely year for Boston\nYeah with federal apparently there was a lot of problems with communication and some Red Sox pirate even those World Series up and asked about the difference mix that it's just give me an occasion referral wasn't I don't want to say he didn't have like an open door policy or maybe he wasn't as available I ... and that's connected to the team its core and\nAnd ... communication as a strength record I don't think the only reason the red Sox me the change I mean the last two years they had good season and they got knocked out quickly and the only yes so when that happened managerial change but that's a big difference here I think is\nIs is just the communication and that just thinking relationships their car has the way he's kind of made this change altogether because it's it's not the same team of life and he's in but it's largely the same cast a quarter is still the same pitch a totally different team\nMy sex CSA with us on the show what's the biggest thing we overreact to his fans in the postseason\nEverything pretty much like you look at David\nPrice tonight prices have in the game of his career tonight and two weeks ago the guy who was a postseason choke or couldn't handle the big spot and now he's got a pretty good chance to win the world series MVP and it just\nYou know that the postseason a lot of weird things happen you know we'll get back to not having a good postseason hit the homerun tonight but he has a good up to this point what do you know an incredible player and I would take them in the postseason he's like the guy I wanted to play it in any situation it just the postseason gets wait a little too heavily and I understand it\nBut at the end of the day it is still the same game and you got to be a little bit too careful to react to not overreact or something and I think we see that with the Dodgers with their line of the way they put two and they have all these ... ...\nIt didn't work for them for two games in Boston and they completely changed it up and did something different and that's just the kind of lead to problems just change everything you do based on a little bit of information in the postseason\nExceeds the joining us on the show I'm so glad you brought up David Price\nOr because I've never seen the postseason costs ... a front end pitcher real money it always seems at any teams is going to take that we'll figure it out after that\nBut how does a pitcher like him who who seem to be mad just talking to the trees ... months ago how does he get that figure it out in the same thing for a guy like clay Clinton crucial who's who's been very good in his own right this postseason it hasn't always had that history\nYeah I think what price you know early in his career with the race he did have some really good postseason starts and you kinda got some tough luck losses there or you didn't really score runs for him and I think it sort of a team like a self fulfilling prophecy America oh the average price didn't win the overseas and even though he's pitching kind of well\nIt kind of compounds that have gotten his head a little bit and then he started to pitch poorly and I think that we hadn't Houston we started on short rest\nI I don't know if something clicked but it seems like he was the ethics are thinking\nKind of built up this confidence and he was able to roll from there and ultimately it just comes down to the fact that this guy is a great pitcher and I don't think you get to where he is where he's been in his career and one of ... ... ... biggest pitching contract in baseball history I don't think you could do that without handling crush or I don't think\nThat's part of it I think you know there was too much pressure form\nFor something thing goes way and I think once he kinda got out of his own head a bit\nKinda figured out you know this is the same game I think could be anything higher and during the regular season it works out for him and he's been marvelous tonight is on short ... which dinner at least two days ago and he's been we haven't touched on that doctors\nMight exceeds is joining us on the show so last year they fall in seven the Dodgers due to Houston it looks like they might fall in five to Boston this year it is their change coming to LA what more can you do\nYeah there has to be some change obviously and and I think this theories especially\nYou just look at the ball and the doctors you don't feel like you're turning to a baseball game this season at any point you see a bunch of guys who throw a hundred with with nasty flyers and the doctors don't really have anyone like that they're hoping is not as good as as it was last year as it has been the last few years that's been a big difference for them and just\nWhite guys on wind up from just are hitting like David Freed sort of two or three hits than I Am one of them was a truck to pop up and\nIt's my granddaughter has an ... Machado this postseason they have a lot of guys who just kind of looked into what about the same time and\nThey don't need to overhaul faced are still a very good team\nYou know you don't get back to back World Series unless you have talent but they do need some tweaks there they got to figure out their fault and\nI Do think there's some changes that could be made on the in your maybe they could do better at second base going forward but I don't think an overhaul comedy\nThey made him a child who hates Boston so he's going to end up in Boston this off season\nYou know it's what can they actually want to do with their money but I think I don't think it's as crazy as people think I'm thinking of\nSend this off season you know it's it depends what can they actually want to do with their money but I think I don't think it's as crazy as people think if they can afford to go after him because as you know as good as somebody in the ... looks\nHe's not many Machado but you I I don't think it's going to happen but I don't think it's completely out of the question if they have the money I think they were kind of the third one the pull their wares Bryce Harper going to end up\nYou know if I had to see right now I think the most likely outcome as he goes back to Washington but I Would take the field over that you know I think that\nIndividual team the best chance the national still bet on the field here I think somebody's going to step up with a monster contract and\n[noise] I feel like it'll be one of fourteen please going the national the cubs the Phillies are the Yankees I think one of those teams will be yet\nI still think the national they're going to kind of go out and and\nGo to a level where maybe we didn't expect him to go because they are still looking good enough to win next season\nHarper's their center piece and\nI don't think they want them to go I think they would love to make them a lifelong national\nNews it seemed like they were gonna go just the cheat sheet Rob that'd be amazing if they were to go out there to make him an offer basically good reviews on that money\nYeah and the national ... certainly have the money I mean the learners are one of the wealthiest families among based on a ship and again they have the money and you and you know you've got ... are still in his parliament Strasburg and now you know wants soda as well and Anthony ... do you have the talent to win and it didn't work out this year\nWhat your goal they want me to fish and they wanted the fishing in recent years to talent Koreans there and\nThey wouldn't without Harper yeah maybe it depends on how to move the big ... is with Bryce Harper\nI think there really is and I think corporate notes probably more valuable\nThan Washington anywhere else already has kind of a legacy already where if he were to go to the Yankees you wouldn't be necessarily be the mad because it's Aaron Judge or most of the cops it would be Chris Bryant you know he's got the center he's got the\nHe's the center of attention in Washington that might not be the case somewhere out so I think he's more valuable he's most valuable to Washington I think it's the best bet for both sides\nWho's been the ... I'm Sorry Mike who's been the biggest disappointment this off season as far as the team's concerned\n\nOr should I think you know I think it's some I think it's a national just based on the seat and they just had I thought they were gonna win sufficient easily\nAnd then I say postseason road I say off season you set off season\nI'm Sorry I met postseason nationals I can agree I met ... who's been the biggest ... brain farce who's been the biggest disappointment this postseason as the team is concerned ... sorry about\nThat stuff right you know I think it has to be the cubs because ... I think the cubs were the most talented team\nIn the national league and then they ended up having a probably a good one sixty three division title which they lost them and they had to play the wild

America because you know what's going to be seen you're telling America\nI got this we're going to win because if you if you show up looking like that\nThat means that you have to walk out of there and if you don't walk out of there like that or you walk out of there with your tail between your will eggs wearing something else that is not a good look run do\nSo you better when if you're going to show up and get up it's the same reason why I Love Russell Westbrook when he shows up dress like a ... and look like he's about to serve tea I I I get excited about that\nBecause it puts pressure on him when he shows up at all black for the funeral the team is about the play I get excited about that because you gotta have stove to do it and sometimes it doesn't always work out that way\nSo for Mr

hello Nick how are you\n[noise] [noise] hello Ken I'm great how are you a\nLittle story about neck LeBron James went to the same high school as he did so you guys got yourself a nice little nugget there Mick I'm doing wonderful did you hear my little due to add about what I was saying about much Mitch Trybulski\nYeah my question is if you were in his shoes how are you are arriving to the game on Sunday of all of them we\nWill do I look like this or do I looked like he\nHe looked like you\nI looked like me while I got to show up looked like any read or Ralph region or something like that Marchman Gino like yeah it's it's not necessarily a like Mike Dick is not necessarily the fitness guy who ever walked the face of the earth but he's certainly not the heaviest either so\nAgain I think if you show up like that you better when because did he do the post game press conference ... do we know that for sure\nYet he did and then he took the glasses off or ...\nThe but the effect but well he did it well you gotta look people in the eye obviously there because you if you did have a change of clothes and you went up there after last dresses might dicker that's pretty remarkable hanging out there and if you understand that don't you a lot of that\nMix just joining us on the show so if you're if you're a bears fan right now we'll move on to go around the league here momentarily but if you're a\nBears fan or you're breathing a sigh of relief or you feel confident Andrew Young quarterback that now he's he's arrived and he's playing better\nI think you have to I think you really have to be confident in in both him in the area of a church in her him he's playing because there's all kinds of a totally different look then had last year I mean that that was noticeable from pretty early on and it seems as though with each week\nHe's taking incremental step by step progress to becoming a better quarterback and really it's fitting into the starter role entirely\nAnd yet the jets but they do have a a a decent defence and um and and really no matter the opponent this week it's how they play it over the last three or four weeks you know that last in Miami and over time was a crushing but they played well patriots\nAnd rented Soviet and will come out today and they had a game that for a moment there looked like they were going to give it up as he could pass bears team or maybe another lesson team\nWould've given that game up in a leather jacket on back but they didn't they closed the deal and they came away with the wind and sitting at foreign three right now and what's what appears to be a pretty winnable division is\nUh the Vikings look like they're about the fall or tonight I'm you know they got to be putting up with the happening up because I don't think anybody really expected this fall I Know I I thought they were in a way and I know we're just now at the halfway point seasonal centrally so there's a lot of football that people have a right now with the record\nThat's right I Know I didn't I thought they were and others you know way and I know we're just now at the halfway point of the season essentially a so there's a lot of football that the play but right now with the record that they have it's it's pretty good position for that\nWhat it is a great point because when riot police made the moves that he did last year when he ... when he traded up and got Mitch ... and then this year when he traded for ...\nMan this is this is the guy who's under the gun ... this guy is if these decisions don't\nWork you're done you're done and I don't know if you're you know I don't know if you're a gym again and and so far there working\nYeah you know and the thing is is that trait up last year did not look good especially afterward when he found out that the niners had had no interest in the risky and they weren't going to make the raid in ... I mean they weren't gonna draft him and they didn't you know they just made the tributes oh you want to give us takes to move back one spot you can take this guy we weren't even going to take All right\nSo it looks bad for him it looks bad for them when they were not a good football team last year and went through his he struggled as a rookie as most would you do and then it was really perplexing when they extended him with a three year deal to get him in line with the matinees contracts because\nAt least from her my seat I was thinking this guy has not really done enough to prove that he is worthy of an extension of that trade was laughable last June and they haven't been a good team you know some of the picks hadn't panned out mainly Kevin White\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight that's eight hundred three eight zero nine five to eight by calling your addiction team you're taking the\nFirst steps to recovery to help you need to be one called the weigh eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight make the recall now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight ... a third party advertiser for very stream centers and play some networks individual\nResults will very busy you weren't ... dot com forward slash turns for more information\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you written a book and want to get it published he's publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets they handle all aspects of the publishing process for you\nPrinting ... publicity copyright an editing go eight hundred times or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author ... should get that seat under advice or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author somebody should get again eight hundred ... or one thirty six eighty nine [noise]\nTo have like ... and go to one hundred and forty thirty estimates that not only that you see the Kentucky but also the scare me\nHave breakfast at Churchill Downs and watch the horses warm up on the track and\nVisit the Kentucky Derby\nThe more the jargon during the great American female races down the river and just kind of taste testing at the reserves distillery\nDetails can be seen on the ... website or by calling me didn't stop at three one zero eight zero\nMexican renovation him to see the rolling hills and written it of course race just ten minutes for [noise]\n\nThe football playoff continue with glassy one quarter final action on friday as mark frame or in the Senate over here the blue jays visit while who to fight him from him and his aides to vision Newman Cavaliers at six o'clock this was for director Joe J. hall of fame coach Bob sniff for Jake ...\nBrigade coverage at five twenty friday evening online rocks Ninety seven five K.

trying to develop and get out of the seller next who's up\nMy gundy\nThose press conferences are all of a sudden they're back\nMaking fart noises while you're there\nIt's amazing yeah or a rat's ass

talking like that okay\n... it's odd to be chef I didn't hear him growing after the last two I Will say\nI didn't hear him ... forbid the media from talking to players about guys transferring I didn't hear him crowing\nAfter the last of the road decay state which is not a very great football team this year they get themselves a surprise when against tax is okay I understand but all of a sudden you're all of a sudden the cats at all over again\nThat mullet as it truly infused into his brain\nIs what's going on here [noise]\nListen you can have your great days and you can celebrate your great days which kind of looked like an ass when you have bad week like you had and then all of a sudden you stand up there and you say that you couldn't care less about winter ... yes you do because if you didn't say anything about it\nYou really wouldn't say anything about it really wouldn't care but he said something about it don't tell me you don't care just like when the guys were able to hack into your teleconference you definitely care that who's down then Gilbert I don't know how what he's going to do with this basketball team I have no idea what's going to do with the cast\nYour fire entire loose six games into the new season less than two weeks into the new season\nWas the point of hold on a new holiday holding on to win the first place Kobe alternate him obviously didn't get along LeBron's gone and now everybody said well you see why you see what he did for the team go right every effort the Cavaliers have made\nTry to prove that they can live life without LeBron the first time he left and now this time it's just advertise themselves [noise]\nI just hope calling sexting can develop in in in hopefully they stay out of his way that's the only hope that cavalier saying would have\nBecause this is it's not a question of whether it's just if you're ever going to get any sort of respectability again\nWith that group he questionable fake next who's up Alex coral one year ONE Championship it's like a guy played video games you got to line up like that you have Steve Pearce coming through with big hits\nGot JD Martinez coming through\nI mean how great could have possibly be David Price doing his work going seven complete only given up three hits David Price was basically talking to the trees\nCom that's dry home one two three dot com\nReady to take control of your financial life\nNews talk W JAG [noise]\n\nOn CBS Sports radio\nComing up a little bit later on I got to get an update\nI have to update on\nOn making a murderer season two I'm putting together a theory I have I Swear to you I have not seen any spoilers I have not watched anything that happens later on I promise you this my Andy you America\nBut I'm watching the I've watched like the first four episodes of season to making a murder and I'm starting to I'm starting to see a picture here just before I used\nTo say that list and Steven Avery through a cat and a bonfire don't tell me this guy's innocent\nBut\nI'm starting to wonder on something I'm starting to wonder eight five five to one to foresee I'm starting to think about right now the Cavaliers are and they're they're in a mess of their own\nYou get rid of the coach of the season less than two weeks into the season\nAnd it basically just puts it out to everybody to\nTo the NBA NBA fans out there oh abroad should have been the MVP the entire way wrong or the entire way along that's not a new take that something that we've been saying for quite a while\nIt just reaffirms what that teen is without LeBron which is a dumpster fire\nStill makes it a little bit more disappointed that he went to LA now explain that why coming up but first let's get Shawn pal NDA dot com Powell do the people is his Twitter handle hello Shaun how are we doing tonight\nI'm going to ask\nShawn first off how surprised were you the tie Lou was jettisoned or six games end of the twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen season\nA little surprise but of course you know I'm not new to the very uh uh I mean this ... ... probably a top\nTen a surprising coaching changes you know that that I knew the capital is going to have a tough year\nUm the fur on anything they've really didn't have much less the veteran players have seen better days and they're young players aren't ready to win right now I'm I'm tie Lou I'm kind of relief I made\nA because now I'm you know I collect the pay check back you know and see what it's going to come my way and another year or two and I the I think the capitalist situation is going to get worse before it gets better\nI I think it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better than Gilbert I I Know he's trying like crazy his his ego is getting him to try like crazy to somehow when a championship without LeBron I think it's an ... authors\nBut man he just seems to get his way it is there any less than that he can learn that it's not going to basically take away or under cut this basketball team over the next few years\nWhile I was sort of surprised that a Dan Gilbert didn't sell the team right after the parade and twenty sixteen I turn and that was talking to my colleague that said\nUh this'll be the right hand self esteem here's why a number one you've already on the champs you can't top that a second chance you things published findings ethic\nNumber two number on at that point on we had another two years or two years I think his contract you never get more of the Cavaliers and you get them right but I just spoke at you know ... I guess that you know it's just my team\nAre going to be successful we'll put without LeBron James that you said\nI don't think he had any kind of vision of winning a championship anytime soon\nBut I didn't think he thought that\nThis team can be pretty good to see them compete for a playoff spot\nAnd who knows ... years could began and fought next rebuilding re loading process that will hold them back up and the top four or five and he's\nShown up ... joining us on the show well\nI but there's always going to be the question of free agency in retaining guys who could possibly go with freeing CNN or the the CPAs changing basically as I say the sentence but\nWho's going to be willing to take the money I it's been a guy who has certainly come with his harsh criticisms when it's when it's come to some of the players and some of these guys are choosing their own happiness over taking their money we wanted empowered athletes and and sometimes this is what we get as a fan base in places\nYou know you would think a place like Cleveland would be a tough sell\nAnd and sometimes this is what we get is a fan base places yeah\nYou know you would think a place like Cleveland would be a tough sell or you know cold weather or not the greatest cosmopolitan city although the people there are hardcore sports fans and you know very passionate um bought a first first of all about the agency is they're going to take the money if the money's there\nUm and also if you look at places like Oklahoma City hall George had a chance to go to the Lakers sunshine and all that he decided to stay in Oklahoma City um again not every player is cut off every player lots of big city\nAnd all that some players are quite a content to be in a small or medium or market like renting Mila stayed in Indiana his entire career and come up with seven eight other examples\nAh but yeah I Do think however if you're a free agent one thing you're going to look at in addition to the money and addition whether you have a chance to win it doesn't look look at the workman organization and if you feel that the organization is invoke a shaky\nAndme will have a hard time in just in terms of making the right trade and ...\nAnd yeah you're going to start to think ah and look elsewhere\nToronto also hot start Milwaukee off to a heart start right there at the top of one and two in the eastern conference in the first couple of weeks what's it going to take for either one of those teams to stay there can either one of those teams staying there\n[noise] I had a lot more confidence in Toronto um only because a quiet Leonard a and cauliflower he has a pretty tough hand them they had some success last year so you know what you're seeing is not a food\nUm quiet Leonard has really mashed well with his team makes\nA I mean this is a team that on paper it's better than last year and last year a marketing nine games so I think with Milwaukee there is always the danger of [noise] you know the rest of the legal figure them out pretty soon although I don't think there's no figuring out on us I mean this is a guy who on pace\nTo finish problem in the top three of the MVP voting I think he is the I shouldn't say the the next superstar 'cause I think he's already a superstar or I look at him in ... in the same mold is Anthony Davis\nA singular talent that can really up with a team almost by himself so I Would say that uh both teams are properly finishing the top four and he went all said and done although I think uh I have a little bit more faith in Toronto because of the makeup of the team ...\nSo a lot of us are saying well Boston is the class of the east what's Philadelphia have to say about that and you just mentioned Toronto in Milwaukee is well\nI think the Sixers um company right there I mean it could be a matter of just set up\nA smattering of game separating them from the top a little you know Alan Bean is off to it just a fantastic start uh he's really make the case for being the best man in the NBA uh but I think\nThey put mark ... from the starting lineup and I think that was a good decisions because you want to get the kissing confidence and want to give them the rest of the first team to see what he can do get him prepare for the springtime as far as the Celtics I just think that there's going to initial pass\nThis too much talent there are and and they're just trying to figure out for the system where everybody can get enough ... a minute and\nAnd contribute because when you are being and Ken Goran have or out last year\nOr you have guys pressed into getting you know start a minute you know a very low share a and a couple of others\nSo now you've got a rotation of about eight nine players so I just think that right now they're just trying to get into a rhythm and just trying to figure out how everybody can contribute to the team and I and I ...

afterwards that time was supposed to take the Neal\nYeah at why did I I just don't get it\nI mean for the same reason that Cody Ballenger decided that he would try to leave early from birth date and steal it what was it the the ninth inning or I don't remember exactly what any it was on a friday night but he takes all but his own and he gets caught in a rundown when he would have been a runner and scoring position 'cause there was a walk right behind him so\nYeah sometimes players think they have an opportunity and they take it even if it's against the game plan it's not always the coaches

and so the Packers never get it back and\nI felt really bad for him quite a lonely spot to be in on the sidelines there were there were a lot of Packer fans of Los Angeles so that was weird it was just me but here are the rams were undefeated and they're taking on a really difficult opponent yet her opponent\nHas more fans are maybe more vocal fans and they did there at the coliseum so rams and

J. G. [noise]\nMemorial no Brian kill me\nHonestly I think this president's whole modus operandi or is to divide us uh he gets up in the morning with a new and inventive ways to divide us and it's not enough that on the day of a tragedy he says the right words if every other day of the year he's saying things to bring us a a into conflict with each other\nRight and Adam Schiff has really done a great job rallying the nation around the president has he with his nonstop Russia\nInnuendos and make the president looked illegitimate please don't tell me you buy into the California congressmen who if a tradition holds in history has something to learn from a will be chairman of oversight or will say oh let's go out to\nScott listening in Florida he's got\nHey Brian this is Scott I'm I'm I'm the guy that call friday on the black that yeah that was a stolen the problem I have there's three things I have problems with\nFirst just political correctness yup it ...\nAnd his allies the politically correctness that's in this nation of laws that prevent people from telling the truth we all know block Obama is why we all know that it will go rock bottom that set the nation against president or\nAnd that was a mission that sustained us through a World War two through the Cold War I'm not saying it was a bad mission many ways it accomplished a great deal and brought a lot of stability and peace too large sections of the world\nBut it also made us assumes certain kinds of burdens and allow others to shift the burden to us\nThat now Donald Trump is saying this is not this is that where America is going to be on my watch and this is not where America needs to be a globally we have so many our allies and partners who could shoulder more bird like NATO we have so many world hotspots in which the United states\nDoesn't have to send troops are put boots on the ground in order to deal with in order to limit the the the destruction and the instability that results from this new paradigm from the last hundred years so Newt\nGingrich had a different take not necessarily against us but he was on it marked within a last night on life liberty and lived in cut forty seven and so\nBecause she was on his Republican\nAnd because he he he has no hostility to conservatism is just as and think about a much and he has enormous hostility to political correctness and liberalism\nBecause it just doesn't fit how he thinks the world wars\nOr and so I think\nWe ended up with somebody who I I compare it frankly there Andrew Jackson as one of the most disruptive presidents we've ever had because because he's not afraid to take on this to average when every single morning\nHey I don't disagree with that and the dimension of Andrew Jackson resonates with you obviously a and it resonates so I think with a lot of Americans who recognize that Jackson was he was kind of our our first real populist president who understood the relationship between American power\nAnd where America needed to be as a society where it was directions and he gets a lot of bad press because of trail of tears and so on and I've written about the fact that Jackson is not the person should take the blame for\nWhat happened with all that but the point is is that if you if you compare Theodore Roosevelt view of America's role in the world and Donald Trump's or they are\nI Would say if not identical certainly parallel in ways that I think Americans right now begin to realize we actually gained a great deal by this new approach to America's role in the world\nAnd the way he was viewed that Teddy Roosevelt to in the beginning they saw this guy was to robots almost comical I and the way he handled himself he was vice president thrown out in the last minute to unify ticket I guess get New York that thrive on a police chiefs I run riders prior guy so and he was self promoting in many ways\nSo only help it and you know what ... and ... that that that that tweet Twitter is Trump's bully part ... and it's a way in which he's been able to change the political dialogue in this country in extraordinary ways that we haven't really seen the end of\nThe people don't accept them they didn't accept a Roosevelt in and he took on business by the way but they didn't accept him really in Washington they never accepted Donald Trump he took his case of the people Teddy Roosevelt took his case of the people and they seem oblivious to criticism\n[noise] totally and she is also a dumb mistake that Roosevelt made was in Nineteen twelve is split the Republican ticket\nAnd let Woodrow Wilson into the White House by running a against his own hand picked successor William Howard Taft because he didn't like some of tests more conservative policies\nAnd that hurt him both as if figure within the Republican Party but it also opened the door to someone like Woodrow Wilson and a progressive agenda both internationally and nationally that we are still trying to sort out and still trying to clear out today\nSays hey Roosevelt gets his you know McKinley gets killed ... writes who he becomes president he finishes McKinley term than wins reelection and then says he's done and then says he's fit and then ... become handed over to ... to the country which was that in in anything\nIf anything it was in many ways a reversing some of Roosevelt overreach and the progressive I especially in domestic politics but Roosevelt also keep in mind too he was our first real colorblind president you know he invited Booker T washing to come to the White House he was a firm believer also in the idea of what we call the melting pot\nRight not the end of hyphenated Americans he would look at the situation with illegal immigration and sort of say well we need immigrants who become Americans we don't need America as a haven where people come in order to preserve and to maintain\nA political or cultural identity which has anesthetic all too what America represents where America needs to go so you know the\nPresidents are shortcomings you know his successors he's anything but traditional and he's he gets up every day he's a unorthodox as say the least but us somebody's historian\nAnd like David a of a David Hanson Victor Davis Hanson and others\nAre open and you know look at General Keane just say okay I Know how things the only one but I'm open to see if this is going to work\nSo I'm just stunned to see the anti Semitism or the anti Semitic gunman walk into a synagogue kill Evan people in cold blood and people draw back to Donald Trump listen to Jonathan Weissman he's in New York Times jeopardy\nEditor listen to this guy cut nine\nNot over what it and and president trolley line we're not calling him a raiders were not calling when we don't know what I'm saying in the show a reluctant time and time again\nTo Charlotte hit the orders and hit the corner as in Illinois that I'm not calling you a writer I bet they or their race or think you're right that's right they said we are in like believe they had on their side and he got pushed back\nHard enough effects are with\nThis guy is hates Trump ... yeah he hated Trump any hate Israel Trump does Trump evading he gets criticized because he's too tight with Israel\nIs a it's a guilt by association but it's so typical of the media's response to truck you know what\nThey're ... they live on Trump Trump has made them possible to maintain ratings to keep themselves in the public eye\nAnd the only way which they can deal with this is and they're declining ... relevance and declining influence that Trump presidency represents is to get more and more extreme or and become more and more unqualified and their attacks on him and in some ways you know I watch this with people that I Know who are never Trump voters and I've watched\nSort of ... if I'm going to send you use this expression\nWashed their character deform as a result of this is a is there anger feeds on itself towards Trump\nAnd this has happened in our mainstream media look what's happened to the New York times and the Washington Post ah the decline of intellectual credibility which was never very high to begin with right on his uh end with the with the mainstream media and it's infuriating Brian to watch it and I'm no I Know that you you see this\nRight on his uh and with the with the mainstream media and it's infuriating Brian to watch and I know I Know that you you see this happening to those who call themselves your peers but it's also tragedy has nothing to do with\nWith Donald Trump it has to do with their own growing impotence to shape the national dialogue and that drives me crazy\nAlso they were wrong comments Donald Trump will never ... Donald Trump will never win and he did all those things that I have\nAnd I had people who are Trump supporters in the summer who'd come to be at my office in sort of say do you think do you really think Donald Trump is going when it said yes I Do I think that the media is wrong I think the polls are off the mark here and I said also I said not only is he going to win I think could be a very good president he's actually exceeded my expectations\nFrom the point of view of what he's been able to accomplish and what he's been able to do\nHere and he okay he's a bowling a China shop but the American people said you know what it's time to break some ... and you need someone who's willing to do that and they sent down Trump them\nSo you are Michael Gerson speech writer for George Bush hates them rights everyday Abadi is you have George Will despise them doesn't want to be Republican anymore you a Bill Kristol or someone whose dad really was one of the founders of conservatism and I know very well yeah and now Bill Kristol hates everything he does he can't do anything right or by him\nGuys like Frank Luntz who were wrong so listen I was wrong\nYou know guys like a Erick Erickson so you know I become I was in trouble but now I'm seeing what's going on and seeing how unfairly has been treated\n'em back in yeah so I give people credit you could be wrong but why you keep doubling and tripling down he's not going to get impeach he's gonna finish for years he's already got a plan in place it's going to be easier to get another four there was his first for\nUs I think it will be and and also to there's going to be a deep bench of young conservatives including people like uh like John James\nThe candidate Michigan who I think it's a terrific can we use a voice in prison term I don't know I think it'd be great go up there with ... you know go go to Detroit doing event therefore for James but you've got a deep bench of very able people men and women are who are going to be able to step into and who will\nFunction is that the level that Trump has in terms of the new paradigms how politics works and what the ... divisions are in this country anymore\nI don't want to make

looked at the last inflation numbers are very low\nPut around I mean I'm not like any airline I was down there it's\nGoing to be honest I'm not blaming anybody I put him there and made me a trade maybe it's wrong but I wanted to get it wrong I put it so couple of other people there that I'm not so happy with two without him very happy with papal\nA that is for the United states speak English Reagon about the fed and he says you know as our economy there's good and forecasters do well they raise rates and its robbing us or the momentum\nAnd nodding along is the co author of jumping jacks inside the America First plan to revive our economy Stephen Moore Steven you think he was a lot of people uh sit on the president should not comment on this how do you feel\nLike I think he's right on the substance and I don't see anything inappropriate but the president who is basically the c._e._o. or our economy speaking out now that's not to say that that shouldn't be independent you just heard Donald Trump said he believes the fed should be independent but look\nThe economy is booming right now we were in the biggest boom in Thirty years we have seven million more workers than we have I mean jobs and we have workers and that's an amazing statistic\nSo the economy is booming and Trump is basically saying look there's no inflation why is the fed taking you know the old metaphor was the rise of taking the punch bowl away from the party just when it's getting going\nAnd I happen to agree with him on that but I don't want to see a return of inflation I Lived through the seventies I Lived through you know Fifteen sixteen percent inflation rate\nBut this idea that somehow this is a bogeyman inflation right now in food prices are not rising\nAnd there's too many people the fed who believed that growth in the economy and higher wages are inflationary now about laughter where here Brian I Know what he would tell you you say if the economy produces more apples the price of Apple's falls it doesn't rise growth causes lower inflation not hire in place\nSo a white now you're looking at ah the market last week and a lot of people an upset so that's for sure of what your point job three hundred points down ... points down what's going on\nA I think there's a lot of profit taking at the beginning I thought there was a lot of nervousness about what the fed was doing what when interest rates rise than bonds are more attractive than sucks right I mean that's just simple a finance but ah look I'm not a great stock picker or anything like that but I Will tell people this\nOne great piece of advice ready for this Bryant ready by low shell high fidelity people tend to do the opposite right they tend to you know when the bark is crashing this is a good time to buy stocks they're cheap earnings are good or not you're good now\nSo it's even more Sherry's talking about his book Trump ... now with the president's got his economy roaring [laughter] he's got the revenue coming in the ... or something else you've got to tackle but a GDP is a three point five to four point to feel good about it but guess what somebody else is taking credit\nWhen your economic\nThat's going on when the job numbers from\nMy job numbers Republicans are saying it's\nActually those numbers are the same as they were\nAnd through Fifteen and threw them sixteen\nReaction Stevens well about my luck liberals have a hard time explaining what's going on with US Economy because you should also play I Know you probably have the send your catalog\nWhen bronco by my set a few weeks before the election how is Donald Trump's going to get us to four percent growth how is he going to revive manufacturing does he have a magic wand well maybe this president does have a magic wand 'cause we have revived manufacture we have revised the mining industry and we have four percent growth and now they're trying to explain why\nCurrent generation post draft frankly you know back in the day you took Eighteen Nineteen year old kids from downtown Detroit from LA from west Georgia and you're all put together I talked to a veteran the other day ... coming from the segregated south the first African American he ever spoke to ever was his bumped made in the navy\nRight and then they became lifelong friends so that that kind of forcing effective getting people from all different aspect of our society is missing something I Want to get back to not just nationwide but in our politics as well\nAnd they do indeed have a major role to play as\nFar as [noise] as far as every [noise]\nAnd we all say this and also to Saturday but\nThe media's constant unfair coverage [noise] ...\nAnd negative attacks you know the [noise] only served to drive people apart\nAnd to undermine healthy debate\nSo he took the argument at him and I thought it was very fair go you got the media's got to see a role here\nIf you watch CNN MSNBC or if something happens good with the economy they don't talk about right if something's happened with ISIS being decimated it doesn't doesn't wear reached the right or if something happens with the Mueller probe it leads are they lying no but they're putting you in ordinance emphasis on things that they think\nIs going to get them ratings that food drives him nuts\nSo that's right and and the bias in the media I tell people all the time isn't necessarily what the coverage what they don't cover what they ... how many people recognize him realize the president just signed a clean up our oceans\nAct to get plastic out of the oceans some of the biggest offenders are in Asia how many people realize that he signed sex trafficking legislation to visit to stop sex trafficking in its tracks that law enforcement\nHas been pressing for for years the veterans accountability act the veteran's Choice Act all of these things people are getting done Brian I'm knocking hundreds of thousands of doors over the course of the last year year and people want results\nThey recognize the results that are happening in their everyday lives there looking past the rhetoric and that's just what we have to keep talking\nAbout the opioid too or just passed a bipartisan level of money to opioid abuse and treatment\nThat is right or not and not only more broadly but with our veterans a community as well many of them running around with Ninety pounds of gear on for decades are all over the world are living with chronic pain and they're getting addicted to opioids so not only are we going to a deal with it more broadly but we need to deal with it within the VA thing and that's what they're getting done\nA colonel on top of that the one thing is and I've always said that is\nThe health care is did you don't even hear about Republicans and Democrats when it comes to health care it's all personal that what kind of play do you have a and when you go to a hospital you go to a doctor what kind of care do you get how much comes out of your pocket yeah he will not what class you are it hits you so I I think Republicans kinda dropped the ball here\nBrian I'm a business owner and for the for the last six years I've had to look at my employees dealing with double digit premium increases year after year after year under Obamacare\nThese are people making maybe fifty sixty thousand dollars if you've got an eight to ten thousand dollar to ... you have to come out of pocket ten grand before your planned even kicks in that's not a plan that's a joke so so I proposed and talked about we have to get out the cost of care\nThat the flow with Obama cares and went after universal coverage and that's what Andrew\nGillum and so many others free free free when nothing's free or if we're going after the cost tort reform portability of insurance selling across shaped prices which the president drug prices getting serious about Medicaid fraud and Medicare fraud that blowing up\nThe system that not only helps businesses like mind that helps individuals that helps the fastest growing part of our defense budget that's not aircraft carriers and planes it's health care costs and it helps or national data will what are you getting after the cost of care\nAnd when people say that the president has made moves to stop covering preexisting conditions what's the truth\nSo what the Democrats are running on nationwide\nIs is a portion and amendment when they went after trying to fix Obamacare that basically said if you have a pre existing condition you were put into a high risk pool\nThe government and helps those individuals because obviously there are costs are much higher but for everyone else it'll actually drive premiums down and drive their deductibles down\nIt section and a half years actually they're my wrist bend the right here at high risk over here the government absolutely should help those I Am ... I Am absolutely for helping people with preexisting conditions we should there's two pieces of Obamacare that we're okay\nOne was that miners can stay on their parents' plan there was one one eighty six and two was that we have to take care of folks with preexisting conditions and the Democrats are essentially trying to scare seniors by telling them otherwise hair and all Americans by telling them otherwise\nThings on the twenty six year old because I'm seeing now my son's twenty two got a job they offered him insurance and a guy that's rare and one of the reasons is when you're a company you have to hire twenty two year old if you have to give them insurance\nNow my son's twenty two got a job they offered him insurance\nAnd a guy that's rare and one of the reasons is when you're a company you have to hire twenty two year old if you have to give them insurance\nThat's who sometimes can be a deterrent yeah what do I want to do that to an unproven personally and take that risk but would you do is if you take the pressure off the company and say that you know that person could stay in their parents' insurance that might for young business be aware score tail and had box we could afford to absorb you make a mistake maybe the small business you can\nWell that's that's absolutely right it helps businesses like mind trying to grow a lot of these kids are going to start ups that are just trying to get off the ground and the most expensive part of their overhead\nIs exploding cost of India and so again we have to get at the affordability of care and that doesn't mean having the government take it over which is only going to balloon their costs like\nBrian for anybody who is telling you government run health care is the solution look at the VA twelve hundred hospitals and clinics three hundred and sixty thousand employees their budget has doubled from thirty billion to sixty billion and yet veterans\nStill are not getting the care that they need cook report Larry ... both\nSay your seat is likely Republican Nate Silver at five thirty eight I'm a odd slip to twenty five percent of the Democrats when you're about it's about a one or two point race to it's going to be who's got the indoor and it's a lot of people who'd been in the Green Bay in that case so what are the issues that I think matters a lot to the people of Florida but you know best healthcare matters\nNot take it away it's a fixed income security that matters\nAnd also this just in you might not know this\nAccording to Lucas Tom Watson who's is respect as anybody at the Pentagon one of our reporters\nRoughly five thousand us troops us troops will be deploying to our southern border as early as Tuesday the reinforcements headed to the southern border will remain as support troops not combat troops can you believe that we have to sue we actually for the first time maybe since Eighteen thirty six or into the Mexican war\nWe had to put troops on our border to stop the five to seven thousand people from storming in\nLess than Brian two things one border security is absolutely national security\nAnd there are instances of Hezbollah working with Mexican drug gangs to infiltrate they're using tunnels they're using smugglers you know a smuggler who can move an immigrant or drugs can move WMD can move\nCan move terrorists to move all kinds of bad stuff but you know on the on the legal side we have to reform that as well you know ice sponsored an Afghan soldier who put his life on the line to fight with us he waited over five years he now has a family here started his own business\nI went to I was able to swear him in as a U.S citizen he was in tears but it should not taken by here that's right it shouldn't have taken five years but you want to find someone who's angry about getting skipped in line\nBy people coming across it illegally I talked to a veteran or just the other day who is barely above the poverty line who is trying to get all the help that he can that he owed by all of us that he helped defend and he's like are you kidding me these people are going to come\nAnd be attacks on our schools on our hospitals in our infrastructure we have a legal immigration system it needs to be fixed but people have to play by the rules we are a nation of immigrants absolutely but yeah we have to fix it ah when we come back with President Obama said about what a Michael Waltz is concerned about other tend to\nGirls going to be here he's wearing the sixth district comes Florida we've got stations all across Florida so if you have a question go ahead and pick up the phone one eight six six for all eight seven six six sign this is the bright kill me ...

big issue for so many families especially in rural America it's always a challenge to figure out that piece of the family puzzle\nExactly how do you pay for it where does it come from they have some new ideas we're going to talk to them about that of course we'll check markets\nAnd our good friend machinery Pete is here to talk everything machinery take your calls of course you can give us a call at eight five five for talk ag eight five five ... to eight four or five five to four if you'd like to come and join the conversation ask Gregory question pick his brain the guys\nJust the genius when it comes to things happening\nHappening in the uh uh machinery world but\nBefore we get to all that much turnover to time Morgan sitting right here to my right to discuss the news time do you have a good weekend was it was a busy\nI did but before we get to the news ... news ... ship is waiting for this grandbaby count yes what do you think they're they're going to call in you know that right\nNow the name wise yeah because you don't even though they're going to call chip what is what's the baby got a call ... right because grandpa granddaddy no those are kind of the ... now it's all different kinds ... puppy I mean what do you think they're going to call and\nI don't know ... ... ... ... should be\nNo I don't think no I don't know maybe but you know to have some suggestions not by us on Twitter yeah what ...\nCall chat because you know my daughter's even when you say okay we're going to call them grandpa or or grand that sometimes it comes out of nowhere and so my girls call my dad got oh I Do not know where that came from the one day ... started calling and guts and it has stuck ever sticks\nYou know we passed the Affordable CARE Act a few years back\nAnd I saw a headline this morning that says for the first time those premiums are going to be down one and a half percent is the first time that premiums are actually fallen\nSo all of these things work into this conversation that we're continuing in constantly having about how do we care or an and provide health insurance for our families and for the people that we love the most without going broke\nWithout uh you know having to spend too much um we're joined this morning by Rob Roberts rascal Farm Bureau chief administrator\nAnd Rob this is just a big a big issue thanks for being on TALK\nOf Oregon thank you for having me yes yes very big and you're ... or particular\nYeah I mean I Know you know my folks about New Mexico and uh you know we've got lots of family and friends that are are in agriculture and often times the solution is someone go into town to get a job to help provide health insurance why the rest of the family tries to stay on the farm or the ranch in and take care of business\n[noise] yeah you know I Can't think of any other sector than than agriculture an armored ranchers up or a better negatively impacted by these high cost of health insurance I mean we're hearing stories from our members of\nYou know twenty twenty five thirty thousand dollars a year ... you know almost becomes their higher Koch died among them former rafting so\nYou know about the working off the farm or or different structure that it's just it really large bloated apparently part right now\nYou know and I think it also in a you tell me what you think but I think it also limits who can come back to the farm because there's a lot of young families with young kids um and a lot of times it just seems to me and having my conversations with people about my age that\nYou know what I'd love to go back to the farm but I've got no way to get health insurance\nAnd that's the limiting decision I mean you know they could work around not making a lot of money if they can be back on the farm but the health insurance costs almost keeps them from going\nBut the health insurance costs almost keeps them from going\nYeah absolutely we hear those stories all the time and we held for regional meeting the summer with her Farm Bureau farmers and ranchers and and literally families and spouses would get up with tears in their eyes talking about how son couldn't come back or how they have to work\nIn town and that her father because he has to do everything on the farm alone and so it just it's a very emotional\nA decision point for family farms and have a real negative impact on some of the future out there\nYou know I was talking with the folks over farm aid and you know in that organization has been around since the crisis in the eighties and they were telling me about how cold there one eight hundred farm aid you know phone number has changed over the years and you know over the last five years one of the calls that they get most often is for a medical bill\nAnd people have a a hospital or a medical bill or health insurance need and if they're having to choose between health care and whether or not they can stay on the farm\nAnd that's a tough decision to make\n[noise] yeah it is in a lot of times that medical bill is sitting out there because they made the decision not to spend that thirty five thousand dollars a year have health insurance which is really unfortunate either on either side is kind of a no win\nSituation and it's a gamble and and those aren't families that have those medical problems crop up\nYou know it's just a big blow so yeah I I can I can believe that was a call or several calls for\nThem so you guys are doing something different you decided to that this is a big enough issue that we need to take this head on what what's going on what's your organization doing now\nWell we've been we've worked about two years on a project to create association health plans with in Nebraska Farm Bureau and we finally\nGot it launched a we're currently enrollment from October one\nThrough a December ... and so it's like the concept of association health plan and it's a large group plan basically as opposed to a small individual unit that you're trying to ensure sold the idea of having a large group of our members then has a less risky more stable pool where the prices can be lower\nSo that's what we're offering so ... as you start talking about this how did how did that come up of you know we we ought to get into the health insurance business and that seems like a pretty big pretty big step to take\n[noise] well yeah for farm organization that's not really what what we do but you know I I remember two years ago sitting at a brass could department insurance office ... what can we do to help these farmers and ranchers and they said well we have this really straight a provision that would allow discretionary groups be formed and associations\nMy eyes lit up and from then on we went for the\nStaying together and you know ... what should be different you know three thousand farmers and ranchers in that group or three thousand workers at a manufacturing company they get a good product but the three thousand farmers and ranchers do that's why we want to get them in a large group\nYeah could uh give them a chance to to have some time that they can afford how as you're putting it together what what was the biggest challenge of trying to get this whole thing a up and run it\nThere's just a lot of regulatory and legal hurdles to get it up and running the main hurdle is you've got to these association health plans have to stay comply with the U.S department of labor ... laws\nAnd and I know that's kind of complicated but the risk of runs all your benefits that are offered through an employer plans\nIn any way to stay in compliance with that there's a lot of legal documents and in a lot of structure that had to be set up in order to make the association health plan legal and compliant for the long term [noise]\nDo you feel like it's a ultimately going to lead to something that's more affordable hay and has led to something that's more affordable and is going to make a difference you feel good about it\nYeah we we think so I think are going on average farmers and ranchers stand to save about twenty five percent on their health insurance\nPremiums this year if they if they joined association health plan uh from from what was compared to on the normal federal market\nPlace exchanges we think uh we we partner with a carrier medical but we think once met a guy gets several years of experience in history underneath their belt that those prices will come down even further\nNo wow great what's been the reaction what ... what our farm families in and raise families telling you guys\n[noise] first one first day out of the gate and on a Roman on October ... we had a farm family going\nAnd their health insurance premiums went from twenty four thousand to Seventeen thousand they say seven thousand dollars you know so that's that's you know a lot of joy for people that qualify but but there are qualification standards and so you know you got to be a Farm Bureau Nebraska Farm Bureau member\nOf it should be you have to show that you're a farmer rancher agribusiness because you have to be in a same wind business with association health plans\nOkay have other foreign bureaus from around the country are seeing what you're doing it are they asking you questions\n[noise] yeah we uh I I suppose about a half dozen to ten foreign bureaus have talked to us here in Nebraska Farm Bureau and tried to get information how we put this together there's a lot of\nA foreign bureaus and agriculture groups in general just trying to work on solution to the options in and of course this is why there's other ones out there as well so you know\nI'm now some of the the issues with a pre existing conditions and covers like that and being complying with the uh ... how how is all that working for you guys\nWell that that that was part of our regulatory hurdles because we wanted to stay complying with the Affordable CARE Act it and\nThen so we regard lists of their status of health if they have pre existing conditions or not we accept them into this group and so that that was a pretty big deal for us because we want to make sure this association health plans days there for the long term and so\nI'm so that that's how we kind of went through we with the idea of taking pre existing conditions\nNow can folks that are not in Nebraska be on this plan or no\n[noise] no it's just a for just for ... within the state of Nebraska yeah\nAll right All right interesting well so it sounds like you guys are often run in you're in a Roman now what do you what's your what's your goal here what are you hoping to to accomplish you know five years down the road\nWell server farm and ranch and members and lower the cost of health insurance and a and hopefully provider you know better network of coverage for farmers or ranchers on healthcare hopefully we get a you know three to five thousand members into this group the larger the group is the more\nRisk it's they're stable is so you can price at lower [noise] so I I just hope it grows or do we help cut the cost of health care for farmers and ranchers\nThank you so much for sharing the story and what you guys are doing I think it's important work I think you're right it is one of the biggest challenges that are our producers are facing a in their home lives uh it's uh we we know it's a big stressors so thank you for your work thanks for sure\nAnd just that uh our producers are facing a in their home lives\nUh it's uh we we know it's a big stressor so thank you for your work thanks for sharing the idea of hopefully this catches on\nA and we can continue to see this spread around the country because you know I think if we can sort some of this health industry out we can figure out a way to provide this affordably to are are farmers and ranchers out there we can make a big difference alright stick with us more advertising coming up and just a matter of fact dropped\nIts digging deeper with the mostly a company the show where to draw tummy experts take your questions about proper nutrition bureau your host ... will folk and Ross spender senior uh dramas from the most of the company [noise] Hi this is\nYeah and you do as well Oakland he lost a job with that and your pod cast and I'm On a day and ah yeah as we travel the country I'm In you and I've done a number of uh beaches for us pharma ... well when you\nWhen you get a day or two to be in an area and you just settle in there and talk to people you know maybe a cover in an auction maybe you're filming a segment whatever but invariably someone will say well you know you should go talk to bill\nBill\nAnd they'll say well built it and the cool part is I think this is part of our Midwest nature is that we don't want\nYou know farmers don't like to blow their own horn basically writers don't it's just [noise] so then one over the years is innovation just bubbles up from a ... people in wanting a better way and farmers are basically you know\nEngineers at heart and uh so yeah mark and his cousin Ralph there they just\nHad a vision and went for it and then it's interesting so people were saying wow that's a revolutionary machine why did that make it to market\nBack in the day now if you look in this case a and I think people can understand the amount of cash and investment that it would take you know to even think about ramping up production um so I Believe what happened is that\nThe they got to a point in the mid nineties and I think testing was going very well I feel testing on their XP are too\nAnd at the time than a Seventeen patents were sold to John Deere and you know that's not a common here as bottle out of certain allergies over the years sometimes to\nJump right in the push forward other times to maybe\nYou know protect market or whatever which holds valid business play sure but anyway this this thing up for sale today open market and we'll we'll see what do you know what it's worth and where it's headed to just be great fun\nThen you've got a couple of other things a video wise that you're going to be a putting up but this week then there are of interest especially from folks down in the south\nYeah we had our machine the crew down at the sun belt expo a couple of weeks back in Moultrie, Georgia\nClinton we we filmed some feature videos from some of these others they're slowly getting those out this week and really find like you said hopper on different parts of the country\nUm you know to talk to dealers farmers and also manufacturers ... see

any other options that you're watching this week that or maybe you're of note\nWill there [noise] I tell you there's there's a couple of coming up on the number in\nWhich I Believe is Saturday on my

go to the to the show we need to check up news a lot going on and for that we have Clinton Griffiths ... act day Clinton how you doing on this Monday I'm\nDoing pretty good you know maybe a chips or

Know it to be a first time\nGrandpa are well let's get to this so what happened in markets today we futures closing mixed\nToday that's after we overnight games are over the week\nUh the strong export story and we continue to you just purchased four hundred and Seventy thousand metric tons of weed on friday\nSixty of that was us soft read when are we now this is an important sale because Egypt has not been a buyer of us we recent years and it might be signals signals more demand on the rise and for American supplies and the next six months\nAnd ... and I said wait features we're mostly higher today December wheat futures close two and a quarter higher on the day five seven and a quarter December Kansas City we end of the day one and a half higher at five oh one and a half and December Minneapolis we closed one and a half a lower at five Seventy six and a quarter\nAnd last time I talk to you you had high hopes for your yields you said things were coming out in the field nicely detailed our near record was that the case when all is said and done this year\nYeah being ... ah we're definitely a record or buy a fair amount and I'm going to say uh you know a by five or six Bush will at least a overall across all for 'em and then\nA corn yields we're pretty similar to twenty four chain uh which was the best that we we've had a when it was all said and done we're actually within a bookstore so so we pretty darn unfortunate uh on both ah both cases\nWell and I know that's not the case for all only farmers all last week as a steep pit stake in northern Illinois and hit us we're a little off from last year they had a great start planting but just had\nAbout four weeks or or I should say like a month of of a dry weather that to happen to us and and chip you're closer to that Peoria area Arnie combine running this week course harvest pretty much wrapped up in your neck of the woods to\nI Would say it's pretty much wrapped up there are a few fields of corn left and some beans but I'd say we're a Ninety five percent here you got to work pretty hard to to find a feel we've had some pretty good being running whether\nUh you know the last five six days here chance of rain tomorrow night but from all the purposes we are wrapped up but uh there's there's a few fields here or there if you look hard\nTipped let's say in in in forty minutes when we see the new a progress report out from USDA let's say we do see a nice jumped and harvest progress do you think that that puts pressure on prices heading into trade on Tuesday\n[noise] uh actually I Do I think it's the opposite so once we historically get passed about two thirds complete you know sixty five Seventy percent complete\nUm you know the the focus kind of seems to shift to what's out ahead of us in and that's not to mean that the last twenty twenty five percent thirty percent of the crop won't cause a little harvest pressure but I think the higher that number is the more we kind of look ahead and say All right the bulk of the harvest pressures behind is\nNot what do we have ahead of us and that is going to be the November crop report\nUm you know or import costs in acreage coming in the winter and kind of setting up for that final January a number here ah were speeding into it as as hard as that is to believe were will be there before you know it on the January crop report\nRight Matt do you agree with all of that as far as the tone heading into tomorrow's trade\nYeah I think you know for the most part the last week this End Days or the the trade\nOr you know people caught up or no question that a lot better run in whether a west of Mississippi and then some of the areas that are running behind and so a trade pretty much digested that spin off the ground is specially guards the soybeans and so a chip said you know you get past that\nTwo thirds mark and typically seal uh some things happen whether it'd be with futures a little bit of a a you know supportive of factor even with basis you know we've seen basis in our area affirmed substantially uh in in a lot of that I Believe is a\nRecourse to do to because you know the harvest was coming towards him in trying to buy some of those last few bushels and you know word on the street is some of the processors or maybe didn't handle quite as much as what they thought they were going to of course there's a lot of folks trying to figure out every creative way they could to store Bush is on the floor and the sheer\nWell let's put a little bit to beans I Know you know really looking at the the fundamentals of beans that suggested a potential sell off but you know headlines that hit\nLater today on out just about an hour I'd go say that the U.S plans more ... Trump She meeting fail saying that the U.S is preparing to announce by early December terrorists on all remaining Chinese imports if talks\nTalks next week between the both presidents go south and that we don't see some progress made\nChip I mean just when we think may be maybe we'll make some headway here then if we don't it looks like all remaining terrorists that we were helping did not come into play now will do you think this is enough to break this lady market even further than we've seen\n[noise] um I Do a a filming that there is no progress made or anything positive are supportive of comes from that ah that gee twenty meeting I'm here about a month from now I'm you know beans have been the weak link they were reluctant to rally um friday when ah when Cornyn we put the big rally in\nI think beans or the weak link going forward and what is going to hold corn back\nA from a potentially nice harvest bounce here so I I ... I'm afraid and have been for a while but the the beans are the weak link care it just seems like um you know but without being fed\nThat's kind of a last gasp by saying you know ... everything every dollar that ah that comes in here then there's nothing left other than waiting for a some sort of a of a resolution on it and and that could take quite a while\nBut do you think Matt tomorrow as we head into two day knowing that all the barest fundamentals that are weighing on sleeping already and then you see a headline like dead what do you how do you think the trade reacts going into Tuesday\nI find it interesting and that you know overnight we had a little bit of a a friendly reaction to hearing about this ball so narrow guy getting elected with the next president or for Brazil being a you know around in the runoff\n... and then all of a sudden we come in here and and as you're suggesting we're talking about additional tariffs and trying to be honest I feel like\nA it's just not something that's going to surprise anybody I don't know that anybody or in around the ... is to look at it kind of roll their eyes and say you know a big deal I mean how much more can we heard\nA Chinese purchases from a centrally nothing here or are we having hardly shipped him anything a couple of car goes a\nBottom line in my opinion is is that uh this days of the game you're trying to figure out a\nA who's going to pick up the business if anybody and then I don't know that you're going to hurt at a whole lot more with a with a newsflash like that I think it's a little bit of preemptive\nUh I think your past the elections whenever they meet as far as the system is concerned and who knows what could happen at this stage of the game we may have a little bit different political climate in our president and quite frankly might have a little bit different tone\n[noise] yeah and an end chip let's digest some of that news that Matt talked about a Brazil electing a new president over the weekend\nAnd the former former army captain wants to privatize state companies or wants to look at gun ownership and there was really and you know has a lot of talk and has put a lot of momentum behind Brazil's farm belt\nAnd it's a dramatic shift to the right in the world's largest democracy president Donald Trump tweeting out today had a very good conversation with a newly elected president of Brazil we agreed that Brazil and the United states will work closely together on trade military and everything else excellent called wishing congrats\nYou know there was a lot of fear heading into this election but it seems like maybe if we can can work together and make some progress that maybe it's something positive for our mark\nYou know there was a lot of fear heading into this election but it seems like maybe if we can can work together and make some progress that maybe it's something positive for our market nonetheless they'll ship it can have a long term impact on on soybeans on our meet this far supplies go if this president had more support for the farm belt in Brazil\nYeah absolutely and and everything and read it seems like he's very pro business pro growth\nA pro bag and you know big picture that's been the trend already is um you know Brazil kind of cutting into\nOur exports particularly with this trade war the turf situation\nOr their um you know doing a lot behind the scenes they have for years and they continue to work closely with China\nAnd um so I don't see that changing at all um you know I think it's a good thing that they're they apparently are going to have some stability and maybe I'm you know a little better run there in Brazil with this government but um I don't know if it helps our act markets out if anything maybe it just continues on the path\nOf them working or even closer with China or as they have been kind of cutting some business out from underneath us\nRight pro business or in a sense that you know we've seen president Donald Trump pro business and initially the reaction from farmers very positive you know what if we get the same reaction down there what if we see more acreage you know since they says he is pro business what if it supports more acreage in in Brazil it seems like it would have long term implications\nOn a mat yeah I mean it seems to me that the trend that we've been going towards the last three or four years May of mitigated that somewhat with the price of soybeans would create and I think we've been going towards is Brazil are producing more soybeans and the long run than what the us is that us\nOf being more record producer I really feel that that's a you know people say well a U.S former loves to play or corn or an absolutely that's the case but it's been\nFor producers to shy away\nOr you know for playing soy beans with the colonel profitability we've seen here the last few years this this year you know we we have this subsidy in place maybe we're going to get sick and pain is kind of sounds like there was a decent chance your choices are probably going to be more profitable for a good deal producers here now twenty Eighteen once again\nBut boy when we started looking at some of the budget for twenty Nineteen I think that things start to look a little bit different so you know I think the long term implications though [noise]\nAren't mountains and harvest in Moore alright ... Bennett chip now in her on the show we're much more to talk about they're going to join me we need to take a quick break and then we'll have to talk right here on TALK after the mouth [noise]\nMy the first\nOne is your son\nHe's my section on mortgage will make it look people bringing ... view\nBut as you back up a step and talk about when we were just talking about and being side you know that's not necessarily great for world meal demand and and the and protein consumption either they're into liquidation mode there so\nYou know mixed bag definitely supportive for for hogs going forward um I think that um you know the winds that are back a little bit we should be passed the biggest supply there\nAnd as we get into winter um you know I think we probably would have had a nice rebound any way and if you are out on some of this wind fever issue it's just going to add this and buying interest and and some speculative frenzy there to the upside as well\nSo you think this momentum can't continue using the green on the board for a lean hard that we could see much more of that in the coming months\n[noise] um well you have to define much more I Do think you probably have to rally a little bit here and we won't go straight up I'm not saying you're into this massive a straight up\nA moon shot bull market here but I think um you know there weren't enough trend the brakes will be bought and then we've got further upside hum and probably haven't seen the highs yet and it probably won't until we get deeper into winter\nAnd possibly even next summer but at least the short run I think you you know between now and maybe February we we definitely a at least I Would expect you have one more upside and haven't seen the highs yet\nYeah some welcome news for hot producers but what about on the cattle side Matt I'm you know what is it going to take it dried these cattle prices higher\n[noise] well I mean I look at this and cattle market uh you know lived or February trade in ah right at one twenty three uh you know a weeks ago we would have liked to have seen this type of price action ah got nice carrying the market\nWithout an inverted market for so long and it really but the producer a tough situation or to go\nIn this type of price action ah got nice carrying the market without an inverted market for so long and it really but the producer a tough situation or\nTo go out and bet on the come for quite some time\nUh but the problem is you know for buying feeders right now if we look too much farther out like out in August we're back down to one third team so yeah I think that the police are still a little bit wary still a little bit\nA still a little bit frustrated but I Do think there's a fair amount of money to be made for anybody that's within a four to five months of or or even six months of ah going terminal and so I kind of like a\nWhat I'm seeing as far as the cattle markets concerns kind of tough to buy feeders the uh right now in my opinion and part of that because you're seeing the low one twenties on back on the market\nYet chip do you agree with that yeah absolutely I think the cattle market or as Britain kind of a shining star we've got through a you know what eight or nine of record\nCattle and feed reports I'm a ... in a row and the market held together when finally here a couple of weeks ago we got a friendly one that was below expectations um so yeah I think that the like the like the hot market\nCattle have some upside here into winter again not straight up but I think it's it's holding together and ah you know cheaper feed costs are translating to some pretty good turns here for the cattle feeder\nWell throughout their marketing discussion with both of you know what the silver lining when it comes to green to the point you know we've we've we've talked a lot about the pressure prices we've seen a lot of the fundamentals working against us soybeans you know what is the silver lining in all of that\nWell you got to think that the the weak market and the corn market it's got a chance to have a uh some decent days ahead of us I think that the being marketed as chip suggested earlier is gonna be a bit of a drag\nOn it but I think we'll we'll never looked at for instance the corn markets carry a\nLot of folks are thinking we could get down under one point seven five well that's actually a pretty friendly compared to what we've looked at the last few years the big problem is the prices are where they're at\nA bit of what that does is is that does suggest you're gonna have decent weather or even if you do increase acreage is most people assume we're going to see and so whenever I look at both worlds and us to carry out situation to corn market I think that that's a pretty good silver lining in my opinion\nChip what are you watching in the next few weeks heading into the next USDA report\nYeah I think obviously I'm Courtney old saying and I'm a ... to a lesser extent be meals are so I I think that as Matt mentioned earlier this late harvest in a in a severe amount of rain and many areas poor stock quality a lot of wind here the last couple of weeks\nHas taken the top side off of a Cornell but still it felt all along had been too high on the Illinois state you we could probably come down a little bit there\nAnd as it turns out because of those late harvest issues and rain I think they're too high in Iowa\nSo I think you could see cornfields come down a little bit\nOf beans I'm not so sure again um you know I I I don't know they're I think hopefully we've seen the the highest I think we eat more wheat production is going to be important as well so as a map mentioned um you know I think the bright spot here is the feed grains corn and wheat\nOr in particular and beans will be a little bit of a headwind against both those markets\nAnd yeah and in isn't it amazing we keep talking about the bright stopped being weak\nIn a while but yet we market can't get up and and get going just yet but I think you're starting to turn the corner especially with this um reduction out of the Australian wheat crop here at the end of last week um we know there's problems in Europe and Russia and Ukraine so uh I I think we\nCould be you know shining star here the next few months\nYou know we could be the shining star helping corn that that could drag down [noise]\nAbsolutely [noise]

and takes the rest of the Denver team into the end zone you liked that one\nGet back in back in the swing of things that the next series and kind of get going but\nUm and then it was below momentum as we as we went on there\nAnd we wish ourselves on the flip those first replies so that the guys you know listen to this group here they love to play and they they they didn't give up hope or anything I was thinking All right we'll fix it we got to take care of us go and and they just moved on and so it was good in our defense did a great job of stopping them early and then that that was a positive too\nI just love the tongue and his team and the way it just continues to increase his team is one of the tougher I think in a recent history but the other thing I see in these geysers and selfishness well let me ask you about Sammy walking yesterday\nA and Sam each day people forget the defensive pass interference on players I was looking at it today are like eleven or twelve on second in Nineteen but Sam each day yesterday and the impact place that he was able to make\nYeah Sammy uh he played very well yesterday and quarterback or give them a whole lot of opportunities to do so and and you know that that's everybody everybody working at but but I'll tell you when when Sammy gets at the ball in his hands he's like a a running back and he is going to punish you\nUm and try to beat you up a on the way to that end zone so um but I was proud of him on how we you know how he handled things he he works hard and for all the things he's gone through\nUm in his young career here it's a great to have um my great great to see him have a day like yet\nAnd then the art of route running his double move near the end of the house for a touchdown just how good is he at the precision that you demand in his office are running around\nWell that was a that was a great movie came in and gave the linebacker little stutter step and then beat them across his face and\nThe nice part about that was the uh both Patrick and\nSam it worked on that during the week and they knew how important it was just to get on the ball right when he cleared the guy after the double move and then he can catch it and get himself up field and Patrick Head a little pressure I mean it was one it was one of his better throws actually it was it was a short one\nThat was one of his better throws the other guy right in his face and he kind of side arm that to Sammy right out of the break\nI couldn't brought up any better than that and then Sammy Sammy caught it and got himself in the end of\nThe other thing that I Love about this team is is an selfishness\nI've seen Sammy block his rear end off on those bubbles or bullet screens you run an entire week is going to be hearing a little bit and she does come and here's the block to allow same either score his second touchdown what about what you've seen in guys accepting roles and how we how can those rules change\nNot only week to week but maybe half the half or series the series\nWell they challenge each other on that I I Know when we were uh you know when the time was where we can talk to him I go and you're pretty good receiver and he goes have you seen my blocks and blocks to\nI went wow that's unusual I had a lot of receivers say that but when you looked at his tape or you could see that he was a heck of a block or and really fearless in that area\nAnd you haven't had a lot of receivers say that but when you looked at his tape or you could see that he was a heck of a block or and really fearless in that area\nAnd so he comes here and and now these guys challenge each other on who's going to make the the best block they're making the catch is but then they they put they put on the thing and they challenge each other on these blocks and so they got a little competition going there\nNow we're going to talking about the play fourth down in one maybe a little less than one and you show them you influence them with the spread option you actually rented earlier the game and then the shovel pastor Kareem on\nAnd love it when you look at that sheet and you come up with a really good stuff but what about the counter measure play and then the ability to finish in your office of line which you had to have guy step up that hadn't been in those roles before to complete that play into it so well\nYeah well ... they they work those things out and they\nCome up with these crazy deals and and that was that was a good one or take a little toss the tire IQ and then uh we got into the shovel action there and and um Patrick's pretty nasty with a ball handling on that then\nYou give it to to seven or you're you're you're going to get punished by China dot com or he's going to go now up and over again and get themselves in the end zone and it was neat to see those three Lyman kind of come around them and Sammy everybody was really excited about it and\nThey help kind of push 'em in as he dragged people and so it was a that was a that was fun to watch though\nAnd when you get that done to make it play like that it's time to\nA hammer down\n[noise] big time and speaking of the hammer de Ford um we're gonna play the highlight later in the show but Patrick throws the interception but now for a second time that I can remember the season you immediately get the ball back\nWhat about the Ford or and what he was able to do to get the ball out and come off the edge to get to ...\nYou know it's fun watching day I mean he's a really put together a good season to this point is great to have I'm healthy and I know that's how he feels he's worked so hard to get to this point and that's what the people don't don't have a chance to see I get to see it\nIsn't that training room sweating like crazy rehab and getting himself right and\nSo now he's out producing and into a nice job of that so I I was happy to see 'em have that success and the success and he's having a season and will continue to have\nYou see the knock down in the ... and the fact that is from deep forward and the rest of his defensive teammates and then the game situation the fact that that the parents handled three different possessions when Denver had a thirty twenty deficit but could have cut into the lead each of those three times\nI call them the whim defence when it matters most but just the ability for these guys to rise seemingly at the most important times\nYeah that's a that's a good quality to have 'em and then\nI think just some more you see these guys play together the better the communication the better they do and I think they'll continue and then\nUh hopefully we're able to bring some more guys back into the mix now you have all these guys that have had a chance to play that normally wouldn't have a chance and you got to really have a nice thing going for you so uh but it's important that they keep pushing like they're pushing I mean they get out of practice and they challenged every snap and\nAnd you got to keep that that same attitude and support on both sides of all do that but\nEven more so on the defensive side there's just a certain certain ... attitude that that comes with a plan on the defense or\nAnother impressive play Kendall forward doesn't bite on the fleet liquor try and makes an athletic interception one of the best defensive plays in the leagues so far this year I Want to ask you though about guys who study you put a lot on their plate\nBut then when they take the homework home basically or for a guy like Kendall polar\nAnd just their ability to study see tendencies are studying Cleveland now what are they what are they find in your two decades as a head coach in his league and even longer than that as an assistant uh what do you see as far as uh guys who were ability to study and then translate that to the field\nYeah also important is it yeah if you want to be a a one of the top teams in the league and it's just not what happens in the building here [noise] you've got to be able to take it and uh take it home and review it\nUm before you go to bed and make sure that you've got it in there so when you come in the next day you can add another load or to it for the next\nUm situation that chance so for instance you\nOne day you might have the base of offense and defense go in and special teams the next day go on short yard engine third down and then the next day you have red zone and so these are all different installs at the players have different plays and so they\nThey've gotta they've gotta take that home and review whatever was put in that day and then by the time you get the Sunday they've put in their hours and then they can go play once they have a damn mentally then you're not worried about it you're not thinking through everything and you can let you two athletic ability show and you go out and then you play the game\nAnd final question has to deal with districts opponent the Cleveland Browns a strange day to day a Cleveland made some moves and fired head coach Hugh Jackson enough as a coordinator Todd hey like I mean how does that affect you getting ready for this game or does it at all and end or just kind of a weird circumstances you get ready to play a Cleveland team\nPeople Cleveland is number one and the league and give away take away they've been outstanding this year in that regard your thoughts on that scenario\nYeah or you and their their defense is run by a Kansas City guy so um but you hate seeing [noise] excuse me hate seeing or anybody get fired in this league I mean you don't like to see that happen I'm On the other hand at this point in the year you\nHave to put that aside and you know you're playing a good Cleveland team I mean they have these uh parts of their game that are very very good that they do and\nAnd so you you go through the process that's what your bank on and I know I say that every week but no more important than it is this week you get in and you make sure you're doing the right things and spending the time to understand what the opponents doing what we're doing ... to\nAttack them and so if you do that the right way then you don't care about all the other stuff all the perfect meal stuff doesn't mean anything you you just focusing on the job at hand\nOr whatever whatever uh whatever man I can\nDo whatever man so I'm trying to think my games in the next level\nSee I'm going to defend your throwing ability cause I think we need to dial that play up again and then you know\nI'm just saying I'm a South Dakota Marie and get back to you I Know [noise] just\nWait for the right time okay mixers in a good mood but here's\nWhat's also about you guys because you made that block per se me to get him into the end zone I seen him do that for you right on those bubbles screens with those bullet passes right or just the fact you Rob I may throw everybody in his calmly or what you guys do for each other and how close you've come and how this works because you're willing to accept different rules\nI mean we just love playing the game on we love compete you know obviously I'm we want to go out and like I'm trying to score um every time that we are on just about so I feel like\nI'm within our group um we said personal goes to like each uh each week um I Will go wants to score like for touchdowns are are like have like five hundred yards receiving I Know that sounds crazy but\nI mean we try to do it man I mean we feel like um [noise] we feel like\nWe got the women who got me Sam increased the Rob uh we got we got that I mean we've got a lot of play maybe so I feel like each and every week like we can go out and like prove that you know um we can be the best the best uh young was even going out in the lead so\nHow many weapons is [noise]\nYou've been around the block enough to know now though that this league is every week right so this is a week now a lot of stuff's been happening today in Cleveland mhm but your ability and your leadership to try to get these two guys prepare every week to keep the train rolling\nRight uh well\nEvery week or every week\nEvery week for a messy every week for a\nUs is like I said well we you know like we don't go into it um prepare you know what I'm saying take care of our bodies you know what I'm saying to take care of my mind I was so I just come out with a dog you know and like I said we've got great leaders in and pat\nI'm Travis meets a fish you know what I'm saying I'm with a hip and all of us with that you know 'cause we all young\nYou know what I'm saying like we want to have fun and all of that but we got great leaders you know what I'm saying to keep our minds right I mean along the path so\nLike I said I'm very excited to be a part of this journey man's going to be crazy it's exciting\nTo have you on this journey and now speak Patrick homes you give me some [noise]\n[noise]\nUsually I I'm an ... you got to show us the stance I Know my ... let's say [noise]\nI like those that they bring\nA fresh very fresh I got the mentioned shoes too though but I went there\nBut that's way way fresh village so over several shorts to give me some\nUh [laughter] yeah we don't want to ruin it uh\nBut the other thing I've seen you do\nSince you first showed up here is just continue to work at your game it would be easy to say right I'm here I'm good I'm One of the leading players when the league the menu are not satisfied if you worked on route running hundreds what have you learned about big\nPrecise in asleep well I feel like you know what I'm saying I Love the game you know what I'm saying that's obviously why I play the game so I feel like I Want to be the best you know what I mean I look I got like Sonia brown I'm Stefan nice guys I'm Guy the\nGuys who were drafted in like the fifth
