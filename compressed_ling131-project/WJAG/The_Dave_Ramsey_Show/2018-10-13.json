real easy um\nYou might if there's a whole bunch of it I you know are a whole bunch of pine needles that is a problem especially if you have like a real steep roof and the saddle which I have and I've got this one section I Do almost have to take it out all the time\nUm so I so I don't really know I I you know I mean it has a potential if it's fine and it's sticking in laying on the roof it may lay on that brush\nAnd if it lays on that brushing gets tangled ... she was leaves and stuff to win cleans it out\nYou know I don't I don't know if it'll do with that\nI doubt it but um I don't know it said it was a time when you're worried about that but I mean ... years old now and you are going to be difficult to get up there and you kind of staff not up to any more so I just wondered um before I commit to it if maybe I should uh\nWell how big of a gun or do you have their Roger\nI've got five inch gutter came\nAnd it goes showing all four sides of the house okay\nUm is there a certain area of links where there would be more than anything else because they have us they have a sample pack and I think it's just like six feet long\nUm but maybe you just want to try and one gutter and just

that's really what I Need you know yeah the case\nIt's relatively inexpensive for what you're trying to do versus helmets\nAnd it's a hundred percent guaranteed\nAnd I may not give it a try I mean you can you really can't lose maybe a little bit of time\nOkay I'll give it a shot All right good enough Roger thing\nBy care but by yeah yeah\nThat real find stuff can be tough I mean even they say maybe

Hayes on top of the surface which will come out with you know react the sealer using half its own but\nThat you know paying to do it that way so I always suggests do like a three foot section but to see their on their way to Terry cloth working at the stone slipped a cloth over buff till dry moved to the next section kind of go down to counter tops outweigh\nAnd folks that really are like me and all about easy you know new granted gold is making a a three step process even easier yeah you guys got a lot of white so\n[noise] yeah you know when we talked about the the cleaning shy of trying to make things more convenient easier um we didn't launch this is kind of a first for the industry is a we have three different wipes we have clear and the first and only see the ripe for stone countertops him to see the waves are great cars\nPull out of out of the er at a pouch wiper kind of top down buffet dry with a paper towel her claws them you're done and it's actually the most cost effective way to seal your countertop so a pack a sealer will range anywhere from nine Ninety nine to fourteen Ninety nine so\nTo counter tops for ten fifty dollars is heard of it in the industry and that ...\nPolish is\nSo we have three separate white so we have one for cleaning one procedurally anyway even have a polish flight\nYeah there you go [laughter]\nYeah it is I mean maybe it'd be easy

you don't need to seal it because the absorption rate is so low uh but you still need to clean it still can polish it um you also you don't want to use a any\nHarsh chemicals cause it's still Ninety percent natural materials so we actually just launched court spray of course ... is a two and one clear and polish where your core it's counter tops and it specifically made for courts\nBecause it's so dense in doesn't absorb so we have to work with a formula to make it or didn't streak on court said it was\nExcellent so here's another question I have an ... if you don't mind maybe they can hold

for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you pledged your house for that line of credit\nUm and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a show a is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that\nWe try to take the other way we went to to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one once you get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of debt because when you don't have any payment you know what you have money\nThe bar or a slave to the lender so now we don't recommend home equity\nAnd bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit you use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point is going to give me trouble\nSo the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is\nThe more the miles would affect it\nIn other words a hundred thousand miles dodged neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point\nI don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built that say a higher in nicer vehicle or they're typically well built I mean ... again Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products for building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that\nAh it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we kind of depends on your budget and how nice of car you want obviously the least miles or the last year's car I bought was a raptor at at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or now got they got about fifty something\nOn it and um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day and um\nSo you know you just you're looking at your situation and to\nWhat is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nBecause I'm just I'm just really don't care because I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nHey look off Sherman what's up\nI'm Seventeen years on high cocaine yeah I've got about three thousand dollars and then in the camp out donating shut eye on that and I knew what China than\nThe community college with a pilot program and St Louis and set the olive tree okay\nSo you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service the five of the Caribbean I keep them at the community colleges to either find the right out in the dark horse yeah\nI Will be true if you get some search some certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that\nSo that's what you want to do you won't be programmer you want to be an hour or whatever Mm\nUh and the community college is paid for\nAs long as you keep an eye plus yeah um\nYou can invest it\nAh here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to pin a nine point nine\nFinished college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money\nTo finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and has a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know may I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account to stage\nA with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree in your field of study\nWhether it's a two year whether it's certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream without any of that\nAnd that three thousand dollar spin on that is more important than ... and the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out\nAnd use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise] if you need to\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago and Mike how are you\nI'm Gray Davis an honor to speak with you you too sure what's up in your world\nFilm my wife and I are currently on baby step forward if they can prepare for retirement and we're using the access and our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take home pay our dilemma is when we have an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that and I'd prevent that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from August coloration so when we save the thick or than we're able to save a lot for a mortgage to tolerate [laughter] so is it okay to do that or am I recommend taking their twenty four\nPercent now they they mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you vested in that is that uh uh you choosing an investment for that or is a pension\nAt the end and there's no options yeah it's it's mandatory it's a pension and you don't have control of it\nRight and when you leave you can't take it with you\nCorrect that the weight on sixty seven uh\nUh and it's nine percent\nOkay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct guy I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly run state and\nAnd those guys [laughter] huh yea no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we can do it as a for then that means we need to put it in ten percent\nYou got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some odd but I mean likelihood as we're not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that so a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and goes round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but you know I was a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nYou know go do it\nThat that's what that's what I Would do about it off a little bit\nAppreciate your joining us you know it's just that I Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big John extraordinary things start from\nOrdinary things that may start from changing the ordinary habits in your day to day life you see changing these habits is the foundation of our teachings after smart conferences and I'm excited to announce this fall and winter we're headed your way at this event we are going to hear from America's most sought after experts on the topics of marriage\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team in his own as to if you can come together and really get on board it can happen you know with with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of that\nBudget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWell that's true but generally drew\nOkay soil I also think that they need to focus on why they're doing it and to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nMy reason why might not be the exact same reason it hits why but the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward ...\nOkay cool what was your why\nRight here I I I like um kids and your family tree I just the legacy I I'm listening to a lot of your staff and a lot of other um had cats on legacy in relieving behind and I think that um if we want to see change like we have to act eating at\nModeling it in teaching it yeah I Am change your family tree that's a big reason people will do stuff to change the direction of their family that they would never do for themselves\nAnd it it's a bigger and more noble why\nThan just a I Want to go on vacation someday you know what you if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else but in the process of doing that you do change the trajectory of your family tree\nSo very well done good you guys very cool very cool or do you have a lot of cheerleaders along lawyer for some people that kind of went yay you be more nuts\nYou know we have a we had some and we had some of the flip side right I'm you're going to have someone who tried to play down but you know I think the one thing we had some good mentors that were local that we are definitely coaching us on keeping us going not only through our you know scenario but also helping us leader he is so ...\n... ... when he came home that first time and said uh we just bought this car it's killing me and listen to this podcast I Want to do something different where you resist under judicial I Will finally you woke up\n[laughter] I Know I had a pet in my stomach when we bought a car now and so and like and traditionally I knew that was not the right choice but we kind of felt that pull that we needed to do it\nOr he played your pod cast on a date night\n[laughter] that is so ...
