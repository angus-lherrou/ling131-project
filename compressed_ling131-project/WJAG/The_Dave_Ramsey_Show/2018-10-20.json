I got to lay off as a different conversation and then I have a big pile of debt and no money and I got laid off it's a different different rule while all the way to go you guys were proud of you congratulations very very well on got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your story\nFor you guys to be millionaires and you are on your way without a doubt you know how to do it now that you know how to make this stuff called money behave\nAnd you've learned it at a very young age and very young in your marriage to learn it and a lot of people go twenty Thirty years and they're still fighting about money all the time and you've got the advantage of being the head of the curve on their way to go guys or rock stars things\nDone Cody and face Waco, Texas Ninety thousand dollars paid off\nIn Seventeen months making thirty one thirty than thirty you heard the story I Love and counted down let's hear a debt free scream three two one\n[noise]\nWell done well done I question that goes from ... dot com find out for yourself\nWhy ... is the number one online retailer of custom window covering you get free samples free shipping\nAnd with a new promos that they run every month you'll save even more use the promo code Ramsey to get the best deals rules and restrictions apply\nToday's question comes from Christian in Florida they took out a lease on a vehicle about four months ago before enrolling in financial ... feel like I made one of the worst mistake some a lot of [laughter] I was wondering\nIf you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return Elise car to the dealership\nOr at this point do just keep the vehicle or none of the above we take her car back that you own money on our signed a lease on that's effectively a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb\nBecause they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and the other and on repossession watch and then they're going to sue you for the difference\nIf you don't pay them the difference immediately and you don't have the different she goes you're broke I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car fleece company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off I'm Alone when it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time so the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that what it's what strikes by the car off\nAnd get the title in your hand\nThen you compare that to\nKB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worse and I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand\nAnd then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars on the whole probably not far off of what you're going to find ... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car\nFor sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars to be able to cover the whole that you're in the amount that you are upside down in the way you would do that is obviously alone\nAnd so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car for as much as you can possibly get for it which is more than they will show at four in the report lot\nSo his bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the difference is greater\nAnd you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession and so\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are so um they told you to borrow money no diver and she's telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the doubt by doing that\nAnd so you borrow and cover\nThe amount that you're upside down you know guys we've been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and why it's so important to be intentional even with the little things there is one thing you can do right now\nTo take care of the little things before they become
