Packers are I'm sure I'm I'm I'm okay um so if it was\nWhat I Do is I'm sure\nBecause it's relatively new got I got I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in as a budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand or the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's\nThree thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA\nA whatever a line in your budget\nFor medical expense ongoing chronic medical when just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up\nAnd leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something now yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so so much for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching I don't like the where I can make that happen\nI mean my issue is is that I'm literally on like penny pinching\nI told him I see where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you either right now and what I I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem\nWhere the government that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I that\nI make I don't think a lot on the lights and social worker and because of my condition actually switched patch I had more functionality on stomach fee for service to earn as opposed to a salary position right now and then they make anywhere from Thirteen hundred ... a paycheck\nAnd I knew he had twice a month on line you back twice a month okay and you said you're living with them\nI guess I'm I'm living with a roommate I paying nine Seventy I rent it give us a lot um\nAnd I do that somehow from the town line from\nAnd what is the nature of the debt\nStudent loan Pratt is aptly credit cards are often because they can hear it I was trying to ... stick things on medical ... student loan they know that that is going to check it out there that fabric\nA total of sixty thousand\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and the food\nPantry not eating not eating out and you're paying more than half\nYour life your lights and water and your rent and your transportation so food children's clothing and transportation utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense of the necessities only the debt you've got is not necessities\nYou take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you were just fall into the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming\nYou told me that that's why you're called yeah yeah yeah I mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying great actually I've got an ongoing medical how to prepare for it you're saving coverage so now that's our short\nTerm long term okay\nWe got to get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would begin to look at a gift take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you show that you\nCan you know be\nPrepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but uh we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you've got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards is time for plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you\nI'm doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife I'm going through a baby step who right now I'm In fact we just paid off our second credit card today that we are done like credit card and move on if they don't mind\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're working the base that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding\nI don't know if we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can get later\nOn on what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of a ... of all want to get your input on a\nWe have our campers can fight it but we want to live without speaking about Clinton got up and giving back to the church and didn't have an extra five percent and kind of giving it to um\nOther charitable organizations that we believe in that are about doing day or a ... you know when the crisis mission and so we're trying to looking at trial give what we can to people who need it\nUm but then she don't have an ... strike ... percent a church and being what we do what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give to chart\nWe had a big argument about five and yesterday was\nI was on the the definition of dies the definition of the time was when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term and Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament\nIs tense it literally means chance the word means tent\nIt doesn't mean fear that doesn't mean twentieth it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to tie they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says and so what ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker a land cruiser Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you\nI Love you and um you can give are not given all still love you the best way to live your life is to to gifts\nAnd all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed does in the New Testament is a time of the tens of you're in some evangelicals are taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years that that's why this is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top before you do anything else and it goes to your local church\nSo if you want to biblical answer\nYour wife wins the argument\nThat's the biblical in most of your wife and his argument but she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nGood luck with that brother\nIn order to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nSo one Osama includes cars yes it is because the cars fifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's ah about eight thousand on mine and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income\n[noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty ... a year\nWhere did you use to mount the old job\nYeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why\nNow I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June\nJune was my first day in real estate mhm I've got to choose a house is sold the lifting didn't take any clothing bought into uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that's six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand by the end of the year\nAnd now what does your why didn't make of the ...\nMakes fifty a she made a fifty one thousand\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you used to make yes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out I'm only selling to houses that's between that long span\n'em and hurt thing is she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [laughter] [noise]\nOkay that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for poor and sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows sad\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to create if you want to be married\nWe are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just you can handle that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nWhen we're married and and it's in sickness and health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish\nAnd that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her is that we need my my truck it's for sale already have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these qualities of course we'll have\nIf I Can't get what I was asking for what you what would I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good uh what these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to is I'll get a car cash in and she sells her car and then what have at least one quarter for now\n... well I don't know I don't ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline and sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay offs and other firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming should create the income that used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are pending or clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed ... signatures\nTo enter you kind of three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today I Would sell your trial today\nAnd I but I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's if your roommates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that so uh but\nUh but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget that has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of that making about a little over a hundred but instead has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car but if you're not willing to do that as a household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble than\nShe is not willing to join armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you have a marriage problem\nOkay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit\nYou run around started selling mom was car is not what a good way to get mom on board\nAnd the same page when you back all for her car a little bit\nYour interests are selling mama's car is not what a good way to get mom on board\nBelow so let's try that other approach 'cause I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your income you're going to go\nThen you might be looking at a different career and she's going to be looking at us on our cars and you get hurricanes car to drive you drive a cheap car while we get this man is going to\nThis day Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped\nYou can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it or will they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally in forever is with timeshare exit team\nThey have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've\nAccepted thousands of timeshare owners this year alone they're the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit team is so confident in their exit service that if they don't get you out you get a full\nRefund called eight for for nine nine nine exit and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine ... or timeshare exit team dot com Dave Ramsey a news talk WG a\nGM focusing on the age that the Norfolk area shopper in November placed an ad for an apartment in automobile or egg machinery from now until the end of November your ad will reach forty five thousand homes for only four dollars and fifty cents\nOne item per add twenty words or less place you're at by calling for oh two three seven nine forty one hundred dropped by or males for oh four west north park avenue for submitted on our website Norfolk area shopper dot com advertise today was the Norfolk area shop or\nDo you feel like you were just a character and they'd be will during story at the mercy of an unreachable off\nThis week on the loose or an hour\nDr Michael stickler says your life is really a great work of nonfiction by an author truly loves his creation\nYour doctors they learned this week on the loose or an hour do the chiefs\nPre game in Lebanon this Sunday the Lutheran our will only be hurt at seven thirty AM this Sunday W.
