problem in there\nWithout without a great or\nHave one other options a little bit of a crapshoot but you know you could cut that vapor barrier is it a paper vapor barrier\nIt's paper extremely brutal yeah I'm pretty well the last oh eight and then should have called\nSo ... you know again I'm all about easy and I don't think you get yourself in trouble if you got up there and yeah I don't know like a gardening rake in just you know\nJust crushed that a paper\nWhere there would be no vapor barriers the roof is the roof vented now\nHoops are you there Mike\nI think his cell phone did die so one of the things and I keep talking Mike and maybe you can hear me\nBut uh one of the things you could do in fact we're seeing this become a little bit of a trend has we've ventilate ventilate ventilate addicts with rich man's turban vents box of band so we got good soft advantage and we're getting good air flows through that addict and we start doing that about Nineteen Seventy eight\nOne of the things we're seeing is maybe a vapor barrier isn't quite is important in that attic area as it once was not Cape Cod so challenging to make sure you get that ventilated well enough but one of the options would be I I Would think you'd be fine with this\nWould be get up there like a garden raking just destroyed that vapor brave it's real brittle probably wouldn't be hard to at all\nAnd then you know you get in a photo blown\nIn insulation on top of that\nYou wouldn't really have a ... moisture would be getting up into that addicts bought [noise] it proper ventilation was originally

like ... like God it's not\nThe kind of like a white jockey looking at not real combat but at our house\nExplain it it's still my first I I from the shared going up in that age where they sprayed it if they're going to crack down on the box and stuff like that get it to get like like if you had in your house with glass I had a ... white look at it ain't mold they're not like\nThat and get up every flight the last ... recommend anything clean and decided to pressure Russia\nA pressure was should do a great job and oxygen needed ... so do you think this was a residue from something or is it from the government and that's\nWhat my wife had to think that something like that because it I mean they're Twenty one years at the ever had that in on their okay ... and we started this year ... year maybe\nHaven't come out they they spray out that half that got a lot and you know pretty young actor you got any spraying for all around it hard to crack up and I think that's where that because\nSome of the ... ... ... ... ... where I can I can talk and how that age I guess you know when it goes to a point around and it seems like a cello right in there when I looked up and they're actually she thinks it's all that stuff that they are not going to ask but I Want to call them and ask them\nWell I think that's what you need to do because it's always difficult to tell someone had a clean something when we don't know what we're cleaning\nSo there is mold that's actually why there is actually an algae that's actually why\nCould it be a residue absolutely some of those was sprays do have a residues they have non non staying in a different uh a sprays also so I don't know what they used a good all purpose exterior cleaner\nAnd as mentioned as many times is oxygen native bleach\nThat'll do mole mildew probably it'll do a bill definitely do dirt I'm In probably remove some residue products but oxygen they bleach\nWould be um an excellent uh type products that you could use on the exterior home law the hardware stores do carry and oxygen aided bleach whether it's a masonry cleaner or whether it's a debt cleaner a lot of them are a\nA R she dated bleach basis so

invested over the past three years without penalty should we do that or should we pay off our debt and leave that money and continue contributing to their\nPrepaid plan how much is in there\nUm about eighty six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars and how much do you own your car\nWe have a ten thousand and what do you own your credit cards are five thousand okay and um\nAre you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe started at ... and that's and I realized that we did that baby steps out of order with having that Peter Pan ... pan and then I don't know what to do at this point gotcha okay and your household income as well\n[noise] [noise] um my husband ... forty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand get retake All right um no I Would not cash would stop adding to it\nUm and um\nYou do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning in financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to it you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency a no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college you know five twenty nine or an ESL and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plants here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of the increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an increased rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time\nTuition for the last Seventy years as average about seven point two percent inflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth spot mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time\nAnd so uh you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is\nA is and it's a blanket statement but and it would vary from state to state\nThe way towards college the other problem with prepaid college is\nA ... and it's a blanket statement but and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nAre very poorly run\nAnd they grew up some of the prepaid college plans in the process\nI mean they're just horrible administrators\nNow some states are well run my state happens to be well run\nSo in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a ... with the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say our road ready six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget crank your lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned to call to vacation because you're broke and you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas have Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you for ... for a a ... I was going through a piece for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ... to my question because this is a wonderful thing that's fixing to happen\nOr we were my family my parents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a tie mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money\nUh over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell\nAnd cash out or hopefully going to we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom\nAnd we want them out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly mhm\n[noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual um oil prices that sustain a drilling a and then that's the only reason west Texas is struggling run our oil prices are so far down that there's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom by you know what I mean\nBut er and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on\nYou know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue all of that to say uh I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all they get just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more\nUh oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them\nYou have to sell all of those at all or none\nNo it's not an all or none or whether you're it's it's simply\nA they're looking at a three million for all\nAnd or or you know obviously one point five perhaps\nOkay so you're just added on how one\nYeah and my biggest concern is a risk\nYeah I mean we are not oil people yeah I think I don't think I'm asking him as women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling the house\nWe're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it would I go by oil rights with it my answer would quickly be no\nMainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay\nBut that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars power in the middle kitchen type ... go by our rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nThe same reason I think you know that you wouldn't die\nAnd I was actually and that's\nThat's what I agree with his getting the family to understand the you know when we're afraid the stock market might crash\nYeah well it might but I got to start getting less rock markets less risk than drilling holes\nYeah we're a hundred percent sure that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be oh person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\n... uh no this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father and make it to say\nOh I see so is it just shut down they can make the decision for the whole thing or not\nYes All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least sell Seventy five percent of it\nOkay I probably would sell at all\nBut on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death of ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so\nThat that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I don't regret it the rest of my life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not\nSome advise set of families entire portfolio three\nMillion dollar network be caught up in ... um\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me\nAs a financial coast because they do that I Would say no\nI Would take the majority or all of that money off the ties\nThe news to have a blessing like that\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare\nI don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible\nAnd um so it has to be a our income and our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy and it's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nThen you know going in you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to be on a condo over in Knoxville and one of the ball game over there and he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more stuff more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine\nJamie is whether Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana Hi Jamie How are you\nHow they how you doing better than I deserve what's up in your life\nWill miss out on the end of August I'm I have a friend who has been following you and she gave me the information and I had been struggling that the single parent and I just got a new job in the month of march\nAnd now I'm like I make

month\nOkay how much you owe on their car\nAnd have a thousand less so that's not bad\nBut your your take on page three thousand thirty six thousand a year so that means you're probably making about forty five thousand before taxes is on right\nNow and go home at each pay take it out and in some and so for the month with a I make my twenty two hundred a month from my job and I get about nine nine and ... points so about three thousand in my\nYou know out of an income from a little over three okay yes\nUh well you don't have a lot of wiggle room here raising two boys um ... but let's just let's stop a second because it sounds like you're paying bills and then trying to eat I Want you to eat and then try to pay bills\nWhat that means is is that we need to start start doing a written budget\nWhere every dollar but for the month begins you look at your paychecks and what they're going to be you look at your child support what it's going to be for this month before the month begins and you assign every dollar\nAnd so we would start with the ... off the top you said your toddler med school and that's the first thing we do like ten percent off okay that tide is done now what are we going to next well we're going to eat\nSo second thing you do\nYou eat so you do your grocery budget and you set that money aside\nAnd then what's the next thing you know you pay your lights in
