NBC thinking or when they do the Sudoku nearby that or it yeah exactly but so are are they are are they sending her up to go out and embarrass yourself or are they trying to sort of root for her to somehow work her way out of this\nKind of what is wrong I didn't play the big the here's the smoking's cut dirty too\nOkay I got I got one to ever yeah let's listen to this one\nI was physically assaulted in every way you could possibly physically assault Taiwan then it was horrible\nAnd wondering if one of those people was broadcast [noise]\nI cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me\nIf you can't rule him out you you ... you you feel to yeah he's guilty if you can't rule about he can't be on the screen great well\nI agree we have no choice copious show you how this number ... ... this is horrible if this happened to her and I don't believe anything she says because none of it seems credible but if this happened to urge terrible why she went to a party with a with groups actually going on ten times is also worthy of a question\nYou know I just started something also where was he a the days that ah OJ Simpson didn't kill his wife right exactly you're right I think I think I mean I think you know ... and what about all the time she didn't try to kill her [laughter] you ... why does he get credit for that if the glove doesn't fit you must acquit right\nSo if as long as there's nobody in her life did knows her well the thing she might be up to something I'm willing to believe Julie sweat Nick so what you see what her ex boyfriend thinks cook thirty three\nIf you asked me personally I Believe from a I don't believe in you know personally I don't believe her I really don't believe a no one knows better I mean nobody knows do this with ... with me and I'm you know he can say that the ones but the fact that I Know and that's what I came here to tell the truth I mean I Know how she is\nYeah okay uh is you have any more to say Richard ... thirty four\nYou know she was always wanted to be the center of attention on the show it was went to do some major show us went to press the where everything she basically was telling me that she was running everything if anybody knows Julie on the person I mean I Know because I knew were\nOn to everything that came out of her mouth was just exaggerations on that she never mentioned that to me at all and there's something that the I I was surprised to hear this it was actually I was surprised to see or making these concessions because you have never ever mentioned that to me at all\n[noise] Michael I have an audio to ... to ... to porn stars this is this is going to hurt him\nReading but again you know we don't care about the opinions of Ninety five a hundred senators um they they were spoken for before now look\nThere will be I Know that but they don't know that they keep saying the same thing over and over again this is Chris Coons is actually thinking about voting for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd he might actually not Chris Coons actually might he's he's quite moderate and it if the FBI comes back to the clean bill of health ... I don't know whether we talked about this last week or not\nBut what happened with this FBI pro is the chances went up that Brett Kavanaugh would be cute and the Trump would have to pick Amy Coney Barrett or ... or another of the twenty four ah judges who were on his short list\nNot a very short list ah so the chances of that happening went up but what also went up where the chances that Kavanaugh would be confirmed with\nFifty five or fifty six votes with a bipartisan vote and that went up because if the FBI comes back\nAnd says look we looked into everything here we can't find cooperation to prove or disprove this yes and ... and and that's what they get if if we get back to a there is no evidence there is no way to corroborate this story in any way\nThen we're back to the chance that a cabinet gets a bunch of democratic votes I looked at a poll out of North Dakota that was yesterday a Heidi Heitkamp to the poll said two things\nAre highly Heitkamp is not going to be a U.S senator for a lot longer\nBut it also said that um the issue this is a galvanizing focusing issue for a Republican and independent voters in red states watching this happen has put a Joe Manchin has put Claire McCaskill has put Joe Donnelly in a very difficult positions\n[noise] interesting because Joe Donnelly came out right before Jeff Flake to reverse course and said not voting for him\nSo he took a bit of a political risk now now they're back and play that well I might change my mind it might change his mind what Chris but Chris you should know this I I always think I can and guys like Chris Coons to be sober and in ... but Chris Coons wasn't no before it turns out\nBrett Kavanaugh drank in high school he changes by now that he yelled at him\nKnow that uh if flake so here's the thing about goodwill\nUm if people are are preferred belief about politics and our preferred belief about Washington and our preferred beliefs about the Senate is it has been informed by a deep deep cynicism and I mean rank\nBut Chris Coons is a guy who he got through ... he he was worried about having a primary challenge this year but he represents a state that's very moderate Delaware is has a strong preference for moderation ... no no extreme is a a prosper in Delaware politics\nAnd I I Would say this is Jeff Flake extends to good well to Chris Coons to say you know what you're right and by the way\nWho is in play right if the Republicans would have tried to jam through\nA and starting a votes of falling off the side as you get down to decision time Murkowski Collins or maybe others say I can't do it that's a real catastrophe I'm also a catastrophe for Republicans would have been\nGrinding it through with all the ... still on the air grinding it through with Mike Pence casting the deciding vote\nThis was a good this was a good compromise for the Republicans what somebody like Coons wants to do is generate goodwill so you go from a no vote to a ... vote to potentially really a yes vote if the FBI investigation comes back and their background check and they say now we got nothing\n[noise] uh you know what I think you're right in and if Jeff Flake if he is or if he is a conservative he might not be but I think he is a conservative who doesn't like Donald Trump which happens to people like George Will and others I get it if he if he's a conservative\nBrett Kavanaugh hits it hits it out of the park if you were like George Bush and John McCain Brett Kavanaugh hits out of the park if you like Lindsey Graham all off it goes against his party\nOr Brett Kavanaugh is not Donald Trump junior so don't worry about it so if he alleviate legitimately just wants to make sure he did a soldier woman in high school then I think capital is fine but listen to a Newt Gingrich\nA concluded and he knows how to make deals\nThey talking about this the other coast to coast cannot nothing\nI mean Republicans sometimes have this passion for being stupid Frank gotten nothing ... nothing so comes plays in this game for really bipartisan let me see how Henry people often yeah Republicans are alone and would you please you have now for a little bit because I feel so much better when you take advantage of\nPeople there that there's a reason people get fed up with this stuff\nLindsey Graham leave that on a while ago\nIs the most affecting the Judiciary Committee told the truth and I think we need the Americans people got to stand up and say they don't want a country that has dominated by these kind of people and I think it's a really serious threat\nThought that was new so that that's what I\nThey they don't want a country that is dominated by these kinds of people and I think it's a really serious threat\nBut that was new so that that's what I see and I didn't see the you know and and I think Scott bellies great but I just wanted one question he if he turned out to pass this FBI background report over the next\nSeven days would you vote for him would your colleagues vote for him because the answer is no that's the honest answer Blumenthal is that changing his mind nine science that changing your mind you know and I ... but can I call\nCan I call a little malarkey call here go ahead I'm when uh people in and people in both parties do this and they say if only everyone would just do what I say then we will win if if only everyone would simply follow what their follow the the instructions and do what they're supposed to do\nThen we will just went well guess what that's not the system\nThat's not how that goes yes obviously if the Republican there are fifty four I told you we talked before about the fifty four ... this was really surprising to me\nUm and it tells you something about our politics fifty four percent of Republicans said even if Brett Kavanaugh tried to rape a girl when he was in high school that he should still be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nBecause the argument here is nothing matters anymore just winning just smashing them in the mouth now the overwhelming majority of Americans say no no no no no we have three hundred and twenty five million people we don't need a guy who tried to rape or grow in high school or on the Supreme Court there are other options at hand\nAnd but the fact that we're at a point here\nWhere both sides embrace this concept of right or wrong just do it for your team and smashed the other guy in the mouth is ridiculous because that's not in Lisa Murkowski's interest that's not in Jeff Flake centrist that's not in Susan Collins interests nor Joe mansions nor Dean Heller\nNor a bunch of members so one of the fiction that frequently get sold to members of both parties is that the answer here is that everybody just quit sinking lashed themselves together and go ... like a wrecking ball and the other side whatever the issue that's not how the Senate supposed to work\nOr I Want you to hear or I Want you to hear what we heard yesterday let's listen\nTo Senator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running you know not attract and not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nEvery bit of moral fiber a more you know it was he well he acted morally wrong with his conscience he couldn't do it any more he said well\nYou know the fact that I'm retiring is allowed me to take on my party if I say I would never do it I I'm I was thrown out of my mouth\nIsn't that sad I Would I Would only do the right thing because I'm retiring yeah\nAnd that and that is ... maybe he didn't mean it that way maybe he meant it differently somehow but the take away what it really sounds like is a man who admits that he would have been craven otherwise\nAnd that is not a good look that is and there and it it is depressingly clear about the way that our primary system\nA has made our politics so much worse that all of this direct marketing in primaries has left us in a place where people are the these craven vessels of ambition or rather than people who are doing the things they think are right right\nAnd that's how I described craves it [laughter] I I Know that that's a that's under this thing's Brian sings brain would never say that\nBut that's why we're different people Christ but I like to end with something where you are a hundred percent agree with Donald Trump a hundred percent agree you're ready now you're curious I'm curious yes\nI think they didn't live out his drinking does that mean you'll pull him I don't think he did\nHere's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I've never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my totally good traits I don't drink [noise]\nWhenever they're looking for something that I say I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I guess you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I think that might be the world's worst [laughter]\nDo you agree that if he had to drink he would be a mess\nWell I I think one of the the underappreciated under told stories about Donald Trump or is it is the demise of his brother John ah from ah alcoholism and that was a a formative a in a kneeling moment in his life\nAnd I think that you know he was being facetious but I think that yes very obviously his decision at a young age to avoid the fate of his older brother whom he really loved him he really admired a that his decision to never drank\nHe would not be president today if he had done that right because we already know what he was doing in the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties I think if you would have added booze yeah she was too that a drug mystic mix of you put booze into that he missed the ex I don't think that you end up with I don't think would you end up with a guy who they Seventy one is out doing what he's", "year":
