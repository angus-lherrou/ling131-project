I just wanted to Mount Vernon recently and they showed me the table that he reportedly opened up the map on and they kind of devised a plan do you does your research say that\nOh yeah no it's it's amazing what an emotional moment for Washington you know he hasn't been home in six years\nFor grandchildren had that he's never seen have been born in that in that time\nAnd he he walks in the ... um Mount Vernon a roshin bow with him and they know that there's a huge fleet of friendships is there and they you know pull out the maps and start planning these only there for a few days but it's the beginning of the great victory that when this\nSide note we've just talking about this I was just reading some excerpts from your book\nAnd one of which is Washington's got some problems not only is he trying to win a war that seems impossible when he writes home he keeps finding some some disturbing news one of which was the British come down the Potomac and they start burning every plantation they can but they don't burn Washington's why why well his\nHis cousin Lund who was a caretaker of Mount Vernon goes out to the British ship the appropriately named Savage and says uh here would you like some provisions are with us it's just you\nKnow if if I give you these don't burn or the place and and if they don't in Washington here's this he is infuriated you know how how could this happen to the leader of the American army said I'd much rather lose all of Mount Vernon a than here this news\nAnd so do the enemy you basically offered a bribe Erie is trying to destroy the enemy and his a caretaker of his nephew yeah nephew thinks he did a good thing\nYeah yeah no it was yeah you know thanks to that we have Mount Vernon today but it put Washington a difficult position and you know this is one of the things I I kept realizing in this book you'd like Washington to have that high five moment you know I've done this\nOne one this thing but at every turn he runs into issues that make it very difficult uh at the great victory Yorktown or his step son Jackie ... died of cabin of of camp fever and you know so instead of\nYou as the rest of America celebrates he's in the morning and uh you know those kinds of things it was really tough on one right so he what he does surrender that how does he get called while says surrender\nWell are they surround a this is a siege and so ... what they do a series of line in which they they move the artillery closer and closer\nTo the British position in Yorktown until finally um they're just pounding the British to pieces at night lord Cornwall is tries to escape by the rowing across the river but a huge storm comes up that doesn't work\nAnd eventually they have no Cornwall ... I've got to surrender\nAnd so he surrenders and Washington is very insistent that the terms of this treaty be in our favor because when at the battle Saratoga under her ratio gates it was just the opposite a Washington was a very tough negotiator\nAre finally it's it's the the the ceremony to surrender book Cornwall is doesn't show up he pleads illness and and uh ... voids the public humiliation of having to turn a sword over to Washington\nSenate Philbrick are ah he's our guest right now so if you have the headquarters in New York and that's what general Clinton yeah has Cornwall surrender anything but the south in the south like how does the transfer\nRight well it's interesting you know you think Yorktown the war's over\nActually it would be two years before the British finally evacuated from New York this was one part of the army a very significant part seven thousand soldiers there about ten thousand up in New York and so this meant there was still a significant army in America and Washington worried even though we won this thing the British are going to come back\nAnd there was a naval victory they won in the Caribbean all this stuff but finally the British Parliament realizes that people no longer want war no matter what we just have to get out of it to us in a lot of money to cost them a huge amount of money and uh you know it costs the French just as much\nAnd you could argue that and many have that the French Revolution in less than a decade was a result of the fact that the French were bankrupted by their support in America and the revolution and about five thousand in New York you said in particular\nUh the the French no no the other issue the British had a over ten thousand so that the Washington wanted to attack New York before he wanted to check tax the Chesapeake but the French felt it was much easier to sell into the Chesapeake sudden they were right and they were right hey\nYou know and they shifted Washington shifted gears I mean this is the thing about Washington he would when he realized you know they're not going to do it my way okay shift gears what can we do to make this happen\nAnd he and he did it in a very decisive brilliant way because he made his preference for New York\nMake the British in New York think that that's where he was going to attack until the very last second when they realized whoa a Washington Rochelle bows army or on their way to Philadelphia and ultimately a Cornwall is in the chest\nAnd they ended up just two years later just leaving on their own cars\nRight it was the evacuation of New York ah in in November of Seventeen eighty three and a you know a huge huge symbolic act if nothing else in Washington rides in um has a a you know as a ride than it's it's it's now um\nYou know we have one this and it's it's one of the major moments in American history\nYeah we went down to ... yeah where she had his final drink or the report is a with his soldiers year he was overcome with emotion\nI couldn't really speak but he says come up and touch me and basically she would take to shake my headache meant yeah and they did and they watched as he walked out to a bar that was waiting and took him down stream\nAnd then you look out and you go to ... to do was make a turn you could see with a barge would be Oh absolutely I mean it's not as if it's been covered up by buildings you can see the path to Washington talk\nNow it's amazing when you go down to that Wall Street section of New York you know the ... it's a village or ... when you look at the historical buildings and it was all very intimate\nAnd when Washington left and he was on his way to Annapolis where the continental Congress was to surrender his commission from ... done you guys could have you back up a country might be alone you know and King George when he heard that this was Washington plan to retire to Mount Vernon\nHe said if he does that he will be the greatest man in the world because you know ... it was inconceivable to surrender power I mean you know so many dictators had had refused to do that in the past and the polling in the future but that's what Washington did\nAnd he made it possible for republic to then spring up from this this great victory right but at first it would be no president no there was no president there was a dysfunctional Congress or without an executive\nAnd it would take you know almost five years before the continental Congress would uh with the the constitutional convention would begin to create the system that we have\nToday I understand you can use to grant sure okay yeah we're going to have a few more questions because the other thing that's happening now since last time we left more than ever the attack on history and our past\nAnd the you know I talked to Douglas Brinkley about this talked Doris Kearns Goodwin about this\nTalk to each him about this and their stance is a little separate about what you do with
