on with a America's Newsroom on Fox News channel given idea what's on your mind will take some calls and also go over the series of a package bombs or none of which gone off\nFor proven to be a lethal or even actual uh but the materials they're the intentions there and the targets are certainly there and they're all famous and you know all of them and they're all Democrats who are critics of President Trump what it means we'll be following but first let's get stores\nNow with a big things you know through the power of three Brian's big story numbers hurry\nWe're just Thirteen Days away from a very very important election it's election of\nJust if you look at it monumental importance isn't it wouldn't you say monument\nHow everybody so that is interesting the president's talking

latest was addressed to actor Robert De Niro and found in lower Manhattan this morning\nA night suspicious package was found this morning the last two in Delaware the latest address a vice president Joe Biden and Robert Deniro production companies you just heard I'll bring you the latest [noise]\nThem or one that was just a week\nAgo that the press that was it was all thing the fact that if Congress men have body slammed the reporter well if you Laura five violence in years Fitch is\nPeople are going to hear that we don't know who delivered the bombs but odds are there was someone who is hurt the president's message and acted on it so he bears responsibility for this\nOr you know I it David Axelrod and he's the one I count on on the left to also be a level head [noise]\n... surprise me with this because do you blame the President Obama\nFor the shooting in South Carolina where the shooting at Sandy Hook\nYou as president at the time you might say his rhetoric was different but it happened during his tenure this is the president's style you think\nIn Sandy Hook he was president at the time you might say is red or who is different but it happened during his tenure this is the president's style you think that he's pro shooting that people might interpret it that he sees a some unrest that is a er during when he was a campaigner\nAnd he saw someone recipe so you know there was a time in which we ah you know we've hit the guy\nI don't really think that that gets you nine a package bombs\nYeah because he is a mainstream Republican thinker who just has a different way of delivering and I think most of the people whose voices you heard right now understand that Donald Trump is different why they get up every day\nAnd I believe this was one of my big three earlier in the week why everyone gets up every day and it surprised when this president has unconventional is stunning to me\nWhy they want to go back over his rhetoric and blame violence we would be attended violence with nine packages being sent two prominent Democrats on Donald Trump\nThat will be is wrong I Believe that blaming Bernie Sanders for the Bernie Sanders worker they shot and almost killed Steve ... on the baseball field\nThere'll be like blaming Brock Obama for setting the tenure to other South Carolina shooting took place or take place or the Sandy Hook shooting to take place so the Gabby Giffords shooting to take place I don't think the president's responsible for that\nBut what I Love to see a reset between the media and the president after the midterms yeah before that I'm not too sure to work after the first one didn't\nBut maybe the president after getting his feet ... for the last two years after getting the Mueller investigation over a that lasted two years if that is over and he emerges unscathed which I expect him to maybe he's got to take that time and who would not say yes the New York times Chuck Todd\nGeorge Stephanopoulos come to the White House three of the two or three of the time excuse me ... the White House or Trump Tower one day\nAnd you say listen when it come to New York like to see you guys and then you go to Washington to me with some different reporters and then you have off the record conversations where people get the air out the main problem with him\nI don't think anybody could say he's not accessible now I Know is one on one interviews he gives more to Fox but boxers ... more fair to him and then the other channels so I don't think they necessarily good or bad I think they're more fair\nSo and I know we've got a lot of lunch you what I'm going to do is go on America's Newsroom shortly at which time we'll talk a little bit about what I'm doing tomorrow night where everyone everyone to join me at St Louis county library\nSo that I'm going to be coming in going right to the stage and we've seen that with more Cox and we're going to have a great time up some tickets there and you'll get a book with every ticket and I'll be able to sign them personalize them and it's all about taking the listeners in St Louis who keep us or one of the top are chosen the entire area\nThen I'm going to do this thing called go to Louisiana with Andrew Jackson America New Orleans I didn't get a chance to go to the first time\nMotor Baton Rouge on Saturday and on Sunday I'm going to be an Octavia books at one o'clock flying at about five o'clock back in New York about eight o'clock eight nine o'clock\nAnd they're ready for Monday I'm Monday will be on the five Tuesday I'll be on Martha it's going to be a crazy couple of weeks but have not been able to talk about history and uh about the history book for obvious reasons uh we got a series of package bombs nine in total\nNow I Can't even say bomb I Would say a would be bombed devices and I said devices because it's not been proven that any of these packages would've blown up\nThey will factors powder on the inside shards of glass on the inside on the outside it looks like a bomb but for the most part there is no proof that it'll blow up but it almost says the same effect thankfully it didn't because a lot of innocent people would have been hurt and a lot of prominent people would have been hurt if it did\nHowever but it's not going to hurt the president or the former President Bill Clinton or Barack Obama because they've been screened for George Soros he's smart enough\nTo leave his mailbox outside this compact so that got him near Fort in Delaware and never got to Joe Biden but two packages were intended in Los Angeles it was intended for Maxine Waters and in Washington DC\nIn Florida down in Miami southern Florida that was intended older return address his word for Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Washington Eric Holder the former attorney general has been a big critic of the president might be running against him\nHe also was targeted so the people that block for all these prominent people would have been hurt but we know it's the same on blow up the same boat we're up on the inside the same printing or they say it's the same printing that's on the label and then the return addresses all Debbie Wasserman\nIm printing that's on the label and then the return address is all Debbie Wasserman Schultz jumper and his name is not spell correctly they also have\nA mocking sticker on it it mocks ISIS one to buy a ... at least one has a parity ISIS flag and as a freezing freezing get her done and that is obviously making a fun ah get her done is uh the cable guy\nYeah we're still waiting so the device looks the same\nUh the uh New York uh NYPD sources uh there was no they could not have blown up according to the CNN package\nBecause there was no blasting cap there was nothing to ignite it that according to Stephen Gomez the fact and nothing blow up shows that it's an amateur thing or they were pro who want to just send the message I got a bomb it got close to you it was intended for you intend to direct your world\nSo those are the things that we're going to go over the ISIS flag on it a lot of people saw it and so Arabic riding on the\nUh so Arabic riding on the battery and I have not seen that any other place on a side note tomorrow we hope to have George Papadopoulos in Studio I had lunch with them on Tuesday he is going to get a chance to testify behind closed doors and talk about the dealing with Mahler what went into it and how he essentially was set up\nBoth high profile critics of President Trump want to check with our colleague and friend Bryan kill me from tanker author of Andrew Jackson the miracle of New Orleans now out in paperback how you doing Brian and the dating you want to hear it on radio or whatever people talking about\nWell I'll tell you what for the most part people are a ... for those package bombs on his side no bill we used to have you here you would send you to do the show this whole third hours hurting our relationship but we can still talk in the hall or ...\nThey should this were nine and there are now okay so we're kind of locked out there actually a competitor\nI Know I I guess though but uh I had lunch by the way with George Papadopoulos on Tuesday he was really looking forward to meeting on Thursday and he's coming in to Fox and friends tomorrow he has a story to tell they could blow the lid off the entire thing and ... out of it but in terms of what my calls are saying\nA lot of concern a lot of pointing out that nothing was detonated and there's a lot of people who feel as though when it's all said and done there's some kind of a plot\nOr on the left to make Donald Trump looked like the bad guys who we start talking about Donald Trump's rhetoric and not about the caravan\nAnd not about cabin on and not about the economy so does this and we took about twenty five calls already anticipating coming out with you and Sandra ... and that's just the pulse of the people but since I've been on and since you've been on as you know we found out about two new packages\nOf both intended for Joe Biden I have yet to talk to anybody and like you I talked to Ron Cosco who have said\nThat these are our bombs but it just worries me then again if they were the most innocent like postal workers in couriers would've been in the line of fire it reminds me of the anthrax situation\nNow very much so you mentioned Papadopoulos seems the number one suspect right originally ... it was sentenced to fourteen days in jail having served a day at the end the address that yet oh yeah and what what what does that mean what does that say what is what is that indicated about the investigation\nI think it says everything about the investigation I think it says a lot when with congressman Jordan would Mark Meadows\nWith Devin Nunes has been doing it pursuing within ... been talking about this twenty eight year old was really on TALK was targeted possibly by a previous or a previous administration because of his links to Israel he was helping Israel with newly discovered oil and setting it up with Greece they did not like that\nThe word is there might be another Pfizer war and it was on him\nAnd ... yeah and they continue to look at him and then he top subways pops up in Britain right the critical column against David Cameron and next thing you know people start coming up to them you need to talk to them wanting to have a few entering into the\nFinds himself in the middle of all this I'm really looking for the interview tomorrow quickly on your book it's in paperback what more do we learn in Jackson\nSince we talked last time Andrew Jackson's ... has been to file for the first time since his death prior to the civil war he is now in the line of fire would I tried to do is remove Donald Trump who's a fan of Andrew Jackson and see we're past presidents thought of him because we do in this thing this war on history\nSo I have a look at what Reagan said Teddy Roosevelt said FDR said with Truman said no to Abraham Lincoln said about the impact of Jackson that\nWhen with special and made them those famous man in America it let them to become a two term president why why are we attacking him now why we let them off the twenty why we booting horrible phrase is on his tomb those are the things I attack in the paper back this time\nWe'll check it out thank you Brian I seem to serve back to the radio and you go\nYou got an air welcome back anytime I Can't wait Sandra how you can grab ...\nThank you All right one eight six six eight seven six six nine but it's mostly the calls him getting I mean I just had to be honest most of the calls believe this whole thing is is set up there maybe ...\nSomebody else's behind it but there's no substance there's no proof until we find the perpetrator into we find a the person who would try to terrorize\nThe nine people\nI can go ahead and say this is some plot either way\nBut I Would hope the one thing that would come out of it is it everyone tone it down if Steve ... bleeding to death on second base on a baseball field on a friday morning I think it was if that wasn't a wakeup call I Hope this is a wakeup call because you don't want anything that you've said personally\nConduct the sovereignty of a nation without some sort of border and they all supported the eight hundred mile science project along the border at that point so I it's it's an understandable if Democrats don't quite what to say about it now they see just got so far away from that stance\nMore through the other thing is uh the word is when both tummy totally we'll going at it last week it wasn't over an issue it was over ... Nielsen and we know the ... the general Kelly the chief of staff is a huge fan of his replacement and former deputy who would do you know about that and will you approach that today when you speak to her\nYou know I mean I think that those issues of sort of you know and we you know put them in the palace intrigue category at the White House you know everyone that I've spoken to in the White House is very supportive of secretary Nelson a\nAnd believe that she's doing a very good job we know that you know she's always said that she starts at the pleasure of the president and that she feels that there's an enormous a jet that falls under her job title that she's very committed to carrying out um but certainly you know questions along those lines of of you know because it's difficult to do your job that if\nThis kind of corrections that are in place and and yes we'll get her response to that\nYeah and I really view of the euro so going into an ... I Know you've got to be able to cover this more than likely but this Arizona Senate race or find endlessly intriguing more Shelley the fighter pilot on paper I thought we'd have the seed\nI guess the primary so brutal she's had trouble getting momentum but now she's got a few she is a with you last night talking about I'm Talking about the border cut forty seven\nWe have to do whatever it takes to secure the border and uh it it's so frustrating as the Democrats continue to obstruct on this issue\nYou see the care of on if it's gets raising awareness to everybody about what's going on but every single day in Yuma little mini caravans are coming from you know where people are showing up\nThey know as soon as they that's set foot in the United states either with a kid or they say the right words they're going to be released and sixteen thousand five hundred last month just released into the interior of the United states never to show up for the coordinate this is not working for our country we have to secure the border we have to close the loop holes\nSo that includes a border wall and include more agents include access rows and technology but also closing a loophole that the cartels and others are taking advantage of right now\nSo she she understands a major issue for hours on end and you're getting now now that you're down there\n[noise] ... yeah absolutely I mean it is a fascinating race to watch between Christmas and Martha ... current Congress members from from Arizona and whoever wins will be the first female senator in the state of Arizona but the demographics in Arizona have\nBeen changing dramatically over the years and it has always been a very interesting\nElectorate to watch um you know it's Jeff Flake seat Jeff Flake is you know an individual who had differences with the president um it was pretty clear that he wasn't going to get reelected for that seat is up there on levers work very weak at the time but\nYeah that is going back and neck race and a lot of it may sort of focus on some of the suburban issues ah with regard to the present with regard to a you know how people feel about him in\nSome of those district so it's it's a fascinating one to watch I I think she's pulled away a little bit I think the real clear politics advertise them only about a point now are right now so the next few weeks are going to be here in that race\nOr the ... right now the other sure that I'm sure you're going to be covering even though you're going to be up close and personal and the border is what's going on with these nine packages yeah everybody we talk to on the on off think we're getting closer to finding the person because they're they're so there's so many opportunities between the surveillance in the packages in the similarities\nTo to start putting the pieces of the puzzle together um\nIt's so hard to know where this is going this is this is somebody like I've never seen before\nIt's fascinating and don't forget a one of the many responsibilities that falls under da chess and under secretary Nelson as protection of national leaders and counterterrorism I've said this is also a you know right in her wheel house in\nDoubt it's even more top of mind and the care of anti Islamic given what's happened over the last twenty four hours it will certainly be getting her reaction and try to get some\nNew information from her on how that investigation's going but absolutely there's there's absolutely a lot of signatures and a lot of uh footage and video that exists of of whoever it is as it's doing it and I think everybody believes it that the FBI is going to do a great job and we're going to find this person said\nMore than when you go to the border do you know to where\nIt's hot I Know that and dusty\nFrom that because I Would have ...
