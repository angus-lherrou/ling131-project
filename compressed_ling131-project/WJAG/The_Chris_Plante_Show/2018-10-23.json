Carter on it and Morgan or take if they both know what they're doing um we we were transferred to a ... I Lived in Latin America we were transferred to Saudi Arabia after the U.S manufacturing jobs started drying up in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd [noise] uh we lived in multiple countries\nAnd we found that uh\nThere were people within the government is not a monolith but but the people and the government like the king and his son the crown ... wanted to reform ... and get rid of terrorism and they've been working on us turkey doesn't like the state want more of this type of violence so that can move into [noise]\nTo Europe but we found something very very interesting I'm a chemical engineer but also supervise lab techs and hospital environment\nAnd we found a that they were flipping out and our crew in and around that crew from Brian infection and they they uh cause things like Mac behavior impulsive behavior vengeful behavior anger\nAnd they were diseases that came off the Silk Road a ... a career in Congo hemorrhagic fever or a plague polio malaria all kinds of things including Venezuela Ecuador ... which causes people to act like\nAre the people who are running the the movement of ... of of people out of Latin America to our border and the FBI just to prove them a quick that detect these things it cost a lot of money to finally flying back in the eighties\nBut we can now test for these things and check people coming out of the country when we help other people outside the country tests of these things and it would help move people more to calm conservative values\nYeah I ... I just do we tell me what do you think is a is a doable inappropriate sanction to keep the relationship alive but at the same time give another brush back but you can't treat a American or any other journalists like this\nYou might need to be severely prosecuted but a a present for the world that we really don't want people killed in embassies et cetera they should have but he should have been taken back to Saudi Arabia and tried if if he was really a part of the Muslim Brotherhood and uh with ... inciting terrorism worldwide\nAnd and so the Saudis have a problem because I have a hobby is there and then they have people walk reform and we have a similar type problem over here so Congress and the president and the government of a Saudi Arabian need to work it out\n[noise] yeah but you were you are for for a guy that lived in Saudi Arabia as crazy as that society is in in comprehensible a as it is in terms of mores uh and the way they structure things you do see the merit in keeping relations with Saudi Arabia\nAbsolutely they're keeping the middle east calm is saving us a huge amount of money and preventing so many people from being murdered 'em by the radicals they are not angels but you have to work with them and and we need to move them more and more moderate stance and there are people who want to do that over there\nAll right thanks I appreciate George Mike ... news Ninety six five minute window Hey Mike\nHi Brian\nYeah the governor's race might give me your perspective dissenters birch Gillum why is Gillum in front and almost every poll\nI thank you Lynn is in French because there's always been this perception that most Republicans don't show up until the gate of and I think the answer is really has a he's got a\nNo matter what just because of where the retirements are where the districts are places like New Jersey ah where in California they're just they're going to lose a bunch of seats um but and so cook is right and we move race we moved a bunch of races last week because\nNow we're down to the end and you waited to see will the Republicans get a miracle bailout will this candidates will the magic thing happened for this candidate and when the magic we like it a little big man he says sometimes the magic doesn't work and in these districts now we finally have some clarity\nIt's interesting we're getting more clarity on individual races but the picture in terms of\nHow the final flop is going to go this is like plant Texas hold them yeah it's it's getting a lot more it it's getting murkier about what's going to happen in that final calculation I think we're going to have a truly interesting election night\nOr in other words you think it's going to be extended I think Chris right because you think of so many of these races going to be a compelling out on the west coast I Know you don't want to stay up all night but you do think you're going to end up doing that well we we\nStay up all night on the decision that's no matter what it is just whether we have company we like it if you guys stay up and watch a so because there's going to be a lot of interesting stuff you know control of house we have a we have a model that lets us predict which party is going to control the house based on the uh our our polling\nBut also the early returns a in a you know if it's a democratic wave will be able to tell you at nine o'clock uh yep here they come in there there it goes a but if if this is what it what the current surveys indicate we're going to have to wait for Texas we are going to have to wait for all kinds of stuff to come in before we have real clear\nYou know it's interesting uh I mean as usual Florida I find the most intriguing and the headliners the governors in the senators number one I'm pure performance I Know Scott doesn't have the great or the great charisma we know that but after eight years Florida knows them and knows these productive hardworking and honest\nAnd and the other side Bill Nelson who's been there for a while has not been necessarily productive you think if he's ever going to be vulnerable there'll be over after a two term governor decided to run against him dead heat and the last poll I saw from Quinnipiac\nHas a Scott down I think seven points system like yes says well you have them down consistently seven I had we had two or three and then this was big\nSo surveys so he actually is improving one point in Quinnipiac Quinnipiac as one of our a plus polls that has a good track record that uses the right methodology and yet Scott has consistently trail and this is also what you see there Andrew Gillum in the governor's race in Florida\nThat should not be the Florida hasn't had a democratic governor\nSince Nineteen Ninety eight I Believe when Jeb Bush won\nA now they don't win by a lot Florida tends to have\nNarrowly contested elections I think Rick Scott one by one point and one and a half points where his margins victory has governor um but and so Florida has been a state that has is a swing state but that has had a consistent narrow Republican advantage um the fact that round\nThe safest and struggling as much as he has to try to get some traction and get some advantage there talks about what kind of year it is in Florida what here's basically what we have\nWe have the volume turned up on both sides to the max we're looking at a year and so normally in a in a by any election in the mid term election the last midterm election and twenty four team was the lowest turnout and any since Nineteen forty two\nWe are on track now to have a midterm election turnout over fifty percent which you have to go back forty or forty years or more to find that kind of turnout you have to go back to basically the the the internal political struggle over Vietnam to find mid term election turnout like that and if that's true so here's the danger for Republicans\nThey are the the intensity as backup on the Republican side to match the Democrats but the Democrats aren't a bathing and in swing states like Florida in swing states like Ohio if Democrats are swarming the poll if Democrats are voting like Republicans Republicans are going to lose out on a bunch of seats because there are more Democrats than there are Republicans in America\nIsn't it great for the country is the guy loves politics to get that type of turnout\n[noise] um I Wish we were doing it in a less wretched way yes um I Wish that it was not so vitriolic an apocalyptic an awful but yes uh speaking selfishly on dopey or this is this is this is what I'm here I Am ... as the kids would say a here for this\nOr he is Christ are well he's always here for this pick up his book every medication helps make sense of Donald Trump's rise and let you know this is not an anomaly there are other
