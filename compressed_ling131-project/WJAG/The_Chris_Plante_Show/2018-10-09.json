representative Jerry neither of New York saying that if he is chairman of the Jewish are you on the house side they'll investigate Brett Kavanaugh are you kidding me can anyone see the big picture

think it's clear that\nThey're trying to line up a lot of Arab support before they present it to the Palestinians and try to make the Arabs push the Palestinians to agree to it I think that's been the hold up a bit yes look I I think you know Brian you and I talked about this a lot we we we you know constant media coverage\nPresident Trump is accomplishing many many things that you can it it's almost like\nPieces of a puzzle fitting together you can see these things taking shape it takes longer it doesn't always go smoothly and sometimes the noise obscures the\nPicture that is developing

all and here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not lying for trying twenty I can tell me she went out to be doing at that point forward to supporting the president\nOr this little Vicki Haley wrapping up her press conference where she announced her resignation effective at the end of the year and she did it with great friendliest mutual respect with our president uh the current prison United States so it does get a tweet fired\nAnd when we're ... come out that Don McGahn is going to be quitting soon the president says thanks time again you're gone so this time class so the president can do it [laughter] when he asked do he knows how to do it Larry listen WTO are seen Indiana hey Larry\nThanks very much when you say to my great loss with Holly gone right\nIt is a great loss it'd be difficult to find someone to fill fill that slot to do as good a job but she has done I'm sure that a John Bolton would be prepared to take this maybe or he would provide the necessary input to the president and as far as or recommending somewhat\nBut a a hope that happens it very quickly after she leaves are they shut somebody you're a Jew Jew a deposition\nYeah I mean you've got a few weeks a you know you have a few weeks you get everything is going to cool down for a while you know some people are speculating there is a story about flights back and went to South Carolina I don't think there's a chance of that but it just goes to show the scrutiny of these cabinet members run by the way this is that should not surprise you\nDespite the economic boom that we're living in right and the relatively piece that we're experiencing outside Afghanistan American the American people are experiencing Trump coverage that is Ninety two percent negative Ninety two percent negative\nOf the administration and she's not only had a good relationship with the president but also the vice president secretary palm pilot it is a very sharp contrast to her relationship with the president\nTo what was rex Tillerson's relationship with the president and so\nYou know as you go forward what she said was she went into the un every day with body armor on because she has to be ready for that fight fighting for America first putting our values and our agenda at the forefront of the UN which is the job of the UN ambassador she's done a phenomenal job\nBut I have to think that in and out every day that weighs on somebody trying to move things in your direction regardless of if you're the most powerful nation in the world it is a fight it is a battle every day and she has done a phenomenal job in the last two years representing our country to the un\nSo I'm used to have said to get your take on the brake cabinet struggled to get his confirmation through and to see how the president has managed by sitting back through most of it\nAnd I really gain an advantage you remember the number one story in America was about Paul Manafort cutting a deal and about Rick Gates testifying against him and now we Papadopoulos a gift to send in since ... coming up in December and everything looks so grim\nAnd now that's a lifetime ago because now everybody's talking about cabinet\nAnd Brian you know this the ... the news cycle move so quickly so fast this president's accomplishing so many things people can't keep up the fight with Brett Kavanaugh lasted\nTwo to three weeks and what we're going to know in two to three weeks from now is that people say boy that seemed like forever ago but what this fight has done I now I mean this is unified the Republican Party from the establishment wing\nTo the to the outskirts and everywhere in between that their unify because now they see the playbook of the Democrats what the Democrats are talking about is not only if they take over the house will they impeach the president of the United states or attempt to they were trying to teach justice Kavanaugh now this is what's on their agenda\nAnd the Republicans are waking up to an election for weeks from today realizing exactly what is at stake I think\nThey were a bit complacent there were so happy with the three point seven percent unemployment rate and the economy doing so well in our national security homeland security all doing better than it's ever done and so they were complacent and now they see\nIt as a reminder of what these what the Democrats want to do which is not just impeach Donald Trump and remove him from office but now they're talking about potentially impeaching justice Kavanaugh for nothing and this is now motivated the Republicans\nAnd we've got four weeks ago early voting starts a very very soon and there is some key battleground states where this president is on the road reminding people the success tonight he'll be in Iowa\nOkay I Want you to hear how this whole thing played out Walter Isaacson he used to run CNN a big town biographer of Steve Jobs Benjamin Franklin major projects and this is how he sees this thing out of the president played a cut succeed\n\nThat's what President Trump does uh he turns the pep rallies in terms of the reality shows\nAnd that's what he knows how to produce a the problem though for Joe and people like yourself is is successful\nHere somehow articulated what a lot of people single which is boy I guess everybody gang up too much on this guy it was unfair and I think it was astonishing that Donald Trump\nAlmost with the help of the Democrats have been married uh married something that should have played very strongly and with Democrats hands\nAnd it's something that is going to on ballads help Republicans especially running for the Senate because by putting it as a notion of mobs of people who try to destroy this nice man uh somehow or another he changed the narrative\n[noise] and I think that some students houses and I'd probably paying bills rise is going to say that\n... Brian he's absolutely right and what this president did is he allowed the Democrats to overplay their hand you've seen the footage many times on Fox News bang on the doors of the Supreme Court to sit in the hundreds of people\nAt a time being arrested at the Capitol the screaming during the confirmation process look Republicans don't do that whether you want it you know Kagan on the court or you want it whoever it was you didn't see that with the conservative they let the process play out the Democrats\nAttacked demand is merged his reputation went after his family this is a man who in his spare time unbeknownst to anybody else for the last dozen years\nGoes down and feed the homeless services the poor he doesn't do that so he thought someday could get them onto the bank she did it because at the character that he is\nAnd no one wants to talk about that and everything that they threw at him he returned fire and I mean that in a positive sense when he made a very impassioned statement his opening remark on a second confirmation process at at that second hearing\nBut what was most stunning to me of everything that judge Kavanaugh said\nWas that is ten year old daughter\nSaid dad we need to pray for this woman who said these things and we need to make sure that we're praying for her that that type of value that he has distilled on his children and that\nAnd we need to pray for this woman who said these things and we need to make sure that we're praying for her that that type of value that he has distilled on his children and that talks about the character of the man and I think the turning point in his confirmation process\nIs when Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said you know what I mean this is not right and he made such\nA moving argument between him and senator Collins and ultimately Mitch McConnell lose three individuals helped change the public opinion of what Brett Kavanaugh did and the fight that Donald Trump put behind him because I Believe Brian\nNot any other president if it wasn't Donald Trump would have stood behind that nominee in the way that he did and far from the way he did and Donald Trump has proven to be successful because of ...\nYears with the president said to judge Kavanaugh his daughters cuts six\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness encourage who has devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens and now\nFrom the bench of our nation's highest court your father will defend the eternal rights and freedoms of all Americans\nThat you right back at the kids you must have heard some of the negativity the horrible allegations from Michael I've been out of you know others and I thought that was a great part of the speech\nHe'll Brian I I've seen this in my own life where I was attacked mercilessly during the campaign and my children are old enough to watch the news and go on the Internet and see what happens I remember then candidate Trump and ultimately President Trump calling\nMy kids and you're saying your dad is doing great work and that goes so far you know and and saying nice things about me and it wasn't just me he's done it so many times to other people because he\nKnows that the media attacks individuals who are associated with Trump in a different manner then if they weren't and we've seen the double standard time and time again and we've seen it with\nMedia reporters who say one thing if they are liberals and get away with it and if they're conservative they are chastised till the end of the earth we saw just this week with a CNN reporter\nWho use some discussing language on Twitter and all of a sudden all of those people on the left defend her use of that language and say well it was a a childish mistake but at the same one to chastise Brett Kavanaugh for drinking beer when he was in high school thirty five years ago the double standard\nIs out of control and the American people are tired of it\nRight Leslie where do you think of a idiot and we're just chances in New Hampshire in the first district you know New Hampshire well a he's a navy veteran graduate the FBI National Academy in Quantico former chief of police for the town of Southampton well chances are that you have\nAny has a shot in New Hampshire and it's one of the few seats are that the Republicans are actually on the fence so most of the places where the Republicans are running we're on the defense because of the map that we have being in the majority but because of the retirement\nOf Carol Shea Porter it's an open seat Eddie Edwards has a great shot at winning that he's a different kind of can a he's a lawn a law and order kinda can they he's a veteran and he is someone who connects very well with the people of New Hampshire but he needs to raise money he needs to increase it profile\nAnd needs to make sure that he is supporting the Trump agenda and if that happens the people in the actual will reward him and sent him to Congress\nCorey Lewandowski he's a coming up next to the I word so good answer a thanks so much uh Korea and the stunning news in a bathroom ... stepped aside but everybody's on good terms
