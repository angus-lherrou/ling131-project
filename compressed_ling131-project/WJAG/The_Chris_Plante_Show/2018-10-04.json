D.\nBut uh to me I just think overall most people don't respect what you saying don't respect collapse you blow up the process\nAnd certainly don't by the fact that\nShe wanted she agreed to limited and the scope they didn't want to have a long investigation\nBleak said I'll give you one week of all people ... give you one week you're not voting for him anyway who does not voting for him anyway Carl robust year Carl I just play Senator Feinstein talk about how disappointed she is about the scope of the investigation are you\nA wire we surprised that Dianne Feinstein or any member of the Senate Judiciary committee would complain about the scope of the and the time of the uh FBI investigation\nWhen it didn't turn out the result they wanted a you know we could go they said seven of them signed a letter saying all it took was three days per Clarence Thomas will they had you know Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday\nAnd up 'cause there's no core operation there was nobody who has come forward to say I can I can attest to the ... give I witnessed support to these extraordinary charges\nAnd that is true and Brett Kavanaugh is somebody you've known and they're still getting complaints Dianne Feinstein that didn't get all the documents but a lot has to do with your the president you work for the things that are still top secret and confidential right\n... right and look there's also an exaggeration of what his role workers staff secretary he was not his job to be a policy advisor it was to look at the documents going to the president and make sure that they made the strongest powerful argument on behalf of everybody in that doctor who's advocating different auction\nAnd that they were accurate and complete in prayer and you know it it it it may be in the Democratic penetration that\nThe staff secretary puts their finger on the scale and as a policy advisor but then ours they have a more important job which is the impartial empire to make sure that the document that's going to the president is the best document it could be regardless of what the argument is that it's making\nHuge spraying towns in a person you do respect choose also unhappy ... former homeland security secretary and advisor to President Bush who's also unhappy that the FBI did not interview a Kavanaugh who are poor and ...\nI personally don't believe as a prosecutor and they couldn't have incredible and complete investigation with an out and interview a doctor for it now I think what they're going to hear from the FBI is that they were constrained and how they can talk to him by the ... than that ain't going to take that\nOn face value that they were constrained ...\nAllegations of sexual assault that do that and explain why don't area Dr Ford\nNarrative have her testimony and they already have his testimony is that fair well that is fair but what what do you not get out of that well you don't get attacked the therapist announced what she asked her for a fresh and don't get the polygraph or the polygraph report which are kind of asked for\nAnd so there are a lot of ... in a thorough investigation into foster care I think I Would have had an agent back out to say that your thoughts girl\nWell I understand where she's coming from but look if the Senate Judiciary committee chairman has asked for these documents and Dr Ford's ah lawyers had refused that why do we think in a in a FBI or interview with no subpoena power that they are going to be any more forthcoming for some reason or another\nDoctor Ford's lawyer's Deborah cats uh the lead lawyer refuses to turn over those documents that have not weeks so look I I I I agree with Fran it'd be nice to have them but they're the windows FBI agents walk in to do an interview not at that\nThey're not they don't have subpoena power they don't have any ability to compel\nUh there's there's there's every likelihood that that Dr ... Dr Ford in her lawyer would give them give them the same response they've given to the Senate Judiciary committee and it took best gators which airs none of your damn business\nCarl a break out in

why you're up in the polls Europe vibe do Brits known as a moderate I just haven't known any moderate weather roots are Coons or imagine that ever voted against their party\nAnd the Tennessee is most ask themselves or they comfortable with the senator there would vote against Kavanaugh because that's really what it comes down to or you going to make that case\nWell we have been making that case because I've said all along\nI Would be I guess like protesting the law and my opponent is yet to say how he would vote on this and I have to tell you do you know anybody who has is still undecided on this and the answer is no and\nHere's the thing when it comes to my race Phil Bredesen my opponent had the opportunity to choose how to run as a Republican that meant dependent or a Democrat\nAnd he chose to run as a Democrat if he went to D.C he would be right there with Chuck Schumer who is bought and paid for his campaign and we know that in the people of Tennessee know that in a few gun eighty six days and can't make up your mind on how you would vote on judge Kavanaugh\nThen what else do you not know what how you would handle it or what you would\nDo a ... a very interesting to see
