I should drive that in\nOrder to war\nAnd then what fuels should I use in this car I just got it don't say what are what I just use regularly whether they ... or ...\nWell the good thing is they have designed the cars for I met a safe\nThirty years that you just put that baby into that overdrive gear and you drive it it's going to take care of itself you don't have to be doing any shifting or I might give you a rare exception if you went into a crazy mountainous area and you wanted to try to use a little engine braking to slow down she didn't heat up your break so bad\nIn was that if that always been the case it seemed like when I was younger there was overdrive and you didn't use it unless you were but then there was a point where we're always talking about an electronic\nOverdrive ... and\n... most anything that had it over drive in it from Nineteen Ninety eight Ninety five forward and has got enough systems in it that that vehicle is going to do as good a job shifting itself as you would do to try and Emanuel engaged that shift or so especially on this little five ... savor you've got an electronically shifted a transmission\nYou just put that baby in overdrive and enjoy the smooth ride\nAs for the fuel you can put that in two thousand and one in a vehicle being that it's an old five so you can put anything in there from no ethanol content up to Fifteen and it'll equally and enjoy the few you don't have to be\nConcerned you're going to save some money on that are using the Fifteen and it'll keep things clean in there\nAnd it may be such a thing of the vehicle has been setting a while and it's an older car like it is with lower mileage you might want to consider a after you start using it maybe soon thereafter replacing the fuel filter at this it needs to be done anyway you know is there might be some residue that that hire local content will clean out of the system so that car will adapt and run just fine with it\nWe're gonna take a quick break you're listening to the under the hood show with the motor medics standard which can be heard each week on great stations across the country that under\nThe hood show dot com\nUnder the hood has a new

more about brush euro at brush hero dot com that's brush hero dot com\nRound seven eight thousand mile range for the light but they couldn't provide and unfortunately\nI Can't believe the number of people that come in and we change their oil we look at the old stickers we pull it off to put the new one on and we say hey I I noticed your eight thousand miles over\nThe four thousand that was put on your sticker before is did you have a change somewhere else no I just hadn't got her on the changing it he's er engines that are very sensitive to oil changes Chris\nBut they must be they should be taken care of high feature high technical agents that led to help the outside of feature high technical oil Kyle did we answer your question\nI did I just go out and that's what I like both of our Facebook page or I have an acquired they are Ninety nine Ford Explorer with the five oh and the ... the forty head lowered for truck ... motor does go it's getting a five oh conversion\nThat'll be fun that'll be really fun Kyle thanks very much for the call eight six six five nine for for one final and thanks for listening on ... exactly into let's Dr Larry Larry you're on the end of the who'd show what can we do for ya\nI've got a Ninety three ... and F bomb went out and I just wanted and how hard they are decaying\nFuel pumps that one I have it as far as I Know I've never seen the door in\nThat it's like an extra ... six\nYeah school like that I don't know I'd rather than the option go at all and I don't know too much about it and I started driving let the other day and age from ... yeah now that that's why I like it and\nYou you might get fortunate on this I'm just trying to think we've dismantled a few of these through the years some of them have Monday I see I think some of them you can remove the backseat area and they had a on both to bowl door yeah adore a plate hatch they'll give you access to the fuel pump\nI I'm just I'm about positive I remember seeing that in in one or that we had so it could go fifty fifty\nBecause I'm thinking no on this model Shannon's thinking ... most likely yeah you could go either way\nBut you got it but I'm sure a resource would be available at once you go through the the uh like we have a a a missile system at our shop a\nLot of shops have an all data system I mean there's different ways they do it but most all of them and their procedure manual if there is an access door they're going to tell you there's an access door and uh that makes the job a lot easier but what that does it do is make the fuel pumps any less expensive\nSome of the British and European stuff\nIs quite expensive to get parts for if it is it something that's still in the mainstream where the after market is came in and contributed\nBecause I see that in our part side of the business that sometimes will buy a mid year\nBritish brand or European brand and we know that we're gonna bill ... parts of that longer even though not offering adamantly then we would on like a domestic sure would cause people will hold onto them longer right and the cost of the parts doesn't go down as they get older\nIf it was a eight hundred dollar fuel pump from jaguar when it was new it's still an eight hundred dollar field jaguar when it's all\nUm but there again there could be a\nA seat belt buckle replacement I mean it's just hard to tell who originally made that maybe it was a ... pump originally and Bosh has a after market replacement that is still an oldie equivalent so you just got to ask the questions and and then the final question you always got to ask yourself\nIs it really the fuel pump I mean do you embrace the fuel pump\nThat that that's in when you're getting into eight hundred that's not something you want to you want to know for sure right you want to have done some testing is that something where I Would bring it to my local shop and they would be able to do would you be able to go out and find out what kind of pump it needs and all that\nWe are you will you first step is to test it and verify that it's actually bad mhm and get an estimate to repair the car we verify yes the pompous bad All right we've done that part of the testing it's going to cause this much and pumping style will be this price\nLarry thanks very much for the call good luck\nI was thinking that might be kinda fun to own a jaguar even though when they bring you know you get but for the while it works it would be fun but then I remembered I have a Jew Fox which is exactly\nThe same taken out of those six range rover so we'll see how this goes ... boxes exactly the same as a jaguar works great for a while and then when it doesn't it's a headache to get fixed because that way the Eighteen thousand fans who you are listening to the
