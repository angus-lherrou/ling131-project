I guess just whenever a lead off and then a hit the gas again and I can I can feel\nA lot of play just having it up on my ...\nLike there I can probably move at a core churn\nJust in the front on ... author or if I Move the front or drive shaft and then ah just watched the backpack and probably move it\nAnd they do it or turn there's a lot about in the back you can move with a whole quarter returned before\nSomething else moves that's usually that sounds like quite a bit and it could be more than the chain I mean you could have some\nThey have some aligns wearing and they're doing what a hundred miles around a\nHundred and twenty\nThat's not really not that ... will drive I say I was expecting you say like one eighty or two hundred with what you're describing it really was that uh but that is the that you're I think you're looking at the right place have you drain your flu or the transfer case yet and inspected the fluid\nI I've just called the ... blog and got good color\nAnd stop sparkly\nBut it didn't know if I should\nI have a new train for sitting in my shop I didn't know if I should waste my time and put it in or if I got other issues inside there and they do a full rebuild\nWell I Would pull the drain plug out and drained it all out into a container that you can see very well maybe something glass some things see really well some clean while at the fluid is great you could always put it back in\nBut if the you know independent some of that flu is really expensive so you want to save it but if you see things that'll give you an opportunity to see what's going on there's many times where we dream fluid and put it back in if we have a question about a case\nUm sometimes we can check them on the top we checked on the other day and it was good when we checked the top plug went well it's not too bad smells good we pulled the bottom plug in once it all came out there was a lot of\n... is there something that transportation for us that you know that I'm just thinking about this that the clutch pack for the for the all wheel drive can that create that same sort of a field versus the chain if it's worn out yeah because there's a viscous clutch in the middle on that all wheel drive system as soon as oil bath\nThat when it senses slippage has to you know gets all the heat to it than it binds up again ... ... and she ... well before it to see what he's describing yeah he's got a hundred ... between the two ends of the trade I slap\nAnd now the tournament it felt like it was the same resistance all the way around it's turning the chain which is turning the cautious but if it's going ... ... it's the chain is just sloppy and they got what sounds\nYeah it does Clinton thanks very much for the call good luck it sounds like a little more ... yeah it's good to talk through it and I was thinking I was thinking about a little bit what stuck to Dan Dan you're on the end of the who'd show what can we do for you\nOh I got a question about a couple of old cars that I got a not terribly old but anyway I I I've got fifty nine forward and sixty nine Oldsmobile and I'm looking at but one of these\nCarburetor replacement fuel injection a like a fast or or yeah if er sniper or whatever it is\nMy six year old has a returning line already I'm already a high pressure set up you know I'd have to have a return line I guess right and uh I didn't know what I'm kinda thinking that I'm probably going to put it on the sixty nine Oldsmobile or fifty five and a\n[noise] but my question and I guess is are you guys for a million refugees are set up so you you would you recommend or maybe didn't care to do that on the air and I\nDon't know we already are those are the fast or whatever well whoever's\nYou use 'em there's\nThere are a lot of really good ones out there and we're familiar with a majority of them\nFrom M. S. D. need to ... to ... a lot of there's a lot of different ones\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh here's another call that came into the ...\nYeah I have a twenty four Camry that story problem was going to accelerate\nStalling problems when you accelerate that seems\nBad yeah I'm a lot of cars\nWill develop certain things that are inherent to them so when we see one that does this and one that does that if we know the model like that it leads us directions\nStalling when taking off in this model car there's been some issues with a as they age a little bit we if there are over sixty thousand miles we've seen some oil packs fail I'm so when you accelerate you get a flashing check engine light you get a ... you know a stutter\nAs you accelerate and uh that is one of the things that can happen those quote pack so we went from spark plug wires years ago to these in a separate oil to one ... per cylinder so that they can\nSupply more power to the spark plug for a cleaner burn it you can just stay recharge faster because one will spark and then uh as the other four are the three go than that one has time to fully recharge we're talking about thousands\nA lot easier for six people that do a tug of war than one\nYeah exactly and what the old one you had one coiled trying to hit every cylinders that went around so it would it would not go with that is something to check first they need to check the state of to you need to have a mechanical that and see what the state of tuna that engineers do we have failed and coils or do we have worn a spark plugs\nAnd then you get into more more technical things or whether or not when you smash and the throttle is it is it reading that correctly is there a problem with a\nFellow positioning censor I mean those are things that are gonna be a little more finite in their diagnosis but all those things really if if you're not getting a check in July you've got to fall back to that based system\nBased fuel base electrical or when you don't start putting a light on it is something in that delivery system of either fuel or electrical and that's what you get into some other stuff uh that Russia is talking about\nEight six six five nine for for one five all what's caught your attention and the automotive\nWorld well Toyota's is issued a recall is better if you've got a an Eighteen or Nineteen tundra which is pretty new with yeah at this release we've been having some\nAirbag\nThings going on\nAnd uh what's happening is as the car when you start to the truck when you start 'em up it's not reading all the sensors correctly and causing this thing to be in a fault mode so you're airbags may not deploying a collision so if you've purchased an Eighteen Nineteen tundra and you don't know about it yet I don't know about this recall\nGet ... get the facts contact your your deal your local dealer give them your vehicle identification number if you bought it from them they're going to have your name and the number on filed is telling her name there'll be a look it up for you and see if it's gotten the open recalls on when cars coming our shop it tells us when there's an open recall and the majority of cars\nAnd we print it out and handed the customer and say look this means it's free it's a recall safety related take this and get this performers it'll tell us parts available or were aware of the recall no parts available\nYou need to get that done because it's a definitely a safety things you don't wanna airbag not working\nEvery all become desensitized to airbag recalls I mean I think that we've had our house because when we bring them up we we all you will catch are still saying\nThis one is not to cut up right this is not a regular airbag recall um\nYou you got to ... and you need to monitor some things yourself to for instance you've got I've got a car that if somebody sitting in the passenger seat about half the time they're sitting there it says passenger airbag on or not a lot of times it says off and there's somebody sitting in it\nAnd if you turn the car off and they get back into the light comes on but it doesn't do it consistently enough to\nCatch it and it has to be the right way person and all that those are things that are important too because while it was not going to set your warning light on the dash\nIt's something you need to be aware of it when I start my car does airbag like come on and blink a few times and then go off or when I start the car does that like never come on if you purchase a used car and you start it up and you never see that everybody like come on you need to get in you need to have it\nAnd those systems do a self test when they start there may have been disabled by some butter talking about the modules saying check this check that out everything looks good full report tonight's offered you go\nAnd theoretically those lights that light up when it starts there I'm supposed to pay attention to those right there check like can't tell you and we see\nCars that come into our auto recycling facility and sometimes we look and go wow that was a that was an awesome wreck I Hope nobody was killed and then when you look in the window but wait a second why all the airbags not blown it obviously looked\nLike it hit a ... you know when the engines push back into the use of the national average apartment and the bags didn't go off you say why and it starts us to thinking and sometimes you never know but other times it could have been a recall that wasn't done\nWe're gonna take a quick break you're listening to the end of
