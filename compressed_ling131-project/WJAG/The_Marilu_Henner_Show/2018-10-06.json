CBS him when he called them different now right like I lost track of my cat like brand needs somebody for yeah they've got some different yeah the tourism but ah\nBut Lincoln is saying that um\nThey sound revolutionary but they just haven't had as much interest as they thought they wouldn't go so whether they didn't market quite Lincoln in general or the subscription sorry we're going for a question there they got some neat looking cars\nBecause everybody's been experimenting with this for the most part on the high end\nI write I write whatever I seen somebody come out and say hey for seven Ninety nine a month you can choose between a cruise and uh and you know go down the line right but uh that'll be interesting to watch because I think that the vehicle manufacturers\nIs a group of their ownership somewhere that's got to be intrigued by the fact to say let's owned the car let's control the car right let's let's not\nGet sued by a third party because they're they've got our car or it's our car and uh let's let's control of this stuff and\nI'm just going to really watch that real close because when you when you interject tell them addicts\nAnd in order ... ship experience which is basically a long term rental like rice said\nIt'll be interesting to see how the market adapts because there are a number of people that they've gotten so used to doing a lease that they are okay it was never really owning their car mhm to them it's just part of their expenses of their life or will they take it a step further and say you know what I'll to\nElise like this are of a a subscription to and I get to switch cars you're going to try and raise the money if I remember correctly I mean it was a it was\nElise like this are of a a subscription\nTo and I get to switch cars you try and raise the money if I remember correctly I mean it was it was I Want to say it was in the Fifteen hundred dollar range and the Cadillac deal per month and Porsche was doing it too there were like three or four majors that were then this is something to watch I I just think\nYou're going to see a lot of conflicting opinions and it's all going to be on the probably the wherewithal to the that the\nManagement or leadership has to stick with it to see if we can get to where it needs to get and what will the next generations of buyers will just be okay with it or they used to paying X amount of dollars for their cell phone and ... for a lot of other services that they have in their life will they put their vehicle on that same list\nAnd the higher levels I remember they even had like a\nService like concierge service where you could say I want to switch today and when you went out from work the right car would be parked in your in your spot\nThat that was what I Would need I think to make that way I Would I Would go oh I can switch anytime and I don't want to drive all the way over there to switch\nYeah they just said that they are in in California where they did their pilots they have little demand a mini that signed up cancels after one or two months\nAnd they have no plans to discontinue the programs says but they're gonna have to altered a little bit mhm uh they've been surprised how few people are genuinely interested in the ... in this type of ownership Robert Parker Lincoln stricter marketing sales and service\nPulled automotive news in Lincoln ... if you'd asked me a year ago I would've said this is the next big thing a lot of people are struggling to make the math work\nIt seems like for a while there and it ... and maybe it's just in my selective\nMemory of of a whole condensing a whole year into a smaller amount of time or something but there was a while they were we were talking every week about subscriptions or this company is a driverless car this company's electric\nThey just doesn't seem to be that\nIs it because those are just started now and we're seeing what happens and it just seems like that stuff is all driverless stuff or did my Facebook algorithm change one thing that I had this I saw\nA drastic drop in the autonomous a type stuff which a lot of the electorate were autonomous stuff that we're kind of one hand in hand we saw big drop when the when the deaths occurred\nRemember the ... part of it I I I think they would have I think a lot of it has to do with the political climate that's there's all kind of partner together all about the ... when he got out of the law you as a political climate and and that just in general the narrative ... a few years ago as\nYou know I mean there's ... there's more of a push to say you know what let's get these auto manufactures a chance to develop something with the internal combustion engine let's you know let's look at the raw materials differently and that in the news\nThe news changes so fast and we've got so much other garbage to\nBe news stuff right now\nThat you know who just who cares about car do I want to do a story on autonomous cars we don't have time we're just doing breaking news this half hour yeah just right now what's your feeling alive but if you're an eight six six five nine for for one five oh that's a number you can call twenty four hours a day\nI this is Joe and I was from in Redmond, Oregon\nI've got a few thousand green cord green fifty six liter power grow\nWhen I'm gone over forty five miles an hour and I'm just quoting the throttle at a certain position just to hold the laws just kinda falls on its face but as soon as I wrote my vote on it\nDried off round real good wondering if you had any ideas on that\nIt could be a or there's tons of things that could do it but it's it sounds like you may be one of the first places we'd started looking at our shop would be at the fuel system in that\nBecause if you've got a an issue where it can't provide proper fuel delivery whether it's the actual fuel flow or a problem with the fuel control like in sector or a masterful cents or something like that it can give you that lug at a real light\nThrottle but then when you hammer down on it it dumps it in and it goes\nAnd feel flow is an important issue on any diesel and for a lot of folks that go into performance diesel that's one of the things they have to modify\nIs the fuel flowed they'll add a fuel proper raider or different things the fuel system to make sure that they always have\nA solid consistent non ... flow of fuel coming into the system\nAnd ah sometimes even a a crack in a in a fuel filter housing or a can cause problems like this and it's a base issue that can have a result that might turn on some sort of a trouble light or things like that but it's it's more in the uh [noise] I guess the the the the general running of the engine\nThe report but it might be worth of of Seventy five dollar flyer to see if it you know if you could buy if you could find a cover and buy it and just confirming has that so annoyed on it at all parts\nAre still on it that you might find a good one because it was just electronic but it just happened to be a high failure rate item the coil fails inside\nBut you can go to ... park try looking up a carburetor\nAnd believe it or not they still have a partner before it ... there was a hundred and eighty five million pieces on there I'm going to guess that there might be someone out there that still has a carburetor or you might be able to look up maybe a an engine and seems to me has an engine from that make model on the shelf and then called up and see if you could talk about buying the carburetor off of it\nThere surely not going to say the so annoyed for little or nothing unless you were willing to pay them yeah a a decent price to take that one part off but that would be an idea\nBecause there's still a lot of these cars running around and the non rust belt areas of our country that are on the road and working shrines with these parts and they it's it's kind of amazing when you look around you'll see Honda's from the seventies and stuff if the body didn't rushed out in the engine kept going they just\nHave you ... have you tried ...\nYes I Am I okay ... and I've tried rock ... my local auto parts store that it'll that type of thing that I haven't had any luck in all I have thought about retrofitting with an adult rock carburetor but the trouble is that I got a ... a cake manifold who 'cause it's just the two barrel car\nRight and they do at a ... makes them two barrels but that that set up would be different\nSteven thanks very much for the call eight six six five nine for\nFor one five I'll talk to David a

with on my daughter's truck for\nPretty much oversight she's had it um it's the truth out of the section east on titan that comfort averted so she can drive it from a wheelchair so she has like a lot of after Marvin stuff on that truck lifts doors at a remote control that type of thing\nAnd you know we get the bad weather um and it all maybe a slightly below on a weekend or something she usually doesn't go anywhere it's used for word five days a week it was such a couple of days it doesn't want to start because the average I mean they're just that much tougher on when she's not using it um\nI was told and they'd be looking at all battery would give me a longer period did\nDid you just wanna make sure I heard what you said did you say cold weather problem\nIn the beginning biologist if it's set for a couple of days that you know the average is altered it over\nAnd I have already bought you know the biggest battery I can get you know for their for the\nCall I just want to make sure I heard over a cold water yeah and that's why after we were both of you know they're like oh what's this about but it's all winter cold while apparently called\nWhy they're called me and I mean if I put it on and you know if I ever survey cold on the weekend to she doesn't drive for a couple of days\nI'll put it on a trickle charger and I will be fine on Monday morning I'm well if it's just\nI've heard like a gel battery might ah last longer as ...\n... yeah the the ATM batteries the absorb glass Matt batteries are\nFar superior than in every way to a standard lead acid batteries that cars came with were since the night early Nineteen hundreds of ... they are made to be able to take that heavier discharge and full charge\nOr without affecting the the electronics at the vehicle\nMultiple times\nAnd if you've got a vehicle first we gotta make sure we you know do we have an extra draw the\nThings that were there for it on it so is there a parasitic leak that into and since the vehicles been modified you do have a number of components that could have a silhouette engaged or something that could be drawing it down and so on\nAll the time and we we have our own employees that have these vehicles\nThat have the same thing they've got with remote controlled doors and lifting things there's a lot of things that stay energized even when the vehicles completely off in your way for it they don't go to sleep because they need to be activated at a moment's notice with the push of a button so\nIf I had a vehicle like this I Do the same thing we did back when we used to do a lot of stereo equipment accessories and stuff and cars\nI Would have not just the one battery but I'd have to batteries in that vehicle and I would use the jail a GM batteries in that since you've got a truck\nHe's got more places to put it you can put the one battery under the hood and then you can have a battery in the back of the vehicle as well and if you wanted to get real\nFancy with it you could contact a company that does after market stereos and remote car stars and stuff and I have seen\nYou could contact a company that does after market stereos and remote car stars and stuff and I have seen and I've done myself systems where you'll have the one battery in the front you have another battery like let's say you're mounted in the bed and you put a battery isolate are in it and when it's isolated\nWhen the keys off it's drawing no power from that second battery all the excesses were drawn off the one battery but then when you crank it you're back battery can go just to the starter so that you how you have your cranking power there it's not being drawn down at all\nBut you still have to have a minor amount to get the the key to engage the light up the gauges if you did at least do that it'll fire up and crank and charge both\nBut before he he he does want to figure out if there he's got to make sure you have an artificial dry is going to be a matter of getting to the fuse panels with the battery off find the apple and then find out if you got to encourage check every circuit to see if you've got average flowing through it if you do have one then look look at that circuit to make sure we don't have something that is engaged that should not be\nAnd I would recommend a digital battery maintain are regardless when you say trickle charger I I just wanna make sure it's not the old school trickle charger a lot of the new vehicles that don't get driven a lot I Know my parents have got a Corvette it came from the factory with a battery maintain or do they play until\nTrend battery tender it's a brand is a good unit thanks very much for the call we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back on the other doesn't show under the hood has a
