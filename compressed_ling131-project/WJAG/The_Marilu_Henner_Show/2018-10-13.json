nordstroms here to do the same welcome ... thanks for tuning in so we can help you tune up I'm Chris started here to answer your calls at eight six six five nine for for one five\nOh the under the

dependable and on the road long\nLet's talk to Steve Steve you're on the under the hood show what can we do for you\nA high a I got an old nine Chevy work truck with a four point three basic Senate and every once in a while while I'm driving the a temperature gauge goes to zero\nThe indicator on the dare says the engine is\nHot and the atheist off a and I hear the AC fans\nCome on and it'll run like that until the next time I shut it off and turn it on again and then temperature gauge works fine I've also had a scanner that I put on to read the temperature when that occurs and the temperature is normal with the scanner reading\n... but I get zero reading on the actual gauge inside track\nAll right well\nWe've had a we've had a few of those that have had problems with with two things we've had the um\nInstrument clusters fail in there so they're not getting the they're not deciphering the data from the\nEngine computer correctly it ... it reads that you're reading the scandal and you can see what it says whatever it says on that scandal was what should be transferred to the gauge we used to have separate sensors one for the gauge and one for the engine temp but now we just read one engine cool in Tempe censor\nPull that into the computer than the computer through the data bus like cable TV sends it out and it it reads it and\nI Would go to the instrument cluster data your stand to read that and see what it says because of your engine computers says we're at two hundred degrees that instrument cluster data should say two hundred degrees therefore if you're\nThis will be gone now do you remember it's only ten percent of the few mhm so the ten percent evaporates quicker to get the\nThe Ninety percent gasoline still evaporates at the same rate as the hundred percent get okay Fifteen little more well Congress and the ... and all those guys at all obey perverse or it's going to evaporate faster so it's you know problem in the summer because we don't want it polluting the air\nLet's hold on let's not use that voice you know if we're going to try and [laughter] oh that's right we've got to be nonpolitical well the powers that be have determined that the hope still up there huh now so it was determined that yes it evaporated in warmer it is the faster it evaporates so winter months were what you had\nHere's the here's the issue though and see if see if\nYou guys are all in our radio lander are with me on this\nAll the signs UC say safe for use in two thousand and one model vehicles enough that's the way it's being promoted so used correctly it's going in your two thousand and one a vehicle or if they're worried about evaporation\nAll vehicles made two thousand and one up and quite a few of them that go over to them that are one hundred percent sealed fuel systems there is no evaporation it's called an evaporative admission system which we talk about on this radio show all the time\n'cause they'll gets problematic from the time they don't\nWant the gasoline evaporating into the year because you will if your cars parked without a gas cap for a long enough period you're going to lose that which pollutes the air but also costs you money in your wallet right take a long time but still you leave a Gaskins sitting there were no cap it's gonna evaporate so they keep it in a sealed containers they seal all this stuff up\nSo it's not a problem so\nNow with that said and so you kind of know how that works going to it year round\nI mean there's all sorts of stuff you can you worry yourself about how it affects the economy and stuff but as far as your car goes 'cause there's not a motor so\nIt's not gonna hurt a thing it's not going to change anything for you as far as you know when you put it in your been put in ten and there for years and I got I'm going to crack another secret which I've been doing for a long time and some people still look at me and my shop like what when they have if you're ...\nEighty eight on it it's ... Fifteen\nThat was the like coach secret code word for you Fifteen so you may have been put in your vehicle this whole time I talked to a gentleman earlier this week had no idea that he had been putting he Fifteen in his vehicle the whole time\nAnd he was and then when he checked he goes oh my gosh I really was I didn't know that didn't change a thing\nSo it is going to change and don't I wouldn't be surprised if in the next twenty Thirty years we see even more things with fuel\nSame cars were making in America are being sold in Brazil\nOr where they have a mandate I Believe it's one of the seven or twenty nine percent in all the fuel now in everything and most of their stuff is even higher than that but they've been doing it for a long time because they're\nAn and I don't think about foreign countries much but they had a lot of corn and stuff so there that's where that comes from\nReally as consumers and as an automotive show we want to know the consumer part we want to know was something hurt my car and how much is going to cost me and how much is it going to save me and as an automotive show we want your Carter runs good and we want you to save money\nAnd we want you to understand so don't worry directly ...\nDon't worry and if you do if you get on the Internet and you're looking to find out the truth about whether it's an all or something else\nDon't go to um one side of the coin you know the other which would be ethanol industry or gasoline industry the oil companies\nGo to independent studies a lot of colleges have done lots of independent studies on everything from\nWater to toothpaste to gasoline and that's and all those studies typically going to give you real facts to let you make decisions because you're smarter than those people that are trying to tell you what's there but\nI don't think it's going to be a I don't think anybody's going to see in in ten years from now people are going to go what what has always used them [noise]\nEight six six five four four one five oh let's talk to Steve Steve you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\nYeah I Would say I have a two thousand and one and a accents without one for six leader for selling or in it in a fight speed\nAnd it has been getting starting problems I uh can guide at several where I can go into a store or something will come back out and it'll turn over like crazy but will fire 'em I wait maybe another hour\nCome back get it starts right up no problem whatsoever I'm I have replaced the ... but they shouldn't censor the camp position to enter the coil packs a plug\nThe wires and it still does it kind of wondering if you give me an idea what to try to why did you replace the items that you did\nAh well I went online and just did a a a search for issue\nWhy did you replace the items that you did\nAh well I went online and just did a a a search for issues with starting and I I figured those are the places to start and they\nThey work that expensive ... so\nYou know and that you know what I didn't ask that opinion the quarter but that is a common thing that happens where people will say you know what I Know I can do this this part's not that expensive I'll give it a try but what they haven't done yet at that point is spent any energy to find out what it wouldn't start what what was missing\nWhat what what you didn't have the you didn't you didn't know whether you had a electrical or fuel problem at that point when you start putting those parts on correct\nThat is correct\nSo and when it's going to bring it back to ... is his site if if he saw the vehicle to service center and it was able to be duplicated like that which is always the tricky part oh yeah you know if it's duplicated in at all in the hour it does it on ... yeah that\nI got some day that'll do it and other days at well well we're just all of a sudden on a whim decided that hey I don't want to go anywhere today\nWe're working on a Monday Carlo and one of our guys just found it after I had been there for three weeks and of course it's a it's a kids' car so he's plugging dad dad can they've had my car for three weeks what kinda shop businesses like\nDude it doesn't do it every day well it doesn't matter there ... there should be able to figure it out like we don't want to just start throwing parts when you\nStarted that I pictured attack going out and going hey there's a Monte Carlo here that's what I pictured [laughter] not you\nKnow I mean and that's why that's a myth perception that's like you can now if if I fix that car and I give it back to you Chris what's your car and you ... your car they say that your car\nWhat happens if you tell your friends\nHey where's your carbon Christ or to do it but to show up it's been there for three weeks for them to go to [laughter] ah what are they gonna thing but now if you tell them well you know what this is the car that remember used to lead me stranded and I've I've been coming into work late for a month\nYeah what's your deal how can we can show up to work on time well with my car about one side of every thirty starts off he won't crank\nSo it doesn't go so I took it to them and of course it did the same thing and they're not driving every single day so it was really hard but finally they figured it out the genius is that the shot found the problem whole different perception isn't it but at the same exact results will this architect found it\nHe was working on it and finally we got to die and it did it a few times in a row\nSo he fired up again these starts touching wires real lightly moving around to see if there might be a short and he touches a computer and it dies\nStarts up such as the computer again it dies or like a hot so we figure out it had a computer problem\nGetting figuring out what we've lost that's the that's the thing when this thing was losing sparked fuel everything was shut down because computers\nSo it wasn't any one thing you could pinpointed on\nNo I mean it would just go wacky but it turned out to be a computer computer can do that fuel pumps can do that like Shane and said you got to find out what are we losing are we losing spark are we losing fuel and that can be so tricky when they get to this I've had cars myself I've had to drive for a year or two\nBefore I found out what it was because it just wouldn't ACT UP enough for me\nTo find the cause and find out what was going on I had the problem with my diesel truck I set on the air before like you let it go that long but it it wouldn't ACT UP just occasionally when I was tone it would do weird things and then\nFix that Steve thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk to ... you're on the under the hood show what can we do for you\nYes I have a question for you um you're just talking about the eight Fifteen gas\nI've heard of any ...\nPrior to two thousand they like a Ninety eight grand free or an eighty eight Chevy Truck you cannot run that\nWell that's ... that that is not a here's the thing they're they have\nWe tried to tried to come up with a generality that you have to cover most vehicle because pretty much everything made\nFrom two thousand one up all the systems are sealed you're perfectly fine there were some trucks and stuff that we're not I'm completely sealed up admissions wise and stuff until that time so that's why they came up with that number but for the most part or\nAnything that is a fuel inject multiply poured fuel on jak yeah multi for fuel injected electronically control the ignition and fuel will work fine so uh a Ninety eight grand prix yeah no problem a Nineteen I'm\nYour ground if you've got power ground on your boat was burned out which is unlikely to have every one of them out but one of the two will be gone either you're missing voltage at the switch\nOr somewhere in between because he got a broken wire that use the ... circuit on the back like the Ford pickup she used to use ... like a little printed printed circuit on the back and those can break you can have a little break and there were more the wire plugs\nInto the back of that gauge I think that one's got around plug with the pins but that back and breaking not connect\nGrounds can do it too and that dashed but um where the radio goes in that car make sure that that wire that goes that same color wire that goes to the back of the radio is not a shortage or in the ashtray that the ashtray light is not shorted and in cause and that thing to have a bad circuit that'll do it to\nA couple of things to check if\nIt was right other question for you to keep us in the LA well does that mean\nThe oil is\nIt sure does does it matter\nOkay I have to walk out that's not\nBad no that's what it is thanks for calling thanks for the call al eight six six five nine for for one five oh what else was caught your attention in the automotive world having news ... news\n... news have you like Chevy Trucks and you like for ... twenty Nineteen Silverado we gave you a little wind that it was going to be coming out with a four cylinder engine option well\nYeah I don't know what do we got going out of that four cylinder engines that makes me nervous when I hear they're talking about\nAn engine that's going to be twenty miles per gallon highway\nA twenty miles per gallon city twenty three miles per gallon highway a eight feet automatic trans or you're going to get a lot more here so you can get this thing moving but it's over\nThree hundred Horst [laughter] we're in this turbo charged engine now\nIn that particular story that they did it say the toying capacity or not\nNo they don't but we've also got a to point seven ego boost in the Ford which is of the six ... six were just talking to an engine with you know a\nBigger displacement inside because we're putting to point seven leaders of displacement in a force owners compared to to point seven and a six or eight what I mean you could make a to point Seventy eight you could make a to point seven one cylinder engine if you wanted to I just have a huge ... helper big stroke yeah I mean so\nYou can do those things a lot of it has to do with heat this patient and the block size and stuff like that the Ford is still going to get you a little more uh by means of talking and horse power not a whole lot more but still we were looking at three hundred and ten horsepower and three hundred and forty eight foot pounds of torque out of a four cylinder\nIf we go back to a five three engine or think about that I mean the five three not too long ago was like three hundred and Ninety five or yeah or rent or own spirit horse power yeah in a five\nThree V. eight so we're talking to a four cylinder with the same amount of power\nSo it is yet to be seen how well these hold up when people over told them because they get in them and say wow this things got a ton of power less poll like we always have and overdo it um when you're when you're pushing a five three V. eight hard\nAnd they run a little warmer and it just doesn't go real hard but when you're pushing a turbo charged engine really hard things get really hot turtles you generate a lot of heat oh yeah um I remember a buddy of mine with one of those four cylinder turbo lasers in uh\nNineteen eighty four five and push that thing heart and yeah it went like a V. eight trying to push it hard with super high rpm but the turbo melted pieces wouldn't the injured and destroyed it so that's not good you know that was way overloaded everyday driving the thing would have been fine for at least thirty thousand miles right\n[laughter] and tell us when our little wearing an adequate headed fifty thousand but he took that\nThing I'll while it was still under warranty you know it's it's all how you drive but I think it's neat the options that are coming out and what we're getting and just to see trucks that are getting into the you know passing\nThey want to live forever this'll be a great option for some fleets that need a full size pick up bad\nTo be able to put light things for the job site in ... they're not pulling the construction trailer they're taking a few guys to work there and they're put something in the back and let's be honest the great thing for the guy who wants to pick up truck that really needs a mini van [laughter]\nI mean I made it out or they are a huge part of yeah that's a huge part of that pick up market now is people who just want to drive pickups they don't need to pick up they just like pick ups and they want to drive the curious to\nSee what this is going to be available and they're showing the half done now but will it be available in a um\nKnow of other half ton Ford or long box truck I say I think there will be I recorded on you know what can I think it'll end but we pretty runny nose and that'll be six selling their stock oh no we need to fix still in there for the full time yeah we'll see what happens
