what are you what do you add to it\nSo you take something like inspired to that we all know technology fails and when that happens all the other guy we're establishing a listing parachute launcher okay a trigger\nOkay that makes a lot of sense because that is one of the big concerns for people you know uh we hear all these stories about you know Amazon Watch you drowned delivery at UPS aunts to drown delivery and yeah I think a lot of us\nMaybe some of us are a little bit older are having visions of drones crashing into each other and this guy and then all the falling down on my personal had

business that you had a problem you need solved and solved it so who your customers now is it other some entertainment sort of a customers or is it all kinds of businesses\nSo basically anybody\nShe's now a having to defend\nEddie ... which we call it an event at the Georgia capital\nIn Nineteen Ninety two when she was a freshman in college in which they burned to the Georgia State flag\nUh it had the Confederate symbol on it and the protest and she was taking part in at that age\nWas about that exact thing it was about that symbol and it was about asking the state of Georgia to remove the Confederate symbol from its state flag\nWhy is this even being brought up now\n... first of all the fact\nIt whatever she was Twenty years old then or whatever it was like twenty Nineteen whatever it was was already politically active and already cared about her state says volume's because Brett\nAt the same age was jumping on girls and slamming beers and he's on the Supreme Court now\nTreat a Stacey Abrams was out protesting and you know taking you know America's rights to the steps of the capital's saying I have a right to protest and this is what I'm protesting and she was protesting a symbol of hate\nAnd she's having to defend us right now while she's running for governor or you for real once again Georgia has bubbled up to the national discussion\nOver this issue Fox News talking about it and CNN talking about it and it's really interesting um just to give you a sense of the way these two outlets see this issue if\nYou just look on line and I'm just going to read the headlines Fox News headline on this topic is this Georgia democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams helped torch state flag during college protest\nThoughts that that's the headline if you're a headline surfer you're like oh my God she's a burner that\nShe doesn't respect the stage he should've because I'm just saying if you just surf the headlines if you read the story actually truth be told the stories on both Fox News dot com and CNN dot com are pretty similar but that's the Fox news headline this\nHeadline a\nIs if I could get to it I'm trying to get to it is Stacey Abrams defends presents at Nineteen Ninety two burning of Georgia State flag so they're giving you they're a little more contacts with Nineteen Ninety two she's defending it and then right in the first paragraph\nOf their story they include on the CNN website that it had the Confederate symbolism on the flag and that is what she was protesting\nSo this is a classic example of two outlets\nEssentially truthfully telling the same story but one you know sort of airing in defense of the person in the story and the other airing on the side of sort of leaving an accusation out there against the person in the story truth be told\nIf you look at the fact I'm pretty sure both stories are factually correct\nIt's the impression and it's the idea\nUm that that she is even having to defend us which by the way as far as I Know and I don't I don't have the full background here but my understanding as somebody found this and they bubbled up on social media and that is where it started from now did that happen just with some you know anti democratic a\nPerson somewhere in the country who happened to care enough about making sure that Brian Kemp want to do this did it come from the ... campaign itself who knows\nBut really that's laughable\nShe should not have to defend that um that is a symbol of hate and by the way there was another story I Believe it was in the wall Street Journal today about how some in the north are now using the Confederate flag\nAs a symbol or for their groups ah for white\nNationalism and all of that so moving it out of the south altogether um and and now starting to use it just to propagate hate a ... you know up north so [noise] that's an issue that I Would love to just have ended once and for all and we're not quite there\nWay I Believe also again without having both story side by side in front of me I'm the while it is true and it's also very valid but the Fox news story also includes the fact that she is one of the ... Abrams is one of the people who wanted a some of the Confederate Confederate imagery to come down in various places in the state of Georgia so\nUh again I'm quite sure that her base could not care less about this and in fact would celebrate this\nAnd Kemp space will find this as reprehensible as you know the day is long so there you go welcome to Georgia and welcome to the United states\nCirca circuit now [laughter] circa now yeah ah\nLots going on I just wanted to share that local story because I feel like we are bubbling up\nRegularly now on the uh on the national said what's really interesting is that congressional race it got so much attention the special election we had\nA to fill what was the Tom Price the seat between Karen Handel and Jon Ossoff that she is Karen Handel is actively having to defend that seat and is you know being a left you know having to be reelected in the midterms a\nAnd Lucy McBath is running against her in that district and we're hearing nothing about that almost nothing and it was such big news I'm back in the in the day so there you have a race between two women ah\nOne you know very carrying those done I think the best she can to sort of walk a line between ... supporting the president and not going all out supporting the president um but mostly she's tried to keep quiet\nAnd ah you know Lucy McBath obviously the underdog there she was known and she's having to uh to fight in a district where Jon Ossoff had so much national money uh but now the race that everyone's watching as the given a four hour is not that congressional district\nWill just comes down to the imagery of it all really at the end of the day and the imagery of the the districts race was the Democrats are going to try and take a traditionally Republican seat right he went all out trying to do that\nAnd now it's you know a Democrat is going to take a wouldn't say traditionally Republican to the kind of has it been but since the big party flipping the sense that has been pretty solidly red so now the Democrats are going to try and take a\nVery red governors' seats and they've tried to push it to the headlines and the Republicans are fighting back\nIf there's no fight in the district between Lucy McBath in in ... handled and you don't need to throw money at it don't need to put headlines on it 'cause I'm not going to sway anybody yes Olivia's\nRight and there's a lot of um talk about her you know somebody told me the other day and of course you know you never know how true some of the stuff as but somebody told me the other day that um they're you know there are ways that the federal government can strike back at states that don't\nDo what they want you know by cutting federal funding to the states for various things\nWhich I don't think it's as simple as just deciding not cutting you a check this month you know I mean they have to do more than that to make that happen but there is some fear apparently a amongst voters that Stacey Abrams wins the the the race and as governor that Trump will retaliate\nOr against the state by trying to cut some federal funding to projects because you know the state didn't support him by supporting camp uh\nAgain I don't know how true that is and how much power that really um is there and that way I Do know there are a lot of projects in which you know we all all the states want and vie for federal funding um\nI Hope that's not true and if that's found out I mean you know the AJC just as a side note\nHas been very dogging going after America seem read I've always sort of been a fan of and I kinda stopped covering all the stories at this point 'cause it just seems it seems bizarre to me it's just like there I mean he's been out of office now for a long time this let's move on a but that's neither here nor there my point is if they want to be that dog it on that topic\nAnd and something like what I just said were to happen you know if if the federal government were to to push back on any state that\nYou know flipped and elected a democratic governor\nI'd love to see the newspapers go after that um because I think most Americans aren't even aware that that's something that could happen um except for people that are scared if you're if you've heard that and it scares you and then you go and vote for the you know the you know the Republican side because you're afraid you might lose federal funding that's terrible\nVote on the merits of the candidate period um that's it I mean all that other nonsense is just exactly that nonsense\nA hundred and ten billion dollar deal it could be as high as a hundred and ten billion\nBut so far are the Saudis have only signed up for I\nI think it's half a million or something like that or know several million I'm Sorry not a hundred and ten billion [noise] oh I'm Sorry let me correct myself here\nBecause I'm reading to different numbers and all integrated in the same story and bring the jobs numbers and the sales numbers I Apologize on ten billion is what Trump is claiming fourteen point five billion is actually\nThere have been a letters of offer and acceptance so we it's not like the hundred and ten billion is all signed up and done but the president literally said uh\nWe got this hundred and ten billion dollar job that everybody wanted and we got it and it signed and it's not only fourteen point five billion of it as a time so that would be a giant exaggerations excuse me for getting the numbers wrong on that the other numbers or how many jobs this alleged a hundred and ten billion dollar deal is going to create\nI don't know if it's a lie if you change your teen Everytime but here's what the president says in terms of number of jobs\nForty thousand jobs here for a hundred and fifty thousand jobs\nAs five hundred thousand jobs to six hundred thousand jobs maybe more than they do that [noise] ...\nYeah it's not a million jobs\nThe first number he threw out forty thousand jobs was clubs that was the most accurate um the U.S State Department I Believe is saying it should be tens of thousands of jobs not hundreds of thousands of jobs and certainly not over a million jobs\nSo we're going to let the Saudis go we're going to let them get away with murder and journal last\nFor tens of thousands of jobs and fourteen point five billion dollars well everyone has a price apparently that's ours\nFourteen point five billion dollars and tens of thousands of jobs for that kill whoever you want in fact don't even bother just right as a fourteen point five billion dollar check and you can murder whoever you want [laughter]\nYeah [noise] ah it's disgusting honestly it's so disgusting what's going on and again I mean the lines are just one after the other\nEnd and by the way Trump also in addition to wanting to tell you wherever you want to tell you he thinks you're stupid anything she'll buy it and he also thinks that what every\nStory he wants you to follow your fellow so forget this Jamal 'cause sure gee we want to talk about that Trump would rather have you focus on the immigrants heading this way in the caravan from Central America we're gonna talk about that right after

these\nThis group of criminals and terrifying people are headed this way so be afraid be very afraid that's not afraid when I thought that now okay I'm\nTrump is making up stuff as he likes to do

um\nThere are three million Americans over three million Americans a thousand people making their way to the border and by the way they want all get here um and they will come to different places at

raiders are all about and today we're going to talk about one of them here here in town for independence is with us she is the managing director of the farm which officially\nAccording to the information I have in front of me a Comcast NBC Universal start up accelerator powered by boom town that I get that right or effect okay\nThat's a lot of it is a mouthful but what's good reason I Want to understand all of that so first of all the farmers go there is a start up accelerator yes so tell me a little bit about what the mission as\nSort of farm is it started to celebrate or it it's a twelve week program where we take about ten companies twice a year through a custom designed curriculum\nTo help them learn how to build and skilled their businesses especially so we're connecting with mentors we provide coaching we provide a skills like how do you do financial modeling what's a good marketing and branding plan\nSo we do all of that so that then they can test it or eight experiment do customer discovery and figure out is this a scalable business model or not and of course they've got to be very creative\nTheir ideas are innovative and they have to put in a lot of heartbreak over those twelve weeks\nAll right now there are a lot of organizations out there doing similar things so and there's all different kinds I think people who are not like\nReally in this world don't sort of know the differences um there are a incubator as accelerators co working space is a lot of people I think just think they're all the same but this is more of it you come in the program he leaves yes okay\nWith that said we have incubator co working a seller raider a space in a heart ... or the farm has all of those under our one roof and I'm ... and ... okay so the difference is just celebrate or it's usually a twelve we program or program for some specific time period to uh celebrate your business is the name\nCo working people can come in and at the farm they come and they get free space where they can essentially work on building their business\nPatient can be before or after seller raiders so our teams once they go through our twelve we could celebrate a program get free space for up to five months so they continue building their businesses and then we have the heart where lab which is really a typical for the seller raider because they're very expensive\nAnd typically only associated with colleges and universities the farm has set as well\nThat's cool because I was going to say I think Georgia Tech has I mean that at a T. V. C.\nUh but you're right a lot of the other places don't have that very cool okay so that thank you for breaking that down here I think it does get confusing for people who are a little in that world so now let me ask you about the program it's off the accelerator program oh I could ask you also about the Comcast NBC Universal engagement and boom town ... what does all that\nTime I know people go like well that's a mouthful as you said I saw the ... that's a nice universal and boom Tom part it's a fifty fifty partnership boom town is a ticket seller reader or has several tech accelerators that are located in Boulder they've been in existence for about five years we've now had about a hundred companies that are\nA roughly Ninety percent success rate meaning that five years later they're still in business and a growing and being successful\nContests NBC Universal obviously needs to explanation as to who they are but maybe explanation as to why they'd be interested in that check of salary to sound like well I guess that means universal is really a technology company\nSo they're doing everything they can to promote innovation and technology in the Atlanta eco systems specifically they want to grow that because they understand that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Barrett Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "23"}
