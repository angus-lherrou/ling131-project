frustrated with the world but they always brings me right back\nPositive stuff happening and there's so much positive that technology can do but I Love this segment\nAnd today protect you say we've got alley Kelly hanging out she is the executive director at the age um\nI I first of all I just have to say welcome alley thank you day and so happy to be here it's great to have you and the raise a cool name but I don't\nA lot of people know what it is so what's the very beginning what is the right\nSo the re is Eighteen miles of interstate eighty five and west Georgia\nOn the physical court or begins at the Georgia Alabama State line and an extent Eighteen miles and to Georgia\nEnding at exit Eighteen which is the city of La Grange his exit and this is all interstate Eighteen miles to the interstate so that's our court or that's our\nLiving laboratory that we build out and help manage west Georgia DOT partners in the federal government and advance tax firms focused on transportation technology\nOK so first of all before we dig into all of that because there's a lot there so he's got this living lab Eighteen miles of road uh interstate and where's all the funding coming\nFrom somewhere around ... there you go where if either one C. three nonprofit and we're actually working with partners in the public and private sector and an expansion of the pie three we've added philanthropy has the fourth pie and we're working in a public private philanthropic partnership\nTo use our foundation resources to help Georgia DOT other state your t.'s\nAnd the federal government find a new and better way forward with transportation by injecting technology and innovation that's at our fingertips ready to be utilized injecting it into an operational interstate\nSo is the goal to save money is it to you know keep the you know oh\nYou know save the environment is if you are you know make our rights more pleasant as it to help with infrastructure what are we trying to do\nIt all of the about look at me so it's saving lives because right now we're losing somewhere between thirty seven thousand in forty thousand American lives every year\nDue to traffic fatalities so number one saving lives um that achieving better outcomes for everyone yes that includes the environment but we're really focused on how\nKnow we just stick with the fact is that for a little while longer because it feels good you know\nYou just have to take a\nFrom all the negativity\nYeah and uh and I love having um alley here from the re because that's\nA classic example to me I'm\nJust of you know cool innovation although that is a big part of it but of\nStepping back in using outside of the box thinking like hey we've got all these miles and miles and miles of road oh I Know and it wasn't the way that came up with it as I said it was a French company but we maybe we could come up with solar panels that could go right on the road that can withstand cars and trucks driving over them all day will take up any space we're not already using for something and\nWe can offer you know\nA way for the DOT is across the world to make revenue from their roads how cool is that ... and ... and in addition using a totally clean source of energy\nI Am like bam and double bam you know that's amazing\nUm that is the kind of out of the box thinking that I Want us to apply to every problem we have\nEveryone from immigration to you know protecting our borders to whatever it is instead of just doing the same thing over and over and over again how 'bout some out\nBox thinking uh\nAnd I also love that it as a you know public private partnership at that you know we don't have to rely solely on the government you know we're not waiting around for the government to come up with this stuff because they want more saying you know hey we've got this idea it will help you long term government entity the OJ so here\nAll right anyway that's enough I could go on all day but I Want to get to some other techniques first of all a big announcements coming out of apple they have just unveiled literally just in the last\nHour a new eye pad pro and new max book air and the new Mac Mini so if you are an apple than you might want to go check all of that out I'm Tim Cook did a keynote and uh this time it wasn't that their fancy theater it was actually in Brooklyn at the Brooklyn Academy of\nMusic and um it's interesting because they just had their big announcement of the iPhones you know the iPhone ... S. X. as max and acts are placed a anyway I Know that's like a ... just like the traditional heads\nI I just the maiming ... understand you're trying to like stick to form a little bit here is maybe it's just time to start over like you know the I flown twenty we're just going to skip a lot started over something we can try new yeah you know there's there's like\nA whole other debate which we could have um about naming things but because you know the iPhone like if you you know windows for a while and went with a year now is a huge mistake\nKind of because then you're like well maybe it wasn't maybe it was smart 'cause if you called it an old one like if you if you were walking around in twenty eight team was still twenty Thirteen running on your computer you're like oh I guess this is old and I should get the new one um but I don't know it just didn't seem like it was really good\nYeah wasn't XP right rather than it was literally not us though [laughter]\nI don't know that wasn't good either a yeah I I kind of agree with you whatever they're trying to do with the S. and the south so long as the sole says iPhone people buy it I Know\nAnd also I feel like most of us don't know what all that means like we don't know what ... as versus acts are it's just too complicated\nThan just that that's the problem it's a ... you know it's real the numeral ... agree\nThat I I guess the official raspberry for me anyway um\nBut they just had that announcement in September and so then now right on the heels of at this new announcement here at the end of October\nA again a there now unveiling what they're saying is the biggest change to the eye pad since its inception eight years ago they say the new uh features play into Apple's mission to make the I've had more adaptable and appealing to a larger audience so we shall see if that really works uh the new eye pad\nPro is center it's about Fifteen Percent thinner than its predecessor doesn't have a home button anymore I think they did back to the phones here I got rid of the home button that worries me I'll miss the home button I'm ... I don't know just gives me a sense of security\nUm it also annoys me because I just bought a new I've had relatively recently for our show and now what now it's outdated [laughter] whatever I'm though they knew I had a pro also has that face recognition at all so has the U. S. B. C. which I'm sure a lot of people will be cheering instead of their own funky adapters which enough or any of that\nUh it has a pencil that Meg medically connects to the side of the pets they lose it just kind of cool um which also charges it automatically also cool so anyway some cool features they're\nAnd a whole bunch of new other new stuff as well as we mentioned also new ... and this is just makes me want to go over and buy stuff which is bad [laughter] I guess that's why they do it right All right there's other tech news I Want to get to a today also I feel like Iran mosque has sort of become like the Trump of tech world\nDare I say now that he's spewing hatred exactly although we kind of does but for him to hatred he uses pretty\nMuch all directed at the SEC and kind of short term investors [noise] um but he got himself in so much trouble doing that you think that he would like stop now so last week a Tesla posted surprising profit on the model three which was exciting news\nBut\nThis year so the shares of course you know that the stock market was like excited and stop when our share price on higher and then just yesterday you know I must went back on Twitter again and this time he was tweeting about his title and he said his titles were taken off the Tesla\nWebsite and he called himself now than nothing of Tesla he said I'm now than nothing of Tesla I don't know I don't know what he's doing and of course the shares are like bumping around every time he does that because people I was going on what is this unpredictable dude going to do next uh somewhat puzzling to those stories as well if you're an Iran must sandwich\nI Would say that I was I\nLike he's on probation with me a little bit right now I don't trust them you know when people start acting crazy you don't know what you're going to get and I appreciate the crazy at some level I Do\nA like a crazy genius nothing like it you know I mean that's we are a country of who has you know built ourselves on the back of crazy geniuses and I'm all about that\nBut it's getting a little too crazy\nRight the crazy genius has to have a nice balance the craving I'd get a little heavy\nRight it's like Sherlock Holmes has to have his a sidekick once the sidekick name right ... thank you [laughter] it's it's that kind of de needs as Watson delight temper him with\nRational right right and so that's like you know unless maybe needs to find himself a Watson you know what I'm thinking I volunteer for that I Wonder if I guess I Wonder if I could handle that I\nMight be a hard job I'm not going to lie I mean imagine trying to be Trump's Watson [noise]\nLike that's people have tried and [laughter] right but ah [laughter] I mean they\nBut I you know in any case you want to mask just cannot get himself off Twitter and in that in that regard maybe only in that regard he is he is just right like right there with our president uh okay also in tech news a couple of other things I Want to mention Facebook a\nAnd Google and other tech companies are looking at possibly billions of dollars owed in New taxes uh across Asia and Latin America it's all starting with Europe\nUh they're proposing new digital tax essentially on these tech giants which is sort of ties back to what we were talking about with the re and it makes sense in a way right because\nTaxation in the past was all about it was all product base\nBut so much is happening now in the digital world not just the commerce where you're buying products that are being taxed but where you're buying digital stuff you're buying ... you're not buying newspapers subscription anymore you're buying a digital subscription so if digital products are not taxing the same way that actual products are\nWhat happens so the um tax regulations are trying to now catch up to this because there is this idea that you tax where the value is but they're everything is so distributed now it's hard to even figure out where that is where is the value delivered\nRight it depends like what if you're living in another country and your companies in another country and you're buying let's say for example Amazon Web services cloud storage\nIs the value where your stuff is being stored is it where you are is it where the company like who gets the tax\nWrite so it's very complicated um but it's looking like companies like Facebook and Google and many others are going to start having to pay a lot higher taxes and there are a lot of people for this and a law against it because there is also a sense that hey we already paid corporate taxes on our ah\nYou know on our profit so we shouldn't have to pay this additional tax so that debate will continue to rage on a and we'll see where it lands so that a bit much\nCook
