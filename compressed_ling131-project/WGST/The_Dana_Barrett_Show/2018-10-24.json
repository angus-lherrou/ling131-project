off they heard it they had to go to a commercial and get out of the building [noise] um [noise]\nAs far as I Know they're still not back in their New York police on high alert there I'm checking out all media outlets in New York and then you have also all CNN outlets I think around the world are are on high alert as well\nAnd you have um\nPeople starting to weigh in about all of this including as some people in power um at least so far\nThe president\nSoared tweet is ... here's what\nWhat happened on that front Mike Pence tweeted a this quote we condemn the attempted attacks\nAgainst President Obama the Clintons at CNN and others these cowardly actions are despicable and have no place in this country grateful for swift response of a secret service at FBI and local law enforcement those responsible will be brought to justice and Donald Trump just re tweets that with I agree wholeheartedly\nReally the president himself can't even come out with a strong message of\nReally I agree wholeheartedly he tweets or to what Mike Pence said his daughter Ivanka sent her own tweet she said this\nQuote I strongly condemn the attempted acts of violence against President Obama the Clinton family CNN and others there is no excuse America is better than this\nAh she around to give gratitude to the secret service and law enforcement you also had Paul Ryan tweeting about this ah saying those behind such represents reprehensible acts must be brought to justice we cannot tolerate any attempt to terrorize public figures\nAnd also thanks uh the secret service\nAnd the national guard in the Capitol police and everybody else thinking that people to you know first responders essentially so\nBad speaker comes out with a full tweet Ivanka Trump comes out with a full suite president or vice president Pence comes out with a full suite and Trump the tweeter and chief the man who cannot stop tweeting can only reach weak in this circumstance\nCome on\nI'm sure it's because there's really no one for him to make fun of here like there's no when he can name call so he doesn't know how to have a tweet without actually mocking someone\nYou know um it has been a crazy twenty four hours\nAnd this is\nListen it's not that we haven't had crazies in this country all along you know we had the Oklahoma City bombing how many years ago now uh we had the bombing at the Boston Marathon\nA couple of years back so there there's been crazy is\nDoing this kind of thing for a long time we had what was it the anthrax scares or whatever so there there's always been people that are willing to um\nOperate in this way so by no means do I uh am I trying to police this bully on the doorstep of Donald Trump because I don't think it belongs they're crazy people are crazy people and that is true by the way when you look at mass shootings and all of that too I mean to some extent\nThere is no ... single blank there is no single source of blame it's not it's not violent video games it's not a name calling nasty\nPresident um to some extent it's just crazy how\nWe are in a culture that is so divided\nAnd so on civil that it's no wonder this what's happening in our culture\nRight now too which Donald Trump is either partially to blame or at least certainly taking advantage of it and and feeding into it\nYou know that we are not doing anything to dissuade this kind of behavior we're not doing anything culturally that would make people say this is not a good idea\nWhat again I recognize that you're not going to sway the crazy the crazies or the crazies um but there is a sense right now that the only thing that matters is money and that any kind of behavior that gets\nUs more money as a country as an individual as a company is fine because money is all that matters that's rat you don't have to be civil you can murder people and just\nMember them that's okay you can murder journalists just remember them oh good [noise] um sexual harassment whatever\nThat you can grab women by them you know whatever as long as you win in the end your actions to get there don't matter so for this particular\nCrazy or group of crazies that are sending these pipe bombs to CNN to

whatever names we want to call the ... and toss around you know lies and fake news and whatever we want that maybe action should matter right like physical proof of things has to matter\nIf the words don't matter then they stopped short right I mean something has\nTo actually matter let's assume that it's proof um and this administration has a very interesting relationship with I think about the Brett Kavanaugh situation the way the president\nContinues to reference Brett Kavanaugh on a fairly regular basis in relation to things that have nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh and Everytime he does it I think to myself man Kevin out right now it's just cringing he's like just mentioning my dad\nJust let me slide away into like quietness I'm I don't want to be in the media at all [laughter] [noise] uh\nIn any case getting back to ... when ... when it was this discussion of whether or not Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted\nDr Christine Blasey Ford the the answer by the administration and by the right in general why\nThere's no proof there is no cooperation there's no proof therefore it didn't happen and well maybe it happened but doesn't really matter because since there's no proof a and there's not concrete evidence of as we cannot\nHold it against this guy and we will go ahead and put him on the highest court in the land into one of the most important jobs in the land that's what we're going to\nSound forward into some of the things that are happening right now so we have this situation in Turkey in which the Saudi journalist democracy algae was murdered and dismembered into consulate by the Saudi Arabians stating\nThat like it's a fact because I feel like from all the evidence that I heard it seems pretty plausible that that is exactly what happened that the ... and now we know he was murdered the Saudis have admitted that I'm their story line up\nAnd there is a lot of evidence that they have on there is a ton of evidence that it was covered up\nNow whether or not we have evidence of the way in which the murder actually occurred but there's plenty of evidence there was a murder and it wasn't covered up there's a lot of evidence there\nBut the one that's really badly badly to do business with Saudi Arabia here's what he is still saying as of yesterday about this situation\nAnd see the facts first\nA look Saudi Arabia's a really great allies and one of the biggest ... maybe the biggest\nEssentially on the uh the bomb story that's been um happening since about I think it really um got the story got really hot probably about eleven o'clock this morning ten thirty eleven o'clock\nThis morning of course there is security at all of these locations I'm trying to block them down and make sure they're safe and that there's not any kind of second wave of packages coming and I'm sure everyone everywhere who feels like they might be a target or something like this is on alert right now\nSo [noise] um let's get to the upcoming midterm election\nIn a in a way that I have not seen probably ever and I'm saying that as a probably because I'd have to really think back but it is um election seems to be more divided along the lines of gender and race than ever before\nAnd\nThink that's really sad actually I'm the men and women are so far apart from each other or in terms of how they want the country run a and how they view what\nAnd politically and really what their priorities are and up and I'm\nI'm gonna generalize here but that blacks and whites are so similarly\nI'm divided or opposed to each other and what they want for the country and this is I'm a huge generalization because obviously there are black Republicans are they're white Democrats and so a huge generalization but statistically speaking there is a very big divide\nAnd uh it's being used it what's worse than the fact that it exists is that it's being used as a weapon the race card in particular a into races that have\nReally caught national attention our ... given a trail race here in Georgia and the given a frail race in Florida\nUm both of them in which both have a black candidate the racist rhetoric that has bubbling up is so\nDisgusting and horrible it makes me embarrassed to be American I mean it's just so wrong and it's twenty Eighteen\nIt's twenty Eighteen I mean can we not ... let me tell you are going to catch up on some of what's happening because you haven't heard that so Andrew Gillum who's running for governor in Florida is now being accused of 'em\nIs now being accused of taking a bribe essentially in the form of Hamilton tickets\nIn New York yeah so the thing is that Andrew Gillum went to New York with his brother and some other folks and was given a ticket to Hamilton allegedly by an undercover FBI agent\nAnd there's proof of that\nCan just point out that we are happily\nEndorsing people who have been accused of rape for office\nAnd happily endorsing people who on camera have body slammed another person and the thing that you know Congress men to office after being convicted of body slamming a reporter you are we\nReally going to be upset about the fact that Andrew Gillum got a ticket to Hamilton without paying for it allegedly\nDoes he really even need to take time to defend the fact that he paid back the ticket\nThat it was his brother that got him the ticket handed and the ticket as they were walking into the theater and that he paid it back later do really to defend that he didn't find any one he went to a musical in New York whoop de free can do\nBut they're coming from I don't know if you heard\nThis either and I don't even want to play it on the air 'cause it was so despicable but there is a robocall\nThat has gone out in Florida with this Amos and Andy racist rhetoric a to try to rile up or if you will a white nationalist base in Florida to come out and vote against Andrew Gillum these are the kinds of things that are happening um yesterday in our state\nThere was a whole drama that bubbled up with Stacey Abrams a about the fact that she was part of a flag burning in uh Nineteen Ninety two I think it was when she was a freshman at Spelman College um that she burned to the state flag\nBut she burned it my friends because it had the Confederate symbol on it she was protesting\nShe was already politically active at age twenty or whatever she was at the time and I said good on her but she's having to defend herself\nBut that she should even have to defend herself for being politically active when she was a freshman in college is ridiculous when you have the president backing Roy Moore\nAt the time when you have the president just days ago proudly talking about a congressman body slamming a reporter\nBut you know we better not we better not elect\nSomebody black 'cause that's terrifying I mean come on and then the gender issue is women on Wednesday I did say we were going to get to some gender stuff and I somehow got myself off on a ... but I feel like\nWe're seeing similar things with gender now we're not seeing is over of attacks on women but we are seeing a huge gender gap in what women want and what men want and we are seeing the Republicans I'm losing a lot of ground with women suburban women they say in particular\nAnd I I really I Know I keep harkening back to this but this idea of\nLess government or less government regulation less government interference in our lives fiscal conservativism lower that all of those things are things that I could get behind and all of those things are theoretically tenants of the Republican a party\nAnd yet\nThe Republican Party seems to have been taken over by the far right Christian conservatives and they are winning essentially I'm from a platform standpoint their issues of a abortion\nYou know taking abortion away abortion rights away from women and overturning roe v Wade I mean\nSome of those issues are are taking over the fiscal conservativism\nAnd so it's like in order to get them get aligned with fiscal conservativism you have to also get in bed with Christian conservativism and they're not the same thing Christian conservativism and fiscal conservativism or not the same thing\nSo there is no party\nFor all the people who want to have social liberalism and fiscal conservativism and they're truly should be because I still stand by the fact that that is more of us than any other side more Americans would prefer the government is stay out of our lives\nI mean when you really think about what the federal government was formed for why should they be involved in any of that stuff anyway\nWhy should they have anything to do with who can get an abortion or who can't\nA church can absolutely make that decision a church can absolutely say we condemn mess um ... we do not support this no and if you want to be a good you know fill in the blank whatever religion Catholic Baptists whatever it is you can't do those things well great do that all day long\nBut for the government to start mandating that\nIs not what the federal government was intended to do that with the state governments were intended to do either but that's a whole other we'll talk about another day [noise] um\nSo yes the less government yes less government spending yes but give me a candidate that can actually run on that stuff\nAnd not all the other bathroom bills and pro life style fan anti gay stuff give me someone who truly is about what Republicans were supposed to be about before they got overtaken\nBy the Christian conservative and then we can talk and we can talk also\nSide note I thought it was going to get to this and\nA cynic before we got on there and we literally have thirty seconds before the next a break\nBut I'm Talking to people you know dissing education and and ... so called elites education is a good thing we want to educate our kids we want them as educated as they can possibly be and do we want our kids to be going to use the word more elite than us don't we want them to be better than us\nIs it only okay to better yourself to a certain point and then you have to stop veteran yourself because then you're the bad guy what is that\nHow education and smarts and the ability to be successful and make money become a bad thing I find that puzzling\nVery puzzling all of that of course impacting this election cycle my friends we've got a lot more to talk about an hour or two it's breast cancer awareness month we're gonna get to that as well for the about [noise]\n... coming up on TALK radio six forty W genius\nReally sad you know we had a marketing a expert in here the other day we had a professor from Emory who teaches marketing we were talking about the fact that negative ads\nAre what work for politicians and the products\nUm by comparison do some of that but they do it in a far nicer and keep the airway right so you know you will see 'em you know sprint putting down varieties and ... and T Mobile putting down sprint or whatever the case may be but they don't do it by saying the other one is evil\nOr that we should go kill the other one right or that the other one you know burned down buildings you know we don't we don't do it that way they just sort of say like their land and we're better I'm so there is a bit of negativity that we buy into even in our normal everyday lives as consumers\nBut on the political side it's gotten so ugly and everybody keeps saying and this is the sad part is that it works so who can change that who is it up to to change that it's up to you talk to you as a consumer\nWrite letters to the candidates ask them to stop doing it don't vote for somebody who does it to access pick somebody who is above the fray teach your kids to be above the fray can you imagine if\nKids started trying to a negative ad each other like mess in elections for you know the student\nPresident can you imagine um how about this in the ... the debate club instead of actually having a debate they just picked on each other and call each other names could you imagine there just tossed out the rule book\nAnd they just said you know will use the same rules they use on the TV for the presidential debates and then they just you know it didn't answer the questions didn't make any selling points and just mocked each other and call each other out for things that are not true\nIn both of those scenarios school wouldn't stand for it shut it down so fast you had what's been there's no way that would be okay\nRight there used to be a time when the debate team was actually training to be a lawyer or for politics what is it now a joke\nI mean honestly what are you learning there how not to be in politics to actually researched the facts and know what you're talking about and prevent salient facts and and you know not attack your opponent like you're certainly not learning how to be a politician I mean maybe that still works in a courtroom I don't know luckily I haven't been in one in a while knock wood\nUm but uh you know\nIt's up to us we are the ones we are the consumers of all of this negative garbage and\nWe keep buying it the only way to stop that is to put other people in office the ones that don't do that [noise] the possible sadly probably not it is it ... affects [noise]\n\n\nBeing a marriage show coming up on TALK radio six forty

Alvarado joining us she is the executive director at turning point breast cancer rehabilitation\nHow are you Rebecca I'm good how are you I'm good thank you um for being here you know we were just talking a off air before we got on about how bad people are let's just start with us forget services for taking care of people with cancer\nBut it was just getting our screenings and making sure that we catch our cancers as early as possible and I say that's because I'm actually scolding myself right now on the air for everyone to hear\nA but I'm a breast cancer survivor I'm not even six years out five years is the magic number for people who have had cancer you know that and I made it in a five year mark\nAnd then I don't know what happened I got I got cocky and\nStopped going part of what happened is my benefits changed I Can't go to my my surgeon office anymore for my mammograms who I Love\nAnd um because otherwise I have to pay out of pocket so um I just didn't make my appointment until this month because I didn't feel like I could bug everybody else on the air [laughter] if I wasn't doing what I Need you so how about is the scenario I'm Rebecca are people not getting their their checkups\nSo it's it's very common that people that have had breast cancer before are actually less likely to get screened than women that have never had breast cancer and in fact women that hadn't had breast cancer are at higher risk of getting cancer just simply because they've already had it\nDo you feel like look I Know that turning point and we've had you guys on the show before and for people who are or maybe new to the show I'm involved with turning point I've I'm seed several of their events and I support them with our women on Wednesday events that we do and I believe very much and what you guys do\nBut I think one of the things people who maybe you haven't heard of turning point don't really know is that in addition to providing physical therapy and the things that you guys do this sort of a community or around turning point yes\nYes there's a huge community and support 'em you know we take women from the time that they've had their surgery typically all the way through their breast cancer journey so maybe radiation chemotherapy reconstruction different revisions that they may have\n'em and get them back to fully functional a range of motion getting them back to doing the things they love but we also help provide\nAn education and information um two women about how they can stay healthy and reduce their risk of recurrence which is really important that you eat right and exercise so there are two big things and then of course you get your screenings on a regular basis\nRight well and I love ... the reason I brought up the whole idea of community and the fact that it's more than just services is because I'm Wondering and maybe you can tell me if this is true or not is being a part of a community like that helps people go back and get those checkups it does it\nDoes it get work so I think part of what we want to do is build a community of support for people and we do that through um having our patients and their caregivers and family um come back to see as for educational events for fitness classes\nUm but they also uh remind each other that it's a really important to go and take care of yourself and and support each other when they may have a a down day or fear and actually going back in and getting their phone or their checkup that they might need\nRight and of course we want not just survivors to go and get their mammograms but every women and ah what is it you know what the ages now that you're supposed to get your first mammogram\nOr forty five ... all the time yeah forty five it's when you're supposed to get at annually yearly until you're on fifty four [laughter]\nAh but I think most providers are perfectly fine with women coming in and saying you know what I'm forty I Want to get a mammogram and they and they'll do it so you need to be your own advocate if you feel like you need a mammogram and that will make you feel more comfortable and protected then go yeah hockey or provider", "show_name": "The Dana Barrett Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "24"}
