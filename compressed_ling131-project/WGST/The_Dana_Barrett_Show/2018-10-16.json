of this story\nBut the argument was ... is showing is making it into a global thing and I said if they have the patches of the flag on their arm yeah they have the usa on the rocket and the and the

awesome\nWelcome to the new day by the way through the fancy ... thanks very rich hands when well first of all for the record KP and I've known each other for many years yes we're not counting any are how right he was my boss at one side of the muck the basketball has every right to have the [noise]\nUm or that's what everyone will that's fine we'll just go with that um but yeah I mean you have so many titles are that I don't even really know how to introduce you anymore but today officially we're going with the founder of shadow ventures correct okay so for people who haven't caught up with you on a while you give me the background on chateau ventures what are you guys do\nYes so we were classic venture capital fund but we have an incubator attached to it so we did a deal earlier this year with when you work um that allows us to really globally incubator owned company so instead of\nSeeking out start ups that are you know it didn't need capital it the right time which is almost impossible to time uh we engage with the very early we coached and we met them for free essentially um but they have to be selected and then the ideas we kinda are creating our and start ups to invest and so and\nYour start ups that are part of that community are all in and around don't tack\nYes so are a theory is you know the planet is dying no one cares a innovators worried about delivering pizza in ten minutes and things like that were kind of saying look there's bigger problems to solve okay I'm sort of saving the planet but to\nJust pick the all he'll be saving the planet\nI'm OK so obviously built packets sort of a newer term for people and I think you know we've talked about this on the show before I mean I think people are clear on things that are obvious them like health medical technology technology financial technology and all the\nAbbreviations that go with those syntax and med tech and whatever they're calling it this these days\nBut bill tickets just everything that has to do as building stuff right okay and innovation in that space\nOkay or theory is you know you build a building twenty percent of the building ends up in the dumpster\nLive that they have you know not totally turned it around and they've turned it around in a big way reputation wise with ah bringing in the new CEO at Travis Kalanick stepping away I mean he was just making things\nWorse day by every the longer he stayed there he you know one bad headlines after the next and now you know a Derek ... his name I butcher it every time and I apologize\nI'm is sort of has sort of turn that around and a lot of ways you know the only press he gets a sort of good press and they have made some decent decisions in terms of how to handle the various sexual harassment claims an arbitration and some things like that\nThey've done a lot of marketing which I Wish that wasn't all we needed a fancy boats make everything okay but it's sort of as\nSocietal they were like oh look at the nice commercial for ... gay Hoover it is\nUm but in any case that is sort of depressed they're getting now\nThey still have some more work to do to clean up but it's definitely ... out of the headlines but just so interesting you know just as a statement on society and the way we view things um if it's not in the headlines in a negative way we're kind of okay with it\nWhich I honestly just bringing it back to the the current headlines for a moment is really what I think the Trump Administration would like to have been around us Saudi Arabia story like they just want it to get out of the headlines and go away\nThey really don't want to focus to be honest because the more we we focus on it and we acknowledge something bad has happened the more likely to they're going to have to do something they don't want to do\nAnd that sort of true with the ... story too right if they can get it out of the headlines they weren't you know look they never really lost a ton of business but they did lose market share to lift\nCertainly in the midst of all of this I mean they certainly gave lifted opportunity a to step into their own power and they don't want to keep doing that they want people to just go back to the up and ... it's all okay never mind uh and there you go\nSo uh\nAnd and apparently under their new leadership there you know fairly successful at that so good on them I guess we'll keep an eye on that I feel like you know if it them is or or\nI certainly not as big butt in along the same lines sort of gig worker III and getting well known to a lot of folks in the cart uh\nMaking news there now valued at seven billion dollars seven billion dollars of course they are the on demand grocery delivery company and ah this is what's fascinating to me about an end to cart\nSo I don't know if you've ever tried it\nOr any of the other services that are like it or where they you you order your groceries and I would I'm going to lock the door dashes and the the restaurant deliveries into the same\nCategory or where you place an order of some kind and some gig worker\nGoes and gets it and generally speaking there are a couple of people along the line and this transaction\nSo there is the person who fulfill the order and if it's a restaurant generally it's the person at the restaurant has taking the order and reading it and fulfilling it and then there is the delivery person and they're usually two separate people and that's how insert started I think is one person doing it all shopping and delivering\nAnd then they switch the model and they have shoppers in the stores that stay in the stores and shopping\nBag things up and set them aside and coolers and they have the delivery people on Amazon delivery does at the same way\nAnd here's why what I'm getting through with all of this this\nIt's very convenient and yet it is the\nWorst service these services are terrible if anyone has tried at it's super convenient look I Know how tired we all are\n[noise] but every single time I have tried one of these services something is wrong with my order and it is not easy to fix it\nThe best that usually you can do is get your money back for whatever item was screwed up but here's the thing I just wanted salsa for my burrito I don't want to eat the burrito without the salsa\nOr I wanted to skim milk and if you brought me the whole fat milk I don't want my money back and to throw out a carnival that no I Want to skim milk I Need it for my movie tomorrow so\nWhat I'm getting at here with a scrape session is that if there is some innovator out there and this is not a technology well maybe there is a technology solution to this but\nThis is a problem I think that could be fixed for these companies and somebody could come along and how do these guys ... it's the carts seven billion dollar evaluation I'm telling you I could do it better if I had time if somebody wants to hire me all consult because think about this\nYou know and they can I think we had this conversation didn't we the other day a you and I did healthier yeah\nBecause well with restaurants it's a little bit harder because you're still relying on the chef to read the order and get it right and make sure they see the special requests or whatever it is and make a mess it up right or you know the person that's bagging if the food not to forget to solve or whatever that's a different story but when you're talking about groceries\nEverything has a bar code so it seems to me\nThat it should be pretty straightforward to have a scanner of some kind and to you know for the person who's picking the groceries off the shelf to scan the barcode from your order to make sure that they're getting the right item\nAnd it's because wasn't your issue that they got the wrong size yeah something\nLike last week I ordered um from it was a whole foods and so it was Amazon delivery and I ordered you know like a thirty two ounce bag or frozen strawberries\nFrom ice maybe and I got a ten ounce bag\nI paid for thirty two ounce bag and I got a ten ounce bag not the saying hey I Need the bigger bag and B I paid you for the bigger one so I complained and I got my money back so I got a free bag of ten ounce strawberries but the problem is I didn't have to go right back to the store to buy more\nAnd you just wasted a ton of money there by wasting the company's money this is not good for profits that it's not a good solution on either side so you know it seems to me that\nWas simple barcode scanner can solve the problem you scanned the order is it and then you scan the show is it and if it doesn't match right and then he scanned and that's one thing and then you scan the shelf and if it doesn't work\nLike this is I could do this I can walk around with a shopper and do the sound effects [laughter] done\nWell they've even got the ups on smartphones though where you can scan the barcode of an item and it will tell you where it costs leases that everything right there's a reason that technology can be incorporated\nRight and then things also happen on these on these apps where like you say I want you know as if they don't have this brand I Want to I Want you to substitute it and the person just doesn't do it again it seems to me if the if the picking of the items was innovated an automated in some way you could solve a lot of problems\nFor the customer and a lot of money for the store so I'm just putting this out there for you thinkers and ... and innovators are listening to our attacked Tuesday segment there could be an opportunity here to outdo a seven billion dollar company easy easy I really don't think it would be that hard I really don't\nIt wouldn't I mean the thing is I think that just comes down to the general training of the people doing it I mean are these people that are doing the shopping trained well and walk through the store with someone a couple of times that of a couple of different orders are they like hey here's a shopping list go get the stuff right\nWell here's that's another problem is the training right and that is a huge problem both for Uber drivers you know and for shoppers there is no training there is no real validation there's like a maybe maybe if we're lucky there's some kind of reference check to make sure you're not a murder or you know um but beyond\nThat you have at it you don't take a shower you stink no problem you can't read but you're picking groceries fine you know like you know what I'm saying right that there is no checking on that stuff as far as I Know\nAnd certainly based on the evidence there is nobody checking that\nSeemed to rely on the review system look ... right\nRight because I didn't bother to review my order after that I got my money back and I don't even know if I got it back but I requested my money back I was frustrated and the story and I'm not ... I'm I'm less likely to use the service again but didn't\nLots more people actually do that then vote so my question is what the heck do we have to do to convince people that there is value in voting and that your chances of living a better life\nIf you participate in the system are actually far\nThan if you buy a lottery ticket\n... say that I don't think it's necessarily be the odds of it counted it's instant gratification I Know I'm going to get some odd the hundreds of millions of dollars really fast and it's a guaranteed\nOr the dream of instant gratification it's the dream of incredible out\nIt's not the actual incident gratification the Windsor gratification as you going out of your way\nTo stop by the ice cream store and getting yourself an ice cream that isn't true gratification that by the lottery tickets starch get yourself a lottery ticket you buying into the dream which I Do by the way by into the dream let's be clear\nBut the reality is that if we all bought into the American dream\nAnd we all took that same or less amount of time to drive ourselves to the polls certainly no time at all really for early voting very little and got in mind and voted if we did it\nWe would actually maybe have a chance I think the American dream because we wouldn't\nBe able to put people in power that would pander to us instead of pandering to the fringes who are the only people who actually vote\n[noise] so I'm just trying to spread the word here peeps you do a lot of stuff every day that is kind of ridiculous\nAnd when I say you I mean way because I Do it too I probably spend more time during ridiculous stuff and you do like we can have a you know I think people do where there was trying to outdo each other [noise]\nI think I could when I went up and it's called the ... yes it's called the went up in game which is almost as fun as the lottery games I Do a lot I spend a lot of time during ridiculous stuff I'll start with Candy Crush I spend a lot of time playing Candy Crush\nI waste a lot of time watching the news it's important but it's also really repetitive and I could probably turn it off after an hour and check back in twelve hours later instead of keeping it on nonstop\nRight what do you waste time doing that's the question right and I'm sure we can all we we cut all vote but let me remind you of something the powers that be\nThe the uh in formerly known as day or don't want you to vote\nSo if you're ordering like me I say go vote like just to show them they don't want you to vote or did you hear me they don't want you to vote because if you vote than they have to answer to you they don't want that so maybe just you know maybe get incentive just\nBy that by the way\nI kind of like the ... I Know that the Republicans were using as an insult I'm sort of dig it I Am the mob and I vote piece out people it's the jaded\nMarriage shall we got a lot more to talk about Saudi Arabia in the headlines climate change in the headlines we'll talk about it All right after them\nBeing a very short coming up on\nStreet [noise]\n\n[noise] ... capital what happened on December ... would\nOr smell

most likely [noise] in the Saudi consulate in Turkey [noise]\nI think most people can agree\nAtrocities happening all over the world but we are clearly tied to this one is this is a journalist again who was living in the United states was a resident of the United states who wrote for one of our major newspapers and of course his disappearance made international news\nBut now we are in the aftermath the question is do the Saudis admitted do the Americans do anything about it do we accept their denials are there are kind of half admitting says\nAnd then what do we do as a country and also what does this say about us as a country if we don't do anything\nThere is a I think there's a age old\nBalance that leaders of companies and leaders of countries and leaders in general try to take a or try to have sort of this this fine line they walk between doing the right thing and preserving\nThe financial interests of whatever organization that is they're running whether it's a country or company or whatever right and so\nBut usually the preservation part of it the financial preservation part of it is discussed quietly I'm behind closed doors and the right thing is sort of done in the public eye\nAs best one cat uh and generally speaking the PR machine comes up with some way to spin whatever continued involvement with the bad player right\n[noise] but we have that anymore thank you Jack Dorsey and Twitter for that we don't we don't have\nAny privacy of thought anymore I'm I say this all the time you know rule number two on the ... show we seal and when you have
