segments every week I'm looking forward to the uh we've had Natalie Molina Nino joining us week after week or as we did to her new book the ... the new revolution for women entrepreneurs Natalie how are you today\nNatalie Natalie she's she's there but I Can't [noise]\nYou like being in a\nWhile we're on the fifth section so for folks that I haven't caught all of the segments yet the sections are ready set go find and grow and we are on section five grow but I've already like twisted your ad man's arm and we're getting you back on next week to do a little bit of a summary and then well and then we'll maybe let you go maybe we'll say\nThere is a lot that we could actually call that\nThey got well are perfect actually I Love the apple I but I don't want to will just tease that some people will be sure to tune in next week\nUm but in this section grow so this is really the book is really all about hacks for women entrepreneurs are on how to sort of achieve the same stuff that people who maybe have more access to whatever it is support money means you know and\nTo sort of get to the same place\nYou know not only style let's call it\nSo under under the guise of growing the business you bring up some things that I wouldn't have necessarily a sign of first and one of them is a non compromising your values for that big client or to make the big sale can you talk about that a little bit\nAnd you know I think the other day you don't have the ability to take many different shapes right and actually one of the thing is that it's my favorite part of the\nAction which isn't very very last [noise] where everyone or sample about you know how you you you you get fired\nAnd there's it's really a story that we can ... I mean the story that we can get your later about an alternative form of that getting into it you can't be a growing at all how we feel like they said a sort of stopping\nHaving like meditation yourself and your team whatever anything\nWe want to look like what do we want to ... what do we want this is the look like at the end of the day I'm sure that you're in line with what you had originally envision there many you know and I think a lot and every one form\nAnd one way to do and that's not true and I tried to block people with a bunch of examples of alternatives\nYeah and I think you tell a lot of personal story throughout the book which I think you know a makes it more real for people and one of the stories you tell them this section is your own gross personally and you know I think we should also note that the book is not just for entrepreneurs I really think these a lot of these hacks or does it valuable for anyone in their career [noise] um but you sort of talk about your own experience sort of\nPushing too hard and actually pushing somebody so hard that they were you know that you sent them to the hospital essentially and how you felt about that and I think that's that's sort of a ... I think something we all come across do I take this deal even though I might you know for somebody to not be home when their kid is blind or you know whatever those stories are you know\nYeah yeah absolutely and I think we need we need to train a narrative show as an example than like real like oriental if we can follow\nThat show that you can actually\nBe a human being and [noise] you know one of my favorite brands of Patagonia and I like store in there to jacket and they're constantly writing and being equal now I don't know any other companies stories I didn't know what they stand for but I Know I'm sure are and I know that you wrote ... make people or if I Know you take\nAnd the top disaster today\nA now winds up two hundred and fifty miles an hour almost account five\nStorm I'm not looking good it's it's really not the president has met with FEMA\nAnd homeland security chiefs are meeting with them now to discuss some of this I'm\nCrazy more uh even more counties a\nDeclared a state of emergency in Georgia we did have Ninety two counties here in the state declared a emergency but now we have a hundred and eight a governor deal making that announcement a little while ago a lot of people already have lost power in the panhandle of Florida\nIt is just it's so\nCrazy to see the barrel down the way we can now you know in the old days when storms\nCame they just came\nYou know you didn't you know what I mean like you didn't see all this on weather maps and the way that you know maybe you have some predictions from weathermen and whatever but not the way you do now that you\nCould have hoped that maybe someone from one of the islands or something we go hey by the way yeah we just got decimated and it's coming your way that that was about the extent of it\nYeah and now it's like you watch it coming and getting stronger or weaker stronger or weaker and you're almost like you know betting on it you know if you're living in those areas you kind of are your body with your life in some cases a pretty crazy\nBut I'm In any case we\nDo have a plenty of other stuff going on in the world believe it or not\nAnd one of the biggest stories is the midterms because it's too late now to register and the state of Georgia if you did not get it done by yesterday and you are not registered you're out of luck\nBut uh hopefully you did and I'm hopefully we will have a bigger turnout than we would ordinarily in the terms there's certainly been a lot of people trying to get your attention and to make you understand how important it is to vote everyone from\nYou know the left and the right saying get out there and vote\nI I'm a big believer in voting and um it works its way way way more effective and I would argue probably less time consuming than trolling\nSo I'm just putting that out there like the time that you're taking to sit down and\nUh and troll somebody and write something nasty you could just take time to go to the polls and and vote and he actually would have more power than just running your digital mouse as it were um one of the uh big stories of course is who is going to run\nIn twenty twenty for the office of president as we were coming out of the last segment I threw endangered for president and let me just say it will be a cold day in ... before I ever run for president but\nNot you know it's funny because ... during this whole Brett Kavanaugh a confirmation thing one of the complaints on a GOP side as hey this is getting so ugly no one's going to ever want to be nominated again I think that I think that was the case before any of this who wants to run for office I mean you know I've got to be willing to put your whole life out there\nAnd sometimes even for the smaller jobs I mean let's be honest the likelihood that someone's digging up dirt on you if you're running for local city council\nI mean maybe they are locally but that word is not getting out to everyone in the country but I mean think about the Jon Ossoff Karen Handel a congressional election just a year ago year ago Murtha\n'em and they were both national news\nAnd you know people were trying to dig up dirt on both of them so I'm president oh my gosh I mean they ... you got to really want it bad you know you've you gotta want it bad to be willing\nI mean we sort of to each other here in the studio you have to be kind of a special kind of crazy to want to run for president you\nKnow and this and you know it's interesting because we were just doing this our our series with not only Molina Nino and one of the things that she talks about in her ... for entrepreneurs is you have to be willing to create some controversy but you also have to be willing to annex and you have to be able to learn how to ignore\nA the flack that you're going to get from people the haters you know and and we we have to learn that we're getting a little bit of that here I'm ... but it's ... it's like twenty billion fold if you're in politics you know and so in any case\nThere are some people that are in it and they are committed to it and they want to run and so then it becomes part of our sport here watching to see who's going to maybe run a\nOn both sides this go round and of course you know we all know that Trump will be running in twenty twenty I whoa wait a minute hold off my back up we all know that Trump is running for twenty twenty because he started running for twenty twenty when like two seconds after he took office for I think earlier than any other president to date I think\nIt was a he technically running before he even took once he won\n... yeah 'cause they had really good yeah I mean he never stopped campaigning essentially a\nAnd sometimes he campaigns under the guise of campaigning for someone else like I'm just trying to help this governor the senator now\nHe's been campaigning nonstop since he was campaigning and so do we know obviously we've got a President Trump on the Republican side and that doesn't mean there won't be some ... you know he there may be people running against him you never know\nUm but the party would have to support that and I don't know that they will um but then who is going to run against him on the Democratic side and that is a big open question right now and while no one has officially declared\nThere have been a lot of people I'm openly considering or who have not said no now yesterday on the Republican side we had a definite no from Nikki Haley\nWho said she will not run and twenty twenty she will support this one are pointing to President Trump and um but that first of all she could change her mind that's certainly possible she wasn't going to say that sitting in the oval next to him but um\nBut at least for now she's in now on the Republican side on the Democratic side um we've got a few people\nThere's a lot of folks actually I Know that Cory Booker has said he wants to run its course Elizabeth Warren's name was getting close to round again I think Bernie has been answered yet did\nCory Booker say he's I think he also just said has said maybe I don't think he's like\nNo one has officially said yes but these are all the big names getting tossed around and none of them I think it said no\nRight right none of them have said no yet and then also interestingly enough I'm today some news coming out that Michael Bloomberg has changed his political affiliation again\nI'm Michael Bloomberg has been everything he has Republican independent and now he has officially registered as a Democrat\n[noise] um and he is openly weighing a bed for twenty twenty um which would be interesting because\nHe has a lot in common with Trump in the sense that he is a billionaire doesn't need to take money from anybody can pay for his own campaign um therefore won't be beholden to any special interest um he's\nDifferent than Trump in that well you can put a fence together but that's neither here nor there um but also he's he has political experience you know a Mayor Bloomberg uh\nSo you know he has a lot of political experience so that's a big difference there\nUm but he uh\nAnd he was a Republican I think mayor correct and then independent and then I said now Democrat and so interesting a story there and I was you know looking around for the best source to pull on when I heard the story\nAnd of course I went to Bloomberg that just seemed like the obvious place to go uh so I figured whatever they're putting on Bloomberg dot com about this\nIt's got to be true I mean you would think right um you know it's also interesting in just a little bit coincidental\nBut yesterday on the show we had Bradley test gone who wrote a book called the fix her and he worked for Bloomberg\nUm campaigns you know help them campaign and also worked for him when he was mayor\nAnd he just randomly yesterday just for me it's random or talked about the fact that Mike Bloomberg was one of the few people or politicians he knew less than five percent he said that actually take office for the right reasons and don't you know do it for politics they do it because they want to make actual change happen so that was a pretty good endorsement I thought\nUm and then to hear that he potentially could run and twenty twenty is interesting\nWhat's also interesting about him as someone to think about is he is a fiscal conservative and a social liberal that is aligned with me and I think that is aligned with a lot of people in this country who are Republican or Democrat and while we are\nGetting pulled a very hard to the opposite sides of the party he lived very measured voice in the middle who is a billionaire but has local experience who is socially liberal and fiscally conservative I think he could appeal to a lot of people who have not had any one really appeal to them in a long time\nSo you know I think it'd be interesting\nI don't know how the Bernie Sanders of the world are going to feel about it but I think it can be interesting and I think he doesn't have the same level of a hatred towards the end that Hillary had\n'em so I you know just someone to watch and he has he has tossed out there of course we also have Joe Biden who um may or may not run and who hasn't you know completely ruled it out and I think a lot of people like Joe\n... Joe does see the one thing about Joe Biden among on top of everything else and it certainly has\nIncredible experience he's just so likeable it's hard\nHim you know he's just such a likeable guy obviously we're going to keep our eyes on that race I'm ... and the midterms yes the midterm still on that now we're gonna take a short break but we'll be right back\nDean of errors show coming up on TALK radio six forty double\nTalk radio six forty double new geo Steve ... three at ... [noise]\nReally ... I\nDon't have that same kind of oh man I'm not letting that being me right really interesting that the general has it gone across everybody who lives near the water yeah and\nGlad you brought that um you know ... because that but you know the other hand it was really interesting about that is I think a lot of people in that scenario helped each other\nWho were you know walking walks together restaurant stayed open and let people come in\nYes he did some women on Wednesday on the ...\nWorld see why leader as women joined on October ... at the Georgia ... [noise]\nSometimes ah women can be our own worst enemy fire and [noise] you know I think sometimes if it's unconscious like sometimes I think we\nYou know cut off our noses despite our faces without even realizing that's what we're doing and you know sometimes it probably is more conscious sometimes it's self preservation um or jealousy or a spy or whatever it is you know it's an attempt to stay on top personally versus as a gender\nUm and what I mean\nBy that is we and I think this is fair I mean everyone to some extent is in self preservation mode right you don't want to lose your job um or lose a promotion or losing opportunity a by\nYou know promoting some other woman over you I mean that would make sense um or even and this is where I think we get in trouble by seeming like too much of a feminist\nUm or to political one way or the other or too opinionated one way or the other or we want to play the game\nAnd forever for the longest time still today I guess in many ways I'm playing the game means getting along\nIn the boys' club and\nYou know I think to some extent ... the only\nPeople who can make a conscious decision to stop doing that are people who were already secure enough that they don't have to worry and that's kind of part of the problem either\nOr we somehow all like lock arms and agree to do it together\nUm but it's not easy to do and I and I'm guilty of this I feel like there's been a long time in my career um where I just played along you know I didn't say what I thought about whether it was a political issue or a snarky comment someone made or whatever else that I just played along\n[noise] um but ultimately that hurts us all I think\nAnd I'm a ... year old is up for a couple of reasons first of all there is a new article or I'm Sorry a new interview out with more of your traffic came out or was it was a ABC that did the interview during the time that she was um in Africa just a last week I guess right um or is it earlier this week I already can't tell\nI don't know what I did yesterday um but in any case she was interviewed by ABC and she said some things that were not helpful to women as a gender um and I think she's just playing the game honestly I think she's planning on but uh we have a little short clip of it let's play that\nWell they do yes and I want people to use more of them\nMore you know not in the text more is good for is good yeah I'm ... and good ones would be good um but I Wonder\nBefore we get into sort of from so first of all you're going to be in town on friday for a leader cast women were excited about that\nYeah me too um and I want to get into sort of a little bit your views on leadership uh\nAll that but before we do for people who sort of don't know the whole story of how you got where you are now can you share a little bit of the journey through the Ted Talk in the book and all of that\nSure so I I've been working for public radio for NPR NPR I and others for about Twenty years now but um I was asked to do it had headaches talk in Savannah and the prompts that they gave me was think of something that you think is going wrong and then tell us how to fix it\nSo the first thing I thought of was I'll tell you what's going wrong we're not having conversations with each other and I know actually know exactly how to fix that so that's where the ... came from um it has over Seventeen million views now and out of that came the book as well", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Barrett Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "10"}
