get these days on [noise]\nThe issues about why our country is so divided\nTo being focused on the real issues that are hurting the country one of those issues is our health care system\nUm consistently rank one of the worst healthcare systems in the world\nEven though we spend the most money on it\nWhich is crazy so I get an expert on the phone to talk about their soap joining us right now one of our ah I'm going to say especially now a regular contributor Dr Elena George is on the phone she's an anti duck and author or how are you Dr George\nI'm fine thank you so much for having me on\nIt is a pleasure to have you back on the show and I want to talk about how bad the healthcare system as I Know you and I have talked about this a little bit before but we're heading into their terms and this is an issue that some are thinking about and a lot of people are just focus on all of the rhetoric right now\nI'm supposed to talk about their health care system a little bit of what the real issues on what the problems are and and so from your perspective as a doctor what do you see as some of the biggest issues\nI think one of the main problem is the third party payer system the middleman\nItself trying to adopt during the patient we now and where patients are paying more if they have health insurance plan for it and it's broken yeah and the single payer system actually only doubles down on that\nI could find an article about releasing healthcare is the worst of the world but it matrix nothing about the infrastructure already taking money out of the system to make it you know basically robbing Peter at taking patient taking care of patients\nIt's like they're not robbing Peter to pay Paul there robbing Peter and keeping them\nOnly to the health care doctor dollar goes to the doctor yeah strange yeah sure companies a hospital for governor it's a joke [noise]\nYeah I think you're right and I think there are a lot of parts to that that people don't even really recognize so you know you can pay your health insurance or or you you you have health insurance at your company pays for whatever the case may be a part of where your money goes you think um but there's a lot of other intermediaries to write I mean there's the uh the\nAnd every year I go through this every year Halloween I started thinking about it like maybe in September and I think okay this is going to be the year that I dress up for the show so at the very least I'm On Facebook Live camera the live stream and camera and I've got some ... some kind of costume at least from the waist up right and every year I think about it and I think about it\nAnd I say I'm going to do it and then it gets to like where it is now which is less than a week away and then I don't do it because I run out of time and it's too much work or it's like to last minute and I have an order whatever it is from Amazon yet you know what I mean\nI I have like a Halloween a phobia or something I have Halloween pro crashed a nation of phobia I don't know what it is it's a problem\nSo um let me let me just since we've got the peanut gallery here which is now Rachel and new dynamic let me just ask\nYou're dressing up this year first of all Rachel yes now yes every year every year ...\nAnd to it yes okay well you're the ... documentary that you're ... you're committed okay uh and are you is this a secret or you are willing to discuss this year's costume well actually I have\nA couple of cost him oh and see what I'm saying yeah I Know it's very key I think ... I think you guys are all keep the with the with your with your coupled um go ahead with the with the couple of it it's so Lois Lane and Clark cat\nOh nice so this is an easy costume because it only requires a Superman T shirt to put underneath the button down for clerk cat and I can just wear a business suit oh there you go and so yeah he's got it from glasses and the and the teacher yeah good point and you you just have to look like she can do that yeah I'm I'm a fan of dressing and it cost him from my closet though yes nice\nAll right and I like that is the ... I probably should've consulted you like ... a month ago for some ideas because at this point it's already but late for me\nOK new guy neck I Know you're also probably doing something to say what they said what is it\nSo the original plan has been to be altered a little bit but uh my fiance and I are both going to go as sweet little people okay\nAnd the original goal was to like my big self carry a door around nice but as we knock on your door we put the door so you open our doors we give you Katie nice to have all the kids right so they can go up there to be and then we're right but you know whatever we're gonna work that out couldn't unfortunately find a door so we're just going to go as a cue old couple of giving you located\nOkay that's amazing I I knew that door thing was a disaster that was ever going to work not not to be fair but\nI could have to I mean we tried to close enough you had to had a good thought you know if you had unlimited funds how'd you won the lottery you could have made it happen right okay ... yeah I was I still might well first of all let me just say for people who have not actually realize is about my name\nMy name is actually from is my real name and this is what I was named her birth but\nIs also the name of the character and Ghostbusters Sigourney Weaver play Dana beret and Ghostbusters a and the original versions and um so I've always thought I should just get a ... costume and where it every year like the orange slowing down and the crazy hair and kind of like whack a doodle makeup and just ...\nSo that's one that's always been my mind but like to get a good costume I got to go on at sea and I got to spend a couple of hundred bucks and I just can't bring myself to do it [noise] yes\nI think it was going to be one of those situations you need to like find one in March yes I Know season right about it and get it and just have it\nThis is one of those things where I just need to like give my daughter a budget and tell her to do it for me because otherwise it's never going to get done a\nBecause every year I say it and I never do it and I do have another idea for this year ... but the jury is still out if I'm going to do if I shouldn't give it away 'cause maybe I'll show that day and cost him All right well this is called a giant one week early radio tease that's what I was I may or may not on the thirty first show up in costumes\nMaybe we'll say I'm OK the other thing Rachel and this is all because you're here now that I'm thinking about this looming in my mind is Thanksgiving ... a because we've got you know Thanksgiving coming up for a lot of people that for most people I Would say that's one of two things it's either travel\nOr or it's cooking mhm and entertaining right so for me it's cooking and entertaining my family all travelled here\nAnd I kind of down pack because I've been doing it for years but I don't and we're already like for now getting into just like four weeks away and I probably\nNeed to start planning how I'm going to move furniture around and because I live in a relatively small boat and all of that so let me just also ask you all what are your Thanksgiving plans you encounter out of town so you're a traveler mhm and Nick going up to Virginia okay so to travelers and I\nAnd a chef that's what we got going on here and All right um so obviously as we get closer to that\nHopefully you'll also give us some sort of travel tips Rachel because I'm relying on you to help all the other travelers fan and we'll put that on your list of things to do and when you when you are traveling in the southeast as I Do every year if you're driving the cops are out yeah maybe we can have some tips for that to safely\nYeah yeah it's like hey exactly what is the exact number of miles you can go over without getting a huge ticket ... recommendations on good radar detector right oh my gosh that'll be a good segment or here's the other one I got a ticket for this year's ago um where it's not that many years ago where I didn't\nI didn't move over Elaine when there was a cop having pulled some by over and I didn't even know that that was a rule at the time and somehow I missed that I wasn't paying attention to the rule book I guess\nIt I feel like maybe five years ago or so it became a rule but it wasn't always\nYeah and I miss it I wasn't paying attention I was too busy focusing on oh I don't know politics or what I should be for Halloween and I missed it and so I was driving along minding my own business and I saw the ... so I'm clear as day I was in another state actually I was driving back from I don't know some other southern state I forget now\nAnd um I I slowed down because I sort of had a sense that you should be careful of them and so I slowed way down but it didn't pull over land and I he jumps and its current came after me and I got my I got my fate yeah\nKnew so that's a quick tip you can if you can't pull over you don't have to look at the super crowded traffic they don't get mad at you for that but if you're on the highway and you can pull over and you don't hear from your ticket ... so that's my first half of the travel season for everybody I'm All right well we do have stuff coming up this weekend to so let's get to it\nWill work hard you know there were just responding ritual of\nOkay let's get this key Atlanta where the zoo at the zoo that Saturday and Sunday October twenty seventh and October twenty eighth each day from nine thirty AM to three PM do Atlanta\nThis event it's free for his new members and children under three and general admission is sixteen Ninety nine to twenty two Ninety nine that this event includes trick or treating at the zoo and also um they'll have special characters and adventures of the ...\nTown I\nI'm not sure that you got to go to check it out I feel like I'm just reading what that what I got here I don't know I Can't I Can't vouch for this one really cute I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun I Would love to see animals in costumes but somehow I think that that's probably not ethical yeah that's probably that's probably be towed probably [laughter]\nJust like decorate their um habitats and yes something I mean I there are also some animals that are just scary period there the reptile house I don't go in there [laughter] ah also this weekend\nAs the Edgar Allan Poe experience that's through Wednesday October thirty first so you have a lot of opportunities to catch it and this is that the ruins nest the cost is forty five fifty dollars a ticket\nAnd this is a time to venture through one of Atlanta's most historic homes threatens ness to become a part of Edgar Allan Poe's for most famous and thrilling tails\nAnd this is in partnership with brain cloud his experiences\nAnd brain cloud us is the founder and executive director of center and be play house so if you're a fan of the productions that they put on out it's here and be than this event is for you\nIt sounds very interesting spooky literature I Love that there's so much of it and there's there's also a great time of year for scary movies just saying endurance houses a beautiful but also could be creepy historic home they have a lot of those in Atlanta point also\nIf you're in the pumpkin patch or corn maze or a tractor ride mood go out to sleepy hollow farm it's in powder springs and these events are available through November forests so again plenty of time to experience the fall fun\nThey're open Saturday and Sunday from ten AM to six PM and Tuesday through friday from two pm to six PM but closed on Mondays\nThis weekend in sports we've got the Atlanta Hawks for Chicago Bulls that this Saturday October twenty seventh at seven thirty PM at State Farm arena tickets range from sixteen dollars to a hundred and thirty four dollars\nIf you're already planning next week you can do a Spanish wine tasting at a clip still Luna that's next Tuesday night\nNovember sixth hoops the following Tuesday excuse me I'm getting way ahead there and that's all right he can science for four weeks will go get it on your calendar that Tuesday November ... from six to seven thirty PM at eclipse diluted and buck had the cost is only ten dollars which is probably why I was so excited about this thing that I Want to do\nNow to trick or treat and that is not a good idea in my opinion because look just because those named those twenty five or thirty named sex offenders are being watched that doesn't mean one can't drive in from another town uh that doesn't mean there is somebody who is a criminal\nUm that hasn't been caught that's you know around 'em\nOr it could be as simple as that doesn't mean or aren't bullies bigger kids that are going to pick on the little ones if there isn't parental supervision so I you know this creating this false sense of security I understand that the intentions are all in the right place they're trying to do something to protect the kids in their town and I respect that um but it just seemed like a really odd\nChoice to me um\nSo I guess the question is beyond whether or not you think it's an odd choice I have a question also is you know are we in a place or we could we ever go back to a place where kids could sort of\nRun free um we've had people now we've had parents um arrested for I think what they call I think they called free range parenting um which was kind of ... like what are we chicken town\nBut but the question is is can we ever get to a place where kids\nHave the freedom to be out and about and playing in their neighborhoods and riding their bikes and trick or treating\nBy themselves and like at what age is that okay because I remember at a pretty young age I mean not five but you know we went with our parents when we were five or six in my day but certainly by fifth grade fourth fifth grade we were trick or treating by ourselves\nAnd we knew what the rules were and we knew where to go we stuck together and a group and but we weren't even afraid I wasn't even any real sense of something bad could happen you know my data biggest fear was that was going to be a I don't know why this anybody even thoughts as ever a good idea and it did happen but there was going to be like a razor blade and an apple\nBut that was ever a problem for me because who wants an apple [laughter] on Halloween\nIt's really good point silly to try to do so being devious that's a bad course about\nThree and that was the thing that was that was the big deal and I was a kid in ... that there might be that people were putting like Cain candy apples people were putting but even candy apples but\nThe ones that candy apple maybe now as a grown up that would be somewhat appealing but like if a kid I Want a Milky Way you know I don't want I Want to receive peanut butter cup I don't want an apple no fruit thank you it's Halloween you know\nUm but now you know this fear\nUm that the child predators are going to come jumping out\nIs what has taken hold and I don't know and I I'd have to do the homework on this I don't know\nHow statistically real that is like are the numbers worse now um or are we just more aware because of twenty four hour news on the Internet and all of that um\nThese are these are the things that these are the things that keep me up and people I I I Love being able to run around free as a kid and I think that's a sad part of you know the old\nDays that has that has gone on civility also gone we'll talk about it right after this\nMore Dina beret show coming up on TALK

working a functional I shouldn't say working but functional bombs inside of them with all of the parts that bomb wouldn't need\n'em but they were not set to go off in the way that a typically male delivered bomb would would do I think those types of things are usually set with some kind of trips\nSo that when you open the package um the bomb will go off or are there on the timer that what's up

if I don't always get to your comments but I did receive a listener comment on that exact clip and what I said about it in our one on the show\nUm which is I made fun of it I joked a little bit about and I sort of did it under my breath of well back I joked about the fact that the president probably had to look up\nAgree just end up ... and the dictionary and I was joking and I um\nWell I think my my motivation for saying that was more along the lines of it was clearly teleprompter Trump because he doesn't usually use words like that he likes to you that much simpler language for the most part but I Want to read\nYou this comment from mark who wrote it in and he said today when you joke about President Trump's using words that he probably had to look up in the dictionary I had to laugh then
