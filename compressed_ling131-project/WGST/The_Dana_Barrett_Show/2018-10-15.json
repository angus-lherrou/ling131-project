phone according to sources on Twitter let's be honest who said he took the phone how behind his back\nAnd then handed it back and buy them was walking away and turned it off must by then walking away so if he thought the kid wanted to take a picture where it was going\nAnd by the way if you watch the video on Twitter you can hear the kid saying to David Perdue as he's walking away and there's nobody between them it's their right there and it's pretty clear in pretty loud a senator I just wanted to ask\nYou you're walking away by just wanted to ask you this question about voter suppression\nI mean ... left David Perdue had like his ear bud then he heard him and he just chose to walk away finger vastly what was happening and\nHe clearly I you know David Perdue is only one of very few Atlantis who don't listen or Georgia into don't listen to the damage oh because I have told you all time and time again\nThat we see you\nAnd especially do we feel when someone is holding a phone with a video turned on are right in front of your face\nYeah we all saw what you see you speak about do you see you come on All right let's get to the real issue broader suppression\nSo here's what's happening I don't know if you've caught a lot of this because it was happening and good bit over the weekend but um there's been discussion of by the right voter fraud or by the left voter suppression going on in many states across the country or for a long time now this is nothing new\nBut bubbled up here in Georgia because in an\nAwkward we all knew this was going to happen turn of events one of the two people running for governor in this neck and neck race is secretary of state of Georgia and therefore in charge of elections awkward he should have ... honestly just to avoid this he should have stepped down\nFrom the secretary of state position the minute he got the game editorial nomination insurance\nYou should have just said you know what just to avoid any possible concerns\nI'm going to step away and let someone else handle this or I'm going to do the rest of the secretary of state job but I'm going to turn over everything that has to do with voting voting rights voter rolls\nAny of them going to turn it over to the deputy secretary of state I'm sure there is such a person I might have made that roll up I don't know but surely there's someone else he could have turned that responsibility over to and said just like in theory when you take the presidency of this country you're supposed to put a wall between you and your businesses so that you can't be bribed et cetera\nNot that kind of walk 'em he should have built along camp again not that kind of wall but he should've build a wall between himself a and any potential allegations a voter suppression but he didn't he chose to stay a hundred percent in charge of that and\nHe implemented a exact match rule that caused fifty three thousand\nVoters in the state of Georgia to be on hold there not gone from the voter rolls but they're like on probation [laughter] and those people I'm In theory can still vote there's gonna have to sort of prove themselves when they get to\nTheir voting places which I find it somewhat confusing anyway because you have to show your id to vote period so I suspect there's going to be some more\nHere's the problem it's not just about they're saying these people can still show up and show their idea and they can still vote however if their name is on this probationary list on this whole blessed\nAnd it's not an exact match are they going to be allowed to vote because that's the problem because everybody has to show an id to vote you don't get to come in without id and vote that's the rule you walk and you pick up a little piece of paper we've all while we haven't all been at thirty percent of us have done it\nYou pick up your little paper you fill out your name and your address and your county and then you hand that piece of paper and your license to the poster who verifies that you're you what's your picture looks at your license looks at your form and then let you go in and do your vote so\nThis whole idea that all you have to do a show up with your license or with an ID and that's going to solve the problem I'm calling because I found that I don't think it's going to be quite that easy I suspect if you're on that last\nYou're going to have to go through a whole rigmarole and there could be like well you know your your ah your ID says John de period voter and your license says John you know dog would voter and\nThat's not an exact match and so by so I I'm confused about all of this but ah\nNot looking good for bank have it's not a good luck as they say ah for Brian cafes and it was on the other hand coming across calm cool and collected will share that with you right after this\nDream of a ritual coming up on the double\nBark Marron right here on my heart radio [noise]\nGetting ready to be new to view streaming

voters are being suppressed [noise] so let's get into the meat of this whole thing somebody the other day described\nA topic as being ... and I just thought that that was kind of fun and slightly odd all the same time what if you're a vegetarian you know I'm\nOK side note and I'll be but I'm coming back here I come it's got it's Monday and I feel like it's just sometimes on a Monday and it's a little it's gray outside for kids to get distracted you know [noise] uh here's the deal uh fifty three\nThousand voter registrations are in limbo in Georgia that is about one percent so first of all it's just be a hundred percent clear it's a small number of people all things considered that said that small number of people can\nBe the difference especially in a close election right I mean you can win by less than fifty three thousand votes clearly on a state election um sometimes it can come down to hundreds of votes right so every vote does matter and it's every vote should matter\nA but there are fifty three thousand that our air quotes in limbo now a according to the secretary of state's office a majority of the applications on hold belong to a minority and black voters\nA the a P the Associated Press putting that number at Seventy percent so seven out of ten of these fifty three thousand on hold in limbo voters are minority or black\nThat is not by the way even close to the uh makeup of our state we are not the Seventy percent black state me I think or something like thirty percent black and the state so ah what's going on\nWe've had about six point nine people register to vote in Georgia since twenty Thirteen\nSo that's pretty decent I mean I still don't know what the total number of citizens and the state is but it's not it's not it's not six point nine [laughter] so you are a lot of people didn't register which we are going to get to that in just a second but in any case they're saying ah\nThat the reason they are on this in this limbo state is because of um an inexact match law that was challenged and then reinstated by the Republicans in power in our state\nAnd it it's what it does is it puts the voter registration through a verification process and it checks everything being exact the name date of birth and they're saying if something is off then you go into this sort of pending status [noise] uh\nOn a on so many levels\nBut it's it's only one percent that means if the other twenty nine percent of well that's not right but you know I'm trying to say either Ninety nine percent of the registered voters will vote\nWill probably still get a relatively fair election but nonetheless it's not it should never be happening at once again Georgia looking like a says on the on the on the national stage team go see him a lot of are\nAre going to

a very good to see you know of course when when you don't like what was that all commercial when when when the no tax people less any of that\nKind of thing I Know when something happens you know you're well known around the area and sell articles are written\nOn celebrations there [laughter]\nSo how long now since you left tax so I think for people I Know it's you know you used to run tagged the technology association of Georgia and it's been two years\nYeah it's been almost two years left in January of Seventeen\nAnd you were there for ten years twelve twelve years ago I started and I mean to cut bachelor that's okay\n[laughter] and so for me when I first got involved with egg probably five years ago it just felt like you were the guy and you're always going to be a guy and the magical forget that we have our own lives and we make our own decisions sometimes you know it's time to go on a\nTwelve years was a good run by the time to do the next thing\nAnd so obviously that's also not your whole story that's twelve years of your story but you have a background I think that people may not realize leading big organizations are big associations so can you give us a little bit of your the ... the pre tax by al\nYeah yeah well I ah\nGrew up in a small town we don't have to go all the way back there but there are very cute little cat I'm sure are on the train of all I Lived in a farm country so [noise] um this is seen as running for president ... a year ago or so um what school I thought I wanted to go into coaching a so I got closer and closer to\nGraduation like many of us you know I said no I don't want to do that\nEnded up in a running a park district and uh started there and then moved over kind of fell into the wives to fall into that fell in love with the wife sue for Twenty years I did that wow great in the water you have to move around and to move up\nAnd er I set a goal of trying to run one of the biggest was running one of the biggest was before it turned forty and so at age thirty nine\nI landed the Chicago YMCA which was New York and Chicago were two largest in the world so\nA people when they think of why they don't think of necessarily all the things that we did in Chicago is or social service oriented career but with gang intervention now the largest provider of singer market let's see how seen a thousand kids in foster care and it was great I did it for ten years and it was just that time I wanted to do something else\nI think you know I think people in Georgia it's not like that I mean the wise we have YMCA you are but there it's a different animal here\nIt's a great organization to Europe or one of my daughters are works here it's not as social service oriented otherwise have said should we be doing how scene you know they made a decision to focus on youth family or community for the most part do really good job with that but in Chicago we were ah\nWe were all over the ballpark in terms of a social significance\nSo it won't really what what do you say from that period of time in your life or and in that particular role was your biggest accomplishment there [noise]\nWell we were known for our innovation um but I think you know getting gang members of the gangs are helping 'em\nTeen mothers we built um if it mortality or infant centers within the schools oh wow so you know really helping them stay in school because there was all kinds of studies if they weren't able to go back in school they'd have more kids by the time they're Eighteen they fear for kids and\nUh the uh low income would would carry on so I mean I think there were a number of things innovation or we were able to receive the first the first non profit to receive the George lay on the word which was a pretty significant in a in the day and we did a number of things like family adventure centers and skate\nNot really very good and she's speaking in the\nPast ah America has been you know so we're supposed to have been sort of a shining began of you know caring about other humans ... you know globally\nAnd ... we have in the past but sanctions on countries for not\nUpholding but we deemed to be a minimum level of human rights\nAnd that\nThink in large part is why this has a bubbled up because there is an expectation\nFrom the world of all I'm very being very general hair sort of on purpose that countries like America and other western countries uh do something about this kind of behavior that they don't tolerate it and of course\nThe main way that we would show a lack of tolerance for this type of behavior would be financial because we're not likely to go to war over it and we shouldn't but financial sanction\nAnd some kind of financial punishment um\nOr incentive maybe you want to call it an incentive right it's a punishment and then you behave better will will will will come back right I mean so it's both is expected\nAnd almost from the moment this was discussed a President Trump has\nFlat out said well you know but we have this deal with them this multibillion dollar deal and we don't want to mess that up\nBecause you know what like if it's not us then they'll go to Russia they'll go to other places and then we won't have what we want out of this whole thing financially\n[noise] which is a problem you know it's funny 'cause I heard one commentator\nAh I think it was earlier today perhaps it was Sunday saying you know politicians have always had those thoughts and tried to work things behind the scenes to do the best we can for ourselves financially while sending the right signal to the rest of the world President Trump has no filter so he just says it all\nOut loud\nSo it's not like he's the only one who has ever cared about a financial deal and chosen a path that would preserve us getting whatever oil we want at a certain price or\nWhatever the trade deal is however they're usually quieter about it this guy not so much so maybe that's what you love about him I don't know I'm the only thing that I think is fascinating about this president is he seems to be\nFine with affirmed denial\nDenial of anything it all he really needs a Russia did X Y Z from denial and they didn't do it um you know Kim Jong un and killing his own people maybe his brother\nIn law firms in Iowa now no problem didn't do it Kavanaugh\nAccused of sexual harassment sexual abuse from denial great didn't do it [laughter]\nOh gosh I'm as if it's like as if that's all you really need to say no and you say it strongly enough then you're good and actually that is\nSort of what the president does about anything that's lobbied on him so for ... I didn't mean lobbied I meant lobbed\nSo for example um\nDid you conclude with Russia no collusion and no collusion and no ... from denial of no collusion\nAnd frequent frequent and from denial a strong tough\nDenial I'm Thirteen plus women accusing him President Trump of sexual harassment sound wife earned it out from denial they weren't pretty enough he doesn't remember it from denials therefore didn't ...\nOkay so where are we on this whole Saudi saying well the president spoke about it several times over the weekend but then again this morning in one of his famous helicopter a press conferences take a lesson\nBy the\nThe knowledge of what life\nAs easy as it is five\nFriendly deny the\nSperm denial from now\n[noise] also pointing out that it was not an American was a Saudi citizen but let's keep in mind that Saudi citizen was a an American resident who was here legally\nAnd who was a journalist for one of I Would say the top probably two or three news outlets in the country the Washington Post in which said journalist was pretty critical of Saudi Arabia so\nYou know this\nIs not a good luck there's been a lot of that weekend could look for us and what's interesting about this is Republicans who have a really always been a strong\nOn their foreign policy and\nYou know their concern over things like human rights violations are not with the president on this they want to make sure ah that they respond appropriately and many are suggesting that we should in fact imposed sanctions if\nUm you know investigations determine that the Saudis worst ones for this I don't really see how they're going to\nClaim that they weren't responsible unless they can produce the guy\nI mean it just seems like there's I mean from everything we're hearing there I mean there are stories coming out of\nThe uh the consulate there of bone saws end up like Thirteen or Fifteen you know guys coming in from Saudi on a flight three o'clock in the morning and going directly to the consulate and then leaving a couple of hours later I don't know with bigger suitcases I mean\nI don't have that primate up the bigger suitcases part um but you know it doesn't seem like there's going to be any way for them to disprove this um\nThey are apparently though now are going to allow um turkey and some others to do a full investigation of the consulate this afternoon supposedly that's going to happen um but it's Thirteen Days after the disappearance so arguably they got their own black lights out already you\nKnow like CSI and cleaned it up\nThis morning there reports they had like be peeled cleaning crews coming into the ... of course they did and what was that\nUm TV show with the serial killer who chop people up remember what was that called\nEverybody has no no that is saying it right now I Can't think of it [noise] um anyway I was a great show I watched a couple of seasons of economics there you go to ... see Dexter we've put like a lot of plastic up\nBefore he saw people into little pieces he like plastic the whole room\nYou know it's taped and ... and he was really good at it like there was never a drop of evidence left he was so good I'm sure somebody in the culture will just watch the show so right can be hard so someone should also check and see if they ordered a lot of extra plastic [laughter]\nSorry I shouldn't joke it's not funny it's terrible but um in any case affirmed and now apparently as all the president needs a Marco Rubio may or may not be running for president again but he was commenting on this topic and whether or not sanctions should happen listen\nBars arms sales I Would not go to the way the president or the arms sales are important not because of the money but because it also provides leverage over their future behavior you know they don't need our spare parts don't meet our training and those are things we can use to influence their behavior but I Would not take cutting out off\nOff the table every option needs to be there in a response\nEvery option needs to be there in a response we need a response a centrally what he was saying they're listening the president Everytime he does\nThese long form interviews which he did on Sunday I think it was Sunday it was a Sunday or is it Saturday friday sixty minutes whenever that's on friday I don't know I don't I haven't here's the problem\nModern times I DVR it I don't know what it actually comes on ah the President Trump was on sixty minutes this past weekend\nLeslie stall and he did this long rambling interview with her\nThat included I mean all\nKinds of stuff I feel like maybe has people should discourage him\nFrom doing these interviews because I also feel like they're not such a good luck but he loves it he loves to do them [noise] um we\nNow I Know we pulled some ... do we pull anything on the Saudi Arabia thing\nFrom ... from that want to know no\nHe did talk about it he talked about it in that interview he literally talked about everything from the Russian meddling uh in our elections\nTo uh whether or not General Mattis is going to leave his post to North\nKorea or you name it he talked about it and who's going to run against him potentially coming up\nIn twenty twenty\nHas also become a hot topic over the last couple of days so that what that means to the ... show is that we have got a lot to talk about an hour or two so up next we are going to get into some of the most interesting comments from Trump's sixty minutes interview and [noise]\nAre probably going to we're diverting the whole Russian and doing it why Russia but I'm also seeing China I'm\n[laughter] was that I have to say uh a couple of things about this one uh Lesley Stahl is my hero like that just to continue to like to have that debate with him I'm not sure I could do that I'm not sure I could do an interview like that and not\nJust get up and walk away um but also\nThe fact that he is so aggressively calling out China is on its own\nLevel fairly interesting because we are I Would say already in a pretty hot trade war with China and I don't know I shouldn't have used the word hot because I think we're pretty close to being at an in an all out trade war Cold War you know with China\nThere the trade talks have stalled it's not looking good he's made comments our president has made comments about you know having good chemistry with the president of China but maybe not for long\nUm he ... and all this in a lot of people like the tough talk against China and and there does need to be some changes in that relationship for sure but in order to get real change we need them at the table talking uh\nThen he was also even asked if he wanted to send a the Chinese economy into a depression\nHe said no I don't want that to happen to the Chinese people um but then he said but they're down thirty two percent which is basically the way it was in Nineteen twenty nine here so we kind of already did send them into a depression so there was a lot of interesting conversation about all of that\nUm he is very much diverting the rush of question by tossing China into the Maxwell everyone does it so therefore yeah Russia did it but so what China does a tail\nAnd we're not as a matter of them so so what\nThen there's the whole issue in this kind of brings us back to the Saudi story but then there's the whole issue of human rights his buddy Vladimir Putin is also has been known for you know killing people and this guy you know all kinds of human rights violations the president was asked about it and here's what he said\nThe hail agree that's led I may have proven is involved and it's not a nation\nAnd poisoning probably is yeah probably I mean I don't have a ... but I rely on them a lot in our case why it why\nThey shouldn't do it this is a terrible thing to do it\nOf course they should do it but they did and you know but it's not in our country the president\nA with a lot of what he said and not talk prove how transactional he as a will continue the conversation right after that [noise]\nMore Dina ... coming up on TALK radio six forty WG a street\nThat runs a year when you think about where you should keep

...\nDelta community credit union is federally insured buddy and see you a fee\nBack to the ... here on WG a street [noise]\nOur president is extremely transactional and I think you know one of the reasons he's been so popular with his base with a GOP in general has been his ability to get things done and there are some things he has absolutely gotten done there's no way to debate that\nHe did get two people on the Supreme Court\nAh that was something he wanted to do and one of the reasons a lot of people did vote for him they wanted Republican choice on the Supreme Court and they got it uh they want to tax reform he got that through it's done they got it so\nThey want you know he campaigned on a new NAFTA there is a new NASA you got it so arguably his ability to get some things\nDone um is there\nOne of the questions I've had about this from the get go is what do we give up to get things done because you don't you don't just win without paying some kind of price that's the way the

previous administrations were going to stand up for the little guy we're\nGoing to stand up for human rights were going to stand up in front of dictators and ... uh who wanted to just blindly assassinate kill their own citizens or anyone else right that we cared about that a enough to go to war for it in many cases\nAnd certainly enough to him or impose sanctions for those reasons I'm the
