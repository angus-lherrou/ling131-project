you\nA little bit sad I'm not going to\nIt's been so fun talking through the book and and informative obviously and um it's just been a joy to have you on the show except for people who maybe I've met some of the earlier segment\nI not only is the head of private investment she has an incredible background which I Wish we could spend all day even just on you are but now has this book out leap frog with fifty hacks essentially for women entrepreneurs and we spent the last five weeks going through a some of them the highlights anyway\nAnd today we're at the apple lock up the block and this is actually is leap frog brazen like\n[laughter] I almost just want you to run with that what do you mean by raising my how brave and not only should I get\nThe reality is you know the answer that question right I mean what are the things that I talk about is that it's filled with examples of amazing underground that have figured out how to be successful on their own terms broken the rules ... they they can all the things that they needed to be\nSort of the ... and you know writing their own and I think what\nI Want to leave it did this idea that the answer to that I should ultimately a few what are you comfortable with how are you willing to push that on the low grade I talk about an example of a woman who pretended that she had more than she did she set up a bunch of email account to make it looked like she was you know punching of overweight class and the company was bigger that actually was\nAnd you know she she made it and helped her a longer wait some people might find that questionable they might find that that crosses the line\nIt's not comfortable with it and it's up to you what I've done is they've given people a sample to hire them and then I Hope that from\nThose fifty sixty one two three will be barred hopefully into you know\nYeah I mean I feel like there are all different ways to you know all different places you can draw your line right I'm making in emails not too bad\nBut we certainly have things in our headlines right now where people are crossing lines that are far worse than that um and I know you talked herself even in the book and one of the stories you told about I'm sort of not being willing to it you know participate in certain events because you didn't feel like it was right for you\nI'm happy to talk about\nThat yeah well I think it matters right because I think we're all being asked a lot more of those kinds of questions now aren't\nA hundred percent I think that we live in a time where you have to stand for something you can not completely out of\nThe fray and whether you're building a business or you're just living your life or your you know elevating your career within quote but the important thing is in where's your line whereas my line the important thing is that you know where that line is when I was invited to give us each\n[noise] women on was on the dean of ... [noise]\nOn today's show\nAnd it's always a good day when he saw me Daniel stops here when I when their stories just for fun [noise]\nYou know [noise] um but in other news a new survey out from white combination or I Believe they did the survey themselves so I don't think that this is I'm trying to hide anything um but there is a new survey out that says one in\nFive female founders who have passed through why combination or which is a Silicon Valley a start up incubator one in five women who have passed through the incubator have been sexually harassed or assaulted by an investor so\nThose are not good numbers my friends\nAre there were eighty eight why combination are female founders surveyed Nineteen of them reported experiencing inappropriate to quote incidents\nFrom angel investors or venture capitalists which included sexual overtures or badgering coercion or quid pro quo or flat out unwanted sexual contact so uh\n... me too but not in Silicon valley has to pay me too but maybe I'm so important and full of cash money that I won't get caught hash tag ... me too but nobody believes Brett Kavanaugh sorority so I'm good\nI\nDon't know what you make of this you know look\nThis was an out to a hundred and twenty five of the white combination are female founders eighty eight of them completed at there have\nBeen a three hundred and eighty four females founders altogether so I don't know why they weren't all surveys I doubt that these are not questions I have the answers to\nBut you know it's just not good it's just not good I\nAnd I don't know here here's another thing I don't really know I don't know when these incidents occurred so a white combinations not brand new they've been around for a little while so I don't know if these incidents or her pre the you know the outing of of a lot of these me two stories maybe some of them did I don't know the answer to that\nUm what I Do know is\nThis time for the stuff to stop already and in order for that to\nHappen in order for us to get better at that\nAs a society we need to start listening to women and believing the women and that doesn't mean we put somebody in jail if there is no evidence or or if it's thirty six years later\nBut when a woman comes forward and tells her story and has I'm Sorry I Know everyone on the right is is hearing me talking even though I haven't set her name I Know everyone is hearing Christine Blasey Ford 'cause I did say thirty six years ago and I know everyone is on the right is saying no corroboration\nBut there was corroboration there just wasn't cooperation that you want to accept\nTheir was corroboration the kind of cooperation that does hold up in court and that is that she did name him six or seven years ago or whenever it was or ten years ago to her therapist\nA and to her husband and that\nThere are other people many that corroborated his heavy drinking which was part of the incident described and that corroborated his sexual inappropriate ness\nWhich has nothing to do with drinking just in general his own yearbook corroborated the attitude toward sexuality that he had in those days\nSo you can discount all that stuff all you\nWant because yes you are correct in that there was no DNA evidence thirty six years later and the Christine Blasey Ford story it's true um but that doesn't mean that the man\nWhen at the he said she said is always to be believed and the woman is to be scorned\nAnd mocked it shouldn't be in that\nAnd the fact that in modern times because I can tell you for sure of the white company has not been around for thirty six years so in you know in modern times and the times of Silicon Valley incubator that one in five women are reporting these kinds of incidents from\nMen in power is disgraceful and I guarantee you\nThat\nThese women haven't filed claims about these things because they're not employee clams unless there was a rape or an assault where do you file a claim if a general purpose man in the public say by an elevator on an airplane decides to a group you who complain to\nAnd what does that you know organizations do about said complaint here's the problem a\nI and I have proper each one of my own story because I told neck I think right after it happened um ... Nick and I were doing an event a couple of years ago we were doing a live remote somewhere a and a potential male client of ours a potential sponsor for our show\nCame up to me and was sort of saying goodbye to me and put his lips on line it's just me right on the face with no invitation\nWith no nothing and you know I didn't feel fear I wasn't afraid I was going to be attacked or anything else but it was inappropriate physical contact that I did not invite\n\nThese things happen all the time there I guarantee you that that same man would not have walked nectar the elevator and try to plan a kiss on him\n\nOr you don't hear you well hello Nick is trying to talk but no no I'm In any case\nAh you know\nIt doesn't happen to men\nEver sometimes it does but it would not happen in ... I'm sure it doesn't happen with the frequency that happens to women to the bottom line is are these kinds of behaviors are going on all the time\nAnd the only look that particular incident that happened to me again I wasn't afraid it was not a big deal um but I'll I'll tell you what it did do it made me not want to pursue an ongoing business relationship with that person because I didn't feel comfortable I felt like that person wanted to uh\nHave a different kind of relationship with me I wasn't comfortable with that and so that was the end of that\nAnd that is unfair that as a disadvantage I have is a female and business uh that doesn't happen to a man\nAnd so if that were those two men trying to do business that wouldn't have happened and that could have been a pain client for someone else but it wasn't for me\nI'm that's why these things happen but you know what I'm trying to get out here is if I were to walk out of that situation what evidence do I have am I going to get my lips swapped like I ... it happened in private nobody else saw it there was no one else around\nWhat evidence do I have the only crew robberies and I have is that I pulled neck\nRight after it happened I said you never going to believe this listen to this and I told a\nBut\nThese are things that just have to stop you know I have\nI Do find it also fascinating that a lot of uh men\nAre you know so afraid now to have any contact with women that they won't even they don't feel comfortable giving you a minor hug hello or you\nKnow I take a picture in the studio with us at all of my guests after they've been here for an interview and I put my arm around them male or female and I feel like many of the men will put their arm behind me but they won't touch me on the back even because they're afraid\nAnd that to me is ridiculous so let's just be a hundred percent clear about that if you know\nYou're not doing anything wrong then don't be weird that's just you know don't be weird about it\nLike it's not weird to pose with somebody for a picture and put your arm on their waste or their shoulder\nIt's weird if you like reach her hand under their shirt in the back you know it's weird if you stick your hand down their pants and the back but if you're putting your\nHand on somebody's way is it's not weird so just don't make it weird you know you know when you're doing something wrong and don't pretend you don't because if your wife wouldn't like it it's probably wrong okay\nBut after like this uh and of course water's always helpful bottled water so I'm sure there's even in fact I Know there's a public's down there so even if you don't have something in your car and you're driving by pulling over run into the public gets you some bottled water and bring it on over\nA woman I have heard though if you do get like in general hygiene products like deodorant shampoo and things like that try to get like uncensored or ... so that way you can go to a man or woman and he'd been in the ...\nSame thing with any of that ... yeah gender neutral as much as you can yeah yeah that's a great idea I'm also if you don't have a chance to get down to Atlantic Station we understand because everyone is busy\nBut there's also a bill fund veep page that has been set up a to help with this drive and we'll post a link to it on our ... at the end of ... dot com so yeah go be helpful\nI'm OK moving on the\nBig story of the day of course is the death of ... the Washington Post journalist in an American resident not citizen but residents who was\nAllegedly killed a\nDismembered in the Saudi consulate in Turkey the Turkish government are very sure that the Saudi Government was responsible for the death and just member meant of a democracy ... the Saudi Arabian government denying it vehemently\nThe president a little bit stands alone in his with his administration I guess in his acceptance of said strong denial um when there is even\nWe haven't heard it or seen it yet but there is evidently a video and audio of the murder\nThe president was asked about this today at a news conference here's what he said\nThat I Do believe that the truth we have is for different exists with them but we always is for if it exists for us I\nI'm not sure yet that it exists probably does possibly the a level full report on that from Mike when it comes for just for that one of the things I\nDoes anyone\nBelieve let me just start with a simple question here and then we'll get to the more complicated ones does and I believe that the President Clinton talk to my ... while he was on ...\nI I mean that he's like on a plane and he's out of contact I Can't talk to him I don't I don't know what do you I didn't have a conversation with Mike since he had his meetings like I'll ask him when he gets back because I Want to give them a few minutes arrest on the plane\nWhat is that like is anyone buying\nI mean I think we've all seen pictures of you know presidents and diplomats and people talking on the phone on planes and so\nI'm pretty the technology we do indeed have the technology I'm fairly sure and I think pretty much now even um listen we know the president is all about the tweets and the tax and stuff and you can tax I think for free generally speaking almost like now so they could be could easily have texted I'm right there in the press conference and said hey I'm Mike did we get the audio\nDoes it exist come on people\nUm and that's just the barebones like that's just the easy question or the president downplaying whether or not this audio and video even exists really\nA lot more to talk about on this Saudi issue including the upcoming Davos in the desert who's going who's not only right back [noise]\n\n\n\nDean of average Joe coming up on

of\nThe pot pie shell back to the dean of average here on ... street\nCountry was meant to have is meant to have this meeting called Davos in the desert that was I think scheduled I think is was scheduled for next week and\nAh this was supposed to be sort of a coming together of you know many executives are financial executives from\nA all over the world to um\nTalk about economic reform and to\nYou know move towards uh the the kingdom's plans for the opening of its economy to all of these businesses like taping Morgan Chase\nA the Blackstone group black rock uh all kinds of folks like that and so it was supposed to be like Davos both a business leaders and a political leaders coming to this meeting but because of all of these happenings in and around uh\nThe death of Jamal 'cause oh gee or the alleged death I guess if you don't have a body whatever but\nA lot of very high profile profile executives have decided to step away\nFrom the meeting everyone from Richard Branson to a Jamie diamond again the company some of the companies I just mentioned a black rock Blackstone Group all of them saying we're not going to go to this um\nPeople from other countries I think two

Google's cloud computing business is not going Ford Motor executive chairman bill Ford won't go although his excuse was um I have I'm too busy\nI have a scheduling conflict so some of them are trying to distance themselves gently are not saying it's because of this human rights violations by Saudi Arabia but rather a for other reasons that they can't be there\nThe at least as far as I Know the one of the few people have backed away yet it's the mission of the Treasury Department\nAnd President Trump saying they are on a in a wait and see\nFrom that perspective from and whether or not they're going to attend establishing the desert conference a and they will make a decision on this by friday that's what the president has said um although at the same time I believe I heard Mike Pompeo say they want to give the Saudis\nI a few more days at least a week to two weeks to finalize an investigation so I don't know how they're going to make a decision if there's if the investigation the so called investigation isn't done\nThe way into the studio we'll be right back [noise]\nRemember Richard what's going on a phone call for you for the movie yesterday [noise]\n[noise] talk radio six
