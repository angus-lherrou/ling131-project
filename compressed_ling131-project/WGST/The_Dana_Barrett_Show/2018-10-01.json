I made a deal over the weekend and then I screwed it up and I needed I really needed to you I mean it's just a deal to sell myself I was there was a Craig's list deal but I think any credit if I'm wrong but I think practicing on something like\nThat a hundred percent you're absolutely right yes you practice was small stuff and you keep getting better and better and more confident and you see what works what happened\nWas under what I did so it was my so for bad for eight hundred and fifty bucks okay good deal and then there was a negotiated I said it a little higher\nAnd I knew that I Would negotiate a little bit and so ultimately make a deal with this young family to come by the south of ads for seven fifty and you know at first they wanted like six hundred and said no we're back and forth a few times and we settled I said look I haven't had it was that long the best I can do is I'm fifty great fine\nAnd they're trying to like make me feel bad like we have to rent to trucks and get this to big burly guys to help us and you know concussion and were weak and we've all these problems in our baby and yada yada\nAnd trying to talk of heartstrings but I help from seven fifty then they\nThey get the cows all the way out of my I should have gotten the money before yes thank yeah OK data that one oh one baby guess\nCats all the way out of the house and then the guys like would you take\nSeven hundred while so I took some and I think I screwed up so well it depends\nIt depends on what did you want most I mean if you were trying to do the right thing and help a family and then hey give for you if you wanted your money\nYeah girl a and and that's when you if you invite like a cute boy over to help and then you can offset all their high got to carry it down it's kind of a pain hey no problem I've got somebody to help carry I Would say I don't we do eight fifty what do you say you're saying that I'm writing a couple of people get some ... boys over there I like\n... how\nI'm Sorry but that's weird\nAll new meaning to little rocket man though\nYeah mighty likes it that way [laughter] um\nAwkward on so many levels so such a strange thing to say we fell in love in the world\nI mean look to some extent we just have to laugh the stuff off and by the way how that didn't end up in every monologue\nMaybe only because it was Sunday night and all the shows weren't on I don't know but surely that's going to end up in some of the comedic monologues uh coming up because while he fell in love but look there's a lot of problems with that um\nThe guy he's in love with has assassinated a lot of people\nThe guy he's in love with our president the president of the United states of America the guy he's in love with has to this moment concentration camps in his own country he's starving his own people to this right now today that's what he's doing\nUm he is still building nuclear weapons and his nuclear capacity he's just not testing them\nSo the message this is sending out to the rest of the world is what\nHe's a loony to like he's so selective all he sees this is such a fascinating\nFascinating look at life right because all Trump sees is a net result\nHe doesn't care and he's made that clear in his own doings you've made it clear that he doesn't really care about the tactics he doesn't care what it takes to get there as long as you get there he doesn't care about the kind of human being that you are it doesn't matter as long as you get there and so\nThe fact that Trump has created a great economy and has you know made a new NAFTA deal and\nIt doesn't matter that he's gotten there as a laughing stock of the world it doesn't matter that he's gotten there with accusations from twelve or Thirteen Women about his own sexual misconduct or doesn't matter that he's gotten their cheating on every wife you've ever had it does none of that ... doesn't ...\nHonor that he's gotten there basically being a buffoon and it doesn't matter\nAnd it shouldn't matter to the rest of us that's what he's saying it's not about quality it's about net result\nI don't know but it just seems to me that if every company operated that way and we only care about how many dollars we're bringing in not the quality of our product\nOr the values of the company or the mission of the company or anything else that all of those companies would be in bankruptcy now because\nThe rest of us the consumers care we care about quality we care about values and to just blow off the fact that Kim Jong un is a murderer who\nIs still also notably entered trying to interfere in our election it's boggles the mind it just boggles the mind\nUm but he's a month and that's all that matters he's happy and he's in love and they're planning the next ... next get together\nSo it was a previous some it was like a honeymoon of sorts with it was I guess it's the first big trip you took together\nGas wealth to announce the first anniversary trip I don't know it's so bizarre I mean I got to tell you also though that there is messing this might be a one way romance this could be on recorded loves because there is a messaging coming out of North Korea\nThat is suggesting that things are stalled talks are stalled and they have out now it said that you know America is using bullying tactics and some other things and so\nThis this romance might be one way and by the way I don't think Kim Jong ... wrote the letters in English she probably wrote them and had them translated so it's possible that the love language the flowering as was really just add by the translator\nJust but not out there\n[noise] All right well we're talking about things that boggles the mind let me talk\nTo you about another big uh anniversary today if you will a more serious one today is the one year anniversary\nOf the horrific shooting in Las Vegas I'm so we had a shooting there that wasn't in a school um that we really never found out what the motive was that it was not\nTerrorism as far as any of the investigators cannot determine and when I say that I mean\nForeign terrorism in any way I mean anything where you're shooting ... you know at hundreds of people as terrorist acts but uh fifty eight people died in that shooting four hundred and Thirteen were wounded and at least a foreigner and fifty six were winded from or injured in\nSome way as they were fleeing and this was all a ... you know again in Las Vegas it was that ... loans shooter from the hotel window a\n\nI mean what have we done about it what what are we\nDone about it the guy's name uh uh you know he also killed himself the guy Stephen Paddock he's sixty four years old he was a retired postal service worker account and real estate investor he was a private pilot he played high limit video poker and was you know earning casino perks cause he was that good at it I guess getting a\nAnd gambling you know tens of thousands of dollars it wasn't porn disgruntled in that way or\nOne of his um people closest him I Want to say it was one of his brothers at the time I described him as religious sort of bored\nAnd that he was he just wanted attention this was something he was sort of ... you know board I mean okay um there were a lot of\nControversy after the fact obviously we got very political about this very quickly you know the left saying gun control in the right saying how dare you touch our guns a look at\nMental health well here's what's fascinating where a year down the road and pretty much nothing has happened I President Trump himself stood in front of a cameras at the time and said that he was going\nTo get rid of got a bump stocks which was a big part of what was used in the shooting um I don't know if you remember all the details here but the the guy uh that the shooter panic I hate to even like say his name because I had to even give his name any\nAnything a family to stop saying it but um\nHe had you know dozens of guns in in his hotel room\nAnd many of the ones he used and many of the ones he had had bump stocks added to them um and so you know even though the president even though there was bipartisan support to end the sale of bump stocks it's not they haven't ended it we're not there\nAnd it's over it's a year today it's a year since this happened um\nHere's the thing when the news media covers this stuff and I get I I guess I have to include myself in this we talk about what's in the headlines today and we get focused on what's in the headlines today and we don't follow up\nOn the least are the less sexy stuff which is the process of changing laws\nAnd so we don't cover it and so then it doesn't happen because the pressure comes off\nAnd as voters we don't even remember to ask those questions\nYou know remembers the victim's family of the victims and the and the victims who are only window but still alive those people are the ones who remember and so maybe you see some legislation like for example in Florida we did see some changes in the state of Florida because there were several shootings there um but nationally\nWe ... it loses our attention and so we don't stay on it and we don't demand that our our uh\nGovernment do anything about it we should we should get better at that I feel like we should make an effort to get better at that\nIt's almost like we just need a list but we need to keep a list okay remember to ask about this remember to ask about that I remember you know and these things that are important right now what's bundling up in our consciousness I'm is you know\nSexual violence because of the ... story but once the cabinet story has calmed down and decision has been made one way or the other we will move on to the next drama and it might be you know\nA hurricane or it might be a wildfire or it might be another shooting or it might be whatever\nIt is and then when it comes time develop we're like we don't even know what questions that we don't even know what traits to look for in our leaders not to mention the fact that they do we elect them to Congress and to the Senate and they get there and they do well nothing because there's gridlock\nAnd they can't get in the whole thing is incredibly frustrating I feel like\nHere's a here's what in my in my dream world here's what's neat what needs to happen we elect\nA Democratic Congress and then they put some stuff in place to get rid of the electoral college that'd be good remember that one put that on your lifestyle just housing that out there\nPut it on your list All right if the state of Arizona we're wrapping up our one but we'll be right back I'm going\n[noise] being a marriage show coming up on TALK radio six forty doubled [noise]\nTalk radio six forty double new ... three Atlanta [noise]\nAnd just go watch it for the funny 'cause it it it's pretty funny I'm up to and including the you know female prosecutor like\nLarry yes Rachel Mitch all uh being portrayed just how Larry us like she's like you will hear me referred to and throughout the day as the female prosecutor but it would be okay for you to just referred to me as a prosecutor other areas\nUh there's some really good stepping air worth watching for sure um but not to be overshadowed because listen ethanol is just some funny stuff all along and they've always got there a correspondence on the news desk and I feel like Michael Che did
