between now and next Tuesday meaning more than one a day\nLet me just ask a question has he worked this hard on anything\nOther than campaigning\n\n... or or yeah I couldn't even or golfing like why don't I mean I I'm trying to think of something he's put this much dedication and to that has to do with being president I mean if he is certainly we're not getting reports of it he could be you know spending hours at his desk working hard on something presidential and they're just\nHe doesn't win but of course as because he's never been particularly quiet about his white nationalist views and he won\nSo just to protect that this isn't a part of the fabric of what you know in the country already it's crazy\nIt's not like this is just now it's not like this is just under trumped by the way this

I really like like in the morning I'm like okay I got to get this author on today so that's pretty much\nEvery day\nEvery day every week is when I went down this show so anytime you want a listen the book well first of all you've been writing um about gender equality and sort of gender in general for a long time so why this book why this decade tell me a little bit about the inspiration\nDuring the Nineteen nineties when I returned it [noise] it was really [noise] Marie my own [noise] [noise] but you know\nUh but when I read in the journal I sort of looking at a janitor and looking [noise]

think you know what\nThink what was really fascinating for me is\nYou know I remember all the same things that you're talking about from that decade and you know I'm a little bit older than you but I'm Still young enough at that time too you know be influenced in many of the same way as into sort of feel the same things that sort of society and the whole south about those women [noise]\nUm but now when you put it all together in the book the way you do it's so clear that\nThat wasn't really fair in most cases and so I Want to you know obviously we can talk about Hillary Clinton all day but I Know people automatically are immediately fraud when you started talking about Hillary Clinton so I think it might be easier to talk about Monica Lewinsky in the sense that when you think about that in the contest\nIn any case there are women running for the top jobs and so I'm not saying you vote based on I just pointed out um also pointing out that the gubernatorial race in this state is apparently so close that both President Trump and\nObama will be coming to our state and the next week or so a blessing a week I should take back the or so um to campaign for their\nParty candidate so of course Trump will be here to campaign for Brian Kemp though he will not be in Atlanta he will be in making a\nAnd Obama will be coming to campaign for Stacey Abrams and I just saw that today I'm not sure do you know where he's going to be did you see that by any chance\nI Believe from our house right I Will take your well already sure he's going to be more ...\nUm so there you go uh it'll\nBe interesting to have both of them here of course [noise] playing or traffic accordingly [laughter] I'm I'm I I think it's interesting\nIn a lot of ways but we shall see it's going to be a close one ah there you know pretty clear everybody is pretty clear on what's going to happen in the house what's going to happen in the Senate you know we don't know race by race um but they are you know ... all the analysts and polls are saying that the\nRepublicans will hold the Senate and lose the house but it is likely that the Democrats will take the house but\nRace by race we don't know so it is still

seven P. M. the early voting places\nFrom a today through friday\nSo get out there and do it or a vote on election day if you like 'em but do it supporting and it's just going to be an interesting day here it's going to be an interesting gain a lot of states out the reason I was mentioning all of the the Congress the house and the Senate is just because the governors are a whole other issue and there\nAre several humans were all races around the country that are very\nClose and are likely to or missions they likely have the chance to switch from Republican to Democrat\nAnd you know the power of states is interesting and in this whole mix and obviously they're not the people that sit you know in Washington and make those same decisions but they have their own powers\nI'm that's what it's all about in this country and and having states' rights and having that be separate and it also is I think indicative\nOr even if even if we stay where we are the fact that the races are that close and that the president of the United states feels like he has to make almost to stop the day or more than two a day I Can't do the math he's got less than a week ago he's got six days he's making a lemon stops so two Jewish\nJewish day\nStarting today the fact that he feels like he has to do that to try to keep things where he wants them is just telling enough itself in any case\nAh I just wanted to mention that in case you're interested in seeing either President Trump or President Obama they're both going to be in the state so he can he make plans\nTo specific on that Obama will be more houses Forbes Arena friday at five gotcha I'm In trouble but you don't and make it I Can't find a location but the Sunday Times so\nThank you knew very neck always there for me buddy appreciate you are already in other news I Want to stick to sort of the the theme of the election and women on Wednesday because there's a new story out in the New York times that talks about yet another gender gap and this time it is a\nOne that we haven't really talked much about in the past and that is the fact that female candidates\nWhile there are many more female candidates running for office this year than I think ever before uh they still are falling behind when it comes to raising money for their campaigns and unfortunately in this country and I think probably most countries\nNowadays I'm ... money wins the more money you raise the better chance you have of winning your election because it's all about\nGetting out having your the bus out there with your logos all over it and having the commercials on TV running as often as you possibly can and your signs all over the place and all that stuff costs money and so\nUm you know there is a definite gap in the amount of money\nThat women are able to raise versus men and women are trying to um\nFind new ways a and creative ways to raise money but um they are still falling behind now in fairness this is the first year I'm certainly not the first year where there have been female candidates but the first year where there have been so many and perhaps as that\nContinues that trend continues which hopefully it will\nUm the donors will ... I hate to say it this way but take one more seriously and give equal amounts I I'll just give me an example of a one situation where the woman clearly raised less money than a comparable male candidate um and that is in the ...\nElection for um the uh in the Democratic primary for a house seat in Michigan a woman named Rashida I'm not sure you pronounce her last name ... something like that was positioning herself to be the first Muslim woman in Congress and\nUh she was given a donation by a man who uh said that he championed Muslim candidates across the country he donated just under a thousand dollars to her campaign she was thrilled then she found out he'd given three times as much to a\nRepresentative Keith Ellison the first Muslim men in Congress\nI'm twenty seven hundred is the max amount amount allowed by law I'm that\nSaid and said you know she ... her comment about this was look I Can't call them and ask why so she wrote them a thank you know and went on to win her primary and she has no Republican opponents or she will have the seat and uh\nThen um he did max out his his contribution to her at that point so look hopefully and that's just one example but there are many and the numbers are it's not like you know Ninety percent more that men are getting the women but the numbers are there\nUm and sit there pretty dramatic so\n[noise] um for example uh I think\nWomen have raised running for the house women have raised an average of one point four million and that's about a hundred and eighty five thousand dollars less than the average for men\nSo it's pretty significant it's not nothing you can buy a lot of ads for a hundred and eighty five thousand so\nMaybe just one on the show but on other shows you know joking obviously you could buy our whole show for two years for that\nOK moving on call us if you want to buy the shell I'm moving on in other\nOn Wednesday new Google again or still I should say in the headlines over sexual misconduct this time Google workers planning a walk out this week it was planned for Thursday and then um\nThe leaders of Google tried to respond and apologize so let's dig into this a little bit first of all um what is the issue at Google why are the Walker Walker's plan to work out\nThe whole other that's a whole other story [laughter] why are the workers planning to walk out well I'm Google has been you know accused of a lot of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct has been multiple cases um but a couple of them have to do with high profile employees\nWho were\nSort of\nForced out after accusations were made but were paid big payouts for example ah Andy Ruben who I Believe was a\nBroad to Google with the acquisition of Android a and was forced out after being accused of forcing a worker into performing oral sex on him back in twenty Thirteen he was sort of quietly pushed out and given a wait for it Ninety million dollar\nPay out that is the the price\nFor a sexual harasser a at Google that was a story that was on ... you know broken by the New York times and got out there and so ah you know the women in particular to open I think men and women are are not having it or they're just not having it and that's certainly one of the cases and there are\nOthers as well many of which have been in the headlines already um but again as I said son a Sunday\nThe question remains um if there will ever be specific evidence the ties the Saudi royal family in particular the royal crown prince a NBS to the um\nThe the killing itself did he give the order did he know about it uh it seems wildly unbelievable that he did not know about it if not order at himself\nUm but\nYou know apparently in this country we are a oh we're just getting word from one of our producers that Hannity is\nFirst show was on right here on W. GST I think that means that I Will be um elevated to the handy level you know by tomorrow probably or the next day maybe the next day maybe it'll take a couple of days whatever ah the point is of course I think he J. D. for that information by the by but\nUm look you know the point here is what do we need as America\nNot the citizens but the decision makers what what is needed for ... in this killing of democracy and\nWhat will we do if we don't get any more information than we have right now\nKeep in mind that the rest of the world is pretty clear on the fact that uh this is you know has was sanctioned by the governing body ... by the folks that are in charge over there in Saudi Arabia so what do we do\nKeep hearing a lot of discussion about the dollar value of the relationship and the question I think becomes\nYou know do we allow\nThe dollar value and do we allow a big contract which the numbers have changed over and over again if you listen to President Trump on what the contracts are worth but do we allow\nThat to outweigh\nHuman rights and it's that's the core conversation at its simplest level now how much you sanction country for how long you sanction country what you've demand of them to to stop the sanctions that certainly could be debated but the question really is\nDo we have to do something so we have to do something or\nAre we going to the rest of the world that you can do whatever you want\nKill people drop bombs you know one of her\nWe're making money with you or from you if we're not\nAnd the worst defense you have is trying to sell your milk more than our milk you're you're dead to us but if you're Saudi Arabia and your dismembered bring people\nHow that\nIt it's all good not by the way not only people to do is\nGo for it\nThat's fine because we have a military contract we ought to look out for yeah we got some some cash we got to have come in it so you know uh that's the big question and and of course now we also I still wonder is there even any more information that can be had\nLike at what point do we say we've collected all the information we're going to get time to make a decision anybody want to get that it's going to happen before the midterm anyone anybody anybody okay yeah you're right it's not going to put in a marriage that will\nMore nine of average show coming up on TALK radio six forty a St\n... radio show every Monday

feeling especially cruel or today and it's really developed here in our studio or to that and we have a brave [noise] joining us right now Joe ... is here from ... capital\nTo talk about something else that could be a little bit scary and that is the volatile market Joe how're you\nDoing great how are you\nYou know I'm ... but this is a bit of a\nScary month when it comes to the markets we've been hearing a lot for the last several weeks about stocks up their way down there a backup a little they're down and all this we've had a pretty solid market for a while now until it at all but overall\nGood but this is not so bad\nIt's I think it's starting to honor people a little bit in that there's a lot of factors that have been going on that have been brushed off over the course of the summer yeah and now because we have the election coming up a lot of the issues are coming to her head\nWhether it's the trade a dispute with China rising dollar which hurts corporate earnings and then we started to see is sort of changing the arm and some of the big time check names like Amazon and Netflix and\nThose were stocks and maybe some people thought were impervious or anything and uh that gets folks nervous and you see a lot of all Julie while people are making the decisions\nAll right so this may be um a really like Jay the sort of question but I I have to go here because neither of us who are not\nYou know watching this world day after day and who sort of maybe just have a four O. one K. or you know a an a step IRA or something like that and our our money is tucked away\nAnd we're focused on other things you hear all the time about you know it makes them are getting nervous like the market as a person is really happened like what's really going on behind the scenes is it people selling because they want to get out while they think the soccer is at its highest point like what what happened\nBut there are two types of participants in the market there's investors and and the speculators and in the near term speculators are driving things up and down that are trying to make money today make money tomorrow make money this week\nFor the normal investor or consumer they're putting money away every month and therefore one carried or saving for the future that's great you should actually enjoy these periods of time because if\nThe market's down ... percent for the month well the money that's going into your four one K. this month goes in its with the stocks about ... percent cheaper so you're actually getting more for your money\nYeah okay well that makes sense um but it really is just about this that speculator group or trying to move things around us to to do what they need to do and getting nervous I guess I like we started getting out you know if they see Amazon reporting lower than expected a forecast or earnings or whatever and then they make a decision based on that\nYeah it's just the crazy guys like me sitting behind a computer all day a staggering watching what's going on now making decisions all day long you\nSay that you know we talk about this sometimes and here we feel like that's silly market you know they just\nSettled down it's going to be fine like I don't think anybody in correct me if I'm wrong here but you know Amazon did just have what lower than expected a forecast for the holiday season or something like that or not what it was\nYeah just that that growth is slowing Roseanne wrong and then um that tends to drive the stock price down stocks on almost twenty percent for the month but it's had a hell of a year already it's up over thirty percent for the year even with that are out\nThere I mean realistically nobody thinks Amazon's going away and nobody thinks Amazon's really going to be hurting\nRight people just get a little too optimistic and then they get a little too pessimistic and that's what creates the volatility I'm very famous investor Ben Graham who was Warren Buffett's mentor always talks about Mr market and as you say we sound like it's a person yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Barrett Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "31"}
