don't know her first of all you should\nAnd she is our negotiation ... the woman has negotiated like half a billion dollars worth of deals so far\nLet's just say we could get you a billion dollars to do it at some point um and now she's teaching other people had to do it yes ma'am I Love it yes I Do too except for people who don't know let's just do the short version of your background\nYeah cool so I was a sports agent for almost Twenty years represented a lot of professional athletes coaches broadcasters\nYou know and and what I loved about it obviously is being around the performers being around people that had to wake up every day and execute or they lost their job I mean and and so I began to ask myself what's the difference between the guys and girls that make it to the big leagues and the ones that down and\nUm so it was an amazing journey I did it for Fifteen Years and now I spend most of my time writing books and speaking and you know we do lots of other cool stuff\nWell I Want to get into the lots of other cool stuff because while that is all great writing books and speaking you're now doing more than that because you're doing workshops to correct\n[noise] yeah so we we uh we have master coaches all over the country to deliver workshops on a tour room of sixteen to thirty people we actually have a public workshop coming up here in Atlanta November twenty eight I'm and people can come in and learn a process that I saw work when I was an agent and\nYou know I think people often think negotiations about you know dollars and domination and\nSort of getting sideways and I think it's about connection and so we teach people how do you show up at the table how to the people you're negotiating show up and how do we drive connection\nHow do we really find common ground how do we learn how to ask for what we want we have lots of modules and tools that we teach three sixty discovery model a proprietary model we teach something called an easy walk\nWhich is a really cool you might need that they never your sponsorship deals gr I might need it so uh yeah it's um it's been fun 'cause I feel like we we can give back and and and serve organizations and people don't want to sign up and come to our poll one too so\nAlright listen I Want to get into this negotiation thing a bit because I had a ... I made a deal over the weekend and then I screwed it up and I needed I really needed you I mean this is just a deal to sell myself I there was a Craig's list the all but I think any credit if I'm wrong but I think practicing on something like\nThat a hundred percent you're absolutely right yes you practice was small stuff and you keep getting better and better and more confident and you see what works what happened\nWas and what I did so it was said my sofa bad for eight hundred and fifty bucks okay good deal and then they're going to go see it I said it a little higher\nAnd I knew that I Would negotiate a little bit and so ultimately make a deal with this young family to come by the sofa bad for seven fifty and you know at first they wanted like six hundred I said no we're back and forth a few times and we settle I said look I haven't had it was that long the best I can do is I'm fifty great fine\nAnd they're trying to like make me feel bad like we have to rent to trucks and get this to big burly guys to help us and you know concussion and were weak and we've all these problems in our baby and yada yada\nAnd trying to take it the heartstrings but I help from seven fifty\nThey get the cows all the way out of\nMy I should have gotten the money before yes I think yeah and that's one of one baby guess cats all the way out of the house and then the guys like\nWould you take seven hundred while so I took some of them I screwed out so well it depends\nOn what did you want most I mean if you were trying to do the right thing and help a family and then hey give for you if you wanted your money yeah girl a and M.\nAnd that's when he left you invite like a cute boy over to help and then you can offset all their high got to carry it down it's kind of a pain have no problem I've got somebody to help here who are saying and we do eight fifty what do you say you're saying I Want to bring a couple of people get some ... boys over there\nAnd you're saying doubled down and turn this into a dating opportunity for me\nLike as one of the only man you should go on a show every day we just have too much fun together she then you\nWould have sold yourself up for eight fifty they would've had to bring extra people to help carry it and you would have had to do it and play their ... and you've got now you're in the new sofa\nAnd I have an excuse to only date really muscle guys because I Need them to move furniture\nYou always have to be able to fit into their genes that's my role my I can still that in my husband's genes so he's still say that\nThese are the important things you learn when Miley Fletcher is on the air with us so just before we totally lose track Mali for people who do want to learn how to negotiate and take part in some of these workshops how do they find\nThe information yeah so we have a public workshop on November twenty eight turning land which is cool it's almost full we only have thirty spots available I think we have like seven laughter something I'm not sure but\nAnd then of course then go to a game changer three sixty dot com which at our website or Molly Fletcher dot com and there's a bunch of information about the programs if you want us to come in house with our coaches and deliver it or if you want to come to the public when it's a great way for\nYou know leaders inside of organizations going to get a sense for the content and make sure they feel like it's a nice fit in their ... together\nGot it All right you said the word leader it made me think about ... women which is coming up October twelve um you're going to be speaking there are at all and I am and we're getting good at that says are all day off like a stick with one hand um\nBut the theme this year is lead yourself and I I think I said this even when Angela was here I when I first heard it I thought what does that\nMean and I had to spend some time thinking about it but I don't have to deliver a keynote and you do so what does that mean to you when you got that word well I mean I think it it ... we've got to think about how do we\nShow up as our best self to the world how do we add value every day to the people that we want to serve the people that we are the most about and\nSo I'm going to be talking I'm working on another book I just want another book deal with a publisher I'm and I'm working on a book on energy management is going to be called the energy clock and so you know when we think about we live in a world don't we where we worry a lot about our time right like you and I've got eight minutes right I mean we are going on here we're going to\nBut what if we spent time thinking about how are we showing up at my filled up with a kind of energy I Need to deliver value in this moment\nSo and and for women I think particularly it's an important thing women tried to be all things to all people and trying to help women understand what are the energy drain or is in your life what are the boosters one of the things that fill you up and what are the things we need to get rid of\nShow that we can be our best self to the people that matter most so I'll be talking a little bit about that\nSo I I think that there's probably a lot in there obviously enough to write a whole book about it\nBut how I mean I think giving something up is probably the ... of of all the things you just mentioned I feel like we're pretty good about figuring out how to add things yeah I'm an even trying to get our heads right but the idea of actually saying no to something or taking something that is a good thing in our lives and saying\nI don't want this anymore it's not healthy for me that's really hard for women in particular I think\nIt is but I think if you take a minute and pause and you say what are the two or three things today reflect on your day at the end of today I Want you to do this okay there you go to bed at night and he laid on the eve of World War two or three things that really warm me out today what\nWere those things and what can I Do to remove them put somebody in place to help execute against those so that I can do what only I can do right so when we can on low dosing and then we can potentially get rid of those things\nStill does things up with one of the things that fills you up right so for me I Love yoga and ... I've got to get my work out in our I really can't show up as well as I Need to one of the things that ... up in the morning on all the things that drain us\nFill up with the things that fill us up the more we can be around you know show up as the best version of ourselves\nYeah I Love that and then I also love the idea of applying that to the people we work with as well and the people that work for us as well\nAnd when we think about leadership and we think about being a great leader we can't we can't lead if we don't have enough energy we cancel problems if you don't have enough energy right we can inspire other people if we don't have enough energy so it's important\nI Wish they had a pill for that Molly Fletcher but instead they have you thought there and leader cast\nWomen and that's how we solve these problems with them I always great to see you thank you so much for spending some time with us today um and for people who want to see my only come out to leaders half women October twelve or check out her upcoming workshops at game changer three sixty dot com we'll post a link to all of that on our show not paid at the\nTalk radio six forty ... three at ...\nSo I Want to talk a little bit about you know how you're seeing that and what perspective um you're taking on that but also um\nUm I I just have to ask you how big 'cause I Know you started by yourself obviously how big is your company now in terms of number of people\nYeah I mean in terms of staff are so small and have a five\nBoys Britain in terms of the impact that we've done we've actually donated hands every children's hospital in America\nAt Fifteen countries now about the wide reach which I'm really proud of\nWell I don't necessarily think anymore in modern times it takes a huge team to have a big impact like you are so I Do appreciate\nThat but also an Emmy correct me if I'm wrong just but I Do feel also like going from no employees even to that first employees a huge hurdle for a lot of small you know solo entrepreneurs and to have five employees is a real thing you really have a team that you have to lead correct\nYeah yeah I mean my first employee with my college roommate ... grill\nHad even after ... days so that it's pretty cool to see how far we've come\nAre to talk to me about this idea of leading yourself what does that mean to you\nI think for me leading yourself is really throwing all that you know preconceived notions that you have to be an expert or you have to have it I'll figure it out or you have to have\nA a rule book to know what you're doing I think it really for me I've been the biggest indicator it's been passionate purpose\nAnd even if I don't know how to get from a to B I'm going to figure it out because I Believe in it enough and I I feel like that taco going to be a theme for a lot of the women that we here at leader cast is really not about having it all figured out or this perfect plan but just like I said before being persistent because you know that it matters\nYeah absolutely I think one of the other things I keep hearing and I know I'm feels true for me also is this idea of not necessarily having it all figured out by sort of knowing yourself um and and well yeah are capable of and what you're not and and sort of not being quite so hard on yourself too\nYeah I I heard a quote one time that was I never knew what I was doing but I always knew that I could\nI could sum up the past six years that is it\nYeah I Love that well given ... where you are um where do you see the company going where do you want it to be you know in in twenty twenty eight\nYeah we I mean twenty twenty eight I Would love this might be a weird answer than if I Would love to not be around anymore it would be really great to\nUltimately help solve the problem that er originally inspired us to START I think when you're a company that is trying to fulfill a problem and that problem to be solved which for us is trying to cancer\nA that would be the best eggs that I think I could have so um we partner with research organization to see what we can kind of raise awareness and I'm hopefully march closer to that every year but in the meantime\nAh the more that we can get our name out there the more headband that he got there the more we can donate or your hospital prom reviewing art therapy programs where the kids can actually design and create their own head band so we're constantly seeing how we can do things better what more we can we do to help\nJust that it's an amazing answer it sounded weird answer it's a great answer and I hope you're right uh especially you know with the problem that you are trying to solve I'm Jess we're looking forward to having you in Atlanta for a leader cast women so a weight looking forward to you hosting\nI Know it's going to be a lot of fun we will see you then again I was just extreme she is a prime example of doing well by doing good he's got to love that were posted a link to all things

going on the show today of being that words matter so of course that and who better to have on the show and then one of a Atlanta's favorite talkers Celeste Headley joining me on the phone I think the Atlanta listening audience is probably thrilled to hear your voice to last how are you\nI'm doing well thanks how are you\nI Am great and I I shouldn't I kind of cut your by off halfway through because I'm so excited to have you on the show 'em but you know a long time\nOn our radio talker but also author of a book called we need to talk to have conversations that matters obviously words matter a lot to you as well\nThey do yes and I want people to use more of them\nIn a text more is good for is good yeah I'm ... and good ones would be good um but I Wonder\nBefore we get into a sort of from so first of all you're going to be in town on friday for a leader cast women were excited about that\nYeah me too um and I want to get into sort of a little bit your views on leadership uh\nAll that but before we do for people who sort of don't know the whole story of how you got where you are now can you share a little bit of the journey through the Ted Talk in the book and all of that\nSure so I I've been working for public radio for NPR and the R I and others for about Twenty years now but um I was asked to do it had headaches talk in Savannah and the prompts that they gave me was think of something that you think is going wrong and then tell us how to fix it\nSo the first thing I thought of was I'll tell you what's going wrong we're not having conversations with each other and I know actually knowing exactly how to fix that so that's where the head ... came from um it has a were Seventeen million views now and out of that came the book as well\nSo why do you think that resonated so much with people I mean we're there are a lot of TED Talks and they don't all get that kind of viewership\nI then I was the most surprised of anybody I honestly did not expect\nThat kind of response I I thought most people would find that a pretty boring topic um you know you know needing that worker training where they said at a train you in soft skills and everybody grown right I figured\nThat the response you've got to be but honestly I mean all these years later thinking about it\nI think that a lot of people and worldwide are beginning to realize that something going wrong um and trying to look for a way to fix it and I think that's what ends up in a Google Search that leads them to me\nYeah I think you're right about that I saw last heavily on the phone with us right now of course award winning journalist and now author a and I I think I heard you're working on her second book too is that correct\nI Am with with Random House which is a it's it's in the same line it's a natural progression but it it's basically talking more about wellbeing and our session with productivity and efficiency\nWho interesting or I don't want to leave this idea of conversations a quite yet because I think it's important and you know I think it's extremely challenging and the digital\nEra that we're living in I feel like you know my daughter for example communicates with her friends a lot but I'm not sure they're really saying anything so when you're sort of talking about how to have a conversation that matters what sort of the first piece of advice\nI mean the first thing is that texting and emailing has not Congress's shank you I and I and I know I mean all I\nI have a twenty year old son that Gen Z what they call ... is that they are they're perfectly skill that conversation they're perfectly skilled at social relationships\nBut they're the most likely generation to believe that texting is the same as in person or on the phone occasion and it just isn't not by any measure not neurologically not emotionally not physiologically it just it is it yeah and and I think more and this is something all of us fall\nPrey to is that we tend to think that email for example is more efficient\nBut that's a complete the illusion we we have the real evidence actually backing up that what you think is an efficient as clear concise message that you said someone\nYou it's not actually being read the same way when it reaches the other end right so there's it's wife with miscommunication and we also know that in email you're more likely to escalate conflict you're less likely to negotiate you're less likely cooperate so all of those tax base messaging that will just\nWe're replacing phone calls with is really hurting us\nYeah I totally buy that I've had a lot of miscommunication over ... you know you think somebody's mad at you and they're not or you know ... and a and also you're right about efficiency I never really thought about that but I Know when I Want to get something done faster I pick up the phone so much fun yeah yeah\nBut that makes you a rare and maybe it's because you talk for a living [laughter] yeah well you're not afraid of calling people\nI mean I don't know I Am a little bit afraid I just do it anyway\nI'm to be honest I'm All right we're going to run in the times I Want to make sure we get to sort of this idea of conversation and and words and all of that as it relates to leadership because you know as we mentioned you are going to be here for leader cast\nOn friday I I Will be there as well I'm very excited um but you know I think part of being a good leaders being a good communicator yes\nYeah it absolutely is and and this idea that you can lead from uh your office by say sending emails and newsletters and\nThings like that if that's just um again that's that's really delusion there has to be face to face interaction and I want to point out that most most of the time\nUm meetings that occur in office spaces are not good communication\nThat's why so many people hate them that's why people view them as a waste of time it's because you're not actually communicating well or taking advantage of the ideas and the innovation that you have there in your employees so you've got to find a different way and that's going to involve actually talking to people face to face", "show_name": "The Dana
