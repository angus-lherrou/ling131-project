conspiracy theory possible on what their motives were and\nWhichever side you're on those are the theories you're going to ascribe to and that's kind of bias you're going to put on a staff\nEven the way we talk about it is\nIt's so clearly biased so\nI'm just quickly I Know we don't have time to time for this but just quickly I tuned in to Fox and friends this morning for the first time in a long time just to see what they were covering what they were saying about it a and Steve do you see who is one of the Fox and friends host\nUm you know introduced a story on the bombs this way\nThat ... as

they've handled the situation a with a real sense of resolve or they're not going to let an act of terror intimidate them it's absolutely terrorism because an effort to use violence or to make a

mean a package scare for me is when I ordered something on Amazon Prime and it hasn't arrived yet and I needed to wear those shoes for an event tomorrow night that's a package scare\nYou know or maybe a bag of scares like I open up my Amazon Prime box and instead of the blender I order you know I got the shoes that I really didn't mean to ... click on you know ... one click buy or whatever\nCome on a package scare me that is so minimizing of what's going on here but there is one piece of really really good news and all of this and that is that none of these bombs exploded\nSo before we start guessing about whether or not they were intended to explode and the guy was just not savvy or they were never intended to explode it doesn't matter\nThey are bombs they were sent to a high level people former presidents sitting senators\nAnd they were sent to you know insight tell\nBut the good news has no one has been harmed\nAt least so far so that that's one piece of good news we are going

cyber security on the whole is is you know terminology that we've been hearing for some time now and we've you know as consumers of news we've heard a lot about it but I think most Americans\nEither sort of don't really get it or don't really see how it affects us or aren't maybe taking it that seriously so why should we\nCare about cyber conflict free shot or as much as it goes so far we're not at a scale or\nThe individual and you know the\nCredit card you had a target right numbers stolen or your personal information was stolen something else was personnel\nManagement at the United states

explain the geopolitics of countries are trying to decide as inexpensive\nShorter than he was in that let's think of it in terms of comes easy to understand why it's a question for you or anybody who doesn't want to take on the United states right\nWell I mean you talk about this in about two but and and you even just sort of Saturday Night in that summary and in the sense that it is it's not like the cost of nuclear weapons I mean this is anybody can hire the right hackers and and get into anybody else's systems so it's a much more level playing field correct\nFor nuclear weapons eight millions of dollars on a rainy and we're not that easy to come by in a way to refine the gas [noise] ... yeah again that you could use a\nNuclear weapon it takes a lot of work at a big footprint for

immigration and what is happening um\nAnd I can't even say what is happening at the border but what is it going to happen at the border in like thirty days or so\n[laughter] when the caravan or that have had it this way gets here [noise] um this is ed\nIssues that the Republicans really want to focus on right now because they feel\nLike it riled up their base and we'll get them out to vote on that they can you know really drive home the fear of other the fear of people coming across the border to take your jobs and to harm you physically to you know\nKill your kids and you know rapists and yadda yadda bought a block [noise] so um this is\nBubbling up in a big way right now I'm curious to Nelson who is the a\nHead of homeland security is not seeming to be overly concerned with a package is filled with bombs being sent all across the country um which is a terrorist threat although we now know it came from a Florida resident named um\nWhat's his name Caesar say I I don't know I Can't remember that but uh in any case she rather that was at the border\nWhere nothing is going to happen as it relates to the caravan for thirty days or so these are folks that are walking this way are\nStill just under a thousand miles away I Believe um and they are only averaging about twenty five miles a day so um and let's see you do better for the record 'em but um\nThat's where she was not for her focus has been on the border at Trump's now also saying and kissed a personal sin both saying that all options are on the table including sending additional military\nEarlier today Trump\nSaying he's going to send additional military interests and nails and saying that the military has quote no intention\nOf shooting at the caravan [noise] um but the rate is\nAbsolutely determined and listen when I say the right I don't mean everybody who votes Republicans will just be clear about that I really mean um some of the the top talkers from the administration along with Fox News and that's what I'm Talking about so I should give out or I should call that something I was like they find a way of labeling\nYou know all the news I don't like as the mainstream media so what does that make them the other stream media the right wing media the or just Fox News maybe just maybe this is like Fox News and all their assorted sundry a radio talk show hosts [laughter]\nI don't know in any case they want you to believe that this is a real scary thing if these people by the way\nI Believe the numbers or something like this and I could be wrong but my my sense of the numbers is it this ... started out with something\nLike seven thousand people but that it's already dwindled down to about thirty five hundred people and then it will likely continue to diminish overtime because it's very hard to walk twenty five miles a day I'm In heat with your kids and in flip flops and carrying your belongings\nSo many of them are sopping wherever they are in Mexico and either turning back or staying there\nUm and it is again unclear how many of them are going to make it all the way to our borders\nBut it is certainly going to be you know it's less than five thousand from what I understand now in the caravan um but it's being characterized again as a very terrifying thing I just want to put it in perspective we have three hundred and thirty something million citizens and we have three\nThousand people walking here poor people who are hungry and tired and yes some of them are riding on the backs of trucks for portions of the journey because nice people in Mexico are giving them a left 'em but\nThey're ... if you see any pictures of these people they really are the furthest thing from scary that there is a but this just this morning a Fox and friends had an\nAuthor and one of the regular contributors on the show ... and she was talking with a Fox and friends host Steve do see about this caravan I Want you to listen to this conversation\nI've gotten so many emails from people just don't call it a cat caravan coal is an invasion is that fair\nOf course it is and it's a full scale invasion by a hostile force and it requires our president and our commander in chief any means an esoteric necessary to protect our sovereignty\nReally a full scale invasion by a hostile force I mean I say that you know when like their answer my kitchen 'em\nOr you know but that is that's because I'm In and the judge reader\nI mean there's no comparison here to a full scale invasion by how America's never actually had a full scale invasion by a hostile force we wouldn't even begin to know what that looks like but I can tell you what it doesn't look like\nMoms and babies in flip flops walking slowly from Mexico over months to get here that is hardly a full scale invasion by hostile force if it\nIs I think we could beat them like come on you know\nThere's no evidence that there's a weapon among them\nNot to be new ugly looking at it but I'm pretty sure if you will please tell which are shoals would take care of that problem if it was a\nRight so we're both we both have like already put our feet in our mouths in the segment and and I appreciate that you did that and you hardly even say anything on the show and but I mean I shouldn't compare anybody to bugs and I'm not but I what I mean is this is not a full scale invasion\nCome on\nBy a hostile force and our presidents should require a requires our president to act and use any means necessary to protect our sovereignty because our sovereignty is in jeopardy\nIs going on\nAnd there are people I'm sure\nAbsolutely buying into that a hundred percent um these people are not criminals\nWell let me let me rephrase at worst they're criminals at worst but they're not but at worst they're ... they're certainly not a hostile force\nI mean I just can't even well like you said half of their numbers have dwindled since this caravan started so they're also whatever they may be they are not well organized no I mean because half of them have left\n[noise] yeah it is one of those things where you know we're taking people that are desperate to get away from a horrible situation and turning them into a ... a political device that try to you know stokes fear in this country and drive people to the\nPolls 'em\nTo vote for the fear mongers it's just disgusting honestly I'm it's so disgusting um\nAre many many many more serious issues in this country can we do something about guns and I'm not saying take them away don't get crazy on me but can we do something about mass shootings can we do something about mental health how about opioid abuse let's talk about opioid abuse where there's so many other things to talk about that are ...\nIt picture here okay All right we'll person pictures for ya uh of this he doesn't look too he looks a little bit like ...\nI'm I'm just saying he's got he's a little bit of crazy I you know what I mean\nI'm In any case that's the good news or the bad news of course in that in this whole case for me is that once again this is just forced us further apart this is just broadening the divide or the president\nHas made several a teleprompter teleprompter Trump\nTalks in which he uh suggested that we should unify I'm going to come together\nAnd then he would you know basically take a breath and then the next sentence say oh but by the way let's blame the media and the Democrats oh and the media and the fake news and the media the mainstream media outlets blame them so so much for unification and and also you know\nI really I'm a bit of a broken record here but it's like you're living in a glass house buddy he's accusing depressed of of you know riling people up with negativity\nGlass house glass house a pot calling kettle black\n... it's almost like a it's it's it's almost like how dare you pretty busy can I say that I'm here to make 'em to to try to act like you're a ... the measure of calm and you know constructive criticism and that's just not the truth\nAnd you know we we talked about this a little bit yesterday but I'm all for a joke you know I'm all for awhile place joke or a criticism but Trump has gone way beyond that on many occasions suggesting that he is in ... not suggesting I'm Sorry let me rephrase that saying clearly\nThat he is an armored with violent behavior\nIncluding punching people in the face including body slamming people as an example of his you know ... you know his loyal fans he talked about himself you know walking down the middle of the street and shooting people like this is not\nOK and we all are responsible for putting someone in power who talks like that and by celebrating them every time they say something like that uh and there is there has been certainly um is similar comments from the left to this is not all Trump but to act like he isn't contributing is just ridiculous\nAnd anyone who has contributed myself included if and when I have I don't believe that I have but if and when those mistakes have been made we need to really review that I Know up to it and stop doing it and stop celebrating it when others do it um\nYou're never going to stop the craziest from being crazy but there is something that made this man feel empowered at this time\nUm\nAnd there was something that made this man target the people that he targeted at this time a and based on the stickers that are all over his shady a kidnapper van um\nHe you know as a fan of Donald Trump so\nYou know he he's not driving around and Maxine Waters man and just putting it out\nThere you know um what is true ah look in any case that is\nA one of the stories we're following that is just a unfolding still a very quickly today a lot happening today including the arrests including to more of these packages at least you are being found but there is a other stories we want to cover so up next we're going to get\nTo the Saudi Arabia story there are some new developments there and the a death in December men of journalists ... uh the Turkish\nPresident has had some more words on the subject so we'll get to that right after the\nDean of errors show coming up on TALK radio for a double the

forgotten about democracy the Saudi journalist who was killed and dismembered in the ah Saudi consul I'm Sorry in the Saudi conflict and turkey ah it's been several weeks now since the\nActual murder occurred and the uh outrage that ensued worldwide has already gotten quiet and the news cycle it's not over people are still talking about it a little um but turkey a and the Turkish president or or to one really are not satisfied with Saudi Arabia is Saudi Arabia's response a\nPresident or to one has increased is pressure on Saudi Arabia by suggesting earlier today or late last time I think it was earlier today that he had more evidence to release and that if a\nSaudi Arabia did not come forward with the full story a and admit there I'm\nPart in all of this than he would come forward and that sort of the way he's been operating which is interesting he's been very ferment is\nA language but he sort of only been trickling evidence forward um I think trying to give Saudi Arabia an opportunity to I don't know not get their story straight hopefully but just come forward and be truthful\nA and I'm not sure what I don't know enough about all of those relationships over there to understand why that's important but um that is he's not giving up let's put it that way I'm president Irwin is not giving up on this and he wants this I'm\nTo be handled by Saudi Arabia the way he believes it should be a Saudi Arabia has changed their story or on\nOn this killing several times for saying that a cause showed you left the embassy on his own they don't know what any once they don't know what the problem is if he is that it wasn't not now me I didn't do it\nUh then they ultimately admitted that he was killed but said it was an accident in a and interrogation that went wrong and that the crown prince nothing about it and be asking him nothing about it they then later sort of gave a little bit more detail but sort of stuck to that same line a\nOf a response being that it was in a chokehold in a fight that ensued um and that somehow um you know there was a chokehold and cause he died from that\nUm but it was unintentional um they are now admitting as uh the last twenty four hours that the killing of come out a democracy was actually\nA pre planned so that's new\nNew a revelation by Saudi Arabia admitting that it was something that was planned so but again still

this Saturday tomorrow is your last chance to do it if you cannot get out of your job you know to early vote Monday through friday or your hours are just not right to do that\nOr then tomorrow is the last data early votes in our state and you can go to the um\nWhat is it the secretary of state website to get the voting the early location or early voting locations for your county um but don't forget don't forget to vote it's so so so important um it is a really close race and that actually alone I think might get more people out to vote\nSometimes when the polls are a a shoo in for one or the other um people are like you know he's gonna win already doesn't need my vote or she's so not any way gonna be able to make up that you know two point drop or whatever it is since you don't need me but when it's close like this people might think their vote actually count and guess what it does\nSo uh it's again it's Saturday as you were if you need a Saturday if you need that weekend ability weekend vote there is no Sunday hours and tomorrow is the last Saturday or of the early voting cycle in our state where I'm the polls will be open I\nDo not understand that I really don't I don't see why because they they always do that they do early voting for a certain period of time and then they stop it for two or three days and then ... election day I don't get that\nIt doesn't like the one excuse that I've heard many times as you know the the paying to keep it staffed so to speak you're keeping people there but then again\nOr most people work in the polls volunteers I think you're all volunteer right so that's how the discussion I heard\nFrom a number of people as you can always keep people there\nYou know 'til nine o'clock and on ... and stuff like that [laughter] benefit ally fake\nFake news come on that is not true and I guarantee you and they they are more people that would happily volunteer if that was the case they don't they don't look for that they don't try to now come on that's\nAt all so therefore it for everyone out there usually your Saturday pulling for tomorrow is bliss hours yeah get out and vote so please please please check it and see what time they close down and you can get there at seven o'clock at night 'cause most of them are open that way\nRight it's I think it might be five or but it does depend on the location\nI just had my pulled up my closest for tomorrow there you go\nI'm Glad you said that writes a definitely double check 'em I think I mentioned the other day I tried to go early vote and I thought I could do it at the place that I had early voted in the summer when there was a run off a journal over there I'll confident you know like around five o'clock\nAnd I pull up and there's like no signage that says anything about voting and so I'm looking around like OK I felt really dumb uh so I Googled it while I was sitting there on my phone and sure enough my early voting that early voting location is open but not until this coming Monday\nOr the twenty ninth is when it will be open and I know everybody's going to get distracted next week because of Halloween\nBut don't forget um if you you know if you weren't really vote you may have less lines if you try and early vote especially if you try to go on and on our like I don't know if you have a flexible schedule and you can do it\nThe best thing to do is go like smack dab in the middle of the afternoon you know like at two o'clock or at you know of a like eleven AM or ten thirty am or something like that you know when it's not lunchtime and it's not before work and it's not after work it was just sort of randomly in the middle of the day if you have any flexibility to do that I Would say that's your best bet for the shortest possible mine's\nUm and then you can you can do that thing afterwards after you vote where you like\nPut your arm up and reach back and give yourself a giant pat on the back for being a patriot and caring about your country and your state and your and your neighbors you wrap your arms around yourself and give yourself a big hug and say I'm awesome because I voted\nYou just got like sex and more attractive I'm thinner young",
