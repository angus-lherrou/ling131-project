know are the Trump fans that Trump's base and the rest of the Republicans going to be fired up enough to show up a good place to vote for governor and are they going to place it\nOn a guy who has aligned themselves very strongly with Trump or\nOr the or the other thing the opposite going to happen to those who are anti Trump going to show up and vote against Trump essentially by voting for

you know buried show here on WG a [noise]\nMoney in this country and\nOur next guest is all about\nBecause he co authored a book with Alan Greenspan called capitalism and American history Adrian well dredge joining us on the phone right now Adrian how are\nYou I'm very well thanks for taking some time to talk to us today I'm obviously there is\nA lot of history to go through and we are only going to scratch the surface in this interview but I guess my first question is what what was the decision to even write this book at this time\n[noise] well I mean Greenspan I share a price cool Scott lawyers and he'd be ... separately\nAnd he looks for bringing together because it's the same sorts of things they have a a mutual approach they agree on a lot of things about bringing them together um so ... bringing us together I think with two tools is this\nUm there there was very very few single histories of the American economy\nYou know it's a for some reason there is an under supply of small kids\nAnd the huge debate growing it back capitalism about whether it's the best system six percent of young people say that they do the capitalism is the best system from school so this ... with us together on three the three weeks three weeks later this book is a much\nIf you have three weeks that would be something\nThat would be productivity of the big story in this book but ah yeah probably\nYeah this is quite a quite a break he got here is a big bucks and I I Do have to tell you I did read it and I did find it fascinating\nAnd um I Want to ask you you know to she brought it up that way do you think capitalism is the best method you know the best system\nWell wait we spoke with a measuring a meeting of apples in sixteen Clinton said we'd say\nImagine if that's all that great a represents all agree on in the world ... I'm not sure the apples to sixteen twenty right and they were all given which will be the great ... of the future and the Chinese would make a good case for China\nThe British would make it sort of case but Britain Spanish or make it\nA case of ... in the next the Indians would all cases new but they would have a conversation of the United states it would it be completely irrelevant it's a gene covers on the periphery of the world\nAnd America accounts for twenty five cents of GDP with ... percent of the population and the reason for that\nCredible gross from from the tree like that's a big such a powerful economy because American Capitalism more enthusiastic than any other country so yes I think capitalism is the great as they should have ...\nIt is sort of a modified version of capitalism now corrupt well\nSays we don't have to bail bank fact again so that that that in a better position to defend that that position if you talk to your assets if the financial bubble bust then they can um bail themselves that they were wrong being bailed out by the financial system as a whole are the ones that mole rebuffed when it comes to shocks from outside\nUm and I think is upholding that's um\nYou know the society as a whole ended up ended up you know enjoying the costs of these things where I'm a you know if you do that you know you encourage risk taking behavior and you've got the wrong people banging the calls but we say let that that that that doesn't have\nThat would be forced to to have bigger capital buffers and if you have a very simple requirement the ... bigger capital buff as you can get rid of this whole very complicated um don't front legislation in the lab regulates has\nTo do what they should be doing which is the routine of fraud and criminality and let the banks you know the ... the banks be regulated themselves by just by the simple mechanism of of all of a higher higher capital requirements\nAbsolutely Adrian thank you so much for spending some time with us today I really appreciated the book again is capitalism in America I'm telling you very eye opening it should be required reading for everybody running for office in this country if not everybody who's voting very important stuff especially if you're conservative I'm just saying that\nUm capitalism in America again by Adrian will drainage and Alan Greenspan available wherever books are so it is it ... and we will be right\nI'm really\nWhere do you think forty WGM\nAll back to the Green Beret show here on ... street [noise]\n\nCapitalism in America that we were just talking about with Adrian ... one of the co author of course the other co author being\nAlan Greenspan brings up a lot of really important points in history that have to do not just with money but also um with government in this country and how is organized Enron and how it has changed over time and you know I think we forget some of uh the important\nPoints when we are arguing about current politics when we think about you know we always want to hearken back to the constitution and say well this was in the constitution therefore it shouldn't be taken away or that was in the constitution therefore it shouldn't be taken away um but we forget about\nHow life was one of those laws were made and even things that came along later we were talking just before the break about Social Security Medicare Medicaid and how those entitlements those programs\nAre actually one of the biggest cost in this country and our one of the biggest reasons we have the ridiculous deficit that we have in the crazy amount of ... that we have and so when you look at the history of the country for example\nA constitutionally when some things were decided let's say for example that Supreme Court justices should be nominated for life when that decision was made people didn't live into their nineties and to a hundred they died on average in their forties\nSo when you were pointing someone to the Supreme Court in the earliest days maybe they were on it for a dozen years\nFifteen twenty not fifty not forty and fifty years that has changed so\nYou know it's not that the constitution was oh Eric with us wrong don't get upset but it was for a different time and perhaps now Supreme Court justices should have term limits perhaps they should be forced to retire and not be able to run or be re nominated after\nYou know age Seventy I\nYou know what's right here I don't have the answer and maybe you grandfather that end but it does seem like these are things that we just don't we sort of assume that they're right because our founding fathers said so what our founding fathers as brilliant as they were did not have a crystal ball they could not envision a world where people live\nTo a hundred what happens when we improve our health even be further and we live to a hundred and twenty a hundred and fifty it could happen we can and we can't think of it right now but it could happen and if it does\nThen we're going to have Supreme Court justices who are on the bench for\nEighty years I mean I don't think that's what they intended [noise]\nUm when you look at programs like Social Security Medicare Medicaid or\nWhen those programs were were created they were created for workforce that look very different than the one we have now\nAnd so the idea that you should be able to start getting those benefits let's just talk Social Security for a moment in your early sixties most people can work way beyond that and should be working way beyond that do we really need thirty and forty years of retirement\nI mean if you're living to pay a hundred might be an exaggeration but it's just an easy round number and we're getting close well into our Ninety some people right so you know if we're living in to our nineties into a hundred and you're retiring at sixty that's forty years\nI'm sitting around doing nothing it's almost half your life we don't need that I mean my stepfather is eighty nine years old\nAnd he works still even after he just liked it um but a lot of people could continue to work\nAnd should continue to work instead of living off the government because once again when Social Security was put in place it was put in place with the assumption that you were going to die within a dozen years of the time that you got on it not thirty and forty years\nAnd we are not\nJust by the way getting back to the money we put in we're getting back as individuals far more than that\nSo I'm not suggesting we'd get rid of Social Security altogether but what I Am suggesting is that these programs should be reformed one of the things that are Adrian will drudge and Alan Greenspan say in this book a capitalism in America is that we should look at raising the retirement age by the way it is set to be raised I Believe to age sixty seven and I think it's twenty\nTwenty one or twenty to something like that\nBut that's not enough it should actually be at least Seventy if not Seventy two and\nHonestly if we pushed it back just that little bit that would be enough to save the program for quite a number of years beyond where it's going to go right now if we leave it alone and there are similar problems with Medicare\nAnd again I'm not a Medicare expert but one thing I Do know is that Medicare isn't as a benefit that is given to everyone regardless of income or ability to pay for yourself\nOr the solely based on your age so again starting at age sixty five I Believe it is Medicare benefits are available to anyone over age sixty five and I guarantee you that there are a lot of wealthy people in this country who are taking Medicare benefits who could afford to pay for their own benefits\nSo and by the way just in case you're wondering here\nOne of the people most responsible for the expansion of and I don't say expansion in the way that states do it but hold on a second uh who\nDrove up the cough when they put it that way of Medicare or more than any other in recent history is George W. Bush who added prescription drugs to Medicare which is outrageously expensive\nSo I think it's great for people who really need a prescription care coverage if they're getting it but every one over sixty five doesn't need that additional benefit and they're getting it and so who's going to argue with that of course I Want my prescription drugs freer cheap\nBut if you can afford it\nPerhaps you shouldn't be taking advantage of it and some note I'm I think once again this puts off because people who are are older are\nI'm not going\nArgue to give this up and by the way they vote but I but I think at the end of the day we have\nTo reform the health care system instead of just providing these benefits\nIf we reformed the system and made the drugs cheaper and made the care more affordable and figured out the whole problem we're having with insurance because by the way insurance does not equal healthcare it is insurance just having insurance doesn't mean you're going to get health care\nUm but if we fix our health care system\nPerhaps we wouldn't have to spend so much on Medicare and\nI really do think we should look at this benefit as a benefit for only for people who need it not for everybody I think there should be an income requirement\nUm it just doesn't make sense to me but and here's\nThe reason I can say all of that as someone who does call herself a fiscal conservative I I really do feel like younger people and I'm going to lump myself in with the younger folks for the moment don't have any real belief that these programs are going to be there for us\nAnd so therefore I'm much more willing to say yeah let's start figuring out how to make these programs more sustainable last longer and help fewer people only those who genuinely need it than to just be programs out there because they've always been out there because they haven't always been out there and be they're broken\nSo let's talk about that now all you people who are saying I'm not a moderate let's hear now bringing on people it has the date of actually got a lot more to cover including a potential change in\nAh the rules about who is what gender thank you Trump Administration that's all coming up in our two while they're at that\nFor Nina ... coming up on TALK radio six forty WG us\nTalk radio six forty WG ... three Atlanta\nOf having all of those illegal immigrants coming here\nI think that through and get through but cutting off aid altogether now that's not to say the age shouldn't be better spent or spent differently or that it shouldn't be a blank check to those regimes\nA veteran place that or you know people are trying to escape if that's the case and again I don't know the politics of all three of those countries without doing some a lot more homework but\nJust cutting off aid is not going to solve the problem\nThis is a\nDangerous I think in many ways and I actually think it's going to um make the as I said make the situation a lot worse you know I've\nBeen on this whole thing today because of this book capitalism in America we talked about it a little bit an hour wind and we had one of the authors of the book on the show with us and I spent a the the better part of the weekend listening to the book on audible as I was driving back and forth is savannah over the weekend\nAnd there's a lot of fascinating stuff I'm In the butt but one of the things that it mentions is the fact that the federal government\nIs far bigger now than it was ever intended to be and has control over far more of our lives than it ever was intended to have 'em they're not even joking about it or in some parts of the book and they talk about the president's you know back in the in the Eighteen hundreds having very little to do\nAnd that they there really wasn't much for them to do and if they got a wild hair as it were to do something there wasn't anyone to do it but they literally had to like open their own door when someone came to the door they had to answer their own phone when someone's became a thing um because they didn't have enough to do and now\nIts way out of control and the other direction so much so that in fact ah the Trump Administration is now I'm Talking about changing the definition of gender\nAnd insisting or changing back I don't know changing the definition of gender and forcing us back to a time where your gender is defined by your body parts at birth\nAnd that's it no matter even if you've gone through a full procedure to change your gender doesn't matter\nIt's what you were born with this is something being considered a by the department of health and Human Services right now in the United states of America um interesting that that's bubbling up two weeks before the midterms also will get into the details of it and\nWhy it's happening right after this [noise]\nMore Green Beret ... coming up on TALK radio six forty WG a street [noise]\n[noise] ... twenty Eighteen presented by capital what

them that's how that works\nOr let's say that before the break I was talking about a potential change to the definition of gender if you think about it or if you study this or if you focused on it at all over the last however many years during the Obama administration\nUh there were some rules that were loosened overtime some definitions that were loosened over time by a series of different decisions that were made under the Obama administration that sort of change the legal concept of gender so people who decided to change their gender\nOr surgically or who decided to change their gender identity and wanted to be referred to as a different gender than what\nThey were [noise] um we're allowed to do so\nAnd this would uh allow certain\nProtections certain civil rights type protections to be extended to them that's the kind of thing that was changing under the Obama administration so title nine things like that some of the protections that were meant to be originally just for women extended do oh genders\nAnd does that change gender as well [noise]\nWell now the department of health and Human Services is looking to change or Mm reestablish I guess are more clearly establish a legal definition of sex saying that it is based solely on your genitals at birth and that it is a an changeable\nWhat they're saying is this is a a quote from a memo that came out of the department of health and Human Services sex means a person's status as a male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth\nThey say are the sex will sit on a person's birth certificate as originally issued shell constitute definitive proof of a person's sex unless responded by reliable genetic evidence\nSo they're doing that I'm\nSo for what reason let's let's be clear about something\nThere is approximately one point four million Americans who have opted to recognize themselves either with surgery or not as a gender other than the one they were born into\nThat is a very small number compared to the total number of citizen citizens in the country what do we have over three hundred million writes about three hundred and thirty something million I think\nA ... three hundred thirty something million people at one point four million or transgender in some way so\nIt's easy\nIn the minds of the current administration to pick on that group of people because they don't really represent a big ... enough voting block to change anything\nBut anybody else who sees these changes as the um you know the truth of what they are which is to take away the civil rights protections from this one point four million a group of one point for a million people you don't have to be someone who\nThe questions I have about all of that\nStill is that not enough people do in the terms this is an ongoing problem we've had in this country so I have to be honest again I keep referring back to the spot capitalism in America because I spent all weekend reading at but there was a time when we had Seventy and eighty percent voter participation in this country and it just made a face it's the truth a\nWhile yeah um it was a long time ago but it was the thing we cared at one time we don't care anymore\nYou know like the first election well [noise] I mean we're talking to the Eighteen hundreds or maybe even in the early Nineteen hundreds I Can't I'm not sure exactly when it stopped lots of people that for you but ah it's reality and now we have less around thirty percent voter turnout\nSo uh\nAnd and less even in the mid term spy we'd you know one thing and that is that you are much more likely to do if you're mad about something then if you are excited about the possibility of something so those negative ads are working and\nDidn't bring in an expert who knows a lot more about that than us that it's coming up next professor David tried ALS joining us from Emory University and they did a whole study on it so we'll be right back with
