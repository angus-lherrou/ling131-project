I don't want to you know go through the whole your whole life story but can you know at least talk about sort of that bridge how you kind of went from politics into this world is helping technology

cramps\nUm [laughter]\nOkay listen the reason I asked that is because\nAs part of that you know breath of political experience you sort of summed up in the bucket and this I thought was fascinating sort of five for types of politicians that are out there and what was scary under a sad to me is that you sort of talked about the fact that only five percent sort of fall into this category of politicians who\nBradley I Love it thank you so much what an amazing but it's a fix her again you can get it anywhere books are sold the fix or my adventures saving started from death by politics the

team with the higher\nTech Tuesday and if you're just joining us um you missed a great interview we just spoke with Bradley task the author of a new book called the fix her my adventures savings start from death by politics and certainly almost on a start ups are not tech start start up\nThat is disrupting an industry like Hoover like draft Kings' and FanDuel I'm\nLike air being be I mean they are usually at least the technology platform and they are in all of those cases for example you know disrupting these age old industries that have tons of dollars that they spend to lobby\nAnd that's what he's doing and that's when he's helping to deal in his career is to help these companies navigate and sort of fight back against that and get the um you know the politicians to band\nUm based on the will of the people who want technologies like Cooper and interestingly enough when I first started reading the book I thought oh I'm not going to like this guy because I've been pretty anti Hoover a for a while now but truth be told he was involved with Hoover sort of before that when they were sort of on their way up\nAnd talked to a little bit about that in the book as well\nBut it's something to think about you know you're thinking of this great idea and your your technology is going to disrupt an industry and you do have to think about who's a player is that you're disrupting and what kind of resources they have\nUm health care you know I'm ... you know maybe you have some new way of doing health insurance that would be amazing or keeping health records that would be amazing but there's powers that be in every scenario that don't actually want that change to happen\nUm and those are the people that are getting elected because they're the the lobbying dollars and the campaign donation dollars are coming from those industries\nI think that those politicians elected and then\nYou know reelected so pretty fascinating stuff um while we're talking about the way things change over time I got to talk about Google their topping the tech headlines today for a number of reasons um first of all I just have to say it this way\nBut by Google Plus long time come in and finally dead Google Plus is over and the reason part of the reason is\nNot great uh do apparently had a breach they exposed\nThe user data of Google Plus users about fifty thousand I think Google Plus users which in the grand scheme of things compared to the millions upon millions of users that were exposed by say Facebook I'm In Cambridge Analytica scandal\nFifty thousand is like nothing but here's what happened Google didn't tell anybody because\nThey were afraid of the repercussions of the schools of disclosing that information\nThe wall Street Journal published an article that really showed that they had an internal memo with three lines in it that really made it clear the first one suggesting that if they admitted that problem it would have ... Google into the spotlight this a quote into the spotlight along side or even instead of Facebook\nA despite having stayed under the radar throughout the Cambridge Analytica scandal so that was in the memo along with the quote it almost guarantees that ... the CEOs and DARPA try a would have to testify before Congress something they did not want\nAnd they also were concerned that the breach would quote spark immediate regulatory interest so\nYeah that's not the none of that is called um authentic or in the best interest of the consumer ah or any of that transparent nope none of that\nI'm now Google defend their decision saying that they had a couple of tests that they run every time they think there might be some kind of breach um to see if any of these you know issues have happened um for example there\nWas there any misuse of the data can they find that anyone actually got into that security breach and missed use the data and in some way and again there are you know a couple of different\nSort of tests that they run you know mental test really to see if\nThey should disclose and they say that in this case this breach of this law this exposure of fifty thousand accounts\nWasn't misused in any way that you know there was no reason to disclose that that is sort of their defense\nUm I'll leave that up to you to decide I'll post a link to the article you can read it and see if you think they really should have disclosed but what has happened in response to this incident is that uh just yesterday the parent company alphabet announced a whole bunch of new data privacy measures\nThat include permanently shutting down Google Plus\n... by ears are always bug me about Google Plus first of all when it came out I was sort of like do I really need another place\nThat does the exact same thing I'm as base but do I need another place to set up a profile and post pictures and\nWe only enough everybody seemed fine with that with Instagram like another place sure um but for whatever reason when Google that and I was sort of like not interested you know um and the other\nThing I feel like I really didn't like about it is and you can correct me if I'm wrong neck but it feels like you were sort of forced to be in it whether you want it to or not\nYeah it did kind of come that way 'cause I I had I had to have\nOr don't have any more 'cause it's gone now plus if I remember looking at it and going this is basically like Facebook lite quite as in the upside of course nobody I knew was on it right\nRight and every once in a while I'd see people like trying to say something on it or invite me that I Would just ignore it was like maybe if I just ignore it like the doorbell rang if it does to an hour and they'll go away sort of thing but I feel like I don't remember like a saying yes I Want to profile on death and it just sort of existed\nAnd then there were things on it now I Do remember doing that and if I did I was sort of tricked into it forced into it and they kept trying to push you there and you know tie it to other things and\nNow thanks um\nI think that you know they could have potentially been a competitor in that space if they had done it differently but I don't think the way they did it was right I'm In any case I Will not miss that functionality at all so by\n... you know because it was an annoyance melt spam folders\nSo all we are talking about Google I Want to also mentioned so that sort of the bad but there's also an interesting story are coming out of Google\nUh right now is Well Google has dropped out of contention for eight ten billion dollar defense contract a government contract because they say it could conflict with their corporate values so this I think also is a signal\nFire of the times they weren't competing with a lot of the other big tech companies including Amazon who I think everyone thinks now will win\nThat deal um Amazon is the front runner now that Google has dropped out but this is coming after several employees a couple of months back signed a petition or an even quit the company over Google's involvement with the military projects the employees there and I'm just throw this out\nThere 'cause I don't know for sure who are again probably millennials have said you know what no like I don't want to work for a company that does this kind of stuff I remember one of the memos we we talked about on the show was they were concerned about this new Google for China\nI don't know if you remember that but they you know Google is talking about developing a new limited search that the Chinese government essentially could control because they don't have an open Internet there and and we said we don't want to be a part of that no we don't support that and\n... so the employee there are starting to have enough of a say I'm the Google literally walked away from a potential ten billion dollar\nDefense contract yeah it is the contract a is a cloud services contract called the joint enterprise a defense infrastructure [noise] jet I that's the initials [laughter] uh and it's going to go to the clouds uh it's it's called services for the department of defense\nSo um you know\nThey have to say they may be part of the reason they dropped out of they don't hold all the necessary certifications I when I called\nThe U.S on that 'cause I think they could get them if they yeah if they needed them um in any case\nHere's a quote from them we well we are working to support the u._s. government with our cloud in many areas we are not being on the ... contract because we couldn't be a shirt it would align with R. A. I. principles\nAI artificial intelligence principles fascinating ah we will dig more into that in our two of the show we got a lot of cool stuff coming up for you so you don't go anywhere we'll be right back\n[noise]\n\n... ... ... [noise]\nRadio I'm Robert US ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley is on her way out the door President Trump accepted Haley's resignation up a White House this morning she told\nAnd maybe setting myself up to run for twenty twenty four I'm\nJust saying that's a possibility um\nYou know either way whether Trump once again or not she could be setting ourselves up for twenty twenty four\nI'm there's been other speculation and I don't really understand this one that a Trump my put her in as his running mate as VP in twenty twenty but Mike Pence isn't going to be very happy if he does that um\nThen you know of course there's further speculation that perhaps uh she might want the secretary\nThe state job at some point so I don't know how Mike Pompeo feels about that maybe there's some and riding on the wall that we don't know about on that front apparently a lot of people were shocked by this resignation including my ... and John Bolton national security advisor so\nOr something I suspect\nThat there's more going on here than meets\nThe guy um you know\nPresident Trump himself has told us on many occasions not to believe what we see and or here so I'm going to take him at his word on this one and just say I don't think there's more I think there's something you're not\nTelling us I think there's something else going on here um and we shall see what it is I also do wonder uh because everybody seemed to be shocked by this news networks there were seemed to be no signaling ahead of time by any insiders if this was something that was going to happen um the timing is interesting\nIt also seems like though apparently she mentioned it to somebody within\nThe last week or so um but didn't wanna I guess get in a way of this whole Kavanaugh confirmation thing which is so interesting because you would think also\nHow how is that how and why are decisions like that made right did she not want to get in the way of that because she didn't want to be in the way of that or did she not want to get do it during that time because she wanted to get her own headline so she waited 'til the day after the she could make the front page news\nBecause in the midst of the whole Brett Kavanaugh thinks you probably wouldn't have been an interesting story there speaking a front page news um Rod Rosenstein is keeping his job just in case you're wondering that that was a fizzled out story that maybe we'll\nHear again after the mid term but he always good in that world apparently there is more to talk about ah\nIn the Kavanaugh files if you will get to those next

right but it does feel like\nThat um because it just like the story that keeps on giving\nYou know it just never ends I'm Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court by a fifty to forty eight vote in the Senate on Saturday that was followed by a swearing in in\nPrivate there was some pictures but it wasn't a televised ceremony well that was not good enough for the president so he decided to have a second swearing in\nAlso known as a political rally that was last night and um he has made it now his mission\nTo I'm just defend due to a knock it off the subject of the uh sexual misconduct in a sexual assault charges against Brett Kavanaugh but not only to knock it off the subject but to\nYou know I'm just credit and dishonor Dr Christine Blasey Ford who many in this country or see as a um as a hero\nFor coming forward and so again whether you believe her not I think the time to talk about her is over and if you're going to say anything about her I think it needs to be um with understanding and with sympathy a\nEmpathy sympathy with some kind of like listen to this woman put her life on the line because she thought she was doing the right thing you may not agree with her you may believe that the Democrats um you know took advantage of the situation to add politics into the mix but\nYou know at the end of the day um she can't go home yet\nBecause she's receiving death threats and people know where she lives and then you have President Trump yesterday afternoon leading up to this event that he had scheduled with Brett Kavanaugh doing one of his famous on the line with the helicopter in the background a press junk gets and uh\nAnd here's what he had to say\nWhat they really torture him and his family I\nDoubt if they get about it a friend of yours yours a

two weeks\nAgo nice huh so definitely getting out there and as a practicing what I preach [laughter]\nNice so that's not a hard thing to practice in your case I don't know what I Would have to do if I was practicing when I preach that'd be a whole other show but let's talk about technology and travel 'cause I'm One of the people that struggles I end up with bringing all of my stuff\nAnd then I get to the hotel for example and I don't have the church or with me or you know why did I Need the I've had it could have done everything on my phone urge that really the my laptop on this trip so what's the best way to sort of bring the right stuff with you left let's talk about you know on this whole you know the travel during the holiday season\nYeah I think um you have it right\nWhen you say that we can over Oregon ourselves with ... your smartphone is really one of the best tool because it is such a great multitaskers so whether it's emails or Internet researching playing games watching videos you can do all that on your phone so odd to me the number one gadget that you want to take on every trip with you\nOn the line or a tablet his life if you want to watch videos and a larger format\nOr if you have kids to traveling with you and you want your kids to be able to either read or evil or play a game\nTo keep them occupied so it just depends on what your needs are of course if you're on a work trip or you're on a trip or you're going to need to work you may need to bring your laptop for 'em so it just depends on what kind of trolley or doing\nBut definitely think about like technology you absolutely need to take what you say you don't end up with you know six devices with you on vacation\nWell they have to make decisions and I'm sure for somebody who's traveled as much as you do you're in this position although you probably have the right stuff with you but I find that I'll be on a plane and I'll think oh well I just want to I don't really want to work I just want to watch a movie or something\nAnd so you can watch it on the back of the you know on which provided by the airline but you have to have the right kind of headphones with you on my Bluetooth headphones so I always forget to bring headphones that'll plug into the back of an airplane seat\nYeah that's true and these days most airlines will give you headphones or at least let you purchase them for pretty cheap but they're the quality is not nearly as good as your noise canceling headphones so\nFor that reason my actual the first thing that I talk whatever I fly whether it's our flight or a ten hour flight on or my noise canceling headphones but they do have a plug option so you can find blue cheese has found is\nThat how the option that you can actually remove if you're not using it and just keeping your carry in case so that's a great idea or exactly to solve the problem that you're talking about yeah um\nYeah that's an easy call but yeah I totally get you on that but if you think about the way technology has advanced it is really transform the way we travel whether it's you know downloading movies on your phone or your tablet\nOr GPS maps so that you know where you're going no matter what city or country or in you know he was downloading mobile boarding passes so we don't have to use paper boarding passes than its share paying for a check baggage at the airport in advance so all those things are saving us time they're saving as", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Barrett Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "09"}
