Trump's mhm they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that\nIs it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out\nAnd said holder comments were

I'm calling it ... it was very cutesy like\nHe was like she's a special person you know I really you know I don't think he said I Love her because I would've been weird but you know it was very loving Debbie she calls herself a lucky girl which I thought was really odd um she's been a governor she was the United states ambassador to the un and she called herself lucky girl\nA lucky woman maybe but what can you imagine any male politician or as part of his resignation saying I was lucky boy no\nHappen in a million years\nI'm lucky man perhaps\nBut not lucky boy and for her to say lucky girl\nAnd it's just odd and it does or to do is listen I'm not I am not picking and I admit that and I don't think she meant anything by it I was a turn of phrase you know whatever but it's just to me another classic indicator of the gender bias that as sort of unconscious that you know as women we still call ourselves girls\nUm you know in that kind of contact you know you do I think men still call each other boys in some contacts but like\nMore like when we're hey we're going out for drinks let's get the boys and go out right now I Will come to the boys yeah not in a professional press conference in I mean can you imagine Madeleine Albright calling herself lucky girl\nNo thank you for the job I'm such a lucky boy right can you imagine people's lives when Rex Tillerson stepped down saying you know it was a privilege to be here I was lucky boy no right like that does not happen so it was just odd I thought anyway ah we\nWill see the president has said he will\nNot name her a successor within the next two to three weeks that person will have to be confirmed so that could be an interesting process as well we have a we live a confirmation in this country they love the confirmation we really do [noise]\nSo um anyway she's not leaving yet she made up perfectly clear she will be leaving a again at the end of the year\nBut I started to say this and I'll just ask it now um I Do wonder you know it it why you take a job that you don't intend to stay in for the length of the job like that you know\nPart of her discussion was she was governor for six years and now you know she's done this for two years and so she's tired\nWell like I Need a break I Need a vacation was like you don't\nTake a job to take a vacation and I get your touch back to work like who does that who takes the job that they know has a set length at least four years would be the you know the thought process and listen I understand a lot of people resign from a administration jobs in all administrations this is not only a Trump thing I mean this is just a normal part of politics\nBut usually it's for some political reason or other you have not served the president and the way that he wants\nUm or you have some disagreement with the way the president is doing things or you have some other opportunity that you're looking towards or whatever the case may be so I don't know if it really is just a pure resignation which is what they tried to make it sound like I Do wonder\nThough the president did sort of say come back anytime pick any job you want\nEven said uh in the uh\nIn the love fest that was the resignation a press conference in any case um another one bites the dust so to speak and and now it's one of those women are in the administration perhaps Ivanka will take the role it's being

the fact that Hooters restaurant is starting to close\nSome of its outlets are because there's such as well as they once did and there was this whole analysis that went on a in the article about sort of not that the problem wasn't so much that restaurants are out um but more that the food isn't good and uh\nYou know if they don't really stack up next cracking up laughing because I said restaurants on the air but that's what they are there are a couple of other brands of restaurant that are still doing okay I'm a tilted killed I think is one of them and what's the other one Twin Peaks\nBut even

high times Adam how are you\nYourself in a I Am very excited to have you on the phone because now I can get out all of my ridiculous references to like wacky weed and all my outdated stuff 'cause I'm old and we have\nSo many of them we could go on forever I\nLike it maybe we should just make the regular segment where we just go through all of the ah ... down to it yeah let's do it on you know people who don't know much about high times the company can you give me kind of a brief overview\nYeah we're event producer or a magazine where a multimedia company and or licensing brand I mean you know where the playboy of cannabis and you know as everyone knows high times when you think about the different a vertical as we could be in today in today's dope world\nUm it's the it's it's limitless you know there's like field and stream stores have been in a clip the Atlanta area and that was a magazine so\nI'm sure everyone can imagine different types of products that we could come up with under the heights and friends as well\nYes I think a magic nations are running wild as we speak a lot I think a lot of people to your point no about the magazine ... but not everybody I think ... all the other things that you already have going on with events and\nUh and some of the brand licensing and all that which is why I wanted you to to talk about it a little bit and I do think I mean getting away from the subject matter of the magazine for just a second and from everything you do I think that what you guys are doing is something really all print publications need to be thinking about ... just like all everybody needs to start thinking outside the box because\nYou know obviously print is not it's multi media nowadays it is a van citizen in person things in his brand licensing and so on is that something is a company\nThat you guys sort of always knew you needed to do or or was that was that sort of a last minute like oh we got to get ahead of this\nUm I think I think it was both I think you know listen we came in I came in with the new investment group about last sometime last year in March last year and we've definitely put some pedals with a metal\nAnd started throw some chairs on the fire and say hey let's look outside do things a little differently but they were fairly ahead of the times and saw\nYou know they weren't one of the first five thousand domains ever registered so high times dot com has like older than Yahoo\nThat's awesome and I you know like when you look at who who would've ever thought of that they were smoking the right stuff\nThey were smoking what they were rolling as they are smoking\nWhat they're printing are rolling ...\nThings up and speaking of a business growth and all of that I Know one of the things I'm you guys just did recently was purchased dope magazines so there you also growth by acquisition\nYes we've done this was or a fourth acquisition we've done in the last year and uh we definitely believe in growing organically but we've been adding other brands to our family and friends and you know\nYou have a single business term you use also has like a dope reference and you're growing that long [laughter] I Love it\nUm so how different is do magazine from high times content wise\nSo it's it's got its own set of users and consumers and the little differentiated in that it's it's definitely a reach its you know half of the magazines regional so there's ten different locations that the that they distribute the magazine and currently and again they're offering\nEvents as well in smaller events than high times you know you come to a high sense of and then we'll know Fifteen to fifty thousand people at a rope a dope events or you know three to four thousand smaller market\nAnd so the two companies wind themselves very well and you know we're doing an interview yesterday myself from the c._e._o. dope and the you\nKnow for a while I thought he was a dope wars and you know\nListen we went head to head on a few things to have a conversation so it's great to have um it was part of the family and really a great part of the teams or cited and the you know that's boring stuff but\nIt's great I get it on I own a company called dope now and uh it's really\nKnow creative to her to what we're doing as well\nIf you decide um that you no longer want to be the CEO of high times could you call me because I Would really like to take over if you decide\nYou're serious or is it was like now you know\nI mean I'm just saying because I Would like to also be able to talk about owning do magazine and met my co CEOs I Do but I mean it's you just have aside from everything else it just seems like you have a really fine job I'm just saying if you\nSat alone up aside I Love or you know I can assist in the hour or something he's let me now I Love it um works on the\nList and one of the other things that's fascinating about what you guys are doing is going public and looking for investors so talked me about all of that\nSo this is bonkers yesterday alone we had more than six hundred investors register it high times investor dot com we've done a partnership with I heart where the\nRadio as I'm getting texts from friends all over the country saying I've just heard the high plains radio commercials yeah\nAnd the disclaimer which was like forty five seconds long in Spain and so right [laughter] because we're stopping people from just stopping themselves and that's just the ... the country we live in today yeah I'm as a whole and uh\nBut uh you know it's great I mean listen and you can go to high times investor dot com\nWe've kinda democratize the ideal process with the JOBS Act yeah and uh you know one of the benefits of of the jobs that was it gave us the ability to bring IPO's to the general consumer yeah and just solicit off the Internet and\nYou know what we're hearing is this is the largest JOBS Act I feel of its time wow I'm you know we're just halfway through it and we're just the you know we're more than nine thousand shareholders\nRegistered and invested today um and uh\nIt's a large number of crazy number no one ever thought in the largest we can find or trying to prove ourselves wrong at this point is like sixty two hundred so we've blown by that number um we've grown by you know more than that and the it's it's\nYou know it's starting to get really really big and you know like people are writing ... we had an investor literally your radio at\n'em and uh invest a five hundred thousand dollars two days ago wow and uh you know people are seeing what's going on in ... in the can of his world and realizing that the brand there is no brand like us and uh they're investing\nAnd let me ask you what I mean Adam I'm before we run out of time there you know people this whole idea of sort of crowd sourcing crowd funding for actual investment\nEquity investment now is the thing people can do it um as you said I mean this is a big one that you guys are doing and uh unusual because\nIf your industry but there aren't any restrictions on where investors can come from even do cannabis and various forms of marijuana or not legal for example in Georgia I could still invest right\nAbsolutely so we can get in on it before but do you think it's really going to build ... and it will take our green I appreciate that I'll be happy to hand it over um do you think it's kind of really end up legal everywhere marijuana\nAbsolutely I mean no one thought some of the states that are currently going you know green would have turned out to be Canada states like North Dakota and you know Texas now has CBD I mean things are are definitely you know\nIt's a it's not going to be you know people who you would have never thought\nUm were were supporters are supporters and you know we have the ... the former president of Mexico on a board of directors wow like that\nIt'll if I chose the wrong word and I apologize I'm I Believe in less regulation but not no regulation I Believe in uh the second amendment but also gun control a I Am pro choice\nI Am pro women I Am pro diversity I Am pro algae beat CQ these are the things I Believe in so I I feel like I've tried to be as clear as I can about that so\nIf you are judging me as a quote not a moderate because I Can't get behind BRIC cabinet or because I'm choosing to believe the woman ah Christine Blasey Ford in this scenario\nThan uh oh I can do is try to tell you where I come down and why [noise] I Will\nAnd second William let me just say I'm that I'm going to do what you're asking out and say okay what if he's innocent\n\nIf he's innocent and these charges you know I I first of all I Do believe that Christine Blasey Ford was credible\nThe the idea that she somehow got the person wrong is hard for me to believe especially because she claims that she's a hundred percent sure and she seemed quite credible but okay I Will make the assumption for the sake of this discussion that he is innocent\nUm the fact that there are multiple people that are suggesting that he or did not represent himself\nAccurately and his Fox interview or\nTo the Senate Judiciary committee when talking about those years in which these accusations are relevant a is concerning to me and while I understand the him being frustrated and of course are very upset and angry if these allegations were all falls it's still\nMandatory that someone who's going to sit on the Supreme Court carry themselves in a measured dignified way and handles that anger\nI'm In a way that isn't insulting to the senators asking questions that is understanding of the woman who had some obviously traumatic experience he did not do any of those things he did not answer a lot of the questions directly\nUm and so yes I Do understand the ... someone's anger being falsely accused but that doesn't mean you can't you you get an a pass to not answer questions and it also doesn't mean you get the job\nAnd I'm just going to continue to go back to the fact that this is not a criminal trial and that this is a job interview for one of the most important jobs in the country um and\nI and I think it's also been pretty clear about the fact that from my perspective I did not want him in the job to begin with\nBecause for me his views on\nPro choice and algae the queue and guns and whether or not a president\nYou know should have to face a special counsel and or potentially a be indicted or be able to pardon himself I don't agree with the judges views on those things so yes I openly admit that I come into this conversation with bias\nThat his anti Brett Kavanaugh but that doesn't mean I Can't look at what's happening I'm ... and give perspective\nOn it that's just my perspective um and\nI understand if it's not yours but we have to be able to have a conversation with each other without yelling left and right without yelling ah I don't know what let's just have the conversation the idea that you know Lindsey Graham is so angry uh\nChuck Grassley is so angry and ... and you know all of them has the most right to be angry\nI give him that um\nAnd the idea that this is the whole thing has concocted by the left\nIs far fetched now is the left politicizing a hundred percent and so is the right\nThey are I mean the the less absolutely is politicizing this ... ... is the left to be blamed in some way for the timing of all of this\nProbably I'll give you that um but even if\nThis was and I but I Will say logically speaking and if you listen to what Christine Blasey Ford said\nShe said I'm not upon of anybody nobody's\nEncouraged me to do this pay me to do this anything else I wrote a letter\nOf my own choice and yes my name was added without my permission but she didn't believe that it was a Dianne Feinstein is office that did it\nAnd what's her name was added it was again her choice to come forward so I\nA hard time believing this whole thing was you know tinfoil hat on concocted by the left did they take advantage of it off a hundred percent\nOr did the right yes they all politicize this yes they did and they still are um so\nThat's my take on all of that and I hope you feel like I at least ... voiced by reading your comments on the show um because I don't want people to feel like they don't have a voice your are free to comment on our social media uh

chief meteorologist ...\nTop forty the\nI Want to go to this idea of anger and who's angry and why they're angry and what this all means so let's think about this okay the\nAngry mob that Trump is referring to\nAnd that McConnell was referring to an Grassley is referring to is predominantly made up of women\nNot just women but in particular women who have been a victims of sexual assault or sexual harassment in particular and those that support them in fairness but women on the whole that's who was protesting\nWas marching that's who was in the halls of the Senate yelling at a you know the senators and their doors knocking on their doors in what most would call a protest\nBut\nNow Trump McConnell and Grassley want you to think those women aren't angry mob now I Want to remind you that just a year ago\nI'm an actual angry mob of white supremacists marched in Charlottesville so angry were they in fact at least one of them had he gotten his car and ran his car through the people\nTo kill them\nBut President Trump didn't see an angry mob there no no he's a good people on both sides\nFast forward to last week and you have women victims protesting and they're angry mob\nTo me Susan Collins um made this worse\nAnd she showed no\nGoing to start famous now I think this is my ... along with all of the other divides in this country I think she showed the age divide\nA in a large way Susan Collins was\nPotentially one of the flip votes and I'm One of the few female Republicans one of two who have a claim to be pro women and pro choice and one of the things that's interesting about her she also comes from a fairly democratic state\nAnd so a little earlier in the show is saying that Heidi Heitkamp who is in a red state and as a Democrat is probably going to pay a for her comments at the polls\nBut I think Susan Collins is also going to pay when it's her turn she's not up for reelection this year but when it is her turn and twenty twenty uh especially because it's also a presidential year and that means more people will be voting I think she's going to lose her seat\nUm because it is a very democratic state and I think she set\nA the women in her state uh on notice she put them on notice and they're paying attention I think she may have gotten elected because she was a more moderate I mean she was somebody who was socially liberal\nUh and and fiscally conservative and they were OK with that but now she has shown that she's not willing to stand up for that um that social liberalism when push comes to shove so\nYou know ultimately the reason I have a problem with her is because she chose to allow a man's anger to win over a woman's word uh she was asked by Dana Bash is\nMaking the rounds this weekend of all of the shows and she was asked by CNN Dana Bash if she believed or Brett Kavanaugh over Christine Blasey Ford or ... and here's what she said\nWell I Would certainly and decided and ... and after hearing\nChristine for this very compelling and painful testimony\nI thought oh my goodness a key perhaps this needs to withdraw but then when he came back with such a forceful denial and the anger and and English\nThat he showed\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her satellite wow so\nYou know she also talked about and in fairness we just pulled too little soundbites there she also talked about there being no ...\nBut the reality is there is no look I understand that in this country in a court of law you have a right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty\nBut she also said on the Senate floor this was not a court of law and that the standards that she was looking at was more likely than not versus innocent before ... until proven guilty\nMore likely than not so she listened to to people's stories\nAfter hearing the first story she thought wow maybe he should withdraw 'cause it seems more likely than not that she could be telling the truth\nThat she was\nYou know witness to his anger and his forceful a denial and won over by the anger of a man\nI guarantee you that if Christine Blasey Ford had been angry she would have been labeled a batch and that would have been that\nAnd if if they're ... if their personality traits\nHad been reversed and he had come on and been measured in an answer to her\nPitching is it would have been everybody would have been like oh yeah well look how common is measured he is for sure he's he's got the the demeanor be adjusted and he there's no way he did this because look he's handling this like a grown up but instead you had the woman\nWho was who handle herself like a grown up and the man who scream and holler and railed like a child\nAnd Susan Collins bonnet and so that everybody else\nEverybody else was just like yeah look look out for your son's look out for your husband's look out for your men are in trouble now um\n\nIt's mind blowing to me um this is that this is where we are\nIt's mind blowing and it's not a it's really sad to me and really disheartening I mean women have been shamed for being angry forever I just had a conversation here's a little insight into my life I've just had a conversation with my therapist take that and\nWhatever you want with it and I said you know as a woman who's been you know an entrepreneur\nAnd uh you know a manager a and a director and a VP and whenever I've always been labeled a batch and I've always been concerned about that\nAnd I've always tried to do things to soften my message so that didn't come across", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Barrett Show", "city": "Atlanta",
