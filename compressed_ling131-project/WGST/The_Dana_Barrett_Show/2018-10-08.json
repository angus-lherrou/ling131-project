Michelle [laughter]\nDo you like that had the ex gay room I'm going to put that on my business card least yeah yeah um I I enjoy giving out titles at random to me [laughter] so look\nBefore we get into ah\nThe fact that it happens to be national cyber security awareness month right um catch me out what's going on in your world yeah it's\nBeen it's been a really really a staff month and then um we've had some changes going on there's been some uh there's been new legislation that was actually a the the bill was passed in May of two thousand Eighteen but it went into effect I'm formally on September twenty first\nAnd there's ... there's a number of\nProvisions within this bill and I'm just going to cheat and look at my notes that is called the economic credit regulatory relief and consumer protection act otherwise known as Twenty one fifty five year Ryan Seventy five so there's a number of provisions in in the I'm In the law\nI'm a number of which I have to deal with banks and credit unions and things like that but there are also some consumer protection provisions in there um and and the two really that um we were really looking at now along with the other TV or as has to do with security phrases and frog alerts\nSo security freezes used to be state regulated by all three bureaus and you had to uh if you wanted to place the security freeze on your credit report you had to go to all three bureaus and depending on the state in which he lived\nThere was a fee and it could range anywhere used to range from anywhere from two dollars to ten dollars and that was applied anywhere from if you were placing it if you were temporarily lifting yeah if you were completely removing it anytime you touched it you pay anytime you touched it depending on the state you're in you might have to pay a fee\nI'm On September twenty first two thousand Eighteen that all changed and security forces are now free\nUm you still have to go to all three credit bureaus and there's a reason for that\nBy it is free and that is I think a lot of consumers are relieved about that um I think there's a recognition that let's make it let's make it easier let's make it a more cost efficient things like that\nAnd the other thing that happened was around fraud alerts so fraught alert security phrase is there a little bit different and I'll get into that in a second yeah I definitely want to break that down but fraud alerts I'm used to be a\nInitial an initial fraud alert was Ninety Days it is now one year so that's a ... it's a longer period of time [noise] um it's a good protection it's a good thing for consumers\nAnd really all three beer as had to simplify the way this could be done for consumers so if you go into Equifax dot com\nUm and if you go to Experian or trans union I Know that they all all three of us were required to dedicate a new portion of our website specifically for this effort so so that way to attack on September twenty first so I work in the\nPast that I Know I've been busy I Know so we've been busy\nDoing other restrictions on ... ... talk radio six forty WG a fee\nTo get a rebel back to ... year old W street\nThere are some people that I have the whole I Can't believe I'm the bar the door and I just can't let them leave and that is whether this happening I think that might be what Haiti bar the door oh yeah that's I don't know what that from though but yeah it is for something\n[laughter] although now has maybe different connotation but let's not go down that road Nancy ... with us she is a vice president of consumer education at Equifax and the reason I wanted\nYou to stay on and continue this conversation is because you know we're talking about\nYou know protecting your credit protecting yourself from potentially a identity theft which can lead to a lot of huge problems and I asked you and and in fairness I didn't warn you at a time that I was going to ask but I asked you if more people um are actually putting freezes on their credit and our locking down their credit\nWith one of the tools that are actually even now free and at least so far\nIt doesn't look that way right um and so you know my thinking is that most of us are just complacent and I think you know we were talking about this from an election standpoint right like you go to vote when you're angry or upset me feel good you don't do it\nRight at the same thing with this in my mind you know it's like you get your wild so and then you close your bag and you always close your bag after that and if you've ever been attacked God Forbid\nThat's when you take a self defense class after right um\nAnd so that's when you get life Walker you start when you've been attacked and I think the question is and this is always going to be a challenge for you I'm In consumer education is how do you get people to be riled up enough to do something right to know that this is real this can happen\nRight and I certainly that that's a really great question and it's certainly something that that we try to emphasize that people are a lot of people will talk about checking their credit score and checking their credit score you know checking their credit scores great it's it's a it's a very responsible thing to do to keep up with that too\nUm if it news you know one way or the other\nIt's a it can be an indication of something but in addition to checking the credit score we also encourage consumers to check their credit reports and you can you can do it for free\nOr you can get a copy of your credit report from each of the three credit bureaus\nUm every twelve months for free and so my thing is um an and I've mentioned this before to consumers is um is often starting the year off remembering that right um I've talked to consumers about I'm starting the year off with respect to\nChecking their budget and seeing if they need to redo their budget off some people need to just do a budget\nPeriod they've they've never done are you looking at me [laughter] but also you know just remembering that checking the credit report and a lot of people I think\nMay not know exactly what's on a credit report may not know what to look for 'em and may not just may not know how to read it\nUm so we talked to consumers a lot um when I go do public speaking out I'll show them a picture of a credit report and say these are the five things that are in it this is what you want to look for um but the report is you know can be not only can I help you see if you know if anyone\nUm you know is is committing some sort of identity theft you can look at some of the counts that you have on there and and check and see is there an account on there that shouldn't be on there um you check your personal information makes sure that's all correct you check your Social Security number and make sure that's accurate\nUm so it can be a really good indicator um and it can it can really help keep you on track\nAs well right and you and to your point I think earlier you said you know when people need it that's one day we'll we'll check right or and even then I said first of all I think you're right I think a lot of people don't even realize there's a difference between checking your score and checking your report\nI I I completely agree with you and a lot of people think with the free credit reports that you get from the beer as you're also getting your score you're not okay interesting said that's a really and I've heard people in the industry actually tell\nConsumers get your credit reports got your score and that's that's incorrect so get your credit report from each of the three beer as you can do that free every twelve months\nBut the other thing is you can get your credit score from there's a number of ways now that you can get your credit score either from a financial institution there's free services out there where you can get the score and that can certainly help you know how you're tracking but I think the other thing with credit scores people have to remember that those are snapshots in time riot so your\nYour credit score I've I've heard people talk about you know oh my gosh my credit score\nYou know went down and then you know this happened or I think people have to understand it is really a snapshot in time\nAnd what the lenders and creditors are looking at\nUm when you go to apply for something is actually the information that's in your credit report they want to see how things have turned it over time they want to see how you been able to manage your financial commitments over time so\nAnd you know when I talk to people I tell them I'm like you know look ... you may be going and sitting in front of a bank or for the first time\nAnd they have to make a call to just basically answer the question okay if I win this person money what are the odds are that they're going to pay me back right now are they going to do that so they have to have something to measure by so they do that in part by the score in part by the report\nAnd then also they have their own criteria\nSo you know I think a lot of consumers also have the um misconception that the bureau's are responsible for the lending decisions no we help inform the lending decisions but we're not the soul you know we're not the sole um you know entity that's making the lending decisions\nWhen they think Nancy one of the things that's interesting about you know your credit report and again I think people who have had problems whatever those problems are\nRealize that there's more to it than just the number the score if there's something on there even though it was your fault or maybe not even your fault but like\nYou know you have a credit card with a store and they've reported you for something that wasn't true or you made a simple mistake in our reporting you didn't know it\nRight and then when you're trying to buy a house you're having to write letters to try to explain why this or that is on your credit report correct so knowing I think to even check it and the details on to understand how to read it right is probably way more critical\nRight I I Love your idea of making it part of like an annual process like once a year do you do this on you you know go to the dentist hopefully a couple of times a year right you automatically I don't know why I always go to dental analogies but like\nBecause of these things you don't want to do sure but you do them because they're good for your health adult in the middle of that adult thing\nRight and you know I ... I think it's interesting because we've done um you know informal surveys at Equifax where we've talked to you I'm\nA college students and most of them you know college age students most of them have checked their credit score um I think the numbers look a little bit different when you start talking about the credit report\nUm and so you know it is something that we we see definitely most more people are looking at the at the number versus the information that's in the report\nYeah oh yeah no I totally I totally get that and and this might be a weird question but why is it only free once a year [noise] you know I think that's a business\nDecision from the the ... themselves um so I you know other than that it\nJust says yeah the way it is yeah um but you can do it from annual credit report dot com that that's the way to do it okay yet they don't have to do to each separate beer or you just go to and your credit report are calm and you can pull from all three yes there yet and they might have different things too is that true\nThat is correct so depending on what financial institutions report to which one are that's another you know people see three different numbers and they get confused yeah um but that's perfectly normal and it's simply because\nWhat information may be on my ankle facts credit report might not be information that's on the other two beers credit reports and that's perfectly normal is well it's the the the lender I'm just may simply not report to all three bureaus\nSo a lot of them were just down to like the last minute here but a lot of what we've talked about has been about sort of what to do to keep an eye on things to make sure something hasn't already happened with like a minute left is there anything we can do to sort of prevent or not really um I think you know going\nBack to some of those things that I mentioned earlier about the username and password so that's one thing that you know one of the things that I see constantly um and then I I Try to be very cognizant of is over sharing on social media\nUm when you start to over share 'em and you know you make information kind of readily available and out there\nUm you know I Would say ... to watch out for that\nUm so I think you know just be smart about what you're putting out there on line um it's it's kind of a NATO age old adage that you know just use your common sense but I think I think those are you know two things that you can do on line to or or\nAs we saying that the entire world number one rule don't be stupid [laughter] I really don't have a\nYoung man and under that comes don't over share and All right ... thank you so much for hanging around we really appreciate it again Nancy busters Balkan a VP over Equifax we'll post a link to all of the stuff we talked about on our show on a stage at the end of our dot com and they'll go away we'll be back [noise]\nYou know there are on\nI gotta do something that I Know I'm really not supposed to do from radio or you know the rules of doing good radio and not as you're not supposed to tea is something that's too far ahead like if I'm trying to get you to stay and listen to my show I shouldn't be teasing something that's happening tomorrow\nI'm going to do in any way um because tomorrow on the show we have a guess who's going to be coming on his name is ah because I think it's Bradley task I Want to say but he has a book out called the fixer\nAnd he's a a political consultant who works for start up companies and helps them sort of figure out the political landscape and the reason I bring this up is because there are several points in the book in which he describes\nThe personalities of politicians and he and he knows because he has worked he's a Democrat but he's worked for some of the top Democrats I assume he's still a Democrat I'm not the end of the book yet to be fair I'll finish tonight but\nYou know he's worked for Chuck Schumer he's worked for um I forget the or the governor and Chicago the one that got in trouble I Can't think of his name right now rod something I'm ... he's ... you know he's been in and around that world through a good bit of his career and he also worked for Mayor Bloomberg\nIn New York and so and he talks about the personalities of politicians and\nThe ones that are kind of doing the right thing for the right reason and literally says and I'm not going to this is not a direct quote but that less than five percent of politicians are there just to genuinely tried to get things done using government as the tool\nAnd most of them are there for reasons that you know the way he describes are pretty scary\nIn any case um\nIt's all a master manipulation and if you don't believe that\nWell I got I got something I got some news for you because and so I'm saying all of that just to say that if more people vote\nThen maybe we can get different people at least in office and maybe we can start to pick the ones that are part of that five percent that genuinely want to do the right thing\nUm and we're not going to agree on what the right thing is and that's okay um but I Would rather have people in there who are genuinely concerned with doing what they see us the right thing then with getting themselves reelected because they enjoy being in the spotlight\nUm or feeling powerful and ah\nSo all that to say good for you Taylor Swift for is dipping your toe in the political pool I'm sure she got some hate and some love\nOr for that so I\nI Would encourage more celebrities to do it and I would encourage you if you haven't already to register and then follow that up with a\nV.

enough to cause all of that stuff\nTo happen um\nThat's really soon I just want to say I think\nOne of the problems here is that we keep thinking that yeah well it's not going to affect me or even my kids is going to be maybe my grandkids\nKids no no no it's ten twelve years from now\nSo ah and I think it does seem to me\nLike it's already a lot worse than it was that do not necessarily the number of storms but the impact they're having the love of the amount of flooding that's occurring uh the numbers of deaths that are occurring I mean it just doesn't really seem that way and this is all you know I'm\nIn the midst of you know being part of an administration that is\nKind of pulling the whole thing sort of\nPicking regulations away that might help the environment get better sort of

what that is but it sounds cool\nUm you're on survivor on CBS you're you've done the same time I mean I don't even know where to start with you so of all the things that you um are doing and have done is NASCAR the favorite\nYeah I mean racing is really where the passion lies and I started when I was ten years old I was an activity that my parents wanted me and my siblings to do that we can be together on the weekends and so that they are girls could do something against boys competitively and I fell in love with it it has been the\nYeah the thing that has made me the most proud that I feel like I Want to work the hardest at it so much fun kind of like it's addicting if that's the book and then you can't let it go so that being said um I really view\nI re than like racing career as I have a platform from which I can do other stuff as well and and you know give back and help empower other than\nThe other cool stuff and you know I just feel like life is short there's a lot to do and I'm very lucky that I get to attack will\nYeah um I Love that you're using the platform ah for other things aside from just sort of self promotion and I want to get to that in just a minute but\nI'm given that you did get into the sport so young and you were already doing it and loving in knowing and and you know making history even at you know fourteen years old what made you want to go to Stanford and get the degree that you got\nYeah that's a great question I'm at the couple fold one I went to a pretty competitive math and science high school in New York City from high school and so\nI have no more intense academics or something that I always like and now I like learning and also racing is somewhat unique sport and that is not just\nUh the skill and the talent around the axle competition you know the very financially driven sport and we need sponsors and partners um to\nTo drive the sport if you will\nHand them with that\nAnd knowing kind of what my family's situation was you know how long they were going to be able to fund my race thing and when I was going to stop\nI just was very conscious of the fact that I needed the business savvy as well and so in addition to just wanting to learn and you know be a better more well rounded person in my opinion um I knew that I had a lot to learn from a business side so that was something that I focused on in school what was really cool about\nYet my science technology and society decree was\nThat it allowed me to become technically literate in certain areas that I was interested in but then it was also very interdisciplinary so it'll take\nPsychology classes and learn you know how are people attracted to you know they're heroes or how do you attract a larger audience how do you communicate with people who don't interact with daily so\nThere's a lot of stuff in there that\nWent beyond the classroom in terms of helping my career\nVery cool a NASCAR driver Julia land or on the phone with us right now and Julie I'm sure people ask you a mostly questions about sort of the driving itself but um I I actually want to stick to the education piece for a minute and a spot for peace for a minute because talking about\nUm you know science and technology and society I mean this is a really interesting time for all of those topics I think just today there was a news report about space facts you know landing a rocket back you know safely on the ground and we're hearing are all kinds of stories in and around you know cyber security and you know cyber warfare", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana
