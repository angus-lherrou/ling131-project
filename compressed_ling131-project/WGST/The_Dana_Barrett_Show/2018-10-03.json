we're waiting for her call and if she does call and we will bring her to you shortly uh I have a couple of other women on Wednesday stories I wanted\nTo cover today anyway and by the way a if we don't get not only on the phone I did my homework and I can go through the segment and give you tips without Natalie\nBecause that's how good I Am I'm actually read the book multiple times how I feel like I'm I could teach a class you know using that material I'm In the meantime a lot of other things to talk about\nUnder the heading of women on Wednesday I'm first of all I Want to talk a little bit about Rachel Mitchell who is the\nQuote unquote female prosecutor\nWho er was a part of the Christine Blasey Ford Brett Kavanaugh hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary committee and she was of course mocked along with everybody else by SNL over the weekend um but part of the fallout or the and the aftermath I should say of the hearings last week\nUm was the ritual Mitchell Report that she provided to the G O P following that day\nAnd in that report she noted that a reasonable any reasonable prosecutor would not have enough to bring a case against Brett Kavanaugh and that is something that Fox News and the GOP have been touting I'm pretty much nonstop since the\nUh hearings ended that's been one in their argument that there is no way to corroborate the stories um\nThat there's no way to go back that far in time and ... and get any real evidence cetera et cetera\nUh I feel like\nRachel Michel ... did a disservice to women in general on a number of levels\nOne in being there and accepting the terms laid out by her employer in that case the GOP um she allowed herself to be used as a shield between the all male Republican senators and\nThe alleged victim Dr Christine Blasey Ford but then not to be the questioner of the accused the accused Brett Kavanaugh so she was only there to shield another woman which is\nIt's it's a disservice in my opinion done two women uh first of all Christine Blasey Ford didn't want it she didn't ask for it in fact she asked for the opposite\nSo for a Grassley and Lindsey Graham and the others to say that she was treated well and Lindsey Graham today actually said handled well which again is like dude out to pasture time for you\nUm but to handle a woman who was strong enough to come forward and tell her story without losing her cool um to to handle her like she needed to handling is is wrong\nAnd I'm Rachel Mitchell allowing herself to be used that way I think was also a disservice now the reality is that of Rachel Mitchell had said no some other female prosecutor would have said yes so it really doesn't matter somebody would have done it\n[noise] But Rachel Mitchell didn't allow it to be her and then by following through afterwards with this report of um is it that a prosecutor wouldn't bring a case\n... changes the dialogue in a way that is unreasonable in my opinion because it was not a criminal prosecution it was not a trial a\nAs some of the comedians have joyfully pointed out over the weekend that was a job interview for one of ultimately the biggest jobs in the country it was a job interview not a prosecution and so\nYeah so that a is a huge important point I think there's a lot of women in general don't ask a for what they need in life let alone or to to start a business so you say don't buy or rent anything at all don't buy anything don't rent anything before you ask for it for free that's a pretty bold\nI mean if everybody's got done sort of an actor and sometimes these are soft trait in my case\nPeople want access to investors they want to ask questions they want coaching they want you to look at their deck and the reality that they're incubator is all over the city that would love to have something like an investor in residence was exchanging some of her time in my case right for free apathy everybody's got something like that it's possible to trade\nI think that's a hugely important point though because I think people get um tripped up on me why why why would anyone just give it to me you're you're still offering something in return and you're not offering cash\nYeah you're you're just spending a little bit of time understanding for this thing that I Want what what do they need where were they lacking right\nYeah absolutely I not only Molina any now on the phone with us right now uh we are talking through some awesome hacks for women entrepreneurs are from her buck alright\nPricing is another one and this is something you get into in a lot of detail and I think this is huge again not just for how we price our products or services as women in business\nBut how we value ourselves a\nTalk a little bit about that whole concept what do you\nOh my God this is such a pet peeve of mine um you know what you write your products that you value your time has such a huge impact on what you perceive your own value to be right but I Would also just to get into ... tax because I Love you know the the really like how to I think that people often\nWill take whatever let's say manufactured products right whatever here factory costs are whatever your raw materials supply costs are and then what they do it they all got up and then they added\nOkay well and it really takes the that sure Irish priest thing what it actually costs if they're caught they total all that up and then they think this is the price\nBut that isn't the reality thing whatever we did for example you're making might actually said somebody so much time might get them a little you know a few more hours with their kids in the afternoon might do something\nFor your end consumer that it's far more valuable in what your math adds up to him right so instead of valuing what you're selling at what it costs you\nThis is value it at what it actually costs your customer to not have it in their lives that's a huge mind shift right\nOh yeah absolutely I think it's so hard for women though to\nTo know how to do that and to really understand what their value is and I think it is also hard and I'm just going to throw this out there if you're doing something that's new or you're creating a product that's not something that's really out there already do you have sort of some suggestions about how to to get the math on that right\n[noise] yeah I mean and I again I Would start with the customer rather than your costs and so what I typically do and I actually teach that even in a high school summer camp that we have at Columbia University at Barnard I send the kid out onto the street I have been taught to perfect strangers and I have them ask people what they think\nIs worth and make it a wide variety of answers and your outliers in the top and then the bottom but a lot of people end up in that middle area and it's often surprising that sort of answers that you've got in terms of what people find the value of something to eat rather than what they think it costs to manufacture to produce\nYeah absolutely listen I think there is something I'm like all of this is resonating for me under this whole idea of I'm sort of the apologies that women make you know this whole idea that like we don't deserve\nAnything for ourselves um we're not worth it we're not worthy whatever it is and I feel like this sort of this sort of plays into all of that\nIt does and you know something that's not in the book that I that I actually I Wish I'd put in there is um\nThat women for example um call ourselves event planners when we're in the business of for example producing event trade but men don't they go into the same business and they called themselves producers murders a vet and guess what producers get paid thirty percent more than event planners do and all it is ... glacier yet\nYeah that's a classic example ah so true art before we um you know get to down a rabbit hole because I Know you and I can do that I Want to switch gears and talk about uh raising money a venture money or angel money or whatever it is and\nFirst of all you talk about in the book the idea that while it's kind of sexy right now and everybody thinks that's how you should start your business by trying to raise money and it's actually not a good fit for many businesses right\nFrom the extent I think that you know I don't I don't sometimes make a lot of friends and my own industry with this comment but the reality is unless you are willing\nTo give up enough equity in your company that you could potentially be fired from your own company Sunday than venture capital is not for you and what will the venture capitalists you know in\nIn their in their attempt to make it seem like it's\nThe end all be all for businesses and they make it seem like the only way you can really scale the company and scale it fast enough to take venture capital and it is right for some companies but I get the samples in the book of people like ... who's about to hit a billion dollars in revenue than her company technical she never took a penny of outside\nThe city or any sort of equity um investment and guess what should the\nFat woman on company in the United states and there are tons of examples like that so I just don't buy it is not the only way to grow a company and go as fast as compatible with them but if it actually tech um especially new innovations in tact\nBut most people are starting different kinds of businesses and loans lines of credit the fact\nThat the small business administration has\nGrant they're foundation grants especially if your company is doing some sort of a social good in the community there are many different ways and one of them one of my favorite ones is crowdfunding both equity crowdfunding as well as the original you know give people a T shirt or give people you know pre sell them your product kind of crowd funding\nWomen are more successful at Conde funding than men so let's do more of that\nYeah I Love that so there's that there's that idea of crowd funding we already talked about the idea of if you raise your prices you're bringing in more revenue and you're raising money yourself by selling your product yet um but if you do want to go down the vc road we hear from a lot of investors before they'll even talk to you well did you do your friends and family round uh\nAnd I like that you're laughing already I'm Natalie but I used to say like this is nonsense like there are so many people for whom this will never be a real option explain\nLooked nonsense of the polite way of saying horse mental are which is what you're doing that because the reality is is when you look at statistics that say that the average American family does not have five thousand dollars in their savings in these friends and family that were meant to be raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from that to me I\nI I I take issue not with the idea that you need to raise money if you are going down this path with these fundamentally want to see is that there's traction in the market but there are enough people that want to put in the game and there are excited about your product\nThat you can ... attraction and yes getting your rich friends and family if you happen to have those which most most Americans don't\nTo write a check is one way to show attraction but another way to show traction is to show that\nThree hundred people paid Fifteen dollars a crowdfunding campaign because they're excited about your product or maybe you just have a ton of users to use your product because it's free and what you've proven to the investors is that\nPeople are really interested in this product now let's think about how to monetize that right so I Would translate what friends and family actually means\nIs to illustrate that there's traction and there's people in the market that are interested in what you're selling and that doesn't necessarily have to come from rich friends and family because again we we call it that and we immediately alienate most Americans\nOh a hundred percent but I loved that you that you're sort of giving us a as women entrepreneurs away to answer that question was well listen I'm when I have is traction you know I don't have a ... I don't have a rich family are rich friends but when I Do have is traction that's the way down and write and here's what\nTotally there's a woman in my book named to tell you about you know get a who started something called pipeline angel and in her mind um what she's trying to do it she's trying to be friends and family around and beat out rich friends and family that most people don't have they creating\nThis amazing group of women who are high net worth women who don't know anything about it in ... in that thing but she takes him through the\nSix on campus she teaches them how to do small angel investing in companies that matter and so she allows people\nWho maybe don't have those rich or the family to come in to pitch their companies and get access to the whole crop of new women investors and in many ways she does kind of replace what the friends and family might have been I\nI Love it not only we're out of time for today but we'll have you back next week looking forward to
