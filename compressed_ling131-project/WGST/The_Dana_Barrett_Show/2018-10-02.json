production when it's not ready\nIt's amazing to me\nNothing more frustrating than whatever your technology device and especially when it's actually worked wants before right you're like oh before great and then for whatever reason you get replicated working\nRight and you didn't change anything like you did anything else like magic not\nLimited to small start up company is putting out you know

little bit different so you can click on something that allows you to see it as an outsider would well somehow that feature\nHad a security hole in it and the hackers got into it and got a hold of\nWhat did they say fifty million user accounts something like that I'm now what they say is and this is interesting ... they did not\nDid not get your ID and password\nOr any credit card information or anything like that what they thought was what's called a token\nAnd this token allows them to um Minnick like they're on your page I Believe 'cause that's what essentially when you're you and your pages someone else would you basically have a token to not be you for a minute if you can think of it that way\nAnd so somehow they're able to use that token to infiltrate in some way and I'm being vague about that because truthfully I Can't explain it any better than that I'm not sure I understand it any better than that\nSo I'm this is only interesting\nBecause a Trump said he had nothing to do with it and it was all done by third parties that were just looking out for his best interest but not he himself\nTrying to stop us in any way and apparently there is now corroborating evidence of some kind by more than one source saying that he was involved but this is a story coming straight from the wall Street Journal so before you start getting fired up about the liberal media and in New York Times or whatever it was the wall Street Journal the Rupert Murdoch paper that report it best\nSo uh in any case we'll keep you posted on that story ah but I Want to talk about millennia Trump who has a on her first ever solo international to her she decided to go to the continent that\nHas a bunch of countries that her husband at one time referred to as ...\nOr ... countries so I just want to say poop on the air today [noise]\nAh did you do that on purpose I don't know unclear but uh you know people are of course making their remarks because\nIt's like everybody's a little tone deaf you know\nLike rather than just ignoring it maybe she should have said you know I don't I don't know what she can it honestly I'm not sure what she could have done and the scenario but um she's there to try to promote her be best campaign a it's a good\nWill tripped and a lot of other first ladies have gone to Africa I think she began ah she started and gone out today with the first lady of Donna I'm\nYou know she's going to look at programs are going to be stopping along the way it and and highlighting programs funded by the U.S agency for international development\nUm but part of the criticism is that the U.S a IDs budget um is you know under the microscope right now the current administration her husband's administration proposing massive cuts\nUh there's also some question about some of these organizations who provide health care and include things like abortion services and that will no longer be funded by the U.S\nSo there's some issues with some of the the aid and at the countries that she's going to see so\nBe interesting to see if she comes out of this um unscathed or she gets ask some tough questions somewhere along the way I'm for the most part it seems like it's ceremonial right now and joy fall and all of that and you know look I\nThink she has been okay person and she should do what she should stand up\nFor the things she believes in regardless of whether what her husband says or does\nThat said she did choose to marry the guy so and she knew what he was like I'm just saying she knew what he was like\nI'm thinking of what he's like do we talk about his drinking or any of this hour I don't think we did\nI think we should have to say I think we should circle back to that because why not have been trying to be may not notice um but he doesn't drink he never has and I believe the back story on that and I'm not sure if I have is correct so if I get it wrong don't be mad at me but I Believe the back story is that perhaps he has a brother that had a drinking problem I think is that what it was\nAnd that scared I'm off maybe somewhere along the way but he doesn't drink and never has and he said he literally has never even taste it alcohol I which is really interesting\nBecause I feel like I'm not even who does that in this in modern times I feel like sometimes you do see that with families where there's been alcohol abuse where the kids you know respond by not drinking at all because they're worried that they could fall into the same\nUh you know hold that their parents did or whatever but it is fairly unusual to not have ever touched a drop in any case the it's kind of interesting that that's who we have is president when Brett Kavanaugh is being a certainly accused of being a sloppy drunk you know if not a lot worse so when Trump was defending him the other day he got\nAsked yesterday in the rose garden he got asked a question about um you know about the drinking or listen to this exchange\nA says he did lie about his drinking does that mean you'll pull his I don't think you do\nLook here's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my only good traits I don't [noise] whatever they're looking for something that I never had a list of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason\nCan you imagine if I had what a mess said they would I'd be the I'd be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing and I watched him and saying that he did have difficulty as a young man was drink\nOkay once\nAgain there's problems with that conversation I'm not sure I heard Brett Kavanaugh admit that he had a problem with\nDrank as a young man he only admitted that he liked beer\nAny sort of was looking you know ... kind of pushing back on everybody likes so what I like beer so I had a few beers were beers there are people that really ought to have beer and I wasn't legal but there were beers and I had them so I didn't hear him saying listen I drank more than I should when I was a kid that's not what he said\nUh so it's interesting if that's what Trump hurt even though that's not what he said and obviously he heard that uncovered by any kind of alcohol but swayed his own ability to hear what was going on [noise] uh\nI could make fun of that conversation uh but I feel like Seth Meyers is the pro so we'll just let him do it\nWas amazing about that Joe is inherent and the premise and struggle meeting that he already [noise]\n[noise]\nThat\nDoesn't work if everyone thinks drop is a great president if they say it is they go in as now imagine if I had a few beers\n[laughter] so true [laughter] ... ah yeah I feel like I just couldn't do it any better than Seth Meyers on that one so I'll just let him have it\n[noise] uh in any case an interesting\nWeek for sure and ... and we're only on Tuesday that's going to get more interesting and I want to jump over to a couple of a local story is just to let you know we are\nClose to mid term now are about four weeks away and a couple of days or something like that four and a half weeks away from the voting a wonder if the registration deadline as it next\nWeek since that's next Wednesday okay I think early voting starts a week after that so\nSo get on it register register online I Wonder do ... let's see some subliminal messaging register register that we're\nStill have a student recorded and periodically through the show we'll just play with her right [laughter]\nOkay ah hopefully that worked on you and you'll hear it like you are sleeping I could just be like oh my God I have to register um\nI mentioned all this because of local debates are beginning tomorrow on Georgia Public broadcasting and they're having debates literally at all levels so they've got you know ... everything leading up to I Believe the gubernatorial debate which I think is October twenty third\nUm but the lieutenant governors are debating the secretary of states are debating all the way down here that the different congressional districts everybody's having a debate in our state\nSo I Know it's going to be hard to watch it all and we'll try to get some excerpts here and there and an air them for you on the show if this was really all you have time for in terms of catching up\nBut do your best to tune into the ones that you're not sure about or you want to know more about the candidates because I'm the more informed we are\nAs voters the better or we
