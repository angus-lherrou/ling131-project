political non fans and what better way to ... that might some GOOD Music or to that and we've got a decent theory hanging out with us from Atlanta pops orchestrate the music director face and how are you I'm well how are you a\nThank you for being here sure it will be here we we started making a tradition of talking about music and sometimes even having it in the studio on Fridays\nSo um you know I'm Glad you're here because there's a few things I Want to talk about but first of all I just have to ask for like a simple definition because I Am not a music expert and I have heard um the term pops orchestra but I Know what that means what does that mean\n[noise] well I'm kind of our thing is that now we were to be on the cutting edge of of music or whatever the latest stuff uh the thing that I Love about the opposite weren't able to do everything from a well a boat starts to prince\nOkay\nDoodle well ah I mean these are the musicians play all the Broadway shows when they come out of town a studio musician so it's it's it's really fun to be able to do just about any projects you throw in front of them\nI feel like we well this is why you're here of course I feel like more people need to\nGet to know that that it's not just like sort of what we might think of as classical music that it's a whole variety that you guys or do I\nOwe no issue we are um we take great pride in being an approachable group of being able to do any musical genre you put in front of us I mean from hip hop to jazz I mean we've we've we've done at all including a no we're on the charts and the [noise]\nThe a bluegrass or I'm On the billboard charts with a pulse rate\nSatisfy we should just mention that we have we have like the peanut gallery in the background [laughter] we've got like the the the Jason West where you know these these are people trying to keep me honest with\nKevin Leahy hanging out behind a bind Jason he's\nOn the board of directors among other titles on and so we'll we'll we'll check in chaos and Kevin is are getting everything right so I Know the season just began mhm so what do we have to look forward to the season [noise]\nOh well we have a show in a Thomasville a tomorrow or or to your little trip down there I'm going to be working with Katie deal I'm doing a couple of numbers of ours um she's traveled all over the south are done a lot of her own uh shows are individually but we've had a nice little partnership with her as well [noise]\nUm where else are doing a a partnership with Kobe Agnew again we've we've had about a two or three year relationship with her or doing shows of a a kind of Irish\n... songs but also some other things that she just wanted to say on her own but we've kinda been there are backup group\nAnd he didn't get to that though until we were off the air I forgot to bring it back 'cause I got distracted by the actual interview today I don't want to leave you hanging now tarmac\nAnd it's funny because we were done with the interview and he just out of the blue said Mel term and I didn't know what you're talking about at first I thought oh okay got it um okay let's do some local stuff ah there's always something going on\nBut you know there's a few things I Want to catch everybody up on one is we've we've been having this discussion for years about Marta expanding beyond Fulton into cab counties and we've had other counties express some interest\nUm and I think one of their county Clinton I think has already approved some Marta yeah\nUm and going is will seem like maybe the next one to ... to fall so to speak I grant seemed like the next a\nPossibility and in fact there is a referendum coming up a frequent voters where they will be able to actually cast a vote on whether or not they would like to have Marta but there is a new poll out today\nThat says a large chunk of going out voters are still undecided on Marta and quite a few are not feeling it so about Fifteen Percent of those polled are undecided\nAnd I think it was about forty I Want to say it was about forty four percent uh\nYeah forty percent said they would vote yes and about ...\nPretty four percent said they would vote no so right now the nose habit though it's within the margin of error and the undecideds could make a big difference you know if the undecided all go for it then we shall see and that poll by the way it was of\nRegistered end likely voters those kind of people who will actually show up to let's say a mid term election or a special election and cast a vote\nSo I got to ask hear what the problem is because I've been saying this all along and I didn't grow up here so I have a different perspective I grew up in a city I'm In the suburbs of a city that had\nWidespread mass transit and it was great I mean it made\nLife so wonderful I feel like for the computers that lived in my town for me as a young a teenager and as a teenager to get around it's far safer I'm just going to point this out and then we'll move on from this particular line of thought but it's far safer to jump on the murder trained if you've had a few than to jump into a car\nAnd frankly I'd rather have my teenagers\nLike I said that like I had two or three teenagers at home I don't have any teenagers at home but I'd\nHave them get you know a group of friends get on the murder train together to get home than to get into an over with somebody who may or may not be a safe person to be driving less I\nI'm just putting that line of eye out there for consideration\nAh I don't know that that is in anyone's thoughts about why are they do or do not want this I think for a lot of people the um the issue is the cost because it there is you know this doesn't mean there will be a these various a penny fear and they're on different sales taxes and whatnot\nUm but for a lot of people it is still\nThe false miss the false legend if you will that mass transit breeds crime\nThat's what we've been hearing for all these years in the greater metro Atlanta area we don't want air quotes those people I'm coming to our neighborhoods really first of all I'd like to say that it's twenty eighth team which doesn't mean a lot because there's a lot of bad stuff going on right now\nWhich means something and secondly there is truly know science there is no statistic there is no evidence to back\nThat mass or the the ... the allegation that mass transit brings crime to the neighborhood in fact if you get through it somewhat absurd\n[noise] so I'm a\nHouse burglar thing can I Choose that as my but then I my business card house burglar and I'm going to go out to going at I'm going to leave my neighborhood and I'm not going to stop and butthead or he's called I'm going to get on Marta go out to win that\nRob your house yours in particular and\nI'm going to what\nWait for the U.S\nI don't think so like if you see I just feel like I have this\nView of like the old school cat burglar you know with like all dressed in all black with like just the mask over their eyes and a big bag of like toasters standing at the bus stop waiting for the ...\nLike they don't ... criminal ... and that's not how it works and if you're thinking like pick pockets or ... or whatever same thing they're not going to like\nRip you off and then grab their breeze card and run to the train and then stand there and wait for minutes for the next two to come or fourteen minutes while the police are looking for is that how it works ... those criminals by the way\nThey make a lot of money and they have cars so they really want to come to your house they're coming anyway\nFor the record Jesse now and also by the way there's this thing now I don't know if you've heard of it it's called ride sharing most people call it Hoover I'm the criminals can also take this right to your door they probably you know if the driver to wait and jump right back in to the uber after they've robbed your house\nUm so yeah boat trip for Marta people here here's the reason we need it\nIf you haven't noticed we have this thing in Atlanta that's of one of the few negatives of living in the city and it's called [noise] traffic have you heard of it starts with the tea and ends of the sea and Scott ethic in the middle\nEast come back if you have good mass transit you have less people on the roads all of the ...\nLeans and the speed lanes and the HOV lane in the car\nPooling nonsense does not work nearly as well as good mass transit that does do enough places that you can get on it and get where you need to go\nThere are people I Know this is hard to imagine in our city but there are people that live in cities like Boston and Chicago and Philadelphia and New York who don't have cars and they get to and from work and to and from every social occasion that they need to get to and from\nIn their life I Know it's crazy but it's true just saying so it's time going that need that it's the eighty five is crazy crowded and it's\nTime it's time to do it let's go this that you're holding up the entire metro area from being the true world class city that we need to be there was a new story out\nAbout Amazon H Q A and the fact that they've gone back and visited a couple of the a handful of the cities that are on the short list um and it looks like they're narrowing down their search although they have not made any official statements\nAh I'd like to point out we were not one of those cities that was visited at least not according to the article I read which I'm pretty sure was in the wall Street Journal\nAnd so it was like cities like ah Newark in New York and Washington DC and places like that uh I think maybe Chicago but there were a few other places like North Carolina and Atlanta did not get second visit to at least not yet again from what I understand\nSo it it I'm not saying that the only reason is because we don't have good enough mass\nTransit but I'm putting out there that it's probably one of them\nBecause we have everything else right and we have great cost of living we have a great airport we have great weather well fish I'm sort of sometimes but you know we don't have a good traffic situation and we don't have enough mass transit\nSo come on going up please if I beg how 'bout that chocolate ride can bribe all when it all going out with chocolate\nWhat if I bribed them all the chocolate and it was a lie I couldn't actually pony up when the time came\nUp to ... you have some very upset when they ...\n... I went on for that but I think it's it's look it's worth doing that I promise you'll like it just try to like it\nAnd for what it's worth this entire segment I've been perusing the inter webs looking for articles that support the fact that crime increases in most transit and now you know\nDo ... British universities lots of big universities who said no the only thing that increases in any way is young people moving around more and you know juveniles tend to be a little mischievous sometimes\n... okay you might get one or two more shoplifters run into them outside of the major crime and also what is the benefit of mass transit aside from alleviating traffic right it brings economic development around all the news stations\nOr it brings younger residents to the area which means they grow their families there there's so many reasons to do it and yes it is going to cost a little money but you know what you can't win if you don't play\nAppropriate since the water is now huge [laughter] um but it's true it's like if you want to be a part of the game you have to play and that costs money you gotta you gotta spend money to make money that's how it\nGoes and it's true in that situation too so come on good at I mean I like to be a cheerleader when it when it when it\nComes down to murder Marta we got this I think we I think we have a new um secondary jobs a cheerleader guy neck a or we should just keep our day job it is that marriage is friday and we will be right back\nFor Dina ... coming up on TALK radio six forty WG a seat\nAnger and it works and unfortunately there isn't any one that is stepping up in a genuine way to stop him from doing that\nAnd I feel like the rest of the people and I'm not saying even the ... it's not a Democrat Republican thing the rest of us\n... let's just put it this way people who are not part of his base\nAren't sure how to fight this fight fire with fire take the high road where do you do how do you counter someone who has the troops rallied so to speak I'm Out of fear\nIt's very hard to do and um when people follow blindly there is no way to make them see\n[noise] uh and that's where we're at with this guy I mean this is a man who will happily\nAnd proudly support the body slamming of journalists he did that last night at a rally in Missoula, Montana listen\nGrudges laws and by the way it never wrestle him [noise]\n\nBody plan\n[noise] I'd\nSay the restaurant we indoors Greg very early [noise] but I had heard that he body slams a reporter [noise]\nAnd it\nWas [noise] and I said oh this is terrible you lose the election that I said well wait a minute I Know Montana pretty well I think it might help him\n[noise] ah is a great guy [noise] self cooking\nHe's been convicted of body finding that it's a crime it's assault he was convicted and elected anyway by the way to the president wasn't entirely wrong because Montana elected him anyway um but to count that as as a good\nThing that anybody can body slam someone that's his guy especially in light of the fact that we're in the ... in the middle of a\nCouple of weeks at a drama in which a journalist and not too great Jim forte slam body find that was a reporter so the president is telling this is a good thing during a three week period in which we're investigating the murder and just member meant of a journalist\nThere no decency left is there no decency laugh can we please take some of that decency we show to each other one on one and tried to raise it up to the to the to the national level that would be amazing let's try for that matter Joe while they're right back\nLena ... coming up on TALK radio six forty\n... presented by capital what happened on December ... the former arena story Shaun\nMarshmallow lead you\nThe wrong way and your ... presented by capital one\nPolitical building that dream home\nNo perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options considered find your loans that\nClose to the store\nJesse from you know through the ... year old [noise]\nAll right we're back at his friday I\nBecause well you know tomorrow the Saturday\nAh the day which most of us get a break\nFrom whatever it is we do all day long that size true as it once was people worked nonstop we're all attached to our devices and you know first of all plenty of people have jobs that act where they actually work on the weekend so there's that uh but then you add to that of course now\nI mean I feel like I kind of do work twenty four seven but it's a little bit of a break its I Pretend that Fridays or extra special I'm alright listen a lot going on a I was mentioning a President Trump's\nRally last night in Missoula, Montana in which he a glorified the body slamming ever reporter when he was talking about a representative ... how you pronounce that man's name I'm going to have to Google that I'm In any case that was part of what he said in the rally he also ah\nThroughout some new rallying cries for the GOP leading up\nTo the midterms because we are now ... what about two weeks away from the mid term elections something like that\nAnd of course early voting\nIs underway and I think all states now I'm pretty sure there is a habit I or the states that don't have early voting we now\nI'm In any case one of the rallying cry or one of the comments the president made about the upcoming midterm is that the mid term is going to the to be about caravans and Kavanaugh so\n... what are you saying there is that the you know of caravans of course he's referring in particular to the current caravan that is heading towards our southern border are coming up through a New Mexico\nBut also I think he means immigration on the whole and when he says Kavanaugh of course he means Brett Kavanaugh and the anger or on frankly on both sides are about Brett Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation and I have to say here here's a here's my question on both of those topics cabinet and the caravan right so who's angrier\nBecause we we just said and if you buy into that said it's much more likely that you'll go to vote if you're mad about something or if you're against something than if you're ... or something who angrier when it comes to immigration the people who want to close the borders and who think Trump and therefore the people\nThat he wants that he's supporting will be good for that um or the people who don't like what happened with family separation who don't like the idea of a wall so who's who's angrier when it\nComes to immigration I don't have the answer I have a question I don't have the answer um [noise] I don't think that that one to me look here's the other problem and I and and and I don't know how\nClosed when this all may have been closed ever sense\nMaker county schools will finally reopen next Tuesday Decatur county school Mike reopen around the middle of next week
