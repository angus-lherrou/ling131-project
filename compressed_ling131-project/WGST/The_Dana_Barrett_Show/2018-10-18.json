story to tackle\nYeah you know that's a great question because I mean he's constantly doing or saying things that are crazy or a nonsensical or [noise]\nBack to the dean of average show here on ...\nRight we\nThe er twenty Eighteen case you were wondering and we have the largest deficit that we have had in the United states since about twenty twelve\nNow keep in mind in twenty twelve when we were\nWe were recovering from a horrible economic recession and so part of the reason you build up a deficit and a time of recession is because you have to kind of overspend to stimulate the economy that's sort of the way it goes\nUm but now we are in a time of\nEconomic strength as everyone says uh the you know we have the best\nUh unemployment numbers we've had in a long time a all everything is good economically\nExcept that we have this giant nor mess deficit and if you listen to\n[noise] uh the Republicans if you stream your ears as hard as you can you're talking about it but let me tell you something they were railing about it when Obama was president but that the ... the debt deficit the deficit the deficit now it's like cricket\nUm but I guess it got under the president's skin a little bit that the last one\nWas griping about it and so he decided it's time to make a change we're gonna we're gonna fix this cabinet meeting and he came up with a suggestion\nFeature of you to come back\nA five percent budget cuts [noise]\nFrom fuel for whether to ship goods or is this\nIs what it was a ... good for the sweetest I think you'll be able to do the reviews social exemptions for a\nGood exemption would be if you can do more than five some of you will see I could be what for those of us [laughter] I\nKnow if that he didn't really mean it this way but it almost sounded like he was saying there's gonna be a five percent I Want you each to come back with a five percent budget cut like just cut a secretary ordered ministry and her she's kind of what it sounded like\nI think he just meant the secretary of the department where an administrator of the department can work on the five percent but it sort of like just got one job and you'll be good to go out and falling in\nSaudi man um but you know he goes off on these tangents sometimes it's hard to figure out what he does mean he referred a lot of it later and not talk to the penny plan which is something that various senators have\nProposed a throughout the last however many years with this idea that if if you caught one percent one penny out of every dollar spent you would a balanced the budget in or get rid of I don't know I don't know if it's don't get rid of the deficit but you would balance the budget I think within five years something like that [noise]\nUm so he was calling just won the nickel plan 'cause it's five percent instead of one percent um\nBut I think the deficit if I have this right or something like up Seventeen percent since he took office I think I have\nRight I don't have the numbers right in front of me so don't quote me I'm Out of the uh in the break room today next mounting like he thinks I got it right just Seventeen up from\nYear oh okay you want to hear your lesson that okay so it's up Seventy percent so cutting five percent I don't somehow I'm not sure again not a mathematician here but somehow I'm thinking that doesn't quite up if it's up Seventeen percent and you only ... five percent\nDoes that fix the problem I'm not sure\nI'm also I Love to hearken back to the movie Dave\nUh with Kevin Kline and um if you haven't seen it and you probably have and it was a long time ago maybe forgot about it\nUh it was a great movie where you know Kevin Kline sort of takes the job of president and he's sort of just a regular old regular guy who takes the job and he just kind of goes in there and if we can save some money I Know we can do it any sort of figured out how to save money and I think that might be where the president got this idea of just bringing everyone around the table and saying\nCut cut them out something I'm now I Will say this some of the uh\nVarious senators and congressmen have taken a this idea of cutting the deficit and they are starting to talk about it a little bit more Mitch McConnell are talked about it within the last two days and suggested that the only way to do that I think he said this yesterday is to cut a\nMedicare Medicaid Social security bubble programs need to go that's basically what is it not all the way but they need to be cut significantly\nUm and so I started thinking about that a little bit\nAnd it occurs to me um that there is a ... and by the way he blamed\n... Democrats even though it's a Republican controlled everything right now he blamed Democrats for the inability to uh cut any of those budgets but when I really started digging into it\nIt does seem to me and you can do your research here that the Trump base actually benefits more from these anti poverty type programs than any other demographic in the country so ah\nThe non college educated a blue collar white folk actually get more benefit from the government\nSubsidy is the government programs than any other group\nCheck me check me I Will post a link to my source on my ... I'm not making this up uh\nAnd so it's I think it's one of these things where they're going to talk about it all day long but the Republicans don't actually want to\nCut into Medicare or Medicaid or Social Security because older white voters use those things more than anyone else\nThey don't want those things to go away so all of that screaming about government programs and the cost of government programs and I'll just keep that in mind because I also am going to say this to you and they were going to move on\nI bet you most millennials and even most of us ... I don't believe that Medicare or Medicaid or Social Security is ever going to help us at all so therefore I'll go Republican on you for a second and say go ahead and cut it I wasn't counting on it anyway\nCut it I don't care that doesn't mean it's not my issue it's actually the other way around then you might think\nJust for thought ah\nIt's Thursday that means it's time\nTo figure out what we're doing this weekend\nI'm work hard you know there would show special correspondent ritual of [noise] when you're hungry\nThis weekend will cut cut it is time for the taste of Atlanta the city's must do food wine beer and cocktail festival at historic forth war park that's this Friday through Sunday October in Ninety three twenty first\nThere are VIP and general admission tickets available you can do the one day the IT at Seventy five dollars one day general admissions only twenty five\nBucks but if you're going to do the three day the passes range from one hundred to two hundred dollars\nAnd I would recommend if you are interested in trying Koch different cocktails go ahead and spring for the VIP ticket it is worth it also historic fourth word park is right off of the Atlanta belt laying east side trail so if you do indulge a little too much and food and drink hey go for a stroll afterwards\nTickets goes on sale tomorrow for Trevor Noah at the Fox theater it's his loud and clear tour the the\nPerformance is not until twenty Nineteen but go ahead and get this pre sell tickets the cost is thirty five dollars to a hundred twenty five dollars plus applicable fees\nThe day for that is February fifteenth twenty and Eighteen you may know Trevor Noah 'cause he's the host of the Daily Show a celebrated comedian and he's known around the world for his his insightful inauthentic take on politics and current events don't miss it\nThis weekend if you're looking to get spooky head on down to little five points for the Halloween festival and parade that this Saturday October twentieth from four to six PM the cost is free and guess will enjoy great food and drink live entertainment and the best Halloween parade in the south\nIf you want to see um interesting folks or grab a Halloween costume I think little five points it's going to be the best place for costume viewing so I Would definitely had down there\nAlso this weekend it's the ... annual ... festival on ...

dynamic\nIn England still has a king or queen they can do with their to just\nYou know they don't do anything they have weddings and parades and stuff which\nI mean let me just be honest if I were a royal I'd prefer that like wow I Want to work just let me have the castles and the fun stuff and you you politicians do the rest I'm good with that uh\nThe rural Saudi Arabia's royal family I think I'd be okay with that as long as you get to keep the money in the castles and stuff\nI don't think that's how they roll or just putting it out there anyway all at the same intuitions not going to the

life and\nTelevision and that's fair because we are sort of living in a giant reality show right now so uh yeah so she did tweet that and she also made a statement or after the airing of the counters because her character ah was killed off by an opioid overdose on the show and she made a\nStatement basically saying that she\nUh is still you know things that was sad wrong bad that uh ABC decided to kill off the character and that by doing it with an opioid overdose just made what was a fun happy show Bram okay sour grapes Roseanne just saying\nI'm OK let's move on we've done a lot of local

stuff but we uh once again our our our local politics are making it to the national headlines a will use that as a jumping off point a to get into some of our local stories first of all\nA there was I don't know if you've caught this but there was a situation where some a senior citizen voters\nIn Jefferson County were\nActually asked to get off a bus that had come to help get them to the polls and that was enough for us to bubble up to the national headlines of course uh the the rallying\nCry is voter suppression um the county Jefferson County defending itself saying no no we just don't allow any political activity on county property like that and that was it specifically sponsored by the Democrats therefore it was partisan and we didn't want that\nIt was all done through a group called black voters matter which does say they are a nonpartisan group\nAnd uh but they do have some funding from the Democratic I don't know if it's a democratic committee or the other democratic foundations or whatever it is\nYou know how hard it is to track the money sometimes um but in any case the story is this a group of voters got together for an event at this particular county facility in Jefferson County uh the black voters matter group was one of the sponsors of that event and they also brought a bus and agreed to take forty of the of the attendees of the event\nAnd we talked about the story when it broke two three years ago so I thought we should you know complete the thought if you will\nI Know about political correctness has it gotten\nAnalyze that next to this one of

correct or do we eat a new study saying a political correctness is actually widely popular with Americans of all ages and races\nSo we have breaking this down and did you say we've got one of our faith on about Dr John ... clinical forensic psychologist how are you sir\nI'm amazing shrimp\nI'm going to stop asking you how you are because you're saying listen I Want to jump right into that because I feel like this has been a problem for a long time and this this new survey this out is saying that eighty percent of Americans think that political correctness is a problem and so I just want to ask\nYou know we don't really mean to to be politically correct because it just like not using the wrong word is it just trying not to offend somebody what do you think\nAre crying and somebody was in that situation I'm sure you drop off your church and we're we're not seeing if we're not we're far and ah you're going from that\nThere are better than they are just so that you don't

saying they think political correctness has gone too far so why are we trying to do something that nobody else really likes what's that about\n... shrink to do that and the problem is if we do it you're also consider not caring and we were on a farm or race or you can't prove a negative you can't prove you're not from the\nLabel you're stuck in order for it so everybody tries to do that in a situation where all of a sudden you get to where you will because you're\nTalking openly about about something you're\nAll right so let's talk about that because one of the other things the study said is that most Americans are part of um what what they're calling and exhausted majority are that are actually fairly flexible on their political views not as divided as we see when you just watch the news um\nWere exhausted and I think it's political correctness is exhausting so how do you break out of this way to sort of stop this because how do\nHave a good conversation if we can't break
