here\nIt looks as though it's going to be a federal contract when you're a little bit more today he's supposed to make an appearance in court today we'll hear officially what the charges are against him and where you stand I heard some reports earlier on that his lawyers denying something about the fingerprint portion or that it wasn't a full fingerprint on the package that was sent to Maxine Waters and so\nAccording to the lawyer trying to indicate that there may be a mix up on that level that perhaps they've got the wrong person in regards to all of this it's also kind of difficult to do that went in the past you had bomb threats before so\nI think we're going to wait and see how this is all going to file together but you are looking at you know a good number of counts it could be coming his direction here and especially when you're adding them up and he kind of open the door a little bit over the weekend and said there may be more of these bombs that are going to reach other people\nThat he knows about it gently open the door but it wasn't him but they're my ... wasn't on that particular oh the other ones look exactly the\nSame maybe it's on that so there's a bunch of questions that have yet to be answered but it's it's very difficult I think if indeed the DNA was found on some of them and put it on the other that you'll be able to back out of this wow\nAll right uh Pittsburgh what is the latest coming out of Pittsburgh\nOh we know that there is a little bit of good information all get to that in a second but what we're seeing right now is about Ninety minutes or so from now\nYou're expecting to see in court the gentleman that they've named as the shooter Robert Bowers came out of the hospital this morning he'd been in the hospital we get on a protection a security as well we know that when he entered the tree of life synagogue Saturday morning open fire killed eleven people\nUh six of those six additional people were injured in addition to the eleventh she had Seventeen altogether for them police officers\nUm here's the thing that the investigators are saying that this was very isolated he was a very awkward man who lived alone struggled with basic human interactions until he got on the line Dana's at that point that when sort of the Internet muscles flared up and that's when he started spewing murderous hatred and bigotry on line\nOr he unleashed a torn about a month or two before the shooting an unleashed a tour of anti immigrant anti Jewish conspiracy theories on a website or that in any case a social media hub known as\nGab I went on a gap Saturday and tried to kind of see what this was all about and the two pages are rooms that I went in and the thirty or so people that were in their\nLevel of hatred I saw was unbelievable and what seemed to be actions and people really requesting actions taken against certain religious and ethnic groups was shaking to me and then shortly thereafter they pulled the website down and the people who are hosting the website told got to go find out someplace else they're currently working on that right now\nRight and of course gab is presenting not like they are under attack was correct amazing\nThem saying well this is our freedom of speech and places like Twitter and Facebook\nThey filter our ability to speak freely so we've got this this gap which by the way it just makes it that way too nice to actually be something that the the hatred that was actually on there but that said this is their version of trying to get out and get the ability for people to speak freely but over the last nine plus months that this guy had been up there it became a hotbed and was totally embrace\nI Want to arm teachers to arm the churches and synagogues it's ridiculous congressmen Adam Schiff

synagogue for not having an armed guard there that's not the answer we're going to have armed guards with every church or synagogue every a movie theater every concert venue we can't have of armed guards everywhere that's not the answer\nYeah I'm looking at the shooting in Kentucky just as an example the ... even if they lock their doors and the and the guy that was planning to go in there and she got that church wasn't able to get in\nA but he wants to cross to the parking lot of the Kroger and shot to black people so are you going to have armed guards everywhere in the parking lots of kroger's now like any place that ever had a shooting then you just armed please until the next shooting happened to then your arm that kind of ridiculous\nListen obviously we continue this

J. C. C. A. that is coming out they'll have in our parents there are coming up I Believe it is a next week or something like that so we'll we'll get the date for you on that as well but it just so happens\nTo also be a truly fascinating topic given\nUm what's been going on\nIn the country and in particular um with anti Semitism and the attack in Pittsburgh so I'm I was really hoping to to get his comments on that but again hopefully will um\nWe'll get those when he's able to hopefully he'll be able to call us ... and talk about that later on the show we do have coming up right at the top of the hour at one o'clock we are going to have a the regional director Alice and good men from the Anti Defamation league um\nComing on TALK about you know her thoughts and all of this and uh the ACL's kinda stance on what happened in Pittsburgh and how we move forward\nOr from that so um you know what will just continue the conversation with Senator Lieberman we can do that we've done it before we will do it again\nBefore the break um we were talking about Trump's reaction to all of this when he said um you know first see you know he sort of gave U.S officials something's got to be done and then he followed up when\nI'm that guns have very little to do with it he said uh and suggested in fact that um if the synagogue um had had armed guards that maybe this would not have happened\nUm we then played a Congressman Adam Schiff response which was you can't blame the synagogue first of all and second of all you can't arm everyone everywhere and we clearly I mean you don't have to even work hard in your memory call a recent shootings\nWe've had school shootings or we've had a nightclub shooting in Florida we had the shooting in Vegas and an outdoor concert venue for my hotel room\nI'm you know now here we have a synagogue shooting we've had church shootings we had the one or several years back\nUm in in South Carolina I think was in Charleston where I'm nine black people were killed by a white supremacist um\nElse to remind you of the newspaper there was a ... I was yeah it was\nAnd this is where are the killer in Pittsburgh found a solace this is where he found people like him this is where he found something that he connected two and a while he clearly says he was not a Trump supporter\nThe reason he did not support Trump is because Trump has too many Jews around him the Jews are controlling him a and so therefore he would not be able to get it done\nHe also believed uh based on what he told police and based on what was on his social media that um\nThe Jews were responsible for uh he he the Jews were responsible for the caravan that is coming up through a central and South America I'm Sorry Central America and into Mexico and headed here um he was criticizing just before he\nYou know within hours before he went to the synagogue in Pittsburgh where he\nKilled eleven people and wounded several others he posted on gab that highest H. I. A. S. which is a um a Jewish refugee resettlement agency that has been around for a very long time quote likes to bring invaders in that kill our people\nUh he goes on to say I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your objects I'm going in um that is one of\nA few post by him that are actually that don't includes directs lawyers like uses the word takes a lot which is\nThe a derogatory term for Jews and I'm\nIn any case that is what he so he he did sort of indicate\nOn social media that he was going to go do something screw your optics I'm going in\n[noise] um\nSo we get into once again this debate of free speech versus a private platforms you know should they\nOr should they not curtail hate speech and where do you draw the line\nNow you know with Facebook and Twitter they have enough of a following of people that are more mainstream shall we say that they have a vest and they have advertisers that are\nMainstream so they have a vested interest in keeping the mainstream population interested in their platforms and on their platforms and they have a vested interest in keeping mainstream advertiser money on their platforms\nSo they are much more likely although Twitter apparently does a pretty bad job of it of kicking those kinds of people off and removing those kinds of posts\nA gab was started specifically to provide a space for that\nSo this is the question that I'm asking all of you and give us a call if you have thoughts about this for a for three six seven WG S T is the number that's for oh four three six seven nine four seven eight\nWhat do we do I think there was a difference when there was no on line kind of activity in that way um because when you were shouting in the public square\nYou know before you could uh\nDo on the Internet and and you know visually shout um you first of all had to look people in the eye\nSecond of all the authorities knew\nThat you were there because you were in the town square so the police the sheriff the mayor whomever saw you in the town square\nYour neighbors saw you I'm taking a step further you had the Ku Klux Klan Ku Klux Klan um easy for me to say uh the thought they had they they knew what they were saying was bad enough that they felt they had to cover their faces and meet in secret at night\n[noise] um but that made it harder to do it it limited\nThose people whether it was the town square or whether was hiding your face under a white cheat you had to\nTry hard much harder than you do now to log on somewhere and spew uh your head and find others like you\nSo here we are in this digital age ... is this the same as you know printing a pamphlet that's filled with hate\nIt or not um and do we do we have to allow it or can we make some kind of you know\nA look our laws are amended all the time and Supreme Court cases add new precedent to the law the time so maybe we need to add some kinds of laws that do restrict speech in some way and hate speech by the way is restricted\nSo and threats are restricted so you're not allowed to say every last thing you want if you threaten even though all you did was talk that can be considered a crime so um\nWe have to maybe figure out how to draw those lines digitally and we also need to figure out what to do about it uh uh\nWe played a little bit earlier the president saying um\nSomething has to be done and then going on to sort of say uh you know they should have been armed in the Senate God\nI don't agree with that but something does have to be done and the problem you know we keep we keep hearing the advice over and over again if you see something say something but many of these people have been\nYou know read it on if you will something has been said they have been arrested for other things or they have been on you know visible to the authorities for some reason\nBut the law does not allow the authorities to do anything about it so just because someone is saying things that are questionable whether it's online or off um just because they're driving\nIn their bomber van with targets on people's faces there's no law against that so perhaps given Parkland and given Pittsburgh and given the package a bomber and given\nA you know Florida oh the the nightclub shooting pulse nightclub shooting and and the and the Vegas you know maybe we need to allow the authorities\nNot to be handcuffed when they are notified\nAbout somebody making threats or being crazy or having a but Julian guns\n[noise] um\nBut the idea that we shouldn't be talking about it and we can't talk about it and then it's too soon to talk about it I don't buy that I think we are going to this whole you know given what we saw with\nParkland for example which by the way the news cycle for Parkland I'm actually lasted a lot longer than many of these do\nWhich is a testament to the kids at Parkland um but it it died away\nIt ... you know we moved on and at that time the president made a lot of promises a he was going to get rid of bump stocks he was gonna you know they were going to do all they were gonna come up with some bars and they were going to change some things and then\nYou know the media changed ears and moved on to the next thing and that was that so\nYou know here we are again at the only time when the subjects get any attention so we have to take advantage of that sounds horrible but it's true and discuss it and we have to keep discussing it and we have to keep we have to stop being I keep\nUsing this term but wag by the president's rhetoric and changing he changes the tune for us all the time and we follow along\nAnd we have to stop allowing that to happen and stay on topic whatever the topic is whether it's you know voter fraud voter suppression guns you know health care whatever it is we can't see we're so ADD as a society that we can't seem to stay on any one topic long enough to actually come up with a solution\n\nAnd I said the suit on the other day on the air but I'm being advised all the time by experts in my field and talk radio to talk about what everybody else is talking about 'cause that's what a hot topic and that's what people want to talk about but if I Do the same thing and follow the leader\nThen nothing ever gets done so I have to resist I think sometimes\nThe urge to go down that bunny trail of that the Trump tweets um and to stay on message because I Do think there are real issues including by the way in our state of Georgia voter suppression because\nThat is a major issue and we are now oh just less than one day less than a week away from\nVoting and there are new stories bubbling up about voter suppression by one of the two candidates running for office\nAnd we're not talking about it now in fairness the stories that are making big news deserve to be heard and so I don't want to take anything away from those also very very important topics\nUm\nBut let's take this the same discussion of voter suppression or voter fraud look if you believe there's voter fraud than we need to examine that too I don't believe that I feel like the statistics don't back that up but if that's what you believe that we should at least have that conversation\nUm there is evidence of voter suppression regardless the same thing is going to happen we're going to get through the election we're going to have a new governor\nA and we're going to stop talking about voter fraud and voter suppression and we cannot do that\nWe need you insist that the laws be change that the gerrymandering stop that the law goes away that's allowing some of this nonsense to happen right now or we're going to get into this and lots of other stuff right here on the ... up next we've got Alison ... Goodman joining us from uh\nThe Anti Defamation league we'll be right back [noise]\n... coming up on TALK radio six boarding do when you're on TALK radio six forty double new geo Steve\nOn Saturday is anti Semitism in is moving from the margins to the mainstream in just alarming ways that we all need to stand up together and said this is not okay\nYou know and I think I think you bring up an interesting point do 'em and yes we do need our leaders to lead both ... you know at every level whether it's mayors governors student body presidents whatever it is but I also think um that there is\nYou know Nick and I talk about this as it relates to other issues that there is also end up as individuals you know if you hear somebody saying something that you disagree with 'em or that you think is you know bullying anti Semitic\nYou know a anti whatever it is oh gee beat the queue or you know that's a you know\nSlut shaming or what is right that you need to save your buddies\nDude no absolutely and actually those words that's what we tell kids when we're doing these trainings if you don't know the whole history of anti Semitism or about\nAlgae B. T. Q. discrimination you can always say what you're saying makes me uncomfortable right so you need to stand up and speak out because those are the people that are going to listen to you actually take it seriously and do something\nThat just a dude no right I mean you know it's that simple to some extent like that it's not okay well I think is not okay\nAnd you have to speak up at those lower levels so it doesn't escalate friend people don't think that that kind of behavior and that kind of language\nAnd that kind of action is tolerated and so we ... we're going to constantly speak truth to power we're going to constantly call it out when we see it but we need everybody to do this right um so here in Atlanta there are number of community vigils over the next twenty four hours there have been tons we've been getting\nJust outpouring of support and solidarity from our Jewish and non Jewish partners\nAnd this is the time for people to come together and say this is not who we are\nYeah ah we were talking about that too you know unfortunately as as humans as a species it is who we are which is terrible as individuals it's not right I mean there's many many many most people are not this yeah um but unfortunately we for some reason continue to foster\nUm groups like this and people like us who feel this way and get away with it and in horrible ways like we saw\nUm before I let you go Allison from a security standpoint you know the president suggested that\nSynagogues and churches and mosques should all be armed and that's you know one solution uh obviously that's not one that I agree with but you know do we what do we do do we lock the door you we put ... ... what do you do about all\nThe Jewish community here in Atlanta and across the country we take security seriously we always has it and we're always will yeah\nUm and I actually I think all houses a face take security very seriously and it's something they should keep doing they should keep working with their law enforcement partners they should keep building those relationships\nAnd they should keep opening their doors to the community and letting people kind of see the truth about what's inside the Comey vigils that are happening in this community which you can anyone can attend I mean they are beautiful manifestations of people coming together from all sides and saying this is not who we are\nYeah and uh I guess we'll just end with that and the idea that um you also should vote yeah\nBecause if you don't like what's happening one way to change it has to change some laws uh and vote so I'm speak up here it's not OK and go to the go to the polls and vote Alison video game and thank you so much for giving us some insight or ALS and again with the ah Anti Defamation like the idea\nWe will post a link to them and all the visuals that are here in town as well as city in America will be right back\nMore Green Beret ... coming up long talk radio six forty WG a St\n\nLouis ... twenty eight presented by capital what happens on December ... the former arena story Shaun would you feel\nTo get the wrong way [laughter] and yours ... twenty eight presented capital one of\nThe ... back to the dean of average here on global down the street [noise]\nRight you know why we're getting deep and here\nFeel like we might as well just go all the way\nAnd get to see if we can get a because you know we're talking obviously about the aftermath of the mass\nShooting in Pittsburgh as well as um the package bombs that were sent to I think there were at least Fifteen package bombs now that have been found\nA I don't know if today's was the fifteenth I think that's correct with one found today here in Atlanta a with a CNN address on it here in Atlanta but of course it went to a a male sorting facility because all CNN mail is now being sort of quick first and scanned and searched and all of that\nUm [noise] but one\nOf the things that the president had to set aside from that we should arm guards in religious\nPlaces of worship or he also uh had another thought he suggested when asked uh he he suggested when asked what we could do to end the violence that maybe the death penalty was the way we look\nI think one thing we should do is sit for an up our laws are germs dust settle\nWhen people do this as you get the death penalty\nOr they should not have to wait ... years and years good everybody that does the thing like this the innocent people veterans temple or a church they should really suffer the ultimate price they should say the ultimate prize\nAll right my liberal friends are not going to believe this but I actually agree with that I\nActually am okay with the death penalty not necessarily as it stands right now I'm because it it has shown to be\nIt has been shown to be racially unfair\nI'm In a way it's being implemented but as a punishment I don't necessarily have a problem with having the death penalty as a punishment for the worst crimes um again that does not mean that I'm okay with how it's being implemented right now because I'm not um but\nThe problem is one thing we do know is certainly the way it's being implemented right now a it is not a deterrent and to some extent what the president\nWas getting to there and he did get to it we just didn't pull the whole thing because why you know what he sounds like um but he was getting to the fact that it should be faster also that you shouldn't get the death penalty and then be you know years and years and years ten years goes by of appeals and by the time you're executed ... nobody even remember what the crime was anymore\nThat's part of the reason it's not a deterrent in fairness he's not wrong about that um but given that it is not a deterrent and by the way there is the death penalty I'm available in a case like what happened in Pittsburgh so it most likely will be a death penalty case um\nBut that's a whole other debate also and I I don't know I think given me look there's a lot of problems with our justice system a lot [noise]\nStay with us it'll be like a game to see if we get them or we don't sit there and sample\nOr Lena marriage shows coming up on TALK radio six forty WG
