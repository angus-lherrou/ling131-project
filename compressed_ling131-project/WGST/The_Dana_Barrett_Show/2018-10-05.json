joining us on the phone he is the c._e._o. high times Adam how are you\nYourself and I I Am very excited to you have you on the phone because now I can get out all of my ridiculous references to like wacky weed and all my outdated African I'm old and we just have\nSo many of them we could go on for ever I've\nMaybe we should make a regular segment where we just go through all of the ah sound like you know I don't know much about high times company can you give me kind of a brief overview\nYeah or or ... or ... or a magazine or a multimedia company and or licensing brand I mean you know we're\nA playboy of candidates and you know everyone knows high times when you think about the different a vertical as we could be in today in today's world um it's a it's it's limitless you know there's like fields and stream stores up and then I'll flip the Atlanta area and that was the magazine so [noise]\nI'm sure everyone can imagine different types of products that we could come up with another friend as well\nYes I think a magic nations are running wild as we speak luck I think a lot of people to your point now without the magazine ... but not everybody I think realize all the things that you already have going on with events and\nUh and some of the brand licensing and all that which is why I wanted you to to talk about it a little bit and I do think I mean getting away from the subject matter of the magazine for just a second and from everything you do I think that what you guys are doing something really print publications need to be thinking about I just like almost everybody needs to start thinking outside the box because\nYou know obviously print is not it's multi media nowadays it is a man's suit is in person things it is brand licensing and so\nUm is that something as a company that you guys sort of always knew you needed to do or or is that was that sort of a last minute like oh we got to get ahead of this\nUm I think I think it was like I think you know listen uh we came in I came in with the new investment group about last sometime last year in March last year\nAnd we've definitely puts them at all the metal and started through some chairs on the fire and say hey let's look outside do things a little differently they're fairly ahead of the times and it's you know there are one of the first five thousand domains ever registered so high times dot com has like\nOlder than you that's awesome man you know like when you look\nAt who who would've ever thought of that they were smoking the right stuff\nThey were smoking what they were real and as\nThey shrunk and what they're printing are rolling it sucks\nUp a business\nGrowth and all of that I Know one of the things I'm you guys just said recently it was purchased joke magazines so they're also graced by acquisition\nYes we've done this was er or its acquisition early on in the last year and uh we definitely believe in growing organically but we've been adding other plans to our family and friends and you know\nBusiness term you use also has like a do reference that you're growing again so [laughter] I Love it so how\nIs joke magazine from high times content wise\nSo it it's got its own set of users and consumers differentiated in that it's it's definitely a reach its you know half of the magazines regional so there's different locations that are that they distribute the magazine and currently and again they're offering\nEvents as well and smaller events that high times you know you can go on and we'll know team to fifty thousand people at a rope a dope events or you know three to four thousand smaller market\nStoned reds when the eyes and there'll be whole area seeing\nLike give me the Doritos [laughter]\nIt there is what is this cool ranch thing you speak of oh you're so close that I'm speaking of Mitch McConnell I just got to let you know and you did talk about him\nDoing whatever it is you might want him to do him right this minute a protesters are throwing a keg or outside McConnell's house yeah I'm not making that up it's it's right out of the headlines\nA they have cans of ... blue ribbon beer signs with Kavanaugh's fraternity letters on them they're wearing sunglasses and straw hats and I'm Talking about drunk and justice\nIn the morning and uh yeah I mean I Can't right outside Mitch McConnell's house that is amazing welcome to America circuit\nTwenty teens and then I got high you know because what else could you damn I'm listening some good news\nUh some more good news we shall say for the economy the ah US unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine that is incredible uh I Am sure if it hasn't already the president is probably tweeting about that or will be shortly\nA in a bragging dishes way I'm sure\nA it's great news I was watching\nSome reports about it though and it's kind of interesting because some simple things can really impact the number\nFor example um and by the way it's relatively like it it ... it has has dropped to a very low number but the job growth rate the number of new jobs added this month which cause they come out with this report every month\nAnd so the number of new jobs added this month actually fell short of expectations so there were supposed to be about a hundred and eighty thousand new jobs added a in September and there were only a hundred and thirty four thousand new jobs added so that's a fairly significant number\nA of a shortage there but overall the rate of unemployment still really really good but when I was watching the evaluation of is one of the reasons they say that the a number of new jobs added wasn't as good as it could have been with some of that the storm some of the the hurricanes\nAre caused people to you know it'd be out of work lose jobs and and now and companies who had problems not to be able to create new jobs and that actually was a very bad last year in hurricane season so you when you look at the calendar it's not you're not just looking at financial growth and vacuum and you're looking at financial growth and job growth\nA all within you know the bigger picture with whatever's happening in the country whether it's elections or whether a or trade wars or whatever it is and so um it's hard sometimes also to look at all those numbers\nOn and not and get a real picture unless you are an economist doing a study because one of the other fascinating things\nAbout some of the new jobs\nAre created a large percentage of those new jobs created that hundred and thirty four thousand a jobs were in high a income jobs are in a technology in health care uh\nAnd that some in manufacturing so those are generally speaking higher paying jobs so of course there are by the way still I Believe about six million people who are unemployed in this country\nWho are probably looking for lower wage jobs were less skills are needed and I can't get them\nA so that's another whole interesting subject because honestly six million people you know based on the side of the country it's not that bad but if you're one of them it's feels just as bad to you whether you're one of six million or one thirty million right that that you're still without a job\n[noise] the only thing that still feel very personal I think to each of us is how much money we're bringing home and what we can afford\nAnd and so I was trying to get my head around the wage growth numbers which\nHaven't been as good as they could be or have been in the past or they're terrible but they're not great so wage while unemployment is down to what it is a three point nine three point seven three point seven percent\nA wage growth is up to point seven percent I Believe it's either two points to her and she pointed I forget\nUm and so that's better than being totally flat ah or going down um or is it because again\nYou have to put it in contact still in the past when unemployment has been close to the slow so I don't want to go all the way back to Nineteen sixty nine if you go back a before the recession when unemployment was lower\nWage growth was closer to four percent so generally speaking the lower unemployment as the higher wage growth as percentage wise and that isn't really happening right\nNow and then if you add to that um inflation and the cost of\nConsumer purchases that are out there it's a the consumer I think it's one of the consumer purchase index something like that\nUm\nIf you look at the cost of inflation and you compare that to the wage growth you actually end up at a net kind of flatten is a net zero kind of and the reason why is because right now\nWhere we're at and twenty Eighteen as we've had it let's say it's a to point seven percent wage increase we've I had a two point eight percent inflation increase so gas prices are higher groceries or higher rents are higher ah insurance costs are higher a health insurance costs are significantly higher right and so\nAll of those things what what that means is essentially we are we have point one percent less money to spend even though our wage wages have gone up the prices of everything we buy has also gone up so that is something I think Americans feel\nMore realistically\nYou know we're not able to put as much money away and savings ... it gets a little tighter we don't have as much money to spend on Christmas which is coming who to believe it already but the being already in October\nRight and so those are the things we feel so it's interesting because we sit there and watch the news and were told to celebrate unemployment is at an all time low the market is doing phenomena our economy is in great shape we hear it over and over again\nBut then we go to the mall and we're like wait a second I Can't I don't have enough money to buy this or they go to the grocery store and we're like my bank accounts kind of low I guess I I'll buy the generic peanut butter this week you know and so\n[noise] um I think that not because I Want to take the wind out of the good economy sales because I Do think overall the economy as good an unemployment being that lo is phenomenal however we need wage growth to do better and part of what worries me about this are part of what this gets me thinking and again\nHashtags I'm not an economist I'm\nI Wonder if what's happening is good for the\nWealthy and good for companies but not necessarily good for the middle class a and good for the average Joe and that is the question so the economy is great the market as great a job numbers are or where they are who is that really good for\nIsn't really good for the average American where we are right now all of it where we are right now yeah I mean if you're a four oh one K. and strong that's great if you have a four O. one K.\nYou know if you're not at a job where you have one of those then you know you don't have money if you're not somebody who has money to invest and it doesn't help you that much if\nYou're somebody in this country has for example a lot of credit card debt which huh I'm raising my hand you can't see that 'cause we're on the radio but it's up there if you have a lot of credit card debt guess what ah\nInterest rates are going up on those because\nWe're in we're in a good economic time that means inflation is happening interest rates go up the feds just raised rates your credit card rates go up that means it's harder for you to get out of debt so if you're somebody who has debt and not a lot of savings and not a lot of four one K. than a green economy doesn't hurt doesn't help you all that much\nSo yeah you have a job and that's something it's something it's certainly better than not having a job again I don't mean to take anything away from that however I think there is a bigger picture here and I do think we need to push harder a on our companies to share the wealth\nAnd to push some of the great profits\nTo the to the workers um you know Amazon just raised their minimum wage to Fifteen dollars that's great\nUm\nAnd they even said that their workers in order to make that happen they did take some benefits away from work or so they raised the wage to Fifteen dollars an hour and took away some of the bonus thing that was happening and some of the ah stock incentive options of things where they could buy stock if they wanted a way but the workers have said\nWe would rather have the security of a steady paycheck of of that Fifteen dollar an hour\nMinimum wage than the potential to buy some stock that might make us rich leader or might not uh we can't pay the bills with that and so I think that is how a lot of Americans feel just raise my salary already stop with the bonuses um\nI'm Glad you got a tax break Mr corporate CEO\nWhere's my tax break so pass that on down to me\nYou know um so I think well you know again I think we should celebrate a good economy I think the job the unemployment being re raping what it is great news um but also I think we need to dig as always a little bit deeper a little bit past the headline and and and actually also look at our own financial situations with a\nYou know with sharp eyes you know really look and see how they all where where are your numbers how're you doing I'm and take that by the way to the voting booth and not just what the headline sell you a\nNever going to take a short break but we'll be back with an hour or two that will blow your socks off we'll be back [noise]\nAnd here is what she said this is a quote from her she says I don't have a statement right now because I did not come to a decision on this until walking\nA into the floor this morning I've been wrestling to really to know what's fair and what's right and the truth is that none of this has been fair this hasn't been fair to the judge but I also recognize that we need to have institutions that are viewed as fair\nAnd if people who are victims if people who feel there is no fairness in our system of government particularly within our courts\nA then we've gone down a path that is not good and write for this country and so I've been wrestling\nWith a whether or not this was about the qualifications of a good man or is this bigger than the nominee and I believe this is again I'm reading a quote from Lisa Murkowski I Believe we are dealing with issues right now that are bigger than a nominee\nAnd how we ensure that our institutions not only the legislative branch but our judicial branch continue to be respected\nThat is what I have been wrestling with so there you go and it's a little bit of what she had to say that statement is actually a quite a bit longer than that um\n[noise] oh that is hugely important and I but it you know last hour I was sort of doing a a tirade she well let me just say that I lost it a little bit a little bit I'm\nFrankly that's as bad as I ever lose that we're in good shape but uh I was talking about the words public service and now I'm going to talk about the words good man\nBecause uh that's part of what Lisa Murkowski said there I Believe the judge is a good man\nAnd um this is something I struggle with my whole life by the way um I used to always say that about I don't know how personal should get here but let's just say a family member\nAnd I would say this person is acting badly but they're a good person and I would say that all the time but you know I don't think they do they mean it you know there are a good person or a good person and I would say it over and over again\nAnd in defense of this member of my family close member of my family and finally I'm as I have gotten older I came to the conclusion maybe two years ago or something like that that if your actions are not good\nIt doesn't really matter all that ... much what your intentions are and that you have to be judged by your actions and I stopped defending that person\nMy family saying they were a good person and I sort of come to realize that they're really not such a good person\nDoes that mean that person in my family is evil no\nUm does that mean that they can't be forgiven in the eyes of God no does that mean that they can't be forgiven by the people they've done wrong you know but it doesn't make you a good person if all of your actions are back\nI'm not saying all Brett Kavanaugh's actions are bad but I'm saying his behavior last this past week haven't been greater last week and potential his behavior in high school and college also not great um to just keep at all in mind because we're judged on the fullness of our life not just one part I think America will be right back [noise]\n\n\nJoined us for the old timers association walked ... to register for an event near you together we can handle [noise]\nWas on par with expectations ringing of twenty three million audiences also have an a minus cinema score average predicted that for the show with about Seventy million by the time of leaves theater\nLast week ... the house with a clock in his ... and number three ... million to ... forty four million which is just above it just made it forty two million dollar budget [noise]\nA symbol favors walked in and fourth place with six million renewed a total of forty three million a month or two here on W [noise]\nBut let's not forget\nIt's gonna be a stressful weekend because we do have the votes coming in tomorrow or on the Senate floor so um I mean I think we know how it's going to go\nBut it's nonetheless I think it's going to be a [noise]\nGoing to be a nail biter watching it even though we kind of know how it's going to go you know\nIt's like watching your team and the super bowl when you know they'll probably going to lose but you know you hope for the best\nThan it was that still too soon to other [laughter] well it's like right now I'm watching the Braves and the playoffs and yeah no that's good and it doesn't mean I'm not up there cheering\nRight we they're hoping probably against hope that something may be different from what I write surprise me please God surprised by the right\nPlace um listen you gotta have some\nFun with some of the stuff and there's always there's always more and more and more to have fun with 'em so let's go a little let's just do a little cold there moment because Steven Kobe or of course this is from last night so this was before a lot of today's nonsense a went on\nBut he was talking about uh the FBI investigation and had this to say\nDemocrats say that the report is lacking in a report [laughter]\nThe one thing the sexual assaults of the cameras accused of also allegedly happened while he was hammer and he said under oath and it was never a big drinker or the White House the myth of the FBI didn't even investigate Kavanaugh's drinking what that's like investigating an arson and saying we're not really looking into the\nFire apart [noise] wondering how this building disappeared over here was the wizard of Oz did they use mirrors polling David Copperfield for questioning\nDisappear [laughter]\nYeah you gotta love and he was having fun last night just that was just a little tiny piece of it he was just having fun um but interestingly enough one of the other uh comedians who usually followed last was pretty serious last night um and that was Trevor Noah he\nWas talking about a Brazilian tromp and ah this idea that men have now become the true victims of all of this and take a listen\nTrump's most powerful tool\nIs that he knows how to wield victim and he knows how to off of victimhood\nTo people who have the ... which is really really powerful tool you realize what he's doing in that moment is he saying the real victims of the me too movement all men there's a real victims someone can accuse you anytime enjoy life is over there's a real victims and you know if\nYou if you were against him completely or if you see through when you go like oh that's nothing but I I think people take for granted how powerful that message was there a lot of men who that message will connect with\nIs now trying to say that the last year using anger\nI'm Sorry what the left or do you think it's called protest peaceful protests marching chanting that's what that's what that's called that they're doing\nJust in case you've never seen it before I'm President Trump himself has used bullying tactics and anger to get what he wants a Mm I think his entire life\nIn fact I think that might actually be the art of the deal is to just be a bully to just be as ruthless as you can possibly be\nAnd if that includes getting angry so be it\nI don't even understand how people are buying but there you go um\nFascinating to watch all of this go down I'm sad that it impacts that's the way that it does but I\n... before at a time and this I mean listen why don't you think the president has done and it's interesting because\nI I think he's very much use bully tactics on trade 'em but one could argue that maybe they're starting to work I mean we've got a lot to talk about and we'll probably get into this more next week about China and what's going on between China and the U.S right now because it really is a war of its own a it's a war of words it's a World Trade it's worth cyber it's a war\nUm but also you know with all of the uh the steel and aluminum tariffs and and the ... and all of the threats a deal did get made you know to redo NAFTA
