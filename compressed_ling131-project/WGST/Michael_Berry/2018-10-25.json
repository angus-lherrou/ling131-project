I get the hundred thousand back we might get a percentage a smaller percentage of it we might even get a bigger percentage of it and so we're still in that deal we're still making that\nThat income in that deal but we're able to use the money from the re fi\nGet into more details so our first year we were able to get into an apartment complexes will now we've had as many as like Seventeen complexes that were invested in and that's the churning effect of the re fi\nAre are selling and so we right now we own sixteen because we still one and that was the situation where we did what they call at ten thirty one exchange and that's where you had we had a complex and we tried it up\nAnd in this case we traded up to two more complex as\nWell okay so let's say we put a hundred thousand in that first um\nApartment complex there's an investment well we had an equity gang of Seventy one percent so when we sold that first complex and tried it up and to to\nMore complex because we had now a hundred and Seventy one thousand to invest and we didn't really even have to put a penny into the deal that we handed over it was already in there\nWe went from a complex to close to two hundred thousand too too complex which total about um\nA five hundred unit I think I did two hundred thousand we went from a complex with two hundred units too too complex but equal five hundred unit and so what that means there's the cash flow increases and um we changed like\nIt was a on one of them the occupancy was eighty three percent and the late investors gotten that up to Ninety three percent and then on the other complex that we traded into\nWe found out that oracle was moving within a half mile of our investment and they were bringing in five thousand employees\nSo it's it's just been great were start sided about\n\nLeo and what is it done for you know how is it has it changed your life what are you doing day to day now that you weren't doing before\n... you know funny or just the other day I remember about it and it was a way or the or order and\nThat was maybe about ... park after I'd gotten up at eight thirty and started getting up but you know six o'clock Wal Mart and I'm a bus and I'm like\nOr you know why they ... thought for you know go get death but here I Am\nBut not ... or ... ... ... ... ... they'll get gasoline I'd do it I Want I Want when we're ... and I thought you know and I bought my swimming certain power go swim and reform or half a mile\nA I'm a ... a comeback and then you know and then there's a really they\nOffer ... or ... or ... or at least on the Internet you can look up for more than ... and stuff and um and then also what you are a lot going back and talk and call and we'll leave investor and bought a no\nVote right so you you're willing to do it on and we are right you can do all the things that you love but you're not responsible for making those deals go down that is wonderful thank you so much for joining me today\nToday shows come to an end fortunately you can find that do on the radio show on the air every day of the week and enjoy our podcasts at Dell on the radio dot com until next time this is Len borough thank you for listening and remember it's not the money it's a lifestyle [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYou know my\n\nIt was really really enjoy your John [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThe information and opinions you hear on the ... radio show or those with the host el ... has gas and his colors and do not necessarily reflect\nThe opinions at this station its affiliates management or advertisers the ... show is for entertainment purposes only police consulted professional regarding your personal investment needs nothing presented on the Dell lumps le show constitutes an endorsement recommendation offer solicitation to buy or sell any product or security\nTalk radio six forty WG a ... three ...\nAnd I'm enjoying the highest approval rating\nOf his presidency\nForty seven percent is three points higher than Morocco Obama's approval rating ahead of the two thousand ten midterms now attentive listeners probably know well Michael that's not saying much\nObama was slaughtered in the midterms you're right\nHe was I don't think Republicans will be in the election that really has already been done the media likes to refer to the November ... election day but actually we've already begun voting\nAnd early voting according to NBC News as reported by political polls Arizona's early voting reflects forty four percent Republican thirty three percent Democrat\nIn a race where they're showing only ... percent or two or three between Republican Martha ... Sally and Christian cinema you gotta wonder what would it take for Arizona Democrats to cut loose of cinema after the awful things she has said\nIncluding how horrible Arizona is a meth lab of democracy how the state of Arizona's like Lindsey low hand it's in the news but for only the wrong reasons\nHow she doesn't see any problem in an American wants to go and join the Taliban apparently ... us some under pagan rituals\nA bit of a nut but the Democrats will still vote for never the last Republican over Democrat as a party preference in that race\nAt forty four thirty three according to the pole as reported by NBC News not exactly a conservative outlets Florida at forty four thirty eight\nIn the midst of a very very tough race race there between the scientists and Gillum Gillum is nothing short of a nut himself\nBut at the same just doesn't seem to be able to put any distance in between him I think President Trump will probably would have been a time or two more between now and election day\nIn Georgia Republicans up fifty two forty three the governor's race there would appear to be closer than that but I'm hopeful Republicans can win that one as well in the state of Arizona the sorry state of Indiana where Joe Donnelly\nI think it's going to be punished for his role in the Kavanaugh hearings Republicans at fifty one percent\nTrailing by about five percentage points there Montana forty eight percent Republican to twenty nine percent Democrat Tennessee Republicans sixty three percent Democrats at thirty\nAnd Marsha Blackburn would appear to have started putting some distance and between herself and the Democrat challenger\nState of Texas pure party preference fifty three percent the forty three percent newest round of polls has cruise beginning to widen his lead over ... and his yard signs\nTroubling for Republicans would be the state of Nevada which are showing thirty eight percent Republican to forty five percent Democrat the Democrat Democrat gubernatorial candidate they're having some problems with an ex accusing him of violence\nBut all in all are Republicans appear to be doing pretty darn well for themselves across the country even in some congressional races in California where you would least expected Republican has pulled ahead of Joe mansion in West Virginia in polls polls don't vote remember that\nBut you'd rather be ahead than behind Wisconsin where the president had a rally yesterday would appear to be a highly winnable Senate seat over an income but Tammy Baldwin\nIn North Dakota the Republican has extended the lead sixteen percentage point lead in the polls over Heidi Heitkamp whose latest round of problems include that she published a full page ad of suppose it's sexual assault victims\nAnd those sexual assault victims did not give her approval to do so and called her out on it it got so bad I Can't follow it up her full page ad exposing those women\nA quarter page ad apologizing ... that's like how the a correction to an erroneous story appears on page eight where the erroneous story was on page one remote who was it again who said\nAlly can get halfway around the world before the truth can get his

restaurants for certain soup or hot cocoa or whatever it is\nThat you do or you might enjoy that discussion\nIt's posted to the pod cast as all of our shows are about Fifteen twenty minutes after\nWe go off the air so our eight to eleven AM program this morning is posted to the podcast if when we're through this evening you'd like to listen to that again that's at Michael berry\nDot com is free and its commercial free Daryl\nIn common road Europe [noise] Michael\nIn regards to the legal um alien invasion coming up from Honduras and Mexico ... there was a very effective way with regard to my government\nAnd it doesn't involve us falling into the trap a bad optics of truth so much for us troops so much of breathing on an illegal immigrant that the mainstream media is you know already cutting their cameras up for\nThe first one is\nThe first idea if the international watering boundary commission ... Mexican Government off of it take control of the Rio Grande and threatened to cut off or water\nIt won't cut it won't cause them any immediate arm because it's so wet right now but all the citrus growers on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande will start getting real darn nervous\nThe second idea is a ... which is the Mexico ... in the Mexican nationalized oil company\nI think it's now the other juvenile some X but yeah yeah but\nOkay they own a fifty percent stake in that show refinery on the board of Houston and they bring my and heavy crude\nUp there haven't refined and then show so I'm get refined product so why don't we see that refined product and put it in the gas tanks of all these vehicles and planes and whatnot\nIt's going to be used to provide services and deal with their citizens\nDarryl while I appreciate your frustration with the caravan and the seeming unwillingness of our neighbors to the south to handle their own responsibility\nI Am not in favor of seizing assets of foreign or domestic interests that will have a chilling effect on the investment that comes into this country that is that the core\nOf our wealth creation we don't want to get into the business of government seizing assets willy nilly and why are we going to seize assets\nOf financial interests over five to ten thousand migrants on march we'd find ourselves seizing assets quite a bit in fact I'm with Rand Paul on the issue that we need to stop seizing so many things we can\nSkate people's money we we take their funds on the basis that they're supposedly in drug deals are in the car tail or a terrorist or whatever else they're all sorts of Americans innocently having their cash seized at airports or various checkpoints throughout this country that they never get back\nSo no I won't be for that this is not very difficult for every one of you who has been a parent or who once had one you've probably use the following line you can do what you want when you're out on your own but as long\nAs you're living under my roof and I'm paying your bills then you're not going to fill in the blank\nVery simple concept every parent is used it and every one of us as a young person hurt our parents tell us that you don't get to do what you want to do as long as the parent is paying the bills and you're living under the that roof\n[noise] Trump buried cleverly said the Guatemalans if you don't stop these Hondurans from coming up here\nAnd we're going to simply freeze the one point six billion dollars you receive that's not so difficult you could do that to Mexico you could do that to Guatemala you could do it to Honduras this is not a problem that should require the United states military now I may eventually because the crap rolls downhill\nThis is not a problem that we should have to be calling in to talk radio with clever ways to deal with\nIt should not require minutemen national\nGuard troops military troops are the seizure of assets\nIt's a problem that other governments need to solve\nAnd if they can't solve it we should use our diplomatic ties there's a reason we have embassies there's a reason we spend so much on the state department there is a region reason we expand so many there's so much of our resources maintaining diplomatic ties\nThe flow of funds from the United states in two countries for humanitarian aid and commercial interests sustains those countries they can't survive without us\nYou simply freeze that for a brief period of time and it won't take long until the Guatemalans\nHave to get down to the dirty business of dealing with a mass of people it's unpleasant the Mexicans don't want to do it the Guatemalans don't want to do it the Hondurans don't want to do it there are clearly outside interest imagine if you would somewhere between five and ten thousand people who\nJust think about that I'm not being sillier funnier or try to think about this for a moment it's not a cheeky comment necessarily ten thousand people taking a dump anywhere imagine what a public health hazard that is\nThe reality is many of these people are carrying disease some of that airborne\nOn the a ... on the top of poop\nHell you can't find a place for ten thousand people to take a dump and an outdoor festival\nHow's that me and coordinated\nThat's dangerous that's a public health scare\nThat alone who's providing water you don't do these things accidentally you don't do these things are in an improvised spontaneous met a man or find out who's doing this and stop them\nAnd make the government's along
