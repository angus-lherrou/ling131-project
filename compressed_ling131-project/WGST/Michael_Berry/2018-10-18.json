St\nLouis ... twenty eight presented by capital what happened on December ... to this day for Maria story\nWrong and yours and be more limited twenty eight presented capital one\nWish [laughter] I don't know what I'm saying\nWe're back with the ... radio show this is Len wrote was successful real estate investor and lifestyles unlimited single family mentor Laurie fond to know and today we've been working on your financial freedom during our conversation about creating wealth and passive income\nThrough real estate investing which allows you to live where you want and invest where you want to invest where it makes sense so Laurie we've come to the end of the hour and I knew we could go on forever about this but can you give us some some final thoughts on this for people who are\nYou know either they're real estate investors and they need to find a better way because they're either like you said at the beginning of the show there\nThey're focused on appreciation instead of focusing on the fundamentals of the real estate investment business that requires cash flow or they're thinking about getting started because what they're doing right now does it work and they see the need for a change\nYeah well one of the other thing I Would recommend is of course in the in the last like that I mentioned all they're doing the due diligence on an area and the property that you can Google lots of things and do research on that whole\nBut this isn't the low ... will uh endeavor and you need to have a team but one of the most important thing I Would think that you really need to have it as a mentor\nThem when you can actually physically equal only books you can read over the articles you will do all the reports you want in the world but it last year talking live an hour in question because many times do you ask a question to a real life person who's been there done that and followed the model that ally\nThey time she'll ask one question they'll have three or four answers or ... ... followed\nSo I I think it's really important to get plugged in someone who has been been successful at the end up over there again they'll hold you accountable when you go off track and they'll also\nSave your money by mistake and they'll all they'll make money by following the model so many times I Know with lifestyle we talk about a millionaire like that in in a ... a middle class or or working employee mentality\nAnd one of the things that we don't then time learning from other people out there and find someone\nWho's already been successful at it don't reinvent the wheel and follow that model that take care of many of them like in in the meantime though really when you got a good mentor you're taking care of them\nAnd following that\nThat's that's really good insight worry because there's a whole [noise]\nI don't know how I I Want to call it a cult that there's a whole culture that's grown up around this idea of make as many mistakes as possible as rapidly as possible so you can get to the success on the other side and the issue with that is that our resources are limited\nAnd one of the most important resources we have is time our time is limited for most of us where you know in our forties or fifties and sixties or seventies and and we haven't secured our retirement yet\nAt some summer younger we have members who come in in their thirties and they get set up perfectly for retirement and by the time they're in their late thirties they're they're doing their world\nTravels and and um and you're going to pick the kids up from school every day and and they really are stepping into the lifestyle that had their parents could only dream of\nBut for for many of us we are looking at what we have done and like wow you know I've been successful by every measure of the world I've been successful in my career I've been successful in my life\nAnd yet I Am not prepared to have their retirement that I Want and so they they have to look at change they have to look at being responsible for that and so do you really want to look at it than\nJust going out there and trying things to see if they work when the clock is ticking away and your money is taking away so that that's how I look at it\nAnd what defines success we we talk about being successful at our career\nSuccessful and re war our family that well but it's all about revolt all we actually the living the life that we want to live we might have said that milestone and that mile marker\nWe're accomplishing something but did it get a result we ... we really focused on and when you've got the part that the income it allows you to go go out there\nAnd do the thing in life they want to do\nIt so it's not about earning more money\nIt's about living the life that want an ... your time today that you're absolutely right time as a a a limited brings forth and if we spend all our time learning what doesn't work or we ever get around to learn what does\nAnd we might but it could take years to do I do go out and find a model if like I'm so fortunate that I had mentors and that's why I Love that when people right now is because someone gave all of the park and I want to share that with other people\nYeah it it really does it the thankful that really does inspire you to just turn around and how many people as you can and and it's living the life that is\nThat creates the satisfaction or the other thing that many of us have done is is we followed we followed the map that that friends or family established for us when we were young we wanted to make them proud of us we figured they know what's best for us and then as\nWe get older we realized that we followed them pass it really weren't our pets there was somebody else's path and they haven't led to our own happiness and\nI I I think you and I both stand as examples of hope for turning that around\nAnd you you follow what you do the best that you can with the resources that you can and what we're saying is there's other resources out there there's people who will share and will help\nAnd they will will help you to do this we you know we are single family an apartment community by on hold investors and if that's what you want to do and the things that you've heard don't talk about talk about life talk about real estate\nAnd that's the path that you want to follow then you should you should follow people who have successfully done that and that's the mantra that you're looking for whatever you want to do in life find somebody who was done it the way you want to do it and been successful and who's willing now\nBecause they're grateful for what they have to turn back and pass and not back to you\nLorrie thank you so much for joining me today we are at the end of the ...\nYour show for

a landslide he said I didn't get the right time and it's hard to know how to do that\nBut I'm going to tell you\nRepublicans are peaking at just the right time\nAnd it is a\nIt is exciting to see I'm gonna I'm gonna to I'm going to give you an example here so the house five thirty eight which is\nOne of the well respected polling shops but they've been wrong before yesterday gave an eighty three point nine percent so eighty four percent chance\nFive and six chance that the Democrats take the house I had somebody asked me at lunch that well what does that mean what does it what what is it what is the effect of that happening\nAnd I said well\nIt means that President Trump will spend the next two years\nBeing in\nBeing locked in a war with the house of representatives it means congressional committees it means every resource they have\nTying up President Trump it means you'll still get your Supreme Court justices through but it Means Committee hearings it means dominating the news cycle\nIt means that for two years he can't get the appropriations the money he needs for anything that's what it means and it's not good\nAnd it's why we have got to when I'm endorsing John Culberson a Republican congressmen here in the seventh congressional district over the years I have been hard on John Culberson when I didn't think he was being sufficiently conservative\nBut I'm telling you I Am going to work to help him win because if he wins it means the Democrats don't get that vote for Nancy Pelosi and it is easy to forget\nHow bad it was in this country with Nancy Pelosi as speaker of our house and that is exactly what would happen\nI Do not want Nancy Pelosi and her ilk Sheila Jackson Lee and ally\nRunning the house of representatives and that's what happens if Lizzie Fletcher

[noise]\n[noise] the projection with the Democrats\nYou get really scary another day\nAnother Democrat assaults Republican the female campaign manager for Nevada is Republican gubernatorial candidate and a black salt was assaulted by Mike Stark\nAn operative with the George Soros funded America twenty first century bridge\nOn Tuesday [noise] stark fifty was arrested by lost mega city marshals Tuesday evening after thirty one year old Kristen Davis and said he grabbed and twisted her arm refusing to let go\nShe told Fox News this man was physically almost body checking me I was getting nervous for my safety so we left in went into an open room she said stark tried to follow her and the gubernatorial candidate or lack so and the other staffers into the second round\nHe grabbed my right arm my leg was lodged between the door in the wall the twisted my arm and can tournament behind my back\nI was scared Everytime I Try and pulling away you would grab tighter will be closer to him ever since that start pulled her head into his chest ruining our neck and held are there for several minutes she said it felt like an hour\nShe said she was scared screaming stop you're hurting me Davis and said start Warren lack\nSo human it's working at saying quote and um there's only one way you can make this stop that really scared me she said\nAccording to the latest polls she's no longer up on Kevin daily on by thirty three percentage points she's only up on him by about fourteen but here's the problem\nShe doesn't crack forty percent\nReal clear politics average ... thirty eight point three to daily ... twenty four point seven\nSo whole lot of Californians who have not made up their minds and probably won't until election day\nSo that means that only about sixty two sixty three sixty four percent less than two thirds fewer than two thirds of Californians have made up their minds\nI Will tell you Twenty years in politics and reading polls\nIncumbents tend to peak in the early polls because their name id is that close to a hundred percent everybody knows who they are\nIf you see an incumbent in an early poll with a high name id Ninety percent or above\nBut doesn't approach high numbers in terms of percentage of votes they're winning that is a signal that a credible candidate can potentially beat them\nWith Feinstein she's widely known she's been the senator of California for four hundred years so they know who she is\nAnd yet they're not saying they're going to vote for her now they're not saying they're going to vote\nHer opposition either and he's a Democrat far more liberal than she is but if they're not willing to commit to her it means they are willing to consider an\nAlternative and that's a third of the voters who are willing to consider an alternative so if you got thirty six percent still out there floating\nIn your ... twenty five percent you've got to win twenty five thirty six which means you gotta you gotta win two thirds of the remaining voters\nBut it's possible it's not crazy because they're not with are already\nThe polling was not even on likely voters it was on adults and registered voters survey usa interviewed twelve hundred California adults from friday through Sunday\nSo any work that she may have done during the Kavanaugh hearing to bolster her her image\nWhich was what most of us thought she was doing was simply\nTrying to build her members she didn't want that fight she wasn't in the Kavanaugh fight her heart wasn't in it but she had to be if she wanted that Kavanaugh fight she would have started to fight earlier\nShe would have been more strategic about it now I suppose you could say well by waiting till the very end she got\nThe most bang for the buck most folks are suggesting that she's not the ones who actually made it public and I'm not convinced she'd necessarily wanted to make it public I think she had a pretty good sense that it might be a loser of an issue she was box into a corner\nDamned if she did and damned if she didn't\nBecause if she does it bring the Ford allegation forward when it showed up on her doorstep she was the one who found out about ... she catches heat\nBecause you sat on this you could have protected this woman who's a victim but does she does bring it forward which in effect is what happened\nNow it's hung around her neck she made a clown of herself she'd be clown her so\nShe ended up looking like a fool\nNo I don't know California fruits and nuts that are California Democrats I don't know in their minds if she came off looking better or worse for what she did 'cause I don't know how they I don't understand how people think\nBut out of twelve hundred adults that were polled from friday through Sunday nine hundred sixty four of them were registered to vote seven hundred sixty two had already voted\nOr we're likely to do so before November six this could get very very interesting\nMeanwhile in\nTexas well before we get to that meanwhile former vice presidential running mate Tim Kaine Democrat whose son has been arrested as a member of antifa is telling Democrats\nTo fight in the streets what we've got to do is fight in Congress fight in the court spy industry in spite online fight at the ballot box and now there's momentum to be able to do this and we're not afraid of the popular outcry we're energized ...\nOK\nOkay
