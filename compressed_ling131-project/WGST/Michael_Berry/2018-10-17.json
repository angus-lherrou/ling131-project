capital what happens on December ... the former arena story on\n\nAnd yours and be more limited single twenty eight presented by Capitol won the\nWar was the moon mission was\nWe're back with the Dell wants a radio show this is Len Merlin today we'd been working on your financial freedom during our conversation with Peggy in Leo and how they've distinguish some of the timeless life lessons that will help us succeed\nI'm from the ideas that we need to transform it into order to make our dreams and our desires of reality and so they grew up in entrepreneurial families ah Peggy grew up with some some belief systems about I'm being debt free very common in in some entrepreneurial families\nI'm Leo grew up with commercial real estate seeing the power of real estate but never really being taught the power of real estate\nAnd they both ended up in corporate jobs um and doing a variety of things Peggy made her way to the top and and retired pretty much when her her salary captain Leo had his own business\nBut didn't want to grow it any further it has to end at some point unless you just want to work in the business until the day you die unless you're going to create a huge team and then manage that team and it wasn't something we all wanted to do\nAnd so now with all this life experience they found themselves you know you know looking out on on the horizon and in uncharted territory and cast about a little bit and we're really looking for something in during something where they can find their place in the world where they could use the things they that they had learned\nAnd transform\nAll of that in to a great retirement living the life they wanted which didn't include managing people\n... working in a business right Leo I'm so tell us a little bit out\nAbout the results you've had you know you you joined lifestyles unlimited you've been members for a couple of years now and talk to us about how your life is now and what you're doing on a day to day basis as a result\nWhen I I Love it I mean we don't have to worry about fighting the traffic um we uh you know we office out of our homes um\nWe just have kind of a piece about it um the thing about it we have learned a skill set on how to invest in apartment complexes and I never dreamed I always thought if you were going to be a passive investor in an apartment that you had to be either an institutional investors are\nAre from the very wealthy family and we're not on a more small guys and actually we're in an apartment complex that you know almost like eight hundred unit I mean we're a tiny percentage fraction and the deal\nBut we've been able to get into that deal and and really I mean\nI think about if one of the got sick couldn't work or maybe both of us\nThat the money that we're making the passive income kids coming in so we don't have to worry about that because there's somebody leading the projects delayed investor which I think in the industry most firms column sponsor investors they're taking care of everything there\nThey're finding the apartment complex they're managing it are finding somebody to manager for them so we just have a certain case about us than we know we're we're going and and really\nAs we get into details and we briefed by\nUm that deal then that means that like let's say I'm just doing an arbitrary figure let's say we put a hundred thousand and\nWe might on a re fi get the hundred thousand back we might get a percentage a smaller percentage of it we might even get a bigger percentage of it and so we're still in that deal we're still making that\nThat income in that bill but we're able to use the money from the re fi to get into more deals\nSo our first year we were able to get into an\nApartment complex was well now we've had as many as like Seventeen complexes that were invested in and that's the churning effect of the race by\nOur or spelling and so we right now we own sixteen because we still one and that was a situation where we did what they call it in thirty one exchange and that's where\nYou had we had a complex\nAnd we traded up in this case we traded up to two more complex as\nWell okay so let's say we put a hundred thousand in that first um\nApartment complex there's an investment well we had an equity gain of Seventy one percent so when we sold out first complex and traded up into two\nMore complex as we had now a hundred and Seventy one thousand to invest and we didn't really even have to put a penny into the deal that we handed over it was already in there\nAnd we went from a complex to close to two hundred thousand\nToo too complex which total about um\nA five hundred year that I think I did two hundred thousand and we went from the complex with two hundred units too too complex is that a five hundred unit and so what that means there's the cash flow increases and um we changed like it it was\nA on one of 'em they occupy the was eighty three percent\nAnd the late investors gotten that up to Ninety three percent and then on the other conflicts that we traded in two ways\nIt or call was made him within a half mile of our investment and they were bringing in five thousand employed so it it's just been great or start sided about it [noise]\nLeo and what is it good for you know how is it how does it change your life what are you doing day to day now that you weren't doing that for\nOr when you know it's funny or just the other day I remember I got it and it was ... or whatever and\nIt was maybe about ... gotten up at eight thirty instead of getting up at six o'clock Wal Mart and um but and then um I thought\nYou know what they do and thought you know go get gas here I Am\nAt nine thirty ten or ... ... ... getting ready to go to get gas oil and I can do what I Want I Want ... not thought about my former ... where am I going to form a half a mile\nA ... a comeback and then you know and then there's a\nReally kind of enjoy ally or they feel at least on the Internet you can look up stuff markets and stuff and um and then also what you are that are like going back and talk and call in the late investor and finding out more about\nYou but if we are right you can do all the things that you love but you're not responsible for making those deals go down and that's wonderful thank you so much for joining me today\nToday shows come to an end

read most anything in to most anything but I think it is fair to say that if Mueller had anything\nOn Trump that he thought might be useful in hurting Trump he would've released that information\nJust before the vote started and I suppose he still could\nBut why would he wait until after the midterms to present his key findings as they are calling on the Russia probe\nLet's presume for a moment he has nothing\nIn at this point he has presented nothing Manafort had his trouble we haven't managed to update Manfred had a stroke but his trouble related to not paying taxes Michael Cohen had his trouble his trouble had to do with the fact that he was basically running a criminal enterprise in addition to being a lawyer\nSo why wouldn't you present this information to Carter Page never really do anything wrong Papadopoulos never doing anything wrong all the money that was spent all the man hours all the promises of the crimes\nCommitted in that you would get to the bottom of\nThe hill

after\nThis November's midterm elections Bloomberg News signing a pair of on a Dennis ... U.S officials reported on Wednesday that Mueller as close to finalizing his inquiry into a pair of the most important aspects of the investigation\nNow the cynical sodomy says the fact that they've come out this early with plenty of time to cure the potential delay in presenting the evidence\nThat it creates the time for the appearance of a groundswell of demand that Mueller let us know what's going on before the midterms and that would put Mueller end of the situation like candidates who create\nTheir own a a a activity there most of their own interest by saying they've been asked to run their never asked to run they weren't around there's no one asking\nThem around they just say that\nIt could be that Mueller is creating all of this doing all this engaging and all this so it could look like well people were asking me to present this before the November mid turns ... midterms than [noise]\nOkay I guess I Will\nYou're on the ball [noise]\nUp on the Michael berry

Seventy one with lots of sunshine so fall is finally here and it will be cooler today and through the rest of the work week and into the weekend this has been CBS forty six meteorologist Jennifer Valdez\nBig Michael there you go on TALK radio forty below do you see I see [noise]\nWe have injected too much\nCriminal justice apparatus into our political system\n... the court system has intruded too far into the political system\nThe process was designed for change for the public's approval and disapproval to be registered in the form of votes and so rather than Mueller\nDoing this big investigation\nWhat we really have to recognize is it the American people elected Donald Trump and the leadership of the FBI didn't want Donald Trump they weren't Hillary Clinton and so\nThey managed using their friends in the media using their friends in the PR community and in the opposition research the silent assassin\nFirst day of your career it's on your mind I Want to be so good I Want to be that among the best what I've done a one on one day where that Jack and be sworn in to the whole\nBut if you serve your country in the military those guys don't think in terms of one day I Want to be invited to the halls of political power in this country\nWith the the the gold drapes behind me andme elect German a flag the room crowded and Fox News carrying it live and the president put the metal around my neck they don't think in those terms\nAnd I think maybe that's what makes it special is that they did not compromise or cashier or sell out or pursue their simply being recognized for incredible incredible valor\nAnd when that blue ribbon goes around their neck and the president ties it in the back they have the\nThe the look on their face seemingly light is taking forever\nBecause these aren't the highest ranking guys in the military they're not used to the spotlight these are the guys that actually fight the wars these are the guys\nAt the the lowest levels that are seeing bullets whiz by they're just not accustomed to this\nAnyway I didn't want this day to go by without I didn't want to show about without noting that soap opera and then there's um it was on trial his buddy who was convicted\nGave him a lot of money and flew them around and his private jet they went down to Dominican Republic where he supposedly cured for Bob Menendez teenage girls\nMenendez used as his defense oh he was a bribing me were just really good friends friends do these things for friends well but\nHe was under investigation and he did get political favors dawn on his behalf\nWell Menendez managed to save his scout but it's unclear whether he'll be able to save his political career the biggest Senate Democrat pack about to drop three million dollars in New Jersey just say Menendez a seat the Huffington Post writes Senate\nPac which is controlled by allies of Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer Democrat from New York will use the cash to air a statewide ad attacking Menendez his opponent former pharmaceutical executive Bob ... as an ally of president Donald Trump\nIn a state where the president is deeply unpopular\n[laughter] it was at a fundraiser for Mendez it Hillary crashed her van on Monday Night for Hillary she can't do anything right\nHugging the Republicans have been hitting Menendez heart over the\nUnderage prostitutes down in the Dominican Republic but I'm not sure it's going to matter I'm increasingly I've the pinion that Democrats don't care\nAs long as they went\nSo now Chuck Schumer is going to drop three million dollars in what should've been a safe Democrat seat\nThree million dollars you know it probably could use some of that thirty eight million that ... has raised mark my words\nWhen this election is over Beto O'Rourke in Texas will be sitting on a huge chunk of change if he only wanted to win\nThe Senate seat from Texas\nHe would spend every penny of it but he won't and he hasn't and the reason is made on knows he can't win a seat the more money they spend the further he falls behind him\nHe'll end up losing fifty five forty or it might even be fifty six forty four\nHe'll lose about ten percentage points he's down consistently by seven points or more and then you have to factor in the turnout model remember that when they show these polls\nThey don't just randomly interview six hundred to a thousand people they have\nEstimates on what percentage of people are going to be Republicans and what percentage you're going to be Democrats show up to vote they have estimates on percentage of old people and young people that are going to show up to vote may have estimates on city in in rural and so they go find that many votes that many poll respond to these\nBut what you can't factor in is the people that they model will show up and vote\nIn the yard signs don't vote rallies don't vote\nYou have a rally on the campus of a university which has been hitting hard over\nThe last month and some people are coming out of class a camera and says to Morgan says\nTo Chloe hey what are you are you know one of the food court for lunch no they're having a political rally oh well what are you going to

I Do you think I'm like a mature adult man and you'll sleep with me\nYeah well I don't know camera and you just come on we're going to watch a political rally and so they do and they go and they may even register to vote that day 'cause they're caught up caught up in the moment and there'd be no serious and all adults and stuff\nThey were doping say likes\nTheir adult thing they're doing stuff that their parents have done [noise]\nThey're really mature you know people think that this generation doesn't know anything but we do where to show them where to vote for ...\nBut they don't show
