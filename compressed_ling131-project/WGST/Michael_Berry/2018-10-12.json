Sharma flew out and presented their multi family\nHomes to us we all sat Brian I'm Michelle Wolf presenting on single family investing and really I think my job as an ambassador is is helping 'em Steve set up a lot of those events but just helping to facilitate helping to be there to welcome new members to be somebody that can answer questions for them um\nTry to help them feel comfortable um in they're investing journey and and just encouraging them along the way I'm so that's really what I see is my main job\nNo work um as I mentioned the last segment as a mathematician math teacher would shoot that could be a very technical side thinker a you seem to make most of your solutions based on\nThe more emotional and people oriented side the decision curve my question you was when you first came to lifestyles physically getting to touch the people were you surprised how open they were\n[noise] oh definitely I mean you know has a [noise] when we talk about businesses a lot of businesses are very competitive and they don't want to share with each other you know what their numbers are and you know that's that's the beauty of a case study um investors upfront\nSharing their actual experiences or with the rest of the members I'm getting to see their\nTheir numbers you know what they invested into a deal what kinds of things they did to improve a property what their returns are um and so you know the transparency and and even just talking to other members\nAnd having them share you know how many deals are you in and you know which deals are good which deals have worked out so well I'm you know everything is very transparent and open\nAnd honest and and it's just a great environment to be a part of what is a truly your wife think about this\nWell\nKnow it's interesting she I wanted her to comments I mentioned before back to the two days seminar in Palm Springs and so she came with me and I'm you know she met um some of the people that I mentioned before and she got to hear Bryan deferred to the the two days seminar and she understands now you know how this whole process works\nFor the most part you know she doesn't really go to all the events that I go to um she\nWent up ... pm comes in and we're discussing you know whether we should get into a new deal I make sure that I Walk her up and and I'll explain to her all the different parts of the steel and why I think it might be good or not and then well actually sitting and pray about it last you know got to give us some guidance on our investing and you know that's sort\nOf her involvement in it I keep her um apprised about what we're doing and and make sure that she's a part of all the decisions [noise] um but she's not his hands on as I Am I I just really love and enjoy the opportunity to get out with like minded investors and discuss things and talk with them and just be a part of all the events\n... contrary to that thought you work in a pension based environment what are the\nPeople around you know of what you're doing and or think about what you're doing if you go\n[noise] that's interesting because I've I've tried to share a few times with people and um you know some of the people that I teach with are are very interested in investing and um\nYou know there are open to listening to some of the ideas that you know I've shared with them I think other times I'll talk to people and they'll look at me for like a deer in headlights they don't really you know to think about putting down a large sum of money on an apartment complex can\nBe sort of beyond you know what they normally think about doing [noise] um so it there's mixed reactions I mean some people really started to talk to him and I realized very quickly that it's it's not going to be fruitful and and I just sort of\nDon't go too far with that and other people all share a lot of details with them because they're very interested in an open to learning\nHow about the family\nExtort our family and external at a rally brother sister yeah my father\nIn law um is actually came with us the Palm Springs and he is a pig member as well and he's invested in twelve or Thirteen bills now himself\nAlthough he's gotten very involved and um my father who live in Florida oh I've shared some of this with him he's more invested in the stock market and\nNot so much in real estate and so you know we've we've talked about that and uh you know family is very supportive on what we're doing I think that um\nYou know it's it's out of the realm of comfort sometimes for people my sister who lives in Cincinnati, Ohio is also a pig member joined after we went and she's in one deal I'm with us so we're both in a deal with Brian button in Atlanta and so I'm\nSo people are very open in my

response from of course I live in a democratic\nA city called the mayor called the parks and recreation [noise] I Can't get a reply I Can't go over there you know it's a beautiful field or I Want to do something with it any ideas on that\nUh nothing you don't already know but my response to that is there's never an easy route\nPersistence is under rated stick to it if this is\nPossibly the greatest character trait that is the thread that runs through highly successful people\nI have found with highly successful people\nThat some of them are really smart and some of them are not\nSome of them have incredible talent some of them really don't some of them have an incredible amount of luck and some of them it might take longer but they still get their despite physical ailments you know the\nProsecution persecution you name it but one threat I have noticed with almost all successful people\nPredict is polling\nNow in the four years since he's not always men right but he has come to be widely respected for his methodology in in\nPolling well he tweeted today this morning\nThe beta coverage is kind of dumb 'cause the big story big story today was that they do raise ... million dollars in the\nIn the third quarter the better coverage is kind of dumb in our polling average he's gone from being down three to four points at his peak to being down six points now\nThat's not great Texas has gone from leaning Republican too likely Republican but the coverage was wrongly treating it as a toss up before and as wrongly treating it as safe Republican now\nWell part of the problem there is that there was so\nMuch passionate Democrat spin trying to say that beta was going to win and text\nI had people call my my school there's there's by you know your ... ever wires Michael yard signs don't vote there's ... there's three of them in my neighborhood\nHow many houses you neighborhood I don't know if there's at least three on ... five hundred house and you never know that\nI'm less than one percent voting for ... and maybe some people to vote for bail and don't have your wife just said Michael ... crudely put some science out here how about we look at the polling does how do we look at the historical ... on your precinct and see that you're in eighty five percent Republican precinct and that's not going to change this year he's\nSeen a more ... ... ...\nPeople get caught up in the things that don't matter the shining medical\nPeople get caught up in stuff that doesn't matter the size of crowds at concerts the size of rallies\nYou've got millions of people in Texas\nThe fact that you can get five hundred of them to show up in Amarillo or El Paso or Dallas or Houston\nFor you to prance around and talk about how Nancy Pelosi should be the speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer should be the Senate majority leader and that's who you vote for that's great\nBut that's not where the votes are\nAnd the media has a vested interest in telling you that the candidates they're supporting and endorsing that they've fallen in love with is dead even or that he has taken the lead\nJust remember they're not to be trust period Dana you're on the show\nI Am the Michael berry gives me this is my first time calling you I'm I'm I Want to comment\nOn your comment about people and the common thread being\nPerfect and for parts of the year and I'm very interested in the subject mainly from the standpoint of programming your subconscious mind which when you are and you have a burning desire your desire how the tap and so\nAll you have to do it and never give up keep going after it in spite of any evidence to the contrary you will get there if you just persevere yeah\nI'm I'm fascinated by the kind of mind over matter\nKnow I look at people who run ultra marathon for instance I look at people look at a guy like Marcus la trail and he talks about the training they do is navy seals to get ready for war\nAnd to be able to persevere you know when your body is telling you that your bleeding out you've been shot multiple times you've fallen off the side of multiple mountains and you're probably going to die and everyone who came in with you has already died\nThat the natural inclination is to shut down and simply die right there but the mind over matter to\nPush beyond that to push through that\nI'm Marcus has a friend named David ... they're doing the Patriot tour next month and I'm going to moderate Ramon I'm pretty excited about and David ... is a maybe seal he's one of the very few black maybe seals in America's ever had\nAnd he decided remember his story he decided he was like a hundred pounds overweight decides will start running and now he runs a ultra marathon hundred miles he runs a hundred miles your body is telling you it eggs he ran so far at one point that the bones in his feet were broken\nFrom the pounding and he continued on and his kidneys had shut down miles before and he continued through pushed through and finished the race\nMost of us our body is telling us through pain to stop\nJust stop doing what you're doing if you're running that pain is telling you your body is is enduring potential damage you need to stop\nAnd walk\nDon't push through any further and this is true in every way I was having lunch with a friend of mine today and we were talking about Asians who come to this country and how successful um we were talking about uh we were at a Thai restaurant but we are talking about the Vietnamese who come here and how successful there\nAnd we were talking about the level of perseverance and I said you know I don't speak Vietnamese but when I Try it's difficult because of the inflection and the part of the mouth from what you speak at all I sit and do you realize it as hard as that is for us to learn\nThe inverse is true for the Vietnamese who come here and you see these these communities of of people who come to this country and succeed can you imagine how easy it would be to give up\nIf you could just teach your kids when they fail to continue trying to kick down that well if you don't say to your kid it's okay but uh you failed you know it's a it's not your fault it's the teachers' fault it's the coaches fault it's\nOr when you do and then ran\nRan I see it coming I'm seeing it in Texas I'm seeing folks saying to me you know I wasn't sure\nI was even going to vote on it I'm not as big a cruise fan as you or I saw ... you know was\nSaying some pretty things and he was visiting his day these young and he's smooth and he's cool he's him but now I realize that he's no different than any other Democrats are they just packaged him differently I don't know yet what I'm saying you can put lipstick on a pig during the Olympics\nAnd this one doesn't even provide any ...\nTo the phone lines we go Robin in Beaumont go ahead\nMichael require ... you know right from ... how many Democrats you think the ones that actually work\nI'm an increase that money if their employer offered it I don't think any I don't eat or\n\nIf they want it back yes they do yes\nYes they do Bradley in Alabama Europe\nAll right Mike are you there yeah go ahead I I got a a\nLittle story for you is a a man that I ride home with every day\nAnd he keeps me company uh we tell stories back and forth and uh I usually end up listening to him he's got a lot of wisdom and been through a lot in life been around for quite some time and I'm listening to him yesterday and\nHe told a story on it provided a metaphor that I felt like sharing year and everybody a list and then\nIt had we got to talking about Kanye him coming into the White House and how strong the media was about an hour on such a bad thing we got a totally repel everything that he says in the\n... he provided this metaphor that kind of sums up black community and the Democrats and I think you'll agree with the a metaphor ... you may recognize his name is\nYours truly Michael berry and uh\nI thought that was the most accurate and really in to it if it's a picture\nOf the current state of the Democratic party and the black community that I heard you date and I'll watch the news every night and everything like that I Would like to talk with\nYou Mr Perry and here to\nOregon I appreciate you saying that you know I Will tell you politics is played very differently\nIn what is frequently called the black community about which I mean the parts of town that are predominantly black\nBlack community as a geo graphic representation means something different than black community at large short of black nation type thing blacks\nWho live outside of predominantly black neighborhoods don't get county in voting patterns because voting patterns are based on precincts\nAnd when you go to a precinct that is an\nAll black or almost all black\nPrecinct it is typically although not exclusively a poor precinct if blacks live in a neighborhood where over Ninety percent of the people are black it is more often than not a poor neighborhood\nWhen blacks are financially successful professionally and then financially successful they will typically move out of a black neighborhood and then they move into a predominantly white neighborhood so their vote never gets cast\nAs part of the quote unquote black community well here's the deal when\nPeople refer to the black community there\nActually referring to depressed areas that have a high concentration of blacks I got news for you if you go to a predominantly white neighborhood that is socio economically poor\nThe voting patterns the positions on issues are going to be quite different than if you go to a mostly white neighborhood where the income is much higher\nSo what happens is people have missed perceptions of blacks and what Kanye is doing is actually laying that bear [noise]\nOne of the world a better place every grown as men and lesbian woman\nThe top on the drive home you bet it would\nThe friday drive home\nTraffic on
