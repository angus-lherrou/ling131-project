today is a fabulous couple Bethany McGregor ... attack a Dallas who currently\nOwn thirty and communities right now have purchased forty six multifamily communities over the last three and a half years three thousand seven hundred twenty nine units and uh they've done thirty five different leading about thirty three different ... of which twenty five\nOf them were first timers so the question came as we went to a break ... theory share with is your theory of having such a large percentage your portfolio with first time investors I think it's an interesting concept\n\nWell we did it and when we first joined a lot of people are like unique I meet her and three great you need to go meet them and all the great deal\nAnd nobody really seem to be saying oh well spent yeah nobody knows them ... and then it ... ... ... ... ... we will I think that we could possibly get a better chance of getting on the other thing that wait a minute is that\nOn and those people that had\nEvery ... on the typically they are they come up with it\nUm they already know how to set everything up\nWhile you can learn things up man it's a you know you're watching than if you're with at first timely you can even be part of helping them or the thing I really like a ... ... ...\nYou can find out exactly how they're getting the delicate what they look at with Iraq will all that stuff and ...\nAnd and that and that's why we did it with that I could learn more\nInteresting point of view I'm going to share with you well I think a first time investors are seem to have a little bit of an edge in my heart to some extent not honest with you\nOr for deals I bought into this year as a passive Raul\nSuper ... leads that I Know personally so um it it's going to sound disingenuous but here's the deal is that I Believe that for you guys a first time investor brings two things to the table but are better than him a ... a a experienced veteran number one they're taking a lower percentage of override on the deal\nDue to the white paper the rules and regulations they chant goes suck up a large portion of the profits on the front in middle and the back of the deal like\nA very highly compensated lead can there for many years uh he's able to take up up to twenty percent of the deal whereas you know a ... percent secondly most of these dinner deals are leads are buying deal small enough that they can afford to get in they qualify for\nEnhanced it's not where they want to end up so they just attack\nYou know there is an attack mode to get this deal done number one because they're scared to death or going to fail a so they're just all over it you know it's like peanut butter on slice of bread they're stuck\nTo that deal and secondly they want to sell the deal because they want to move on they want to get to a big deal so they want to get to that result to that gain as quickly as they care whether they're going to refinance the money out ourselves really irrelevant\nBut it gets you to that point sooner because they're just really more aggressive that people go like you know I already on ...\nAnd this was just another we're getting into what brought you know\nThe story is in a I go back to pumping iron which is about body builders Arnold Schwarzenegger is talking to Lou Ferrigno father or Lou Ferrigno which is the hulk is trying to be our will do in the Olympia and\nLoose values are I don't know Louis pretty big he's pretty hungry you're you're ... you're not that hungry sitting in your you know blue is hungry line and our looks at him to go to Joe Louis may be hungry\nYou says but I always get sad\n[laughter]\nThere's there's something about being the guy at the top it's already done today as you know some things to it so I have you guys realize the benefits from having lower competitions from the first time leads are not\nOh definitely I Can't be any like return for about ... ... lead on and you know you're exactly right they had a lower percentage and also you know they were smaller guilt a lot easier to get your money in\n... when you know you're only basing it on three hundred thousand that an investor tail rather than I think we're in one that like eight million dollars that's your money invested in that the al\n\n... who are\nNow whose sole da da da ... were those beginners or with those all across the board the ones that you sold to minors in this practice is getting out of ... will be gone\nFor the first time only two of them or one of the first time late but it was actually a second sale and all of the late and then the other two were
