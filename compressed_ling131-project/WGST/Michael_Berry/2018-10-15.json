Sharma flew out and presented their multi family\nHomes to us we also had Brian and Michelle Wolf presenting on single family investing and really I think my job as an ambassador is is helping 'em

in they're investing journey and and just encouraging them along the way I'm so that's really what I see is my main job\nNo Mark I'm as I mentioned the last segment as a mathematician math teacher which could be a very technical side thinker a you seemed made most of your solutions based on\nThe more emotional and people oriented side the decision curve my question you was when you first came to lifestyles physically getting to touch the people were you surprised how open they were\n[noise]\nDefinitely I mean you know has a [noise]\nWhen we talk about businesses a lot of businesses are very competitive and they don't want to share with each other you know what their numbers are and you know that's that's the beauty of a case study um investors upfront\nSharing their actual experiences uh with the rest of the members I'm getting to feed their\nTheir numbers you know what they invested in to do a deal what kinds of things they did to improve a property what their returns are um and so you know the transparency and and even just talking to other members and having them share you know how many deals are you in and you know with\nSkills are good which deals have worked out so well I'm you know everything is very transparent\nAnd open and honest and and it's just a a great environment to be a part of what is a truly your wife think about this\nWell you know it's interesting she wanted her to come as I mentioned before back to the two days seminar in Palm Springs and so she came with me and I'm you know she met um some of the people that I've mentioned before and she got to hear Bryan deferred to the the\nTwo days seminar and she understands now you know how this whole process works for the most part you know she doesn't really go to all the events that I go to um she\nWent up ... ... pm comes in and we're discussing you know whether we should get into a new deal I make sure that I Walk her up and and I'll explain to her all the different parts of this deal and why I think it might be good or not\nAnd then we'll actually sitting and pray about it last you know got to give us some guidance on our investing and you know that's\nSort of her involvement in it I keep her um\nApprised about what we're doing and and make sure that she's a part of all the decisions [noise] um but she's not his hands on as I Am I I just really love and enjoy the opportunity to get out with like minded investors and discuss things and talk with them and just be a part of all the events\n... contrary to that thought you work at a pension based environment what are the\nPeople around you know of what you're doing it or think about what you're doing if you go\n[noise] that's interesting because I've I've tried to share a few times with people and um you know some of the people that I teach with um are very interested in the best thing and um\nYou know there are open to listening to some of the ideas that you know I've shared with them I think other times I'll talk to people and they'll look at me for like a deer in headlights they don't really you know to think about putting down a large sum of money on an apartment complex\nCan be sort of beyond you know what they normally think about doing [noise] um so ... there's mixed reactions I mean some people really I started to talk to them and I realized very quickly that it's it's not going to be fruitful and and I just sort of\nGo too far with that and other people all share a lot of details with them because they're very interested in an open to learning\nAbout the family\n... family and external at a rally brother sister yeah my\nFather in law um is actually came with us to Palm Springs and he is a big number as well and he's invested in twelve or Thirteen bills now himself\nAlthough he's gotten very involved and um my father who live in Florida oh I've shared some of this with him he's more invested in the stock market and\nNot so much and real estate and so you know we've we've talked about that and ah you know family is very supportive on what we're doing I think that um\nYou know it it out of the realm of comfort sometimes for people my sister who lives in Cincinnati, Ohio is also a pig member joined after we went and\nShe's in one deal I'm with us so we're both in a deal with Brian button in Atlanta and so I'm so people are very open in my family and very you know

definitely\nGoing towards kind of person they just keep looking ahead moving forward guys that's completely different than me which I'm a skeptic I'm moving away from pain away from trouble\nAway for

help his case it actually hurts his case or is he afraid that they committed a crime and he's at least not going to get nailed for perjury\nIn which case was Mr Sampson not informed that the story as we didn't meet until after the election maybe they forgot to corroborate their testimony maybe one of them is telling the truth and if one of them is telling an untruth\nWhy would they be doing that now before you think to yourself but maybe it just doesn't remember a meeting if they were weekly lunch partners\nAnd you forgot one of the meetings that it'd be fine\nBut if you've only met someone

[noise]\nJohn Ratcliffe was a Republican is not surprised that Glenn Simpson is pleading the fifth\nDuring an interview with Fox News Ratcliffe says that Simpsons testimony as at odds with the testimony that Bruce or with the department of justice gave last month quote the reason for that is it Glen Simpson had previously testified under oath to the house intelligence committee\nThat ain't never met with Bruce or or discussed with Bruce or the Steele dossier prior to the October application that's the ... application in two thousand sixteen or the two thousand sixty and presidential election\nThat is in direct contradiction to what Bruce or told me under oath last month I Am not surprised Mr Sampson is taking the fifth you probably should\nHe's in real legal jeopardy very clearly someone is not telling the truth is Nelly or Bruce or his wife certainly can shed some light Nelly or course works for fusion GPS\nSimpson is not the only one on the hot seat here deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein failed to appear before the house last week\nI don't want to use air quotes over the radio so I'm going to tell you where the quotes are that they put around his comments which would suggest that they were which would know not sure which would state that they were taking his words directly and that would be important they wrote President Trump says quote\nElite was a great general end quote during Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader quote incredible in quote\nWell even liberals in the media came out and criticized what they had done\nEven liberals in the media came out in distance themselves from what NBC had done\nHere is the president's comments now I happen to think as many military historians do that Robert really was a very effective general\nAnd I think one of the factors in his favor\nSubject is the fact that President Lincoln sought to employ him in a senior position within the union army in fact he was invited to the ... to the White House so that the case could be made that he not break off and lead his fellow Virginians which he did the ...\nBut that he lead the union [noise]\nHe had a lineage at West point which was nothing short of spectacular um in in a union wanted his services and be the one to keep them away from the Confederate\nHe's been regarded throughout history by military who's historians as a very bright effective successful tactician\nNow there's been in the last Twenty years and attempt to discredit his military actor maintenance and that's fine it's based in the fact that it's based in the short of revision as some of the confederacy was awful therefore anything that went on there if\nThey develop a cure for cancer in a Confederate a I'm a medical tent they would have declared that it wasn't such a great I'm a discovery after all ... it's it's that bad\nBut the point I'm making here is the military is attempt to smear the president by taking words that I say military the media's attempt to smear the president by taking words out of context\nIs backfiring over and over and over again\nBecause increasingly Americans don't believe them and increasingly they give Americans every reason not to believe them here is the president's actual statement and I would I Would beg to find anyone who could disagree\nWith anything he says here you're free to have your own opinions but they're certainly not saying he says here that that speaks to white supremacy or anything of of of the store and NBC had to come to come back and do something they rarely do and correct\nTheir article and admit that what they said he said he didn't say here's what he did say\nOh I always say that gave us a great president who has it been properly recognized OK\nWilliam McKinley has not been properly racket [noise] what he did and in terms of fray\nIn terms of war but in terms of trade and I hate to say it in terms of being smart and tariffs William McKinley has not been properly recognize but maybe someday he will [noise]\nIt also gave you [noise]\nA general\nWho is incredible he drank a little bit too much [noise]\nYou know what I'm Talking about [noise]\nSo Robert Daly it was a great general\nAbraham Lincoln\nDevelop a phobia he couldn't be Robert Ley\nHe was going crazy I don't know if you know this but Robert Daly was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln gay mommy's that I can be Robert Daly and they had all of these generals\nThey look great they were the top of that class at West point they were the greatest people there's only one problem they didn't know how to help when they didn't know how to fight [noise] they didn't know how and one day it was looking really bad\nAnd lead you just said you hardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem\nAnd Lincoln said I don't get what probably as you guys aren't winning\nAnd his name was grant general grant [noise]\n\nAnd he went in and said hey knock the hell out of everyone [noise]\nAnd you know this story\nThey said the Lincoln\nYou can use them anymore he's an alcoholic\nAnd Lincoln said [noise]\nDon't care if he's an alcoholic frankly\nGive me six or seven more just like [noise] we started to win\nGrant really did he had a serious problem a serious drinking problem but man was he a good general and he's finally being recognized as a great general but [noise]\nAlmost developed a phobia because he was having a hard time with it so great fighter and a great General Robert Italy but grant figured it out and grad is a great general and grand came from right here [noise]\nSo they took him out of context but what is more saying that\nRobert ... was a great general in order to build up this victory that that grant and executed above him\nAnd just a moment I'm going to read to you\nFrom some presidents of the past\nOver the last almost a hundred years\nAs to how they describe properly\nAnd I'll tell you what if today we're supposed to believe he was an awful general\nWe sure have had a lot of presidents\nWho went out of their way\nTo tell us how great\nA general he was but that's not what\nPresident Trump was praising grant NBC took on Trump

Bush addressing the United states military academy called Robert ... the perfect West Point graduate\nSo the media criticized as Donald Trump for saying that US Grant defeating Robert he was a major event because leave with such a good general and the media says all that shouldn't do that\nWhen nothing less than West Point considers him to have been one of the finest and his father before him by the way\nThis isn't a confederacy issue this isn't a in an attempt to battle for the honor and dignity\nOf those who opposed\nWhat Lincoln's union represented this is simply another example\nOf trying to twist the words and actions of people\nIn an attempt to swing an election to sway the opinions of people with dishonesty the same network that used doctored photos of George Zimmerman's head when Trayvon Martin had bang dam on the floor on the on the asphalt\nIn an attempt to kill him and finally tsimerman in fear for his life but his head busted opening gushing blood had to pull the trigger\nNBC doctored those photos so that they didn't look like his head was split wide open because they wanted it to be the case that Zimmerman wanted to kill Trayvon that he killed him without provocation so they actually doctored the photos\nWhen you reached the point that you can no longer report the news but that you actually all through the news in order to win your point\nHow can anyone trusts you have to ... how can anyone ever trust you and so then the media is left\nConsidered on trustworthy their stories being called fake news nobody believing anything they say an angry at U.

so one of the narratives that's beginning to emerge regards a Saudi journalist named ...\nNow he was actually a state run media Saudi journalist of some repeated until he started criticizing the current regime current regime who has hired PR agencies and folks to really burnish his image here\nHe goes by NBS meant to make him sort of a friendly figure kind of rock storage figure he's really\nPromoted and advertise these reforms Saudi Arabia women getting to do more what a nice guy he is\nBut he's also rather brutal crackdown on individuals within the government that he believes a might pose a threat to him so ... is a columnist for the Washington Post and is taken up residence in the U.S\nHe goes into the Saudi conflict\nOn October second and does not come out his wife's waiting outside she's a Turkish citizen and she says he doesn't come back out and then from there it unraveled what exactly happened\nWell ... had been critical of the uh Saturday the current Saudi administration NBS this you know the short high flying and hot shot you know new leader and in Saudi Arabia [noise] he had been rather critical\nBut he didn't consider consider himself a guy that was at war with his own country or his own government\nAnd by all accounts including his wife he didn't think that there was a risk that they were going to kill him he did go to the Saudi consulate uh on September twenty eight a few days before that\nAnd he applied for a document that would allow him from the Saudi Government to marry this Turkish woman\nHe was told to come back\nOn October second so he leaves and according to his wife or what would have been his wife they were getting married in a couple of days his fiance he had no reason to fear for safety he flies to London he gives a speech\nHe flashback to Istanbul there they arrive on the first he goes in on the second there's footage of him going into the consulate he goes in\nAnd that's where according to the Turkish government he was tortured\nA cut into pieces thrown into a black plastic bags probably tossed into the van that brought the assassination team a Fifteen member team that had been flown by the Saudis to turkey\nAnd never to be seen again\nNow they're the Turkish government air to gone is claiming or well Turkish officials are claiming that all of this was recorded on his phone his iPhone while his wife held his phone outside that it was it was recorded on his I watch\nAnd then it was up loaded to the cloud I've not heard\nYet I've not heard it but it has been reported on it's also been reported that the individuals who flew in flew back out on private planes\nThat those individuals went to the Saudi consul general's home three hours after Mr could show you went into the consulate\nWas that to update him or what had happened was that to check on what kind of response there'd been was that to go through the last details of how to get them out of the country I don't know pure speculation\nThis issue is fraught with a lot of industry because the Turks and Saudis don't get along well over among other things what's going on in Syria\nBut this is also the same Turkish government just released American pastor Andrew Brunson who they accused of espionage and terrorism\nAnd I have not heard of a single American Thinker writer diplomat foreign services a veteran who
