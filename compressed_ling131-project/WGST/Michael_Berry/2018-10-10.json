Sharma flew out and presented their multi family\nHomes to us we all sat Brian and Michelle Wolf preventing on single family investing and really I think my job as an ambassador is is helping 'em they've set up a lot of those events but just helping to facilitate helped me to be there to welcome new members to be somebody that can answer questions for them um\nTry to help them feel comfortable um in they're investing journey and and just encouraging them along the way I'm so that's really what I see as my main job\nNo Mark I'm as I mentioned the last segment as a mathematician a teacher which could be a very technical side thinker a you seem to have made most of your solutions based on\nThe more emotional and people oriented side the decision curve my question you was when you first came to lifestyles physically getting to touch the people were you surprised how open they were\n[noise] oh definitely I mean you know has a [noise]\nWhen we talk about businesses a lot of businesses are very competitive and they don't want to share with each other you know what their numbers are and you know that's that's the beauty of a case study um investors upfront\nSharing their actual experience of uh with the rest of the members I'm getting to feed their\nTheir numbers you know what they invest and do a deal what kinds of things they did to improve a property what their returns are um and so you know the transparency and and even just talking to other members\nAnd having them share you know how many deals are you in and you know which deals are good which deals have worked out so well I'm you know everything is very transparent\nAnd open and honest and and it's just a a great environment to be a part of what is a truly your wives think about this\nWell you know it's interesting she I wanted her to come as I mentioned before back to the two days seminar in Palm Springs and so she came with me and I'm you know she met\nUm some of the people that I've mentioned before and she got to hear Bryan deferred to the the two days seminar and she understands now you know how this whole process works for the most part you know she doesn't really go to all the events that I go to um she\nWent up ... ... pm comes in and we're discussing you know whether we should\nGet into a new deal I make sure that I Walk her up and and I'll explain to her all the different parts of this deal and why I think it might be good or not\nAnd then we'll actually sitting and pray about it you know got to give us some guidance on our investing and you know that's\nSort of her involvement in it I keep her um apprised about what we're doing and and make sure that she's a part of all the decisions um but she's not his hands on as I Am I I just really love and enjoy the opportunity to get out with like minded\nInvestors and discuss things and talk with them and just be a part of all the events\nCutter contrary to that thought you work at a pension based environment\nWhat are the people around you know of what you're doing and or think about what you're doing if you go\nThat's interesting because I've I've tried to share a few times with people and um you know some of the people that I teach with um are very interested in investing and um\nYou know there are open to listening to some of the ideas that you know I've shared with them\nI think other times I'll talk to people and they'll look at me for like a deer in headlights they don't really you know to think about putting down a large sum of money on an apartment complex can be sort of beyond you know what they normally think about doing [noise] um so\nThere's mixed reactions I mean some people really started to talk to him and I realized very quickly that it's it's not going to be to fruitful and and I just sort of don't go too far with that and other people all share a lot of details with them because they're very interested in an open to learning\nAbout the family\n... family and external at a rally brother sister yeah my\nFather in law is actually came with us the Palm Springs and he is a big number as well and he's invested in twelve or Thirteen bills now himself\nAlthough he's gotten very involved and um my father who live in Florida or I've shared some of this with him he's more invested in the stock market and\nNot so much in real estate and so you know we've we've talked about that and uh you know family is very supportive on what we're doing I think that um\nYou know it it's out of the realm of comfort sometimes for people my sister who lives in Cincinnati, Ohio is also a pig member joined after we went and she has been one\nDeal I'm with us so we're both in a deal with Brian button in Atlanta and so I'm so people are very open in my family and very you know interested in what we're doing\nWell that's great really is you know say something Marco through this whole interview\nI've not heard anything any type of skepticism in any way so you're you're definitely\nA going towards kind of person they just keep looking ahead moving forward guys that's completely different than me which I'm a skeptic I'm moving away from pain away from trouble\nAway for problems so it's interesting to see the dichotomy of personalities are but you've done well and you continue to do well several deals and seven months is actually\nI Want to

know angry you got during the Kevin all proceedings\n\nOne of the healthiest aspects to that\nWas the feeling\nThat you were being wrong that Brett Kavanaugh was being wrong\nThat the process was being wrong\nAnd that nothing was done being done about it\nThat created a boiling over effect\nAnd it takes a few days for that to be reflected in the polls\nBecause poll can't be taken in real time to be accurate\nHas to go out into the field\nAnd then you've got to you you're always running a lag\nWell here we go\nUm\nSix hundred likely voters sampled from October first and second margin of error plus the morning minus five percent ... percent\nBy pollster might nobles Ohio predictive inside and ABC Fifteen local local Phoenix TV station\nTurns out that Martha much Sally the Republican there\nSomething of a bad assed veteran from what I understand has erased\nAll of cure students to name as early lead in the race to replace\nJeff Flake\nNow this is not McCain's seat this is Jeff lakes seat remember the governor there put the former Republican senator in that seat for now\nFlake fortunately is retiring flake voted against Kavanaugh reminds you mix Sally is now up\nShe was ... she was a losing\nShe's now a forty seven forty one\nAnd the Green Party candidate angel agree that's convenient has four percent\n\nWhat's interesting there is I think a couple of things happening\nThat's a Republican state there's no doubt Arizona's a Republican state\nHas been since long before Goldwater\nConsistently\nYou have some pockets of Democrats you had a Hispanic Democrat who was plum crazy you had Gabby Giffords who was a Democrat in a purple district but at the time\nShe was a pro gun rights Democrat and she was a little more conservative on some of the social issues and so she was able as a Democrat popular Democrat to win in what was really a Republican district I Believe it is Republican now\n\nSo but the state is a Republican state no doubt about that\nMake Sally was in an ugly ugly three person primary race and I think there were some hard feelings there\nI think that some of what we experienced in for instance Alabama\nWhere you had kind of a Tea Party candidate kind of a constitutional is Canada national a nationalist nationalist populist candidate\nAnd then you get more sort of a traditional Republican Party establishment guy you get these bruising primaries and we're not done with this this has been going on\nWhat we've really seen is a lot going back all the way the two thousand ten in Republican primaries and the question is can you get\nCan you get your\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\nThe Democrats would suffer I mean look at look at what um\nNader did to Al Gore but for Ralph Nader running in two thousand\nAl Gore would have one that we wouldn't have ... you wouldn't have gone to the secretary of state was in Florida there would have been no hanging chads that races over let's turn to Tennessee my my prediction at this point unless something dramatic changes my prediction at this point is\nThat Arizona goes to Martha McSally that I've Republican holes that seat which would be important\nThe national folks are are are weighing in and helping where they can like Sally plays nice with the establishment so she's not a candidate that the establishment is going to turn on kicker out of the boat so my guess is they pour some resources in their toward the end they really focused on her military record which is impressive\nUm they focus on keeping that seat Republican and she's a woman if it works you were a man dish she could be hit by a woman as you know we need another woman in the Senate but she's not\nSo if if I were to say right now I think Arizona holes that the Republicans Tennessee has been an interesting see during all of this\nMarsha Blackburn the congressman\nAppears to have pulled out in front I don't know how you pronounce this guy's name breeds and I see it written but I don't I don't know how you breathe isn't or breeds and B. R. E. D. E. S. A. yet it doesn't matter because market Marsha Blackburn is going to win that\nRight now of Fox News or let's say a New York times had a live poll the New York times is doing this deal where they're calling people and as the calls come in they're posting which is an interesting kind of a real time it's almost like when Frank Luntz does the\nThe uh the the surveys where they have you know six or eight or ten or twenty people and and they have the meters and\nAs they vote you get to see you know like you get to watch them watch a debate and see what they like and don't why well\nThis thing's pretty neat what what New York times is doing I just don't trust the New York times but they've got um they've got Blackburn with a twenty point lead\nUm\nThey've got her with a with a sorry I'm Eighteen percentage point lead fifty seven thirty not Tennessee is a red state it's a Republican state this is Bob Corker seat\nTennessee has been cursed with to squish Republicans Corcoran immoral or Alexander\nAnd I think Tennessee is a more conservative state than the senators they've had they've had Jeff Flake style senators and I think the state is much more conservative than that I just do\nOnce you get outside of Nashville I don't think national itself is is terribly conservative as most big cities are and it's a big city full of artist so I think you've got a bunch of\nYou got a bunch or granola conservative types skinny jeans\nIt was wearing a liberal folks who liked to act like their country but they're actually Austin, Texas or San Francisco liberals anyway I think Marsha Blackburn wins that the national media has fallen for the issue that that uh\nTaylor Swift has broken her silence on politics and she's done with the mob demanded she's gone with a Democrat interestingly a Democrat who in two thousand five had some serious sexual harassment allegations in his office\nAnd she did this just after the Kavanaugh hearings so that's kind of an odd choice and by the way the guy she went for said he would have voted yes for capital because he sees riding on the wall he's looking at the same polling number we are except he's looking at a lot more polling numbers\nRemember these guys have a lot more polling data up to date sooner than you do so by the time you see a poll that says hey Heidi Heitkamp losing\nIn North Carolina I'm In North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp the Democrat incumbent is losing in North Dakota and the people of North Dakota want Kavanaugh by the time you see it she's had it for days\nShe's had time to change her opinion or change our public positions\nNever forget how much polling data these people have access to in real time they pay people a lot of money to do focus groups and see where they should come down on these issues and they don't make a statement on it before that and I'll tell you this I'm Glad Susan\nCollins went with with a Kevin all but I guarantee you Susan Collins was looking at polling data that showed that the people in her state wanted Kavanaugh\nThat doesn't minimize how difficult it was for her as a woman to come out in favor of him especially when she was targeted so heavily but it does mean that the support is there and and they're going to talk\nAbout Susan Rice running against or they can run Taylor Swift or Susan Rice or a Lena Dunham or whoever else they want to drag out\nThe fact is the fact is Susan Collins is popular in Maine Susan Collins voted with the conservatives and the state of Maine has a fierce streak of independence\nAnd they don't like to be bullied by other folks so when Susan Collins comes out and says they tried to illegally bribe me\nWhen stories appear about them sending three thousand coat hangers to her when she has to take back alley entrances to get into the Capitol when she talks about how awful it's banned and she's been intimidated and threatened\nMaybe Susan Collins is paying people to do that because you are absolutely positively ensuring that she's going to be reelected I'm kidding she's not she's not a paying people to do that\nBut she is having to put up with help from the left and if they think they're going to bully this woman into ... she's no she doesn't sit down when she pays like Jeff like she's not going to be intimidated [noise]\nAnd she's going to be reelected in twenty two and [noise]\nTraffic on TALK radio six forty double
