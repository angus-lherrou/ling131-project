December ... the former ... story Shaun\nMarshmallow lead you to record the wrong way and yours ... presented by capital on\nThe moon mission bumps and\nWe're back with the Dell wants a radio show this is Len Merlin today we'd been working on your financial freedom during our conversation with Peggy in Leo and how they've\nDistinguish some of the timeless life lessons that will help us succeed uh\nFrom the ideas that we need to transform it into order to make our dreams and our desires of reality and so they grew up in entrepreneurial families ah Peggy grew up with some some belief systems about I'm being debt free very common and in in some entrepreneurial families\nI'm Leo grew up with commercial real estate seeing the power of real estate but never really being taught the power of real estate\nAnd they both ended up in corporate jobs um and doing a variety of things Peggy made her way to the top and and retired pretty much when her her salary cap to Leo had his own business\nBut didn't want to grow it any further it has to end at some point unless you just want to work in the business until the day you die unless you're going to create a huge team and then manage that team and it wasn't something we all wanted to do\nAnd so now with all this life experience they found themselves you know looking out on on to the horizon in uncharted territory and cast about a little bit we're really looking for something in during something where they can find their place in the world where they could use the things they that they had learned\nAnd transform\nAll of that in to a great retirement living the life they want it which didn't include managing people\n... working in a business right Leo I'm so tell us a little bit out\nAbout the results you've had you know you you join lifestyles unlimited you've been members for a couple of years now and talk to us about how your life is now and what you're doing on a day to day basis as a result\nWhen I I Love it I mean we don't have to worry about fighting the traffic [laughter] um we uh you know we office out of our homes um\nWe just have kind of a piece about it um the thing about it we have learned a skill set on how to invest in apartment complexes and I never dreamed I always thought if you are going to be a passive investor in an apartment that you had to be there and institutional investors are\nAre from the very wealthy family and we're not on a more small guys and actually we're in an apartment complex that the you know almost like eight hundred units I mean we're a tiny percentage fraction and the deal\nBut we've been able to get into that deal and\nAnd really I mean\nI think about if one of the got sick couldn't work or maybe both of us that the money that we're making the passive income kids coming in so we don't have to worry about that because there's somebody leading the projects delete investor which I think in the industry most\nFirms column sponsor investors they're taking care of everything there they're finding the apartment complex they're managing it are finding somebody to manager for them so we just have a certain case about us than we know we're we're going and and really\nAs we get into details and we briefed by\nUm that deal then that means that like let's say I'm just\nDoing an arbitrary figure let's say we put a hundred thousand and we might on a re fi get the hundred thousand back we might get a percentage a smaller percentage of it we might even get a bigger percentage of it and so we're still in that deal we're still making that\nThat income in that bill but we're able to use the money from the re fi to get into more deals so our first year we were able to get into an\nApartment complex was well now we've had as many as like Seventeen complexes that were invested in and that's the churning effect of the race by\nOur or spelling and so we right now we own sixteen because we still one and that was a situation where we did what they call it ten thirty one exchange and that's where\nYou had we had a complex and we tried it up\nAnd in this case we traded up to two more complex as\nWell okay so let's say we put a hundred thousand in that first um\nApartment complex there's an investment well we had an equity gain of Seventy one percent so when we do that first complex and traded up into two\nMore complex as we had now a hundred and Seventy one thousand to invest and we didn't really even have to put a penny into the deal that we handed over it was already in there\nAnd we went from a complex the close to two hundred thousand\nToo too complex which total about um a five hundred year that I think the two hundred thousand and we went from a complex with two hundred units too too complex that equaled five hundred unit and so what that means there's the cash flow increases and um we changed like\nIt it was a on one of 'em they occupied at the it was eighty three percent and delayed investors gotten that up to Ninety three percent and then on the other complex that we traded into we found out that oracle was moving within a half mile\nA bar investment and they were bringing in five thousand employed so it's it's just been great or start started about it [noise]\nLeo and what is it done for you know how is it how it changed your life what are you doing day to day now that you weren't doing before\nOr when you know on Iraq

to vote on election day you can imagine the various reasons they get hospitalized they get called out of town on worked unavoidable\nTheir kid gets terribly ill they don't want to leave them there in an auto accident you name it it happens and then you don't get to vote in your vote counts it matters especially your vote\n'cause you're the smart voters we don't have enough of you so we need every one of you to vote vote early vote straight Republican ticket it matters\n[noise] I've been asking folks to uh\nTell me about your voting experiences T W writes I went to the Jersey village decision the greater Houston area\nTo the Jersey village polling location at about eleven this morning nothing unusual everything went very smoothly I did not vote straight Republican ticket this time I could not cast my vote for the Alamo destroyer joy\nBush instead I voted for the libertarian candidate may I suggest you advise the voters to do the same we should not disturbed that hallowed ground\nYeah my problem with telling people to vote in anything other than straight party ticket is to that gets lost in the translation so while I think George Bush has done an awful job I Would rather when the seats that matter the most important seats that matter and deal with him in the future so I'm asking people to vote straight Republican\nRamona and I went to cast their votes today and we're very happy to do so\nUm when you say remind was there anything about\nOur voting experience that you would like\nUs to share just for the women in front of us were very attractive I don't know how this happened but we had um one woman in very tight\nYoga pants I mean restricting a circulation short of tight yoga pants and tennis shoes I'm very muscular I'm home or should I say I'm probably thirty eight year old black woman\nUm she she wasn't talking anybody though unfortunately we kept trying to make her eyes make small talk um the other was the what do you take that role was Hispanic\nWoman that was too in front of us\nYeah um she was very attractive and and for some reason I said something inappropriate that Ramon chest asked me for I noted to him that she had beautiful hands in addition to many of our other features and he thought that was weird but you know what to each his own Lisa writes\nI live in Houston I listen to you mostly on the podcast because I Love to skip

enjoy your music you're talk of food family I'm standing in line to vote at the third precinct on on worked\nThere was a flipping traffic jam and a really long line it's raining outside and it should deter people this was earlier this afternoon\nBut you can't keep determined to people down as I look around and catch the eye of others\nTrade that knowing grand no dog whistle it's a battle cry I have a bet with my office if everyone will vote on making a huge pot of ham with beans even if they vote the wrong side happy days sorry said oh you're not gonna win\nLeaves the Castro and I have been

ticket Republican from St Lucia and there you have it that's Glenda Lisa you're on the Michael berry she'll go ahead dear [noise] hello yeah\nHi I wanted to call in and say that I really believe that the entire package bomb in it that it is a political thing is that flak\nFrom that job not not campaign and being used flak from the whole caravan thing that's not working for them\nOkay are you are not the first person to say that Dave go ahead [noise]\nHey so I won't let\nYou have an open Saturday and Sunday you know extra day that you should be able to find out on Saturday So you shouldn't be able to go out and\nThat is correct thank you Dave I'm for those of you in Texas anyway I I don't want to speak to other states and get it wrong\nIf you need to vote on the weekend um\nYou because for whatever reason you can't get to the polls during the week\nSaturday is seven eight to Seventy in Harris County anyway I Know that to be true and then Sunday is one to six you can look it up in the county in which you live the voter registrar the elections officer of record in your county or perish\nWill uh will have will post your voting location Ramona now when how\nLong do you think it it didn't take long enough because we were staring at these two women in front of us we would have been happy if we could have stayed in line longer to be completely honest [noise]\nUm how long but Fifteen minutes I think it was less than I think it was ten maybe ten [noise] um\nIt was really easy um I always get a lot of emails from folks on these voting machines and you know if you're convinced the voting machines are crooked corrupt wired when that's your business or you know I'm Sorry that I don't devote enough time for you on that it is true that it's tricky little machine\nAnd it is true that you need to go slowly I admit I get a bit of anxiety when it comes to the machine because I Want to make sure that my vote is cash correctly and I suspect others do too because my vote matters I take my vote very seriously it might just be one vote but I take very seriously um my choice\nAs to who is going to fill the seat and serve in a row and I want to make sure that my voice is heard properly so I Do I I go through very slowly and I cast my vote and then I go back\nWhere it gives you a chance to review it and I go tedious Lee line by line by line Ramon you don't because you're waiting outside and you kind of rush through it you're that kid that turns his paper into early and went through the whole thing and cast my vote and there's a good feeling I stuck my I voted sticker on my forehead today because\nI wanted everybody to know [noise]\nAnd I think it's important\nUh you don't want to get hokey but I I Do I find that to be a very important Mike Europe yeah\nHey Michael how are you doing good hey let me tell you what I\nI was thinking about this most of the day before I went to vote and I'm telling you I think this whole situation is just a little bit to queen it's almost like a part of a psychological operations plan where it's\nOne of those if this then that thanks so at the caravan didn't work now they try this and you notice that every one is very prominent and they all ended\nUp they're supposed to target at the same time but what concerns me about all this is this is not effective\nI I I fear that it might be a democratic operative where they you know knocked a prominent people that know about this but I think this is not effective Nancy Pelosi said it a week ago you know from there's going to be some collateral damage I fear somebody's going to get hurt at some point and this is the same party they\nTry to blame then got on a video tape for awhile\nInteresting so you think it is a democratic operative who's doing this but not coordinated at the highest levels\nI think that's exactly right I think there's some plausible deniability that kind of built in and I think that it's probably somebody who's young and likes to think they're big on strategy but those of us who've lived a long time and seeing how some of these things work is\nIt fear I fear that if there's always the next step in the plant that if this doesn't work then something else is already lined up and it's just\nTo clean to have these specific individuals and twelve days before election day getting these packages all at the same time and I I think that if in fact\nIf this was some nut out there will have an arrest by Monday because the police and the law enforcement people looking at that are really I think they're that good and coming from the military background is myself I really think they're that good but this is in fact an operative word for political\nA game of some sort where no one was ever intended to get hurt I don't think anyone is going to get arrested conflict will find out\nDo you think that they want to say and say that last line well\nI think that if I think the the first responders and the Alcohol Tobacco and firearms people in the ... I think they're really good such that if this was in fact intended to hurt somebody and we're really a real threat I think they'll have an arrest by next week\n... okay so so they're they're let me unpack that\nYou think this was orchestrated by a Democrat operative do you think that anybody was intended to be harmed\nNo sir I Know guys not not this time but what I what I fear is that if this plan\nOr if this story does not play the way that they wanted it to a I think that I'm fearful that they might her one of their own and call it collateral damage him and blame it on trial I mean I don't think your language actually John anymore to harmony in than what some of the other people upset you know you stuck it up and people are so\nRight yeah no no and I got I don't mean to suggest your opinions on for now I'm really want to get to your thoughts on who did this and what you what you believe they did what what they intended to do so you think they meant to frighten America\nAnd and maybe get an immediate boost in the polls the sympathy vote but not have to actually harm anyone because they would be supporters of these people that that's what I think and they're very interesting my very interesting [noise]\n\n\nTraffic on TALK radio six forty WG as the\nGood eating they're still working on the leftovers on a greyhound bus spying from this afternoon\nThe punch line on ET by more than ...\nJimmy Carter boulevard and the other is giving trapping slope right there near shallow heard all the way up towards Jimmy Carter before it starts to let go just altogether\nRent tropic backed up onto any by that spaghetti junction born a north bound up buddy love Abernathy will be blocked in mind at nine or ... under construction work to be it'll reopen in the morning at five and the harsh will be in the regular season so I was really renovated state bar Marino so expect traffic\nDowntown streets and the ... member on TALK radio six border you know did you as the [noise]\nMake sure you tune into home radio every Saturday morning at nine AM on TALK radio six forty WG S T joined Cheryl came sparks king and a lot and Josh Moffat of silver mortgage as they discuss real estate in Atlanta\nJoined us for the old timers association walk to end the old timers go to A L Z dot org slash walk to register for an event near you together we can handle\nAtlanta jingle bombs twenty Eighteen present divide capital what happens on December ... starring Sean ...\nAre on sale to everyone right now [laughter]\nGet yours and be more to the Atlanta jingle twenty eight presented by Capitol line\nDog radio six forty WG honesty in ...

profile jobs several in a row\nHe had come to campus and I want to say it was on the campus of LSU but I it doesn't matter which campus it was and he was coming to give a speech and a Lenski\nHad the a socialist students there the radicals had them by outfits are fashion outfits as if they were Klan members\nAnd he had them make signs and they kept all of this quiet he had them make signs that said the KKK loves George Bush George Bush's our guy George Bush will you know carry out our agenda we love George Bush\nAnd they they got all their gear on and as George Bush came across the campus Lewinsky tells the story with great glee\nAs as Bush comes across the campus to speak to the students\nThis whole group of seeming clans members Klan members come out with all their science\nThe media is there and they get this photo of Bush being endorsed in and cheered for by what appears to be the Klan it's actually Clarence Bixby and his ilk probably ah it's what's\nIt if you don't know who's
