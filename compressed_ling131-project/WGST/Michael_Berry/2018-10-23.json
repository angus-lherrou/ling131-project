she was unable to as the\nWar was the moon mission bumps and\nWe're back with the Dell wants a radio show this is Len Merlin today we'd been working on your financial freedom during our conversation with Peggy in Leo\nAnd how they've distinguish some of the timeless life lessons that will help us succeed uh\nFrom the ideas that we need to transform it into order to make our dreams and our desires of reality and so they grew up in entrepreneurial families ah Peggy grew up with some some belief systems about I'm being debt free very common and in in some entrepreneurial families\nI'm Leo grew up with commercial real estate seeing the power of real estate but never really being taught the power of real estate\nAnd they both ended up in corporate jobs um and doing a variety of things Peggy made her way to the top and and retired pretty much when her her salary cap to Leo had his own business\nBut didn't want to grow it any further it has to end at some point unless you just want to work in the business until the day you die unless you're going to create a huge team and then manage that team and it wasn't something we all wanted to do\nAnd so now with all this life experience they found themselves you know you know looking out on on the horizon and in uncharted territory and cast about a little bit and we're really looking for something in during something where they can find their place in the world where they could use the things they that they had learned\nAnd transform\nAll of that in to a great retirement living the life they wanted which didn't include managing people\n... working in a business right Leo I'm so tell us a little bit out\nAbout the results you've had you know you you join lifestyles unlimited you've been members for a couple of years now and talk to us about how your life is now and what you're doing on a day to day basis as a result\nLynn I I Love it I mean we don't have to worry about fighting the traffic [laughter] um we uh you know we office out of our homes um we just have kind of a piece about it um the thing about it we have learned a skill set\nOn how to invest in apartment complexes and I never dreamed I always thought if you are going to be a passive investor in an apartment that you had to be there an institutional investors\nAre from the very wealthy family and we're not on a more small guys and actually we're in an apartment complex that the you know almost like eight hundred unit I mean we're tiny Crispin attraction and the deal\nBut we've been able to get into that deal and and really I mean\nI think about if one of the guts to couldn't work or maybe both of us that the money that we're making the passive income kids coming in so we don't have to worry about that because there's somebody leading the projects delete investor which I think in the industry most\nFirms column sponsor investors they're taking care of everything there they're finding the apartment complex they're managing it are finding somebody to manager for them so we just have a certain case about us than we know we're we're going\nAnd and really as we get into details and we re fi\nUm that deal then that means that like let's say I'm just doing an arbitrary figure let's say we put a hundred thousand and we might on a re fi get the hundred thousand back we might get a percentage a smaller percentage of it we might even get a bigger percentage of it and so we're still in that deal we're still making that\nThat income in that bill but we're able to use the money from the re fi\nTo get into more deals so our first year we were able to get into an apartment complexes will now we've had as many as like Seventeen complexes that were invested in and that's the churning effect of the ...\nAre are selling and so we right now we own sixteen because we still one and that was a situation where we did what they call at ten thirty one exchange and that's where you had we had a complex and we tried it up\nAnd in this case we traded up to two more complex as\nWell okay so let's say we put a hundred thousand in that first um\nApartment complex there's an investment well we had an equity gain of Seventy one percent so when we sold that first complex and tried it up and to to\nMore complex as we had now a hundred and Seventy one thousand to invest and we didn't really even have to put a penny into the deal that we handed over it was already in there\nWe went from a complex to close to two hundred thousand too too complex there's which total about um\nA five hundred unit I think the two hundred thousand we went from a complex with two hundred units too too complex that equaled by hungry unit and so what that means there's the cash flow increases and um we changed like\nIt was a on one of them the occupancy was eighty three percent and the late investors gotten that up to Ninety three percent and then on the other complex that we traded into\nWe found out that oracle was moving within a half mile of our investment and they were bringing in five thousand employees\nSo it's it's just been great were so excited about it [noise]\nLeo and what is it done for you know how is it has it changed your life what are you doing day to day now that you weren't doing before\n\nOr um you know funny or just the other day I remember about it and it was a way or the or order and\nIt was maybe about ... park after I'd gotten up at

I Can't build my ... I got to have Ted Cruz there and I'm asking\nFor you guys who support\nMe to support him and I think that message was made loud and clear but what I notice\nAnd this is the reason Trump won when two years ago today Nate Silver said there was an eighty six percent chance that Hillary Clinton\nWins the presidency two weeks from the election two weeks out last year or two years ago ... silver why respected pollster\nIn every time president would pause he would scream lock her up\nI don't like Hillary Clinton I Do think she's committed crimes and I would like to see her pursued\nBy the criminal justice system because I think it destroys morale I think there was a rocked in the body politic\nWhen an individual at that high level is allowed to get away with what I think she got away with\nBut to scream lock her up while the president is talking about the various planks of his platform was at a minimum distracting\nEveryone around me would turn and look at the guy he's having a great time he's under the influence of nothing 'cause they didn't sell in the alcohol and he's been waiting all day for the seat\nAnd I kinda giggled inwardly thinking to myself that gosh probably felt shut out by the political process his entire life to the extent even had an interest in by God he feels empowered tonight\nNow do I wish she'd quit screaming yeah I'd actually like to hear what the president has to say but I can also recognize that\nHe's pretty excited maybe he's all jacked up all Mountain Dew\nHe fell at that moment that that guy up there on the stage speaks for him and I bet you he's never felt that way before in his entire life\nHe felt in bold and empowered he felt comfortable being able to screen things out\nSome of the other things he screamed out some F bombs totally inappropriate in a place like that awful nobody stopped him\n'cause nobody wanted to kill the moment he was haven't\nNo I Would tell you when I hear things like that I cringe\nCringe because I don't want that to be projected as what Republicans are not because I'm embarrassed that he's got awful\nTeeth cheap hair cut\nIs obviously worked outside his entire life he's probably aged far more than his number of years he's not had an easy life you can see it on his face\nYou could tell it in his countenance but at this moment he's proud of who in what he is and he knows what he is what he is not\nWhat has tended to happen in the past is that the media has cast that guy in a light\nAs if he is nothing as if he is useless as if he is a\nBad person and truthfully\nThe Republican Party is very discreetly kept him at a distance because he's the embarrassing cousin he's the uncle who drinks a little too much\nSo he was allowed to vote but never be too close to the stage because he might disagree mount an F bomb\nMy friend Nick Searcy fantastic actor director has compared Trump\nUsing or has has blamed Trump I guess\nSomebody will go somewhere with a broken toes was that delayed used that\nSlow on the danger because of a broken into wow [noise]\nMy friend ... has [noise]\nExplained Trump and I think brilliantly using\nThe vehicle of the wrestling world which Nick has been a lot of time\nI'll never forget when when I saw the the video of of Trump and uh what's the guy's name that he that he body slams Vincent man\nBut Trump understands how to put on the show he understands how to excite had an insight\nAn ex site he understands how to rally people there were people screaming at that rally last night that I bet you have never screamed at a political rally before last night\nRepublicans have traditionally typically put up candidates who talk about guns and gun and patriotism and how the Democrats are bad people and completely bored to tears\nTrump understands what moves that guy now wherever you are on the educational totem pole socio economic manners culture which are putting quotes high culture\nRefinement sophistication civil civilized behavior whatever you want to call it\nI Will posed this question why is it that American politics has celebrated the efforts by the Democrats to reach out to poor blacks\nTo reach out to poor Hispanics\nBring them into the political process\nAnd make offers to them not always on the basis of the most high minded ambition not always on a visionary aspirational basis sometimes on the basis that don't you hate widely 'cause he sure hate you but it's okay because these are poor black people that we're finally getting excited about the political\nProcess so why is it wrong to reach out to poor white people\nWhy is it wrong to reach out to the working class white guy why is it wrong when he feels good about himself\nBecause the media\nAre white liberal elites and some of them come from some of those families
