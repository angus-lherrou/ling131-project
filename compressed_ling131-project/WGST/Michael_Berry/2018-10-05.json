westbound your Ashford Dunwoody road did slows traffic down a little medicine were coming over from doorbell trying to get through somebody farther north down slow but not looking too bad for a friday afternoon as you're headed up through Sandy Springs and we just got word of humans do they have cleared bad accident\nOn nine eighty five north down your friendship road all Marines have been reopened the traffic is still pretty heavy coming off eighty five ... ... talk Radio's exporting Ali G Estee\nMore conventional wisdom says you know the man on a mission to retire America One version added bumps and he\nWill go back to do ... radio show today we're discussing six different reasons why real estate\nInvesting or the investment in real estate is more profitable than any other types of investments other than maybe owning your own business all a Bill Gates or um ... anybody Warren Buffett who owns Berkshire Hathaway\nUh those types of businesses or any business for that matter run correctly is going to have the highest rate of return\nOut there but real estate is one of those same just right there where the uh the next two we've done one through four so far first one was capital ... was captured act we second one was cash flow third one was appreciation fourth one was forced appreciation and number five is capital gains\nUm when you look at a piece of real estate\nYou have something called capital gains it is not cash flow and it's not ordinary income\nAnd when you pull this money out it gets taxed at a lower tax rate\nOr it doesn't get taxed at all now we can take and force appreciation or forced a capital gain through real estate where you buy stock there's nothing you can do to force a capital gain we can force that capital gain\nBy improving the quality of the property or just improving the management of the property\nNow written this capital gains curves what's different for us is that we don't have to sell the property to capture the capital game we can refinance the money out the money that comes out is tax free so I'll give you an example we buy property\nFor a million dollars we put two hundred thousand dollars down we get eight hundred thousand dollar loan\nAnd we go in there and we increase the income by just ten percent so the income was three hundred thousand a year a minus two hundred and expenses which gave us a hundred thousand dollars and not operating income that that are bringing in comes the amount of money we learn\nIf we own the property free and clear\nAnd that after all expenses so we make a hundred grand a year now we take that up by ten percent two hundred and thirty thousand by increasing the sales from three hundred to three thirty\nDrop to the bottom line three hundred and thirty thousand dollar a hundred and thirty thousand dollars income now makes the property worth one point three million dollars\nWe now go back to the bank to say like a new eighty percent loan and they give us a loan for a one million fifty which is eighty percent of that one point three and then we pay off the old ... eight hundred thousand dollars what do we walk away with this two hundred and fifty thousand dollars tax free\nAnd I remember we had to pay fifty thousand closing costs to do the first trans actually we have ... fifty thousand do the second transect or actually a little less than that but it all with all would basically comes out to about a hundred percent gain\nHow long does it take to make that game well in some cases property small enough we can get that all the stuff done that needs to be done to turn that around within six months larger property might take a year\nReally large property might take two years longest one I ever did was Eighteen months and in Eighteen months uh we made the property go up you know should we bought it at a thousand or door we put forward and if we owned it for twelve we sold it for thirty five so uh from\nFifteen to thirty five twenty thousand dollars a door\nUm type of game\nThat's a lot of money especially since it was like three hundred and twenty units or something like that so it was a it was a massive gain again just round those numbers off you don't have to have specific actual numbers to conceive what I'm Talking about\nBut the very simple fact is now is in this case we did sell this property but before we saw that we did a refinance and we pulled out that equity tax free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey only like the women who do what they're told\nIf women are independent and cast their own votes as they see fit it sort of like it or Hillary Clinton after she lost the election saying nasty things about the women who didn't vote for her\nDemocrats are going back to my husband even before but just in recent times going back to bill and and and uh\nOur candidates and then President Obama had been losing the white vote including white women uh we do not do well with white men and we don't do well with married white women\nUm and part of that is a an identification with the Republican Party\nA and a um a dirt of ongoing pressure a to\nA vote the way that your husband your boss uh your son whoever uh believes you should and what happened in my election is I was on the way to winning I'm white women\nUntil [noise] former director of the FBI Jim Comey dropped that are very ill advised letter on October the twenty eighth in my numbers just went down because all and I heard a lot of anecdotal evidence about those people have written about it\nAll of a sudden you know white women who were going to vote for me and frankly standing up to the men in their lives and the men in their workplaces\nAre we're being told she's going to jail\nYou know you don't want to vote for her you know it can be terrible you can't vote for that so it just it stopped by momentum and it decreased my vote\nA enough because I was I was I had I was winning and I thought I had my way back in the ten days from that letter until\nOn the election I felt a little bit short and so I think that it it was part of the historical trend that I was walking and then it collapsed on me\n[laughter] you know who like beer

recommend to people that's been our mentors out there sitting in the name of that book again um I don't have the book and I'm going to get it but we were talking I was saying you know\nIt it took me a

is a true today but [noise] Astros you've lost three eight zero taxes are good\nKnow when you know\nWearing name drinking\nA ...\nYear old Michael Mary she'll go ahead I mean yeah and that's just\nA ... and then the thing about the people that just can't be happy and man I just divorced on rather got divorced from the ones that started happening I was just like so relieved I'm married ... years stay at home mom\nOr we are salary the last year that we initiated everything with the freaking quarter of a million dollars and she thought she had problems at all the other people have way worse problems but er I guess you got to be unhappy about something I never been happier in my life to have that that's the other dog\nYou know there are\nWho let's take television music\nWe'll Cher parenting all of it there are people who were drawn toward darkness\nThere are glass half empty people and and I think that's that's just\nTheir natural disposition they're drawn toward negativity\nAnd you have to explain it in economic terms to understand that those people are only happy they only gain utility from negativity and in fact you see this a lot on the left the left sees happiness and its manifestations\nAs Pollyanna they see it as unsophisticated they see being happy\nAs not being sufficiently concerned about the woes of the world\nAnd they see being very sad\nMoribund uh I'm\nDark as being\nIn tune with the problems of the world and that's why they never stop funding problems it might be plastics draws it might\nBe a a Boko Haram taking little girls it might be a\nTax policies inequalities illegals need the come they're going to find something to be unhappy about and sometimes they'll split their loyalty but they like to have one thing they have convinced themselves\nI mean if you watch they have convinced themselves that Brett Kavanaugh sitting on the Supreme Court is going to be the end of the world and they have so worked\nThemselves into a fervor it's sort of disappointing\nThat he's not going to be as awful as they've convinced them so it kind of be nice if he was just sort of Darth Vader figure and he wouldn't wear black robe you just come in and his black tape and all and he'd sit down\nYou know that it'd be it James Earl Jones do as do his voice and and well he when he would ask a question or make a statement you hear the heavy breathing new your father and he'd do it from the bench that'd be fantastic\nI mean it it's almost as if\nKavanaugh on the bench they're going to move past that and a year from now that things which they thought was going to be the end of the world won't be\nBut it's not that they're ever going to double back and go you know what [laughter] is this kind of silly I'm embarrassed to admit it but I mean I really thought I thought everybody was going to die I felt when Kavanaugh\nOnce he became a Supreme Court ...
