smell\nOr not get yours in the morning the land and single on twenty eight presented capitalize the\n[noise] love your back you know here's some more conventional wisdom says you know the man on a mission to retire America One person at a guy bumps and he\nWill go back to do on the radio show today we're talking about how you've been educated\nOr out of success you have been brainwashed into mediocrity and that you no longer have any ability to do critical thinking to think outside of the box you figure out things for yourself in a manner that would allow you to become financially successful\nFinancially free so third article I'm going to bring up and says almost Seventy percent of millennials regret buying their homes here's why\nAnd it goes on and talks about the fact of liberals are really upset about owning a home but first of all talks about the number of millennials that on their home and it says right now it looks like forty six percent of millennials on their home one percent stay with their friends\nAnd get a little more light on that a ... percent stay with their parents I'm Sorry forty two percent on their own home forty six percent rent a and ... percent stay with their parents were present station for him\nAnd are these millennials decided that they made some\nReally bad mistakes in buying a home Seventy percent of them be like they've made a very bad mistake in purchasing their home so let's talk about the mistakes that belt that they made\nAnd this talk about why they made them the number one mistake that feel like they made is they feel like they put too much down on their personal residents they'll that's a very logical thing to figure out after you do it but in the beginning\nEvery pundit you run into\nYour mother your father your cousin your attorney or a CPA your doctor your financial planner all we are going to tell you put as much down as you possibly can to get your payments as low as you can add to get this they paid off as quickly as you can\nWhat they do they end up creating a cash poor environment and\nSecondly they create an environment where they have no income and they can never get back that money that they save their life savings to put down around our house\nWhat should have done two things completely differently and always someone to actually understands why money finance which is none of the people I just mentioned I guarantee you know financial planner out there is smart enough to understand is\nWhat they should have dealt with taking all of that money they put down and bought rental income so now they have more income to pay the mortgage should know whip\nAnd they have three or four times the assets working for them number to an owner occupant can get into a home for zero down so they can still have a home so you've now got the asset of your personal residence accumulating\nA appreciation mortgage pay down all the benefits tax benefits\nWhich have been taken away by the way uh to some extent a ... and you also had these rental properties and for you know six hundred and think about six hundred thousand dollar house\nThat these guys are talking about if they put twenty percent down which would be the typical down payment you know\nGod I Can't even do that math is so insane or or a minus six hundred and eighty thousand dollar house\nTen percent down would be sixty eight thousand dollars you could have gone out and bought for rent houses with that twenty percent down would be\nA hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty thousand dollars you could have bought you know eight rent houses with that think of if they put twenty percent down they could have bought a red houses made five hundred dollars a house\nAnd be making four thousand dollars a month more casual towards that mortgage payment towards just through life for that matter he wouldn't need to drive ... if he made forty eight thousand dollars a year tax free\nBy his rental properties remember tax free forty thousand is equivalent to that sixty nine thousand they both earned by having jobs\nSo they're insane to put that money down on the house is just insanity no guys send me emails you know they're just oh you do is yellow people are yell at you because you're not listening you're not paying attention as the successful\nPeople will get wealthier wealthier wealthier and you're seeing that the smart people in our society are educated people educated in finance are getting wealthier every single day year month whatever\nAnd the middle class has gone back to what they're saying the middle class is gone now second\nThing about owning a home is they buy to larger home we've all been taught our entire lives by the largest home you could possibly afford right because then over Thirty years you'll pay it off it would be your largest asset\nWhile Gomez Iraq your dollhouse poor you can't afford the payments and the second largest thing that they're complaining about is not the payments they knew the paper's going to be it's the upkeep and maintenance the reason forty six percent\nOf millennials live or read in an apartment is because when they call the apartment for maintenance there's a maintenance guy to come fix stuff now\nI just got off the phone with another person in my neighborhood and we're sitting here fighting with the landscape crews that have been doing our neighborhood per year they just crippled the cost of landscaping the cost of my landscaping on my house is more than most people pay for the personal home residents mortgage payment\nAn automobile payments each month that's my landscaping and yet\nWhat happened was that because they just tripled became wasn't that much before but they're just tripled that and so a couple of names all of which are wealthy to live in this neighborhood you up to be smart enough to be wealthy enough to live your right\nGot together and said this was in saying these\nPeople don't know what they're doing\nAnd so we all go out look for some way to solve the problem but really the real problem is what my dad taught me a long time ago when I was a kid and that is is is not what it costs to buy it what it costs to maintain it\nAnd if you go out there by yourself a home before you're financially able and capable to take care of it\nThen you are do mean yourself to a financial disaster for the rest of your life yes my
