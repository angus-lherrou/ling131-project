here's some more conventional wisdom or sets you free\nThe man on a mission to retire America\nWoke up back there last segment Adele wants the radio show if you'd like to call and ask a question in this last segment our number is eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven uh sat next segment here I Want to share something with you I thought was rather interesting\nI found an article a that was stating that it costs more to read that it costs more to own that it does to read\nIn every state in the union every city in the union everywhere and the reason why I thought that the article made sense to bring the brain to you\nIs because people always ask me what do you think that the market to speak\nAnd you know the answer\nYou can look at data in and making predictions that it might be picked it might not be but I can tell you this as long as it's cheaper to rent than it is to own investors are going to continue to buy\nAnd as they continue to buy rentals they're going to drive the price up and they're going to make lots and lots of money doing it they're also going to have lots of positive casual so I was looking at this\nIf somebody has to buy living you know by housing\nWhat would they be willing to pay\nTo go from renting a place to owning a comparable piece of housing and it really blew my mind when I look these numbers so the ... is the key takeaways according to the article\nAnd then I'll come back and I'll speak more specifically about the markets rent\nIt says owning is more expensive everywhere access to all fifty ... days including Washington DC it costs more each month to own a home than to rent the median cost people pay nationwide own a home is fifty four percent more than the median cost or to rent one\nThe smallest differences still third is still a third more to old state where the premium\nTo own a home is the lowest is Florida where it costs a meeting of thirty three percent more to own than to rent the states with the next lowest premiums are Colorado forty percent in Arizona forty one percent so you can see why you know it wouldn't make sense\nFor people even in these areas where you would think they can get housing\nYou know cheaper\nRight then they can't other places it still costs can be at least thirty to forty percent more to own a house\nIt goes on and says in some states it costs of owning is far eclipses across reading in New Jersey state with the highest ownership premium the median monthly cost of owning is nearly doubled that of renting Ninety three percent more to own\nThat it is to read this is just an unbelievable situation Ninety three percent more so it looks to me that there is no time soon that people are going to stop ranting when you can go live for half the price or fifty percent less\nThan why would you want to take the risk of buying a house looks like we have a caller on the line Tom is this the Tom Ziegler\nHello anybody out there ... okay\nThought to have somebody on the line goes up so let's go back to look at the area's local areas here are the first local area a is Texas it cost fifty six percent more to own in Texas than direct\nFlorida's the lowest only thirty three percent premium and Arizona is forty one the second lowest Georgia is the third lowest\nMichigan is fifty two per se and a California sixty two percent\nSixty two percent there so looks like a people are going to be renting for some time in the future it appears at this point uh looks like there's phone lines lit up here is there anybody on the phone\nHello\nLost connection with my engineer it looks like All right so moving on\nLast thing I Want to cover here today is this when you're looking at retiring what you're thinking most of the times how can I save up enough money to be able to retire that's the concept right but the reality\nIs that what you really should be looking at is how can I learned to replace my earned income\nSo that if I Do lose my job if I Do retire my financial situation doesn't get worse it gets better that's the whole goal behind what we do is not create a big pile of money although many of us do\nBut the idea is to replace our earned income we passive
