you know there are a hundred senators\nAnd the Connecticut Compromise\nYet small state should big states forgive me for repeating this and we make sure everybody understands how this happens so when our union was perfected\nAnd consolidated the small states said like New Jersey Marilyn\nNice of you know we come into this union\nVirginia has more people than three or four of us little states combined so they're going to run the union so we're always going to be in the minority if we go about population Virginia has way more New York is way more people than we do Pennsylvania\nSo the Connecticut Compromise allowed\nFor a lower house based on population abortion so Virginia dominated that lower house New York dominated that lower house and the upper chamber of our Congress\nThe Senate every state gets to think about this that means a little dinky states get the same number of senators\nAs the most important state taxes that doesn't make any sense but that's the way it works New York only gets two senators Rhode Island that exactly as many senators as sexist us so you've got a situation in North Dakota\nWhere Heidi Heitkamp\nAccording to the latest poll she is now down\nBy ten percentage points she's an incumbent the urban combat seat in Congress is not to be underestimated\nI'm\nPresident Trump is expected to make multiple visits where a Republican congressman

do and you will since that one\nOf the thing is nobody's things nobody's talking about\nIs that\nThere's almost a plebiscite for the Supreme Court nomination\n\nIt's almost as if we're throwing this nomination directly to the masses because here's the deal\nThey're not very many votes in flux you've got Jeff Flake in Arizona He's a Republican leaves offices in the year Jeff\nFlake future is on MSNBC or CNN Jeff lakes future is being like Brett Stevens or Jennifer Rubin being called\nA conservative being called a Republican and then trashing Republicans there's value in that that's his shtick that's his gimmick right and he knows that and he needs to leave with that in my McCain's funeral\nFor all the talk about his link the careers of senator what did the media to tell you he was a hero for he walked up and gave the thumbs down on repealing Obamacare\nAnd so the people who write the modern history not the long term historian the modern history writers the New York Times columnist the Washington Post columnist\nDid they say he was a maverick who wasn't a maverick he was the swamp but why they called him a maverick\nThey called him a maverick because he win against the Republican Party he went against the people who voted for him he went against the Tea Party he win against the base\nHe basically voted to continue Obamacare\n\nHe voted to continue the signature piece of legislation of the guy who defeated him in two thousand eight\n\nThe single most unifying political issue for Republicans from the spring of two thousand ten when it passed\nUp through the end of two thousand fourteen was repealing Obamacare the residual passion for repealing Obamacare was still high enough\nThat Ted Cruz and the Republicans led the charge to repeal it McCain put to some down\nFor flake he understands that if he votes with Republicans the woman who who are accosted him in the elevator\nArt Sheila she's the head of a four of us are George Soros funded\nLiberal activist organization out of New York she wasn't a member of the general public she wasn't a rape victim writ large who was simply a upset\nShe was placed there and it's my friend Jesse Kelly said notes just like the will of the beast that the uh the tigers are cheetahs pick off from the herd they knew who the weak link was\nThey knew who was the one that the herd would shed they knew the one most likely to be taken down and that's just like\nEven if Republicans lose flake\nThe public opinion over the next couple of days this thing is being battled not for the votes of the senators the senators opinions are derivative of the public rather than their own food generics opinions that they arrive at\nHeidi Heitkamp gotta look at polling data and the one thing politicians care about more than anything else is staying in office and then once they're leaving office the one thing they care about\nIs being able to get paid after they leave office if flake was up for reelection we wouldn't have to worry about his vote\nBut because he's stepping out we do the Democrats have\nThree vulnerable candidates mansion in West Virginia Donnelly in Indiana and hide camp in North Dakota and that's
