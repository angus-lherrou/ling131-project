Mark Foley and mark is a a member out of California in Huntington Beach he's also Southern California bastard her\nAnd Mark I'm happy to get to see you at the party we just had for the ambassador's tell us or what it means to you to be the bachelor\nBut it's a really I Know that you've foster sort of this environment of giving back and that if people are are blessed and different ways to be a part of lifestyles that there are opportunities for us to give back to other people\nAnd so you know I look back and and as I mentioned before Steve Anderson ... warmly welcome to being spent some time with me unanswered questions for me back when I first met him in Palm Springs\nAnd so that's what I've tried to do is um we've had several events out here in Southern California or Southern California group is really starting to grow and expand um last month on July twenty eighth we had a case study and found Valley California\nWe actually had Texas leads move on and ... Sharma flew out and presented their multi family\nHomes to us we all sat Brian I'm Michelle Wolf presenting on single family investing and really I think my job as an ambassador is helping 'em Steve set up a lot of those events but just helping to facilitate helping to be there to welcome new members to be somebody that can answer questions for them um\nTry to help them feel comfortable um in they're investing journey and and just encouraging them along the way I'm so that's really what I see is my main job\nNo Mark I'm as I mentioned the last segment as a mathematician math teacher which you could be a very technical side thinker a you seem to have made most of your ... based on\nThe more emotional and people oriented side the decision curve my question you was when you first came to lifestyles physically getting to touch the people were you surprised how open they were\n[noise] oh definitely I mean you know has a [noise]\nWhen we talk about businesses a lot of businesses are very competitive and they don't want to share with each other you know what their numbers are and you know that's that's the beauty of a case study um investors upfront sharing their actual experiences or with the rest of the members I'm getting to see their\nTheir numbers you know what they invested into a deal what kind of things they did to improve a property what their returns are um and so you know the transparency and and even just talking to other members\nAnd having them share you know how many deals are you in and you know which deals are good which deals have worked out so well I'm you know everything is very transparent and open\nAnd honest and and it's just a great environment to be a part of\nWhat is a truly your wife think about this\nWell you know it's interesting she I wanted her to count as I mentioned before back to the two days seminar in Palm Springs and so she came with me and I'm you know she met\nUm some of the people that I've mentioned before and she got to hear Bryan deferred to the the two days seminar and she understands now you know how this whole process works for the most part you know she doesn't really go to all the events that I go to um she\nWent up ... pm comes in and we're discussing you know whether we should get into a new deal I make sure that I Walk her up and and I'll explain to her all the different parts of this deal and why I think it might be good or not\nAnd then well actually sitting and pray about it last you know got to give us some guidance on our investing and you know that's\nSort of her involvement in it I keep her um\nApprised about what we're doing and and make sure that she's a part of all the decisions [noise] um but she's not his hands on as I Am I I just really love and enjoy the opportunity to get out with like minded investors and discuss things and talk with them and just be a part of all the events\n... contrary to that thought you work in a pension based environment\nWhat are the people around you know of what you're doing and or think about what you're doing if they know\nThat's interesting because I've I've tried to share a few times with people and um you know some of the people that I teach with um are very interested in investing and um\nYou know there are open to listening to some of the ideas that you know I've shared with them\nI think other times I'll talk to people and they'll look at me for like a deer in headlights they don't really you know to think about putting down a large sum of money on an apartment complex can be sort of beyond you know what they normally think about doing [noise] um so\nIt there's mixed reactions I mean some people really started to talk to him and I realized very quickly that it's it's not going to be fruitful and and I just sort of don't go too far with that and other people all share a lot of details with them because they're very interested in an open to learning\nHow about the family\n... family and external at a rally a brother or sister yeah my father\nIn law um is actually came with us to Palm Springs than he is a big number as well and he's invested in twelve or Thirteen bills now himself\nAlthough he's gotten very involved and um my father who live in Florida uh I've shared some of this with him he's more invested in the stock market and\nNot so much in real estate and so you know we've we've talked about that and uh you know family is very supportive on what we're doing I think that um\nYou know it's it's out of the realm of comfort sometimes for people my sister who lives in Cincinnati, Ohio is also a pig member joined after we went and she's in one deal I'm with us so we're both in a deal with Brian button in Atlanta and so I'm\nSo people are very open in my family and very you know interested in what we're doing\nWell that's great really is you know say something Marco through this whole interview\nI've not heard anything any type of skepticism in any way so you're you're definitely\nGoing towards kind of person they just keep looking ahead moving forward guy so that's completely different than me which I'm a skeptic I'm moving away from pain away from trouble\nAway for problems so it's interesting to see the dichotomy of personalities are but you've done well in just continue to do well seven deals and seven months is excellent\nI Want to thank you for a couple of things over one for being on the show today appreciate that sharing your story number two for being a bachelor and for the rest of your house or remember this mark myself and everybody else is not the money it's a lifestyle wonderful day will shoot 'em off\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThink you lose your radio show memory\nJoined seven days a week and good enough reason to go on the radio dot com\nMostly radio show and you know what they're trying to make sure [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd then in twenty twenty and that the only campaigning she would be doing in twenty twenty would be for President Trump\nAnd so hopefully that can put that to rest the biggest sparks came when a reporter asked President Trump about the swearing in of\nBrett Kavanaugh to be an associate justice to the Supreme Court at the White House and of course that Hillary still wishes she was president and so his response I thought was priceless\nWhat's your response saying we're\nI guess that's where she lost [noise]\nShe doesn't get it [noise]\nShe never did I knew that a long time\n\nAnd that was probably the most ... reported statement of the press conference and so\nWith less than a month ago before the midterms President Trump owned the media cycle Hillary Clinton in an interview made some statements that are not being received very well\nWe cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house armed or the Senate that twin civility can started down\nBut until then the only thing that the Republican whom to\nRecognize anger that its strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nWill get back to Hillary Clinton's comments in the next segment because they could not be better timed I think that that just that is just one more element\nThat will fire up the base as we go into the election season today is the last day in the state of Texas to have registered on is to have registered to vote in the mid term elections\nTexas does not have a an online registration that's available now it's also the last day to register in Georgia Kentucky and Tennessee for those of you in Louisiana\nYour last day to register in person was today but you can register online for one more week\nUntil the sixteenth in New York you can register up to twenty five days before the election which is October twelve\nUm but it must be ... you can also register by mail but it must be received\nBy October seven teams\nIn Alabama the rule is Fifteen days before the vote and so you can register up till October twenty second that is also the case in California and through our Oregon affiliate ah by the way\nOregon and Louisiana are ah through October sixteenth so one more week\nAnd for our listeners to K. E. X. eleven Ninety out of Portland, Oregon who live in Washington state your last day to register was yesterday your rule is twenty two days\nBefore the election but you can vote in person until October twenty nine I'm not actually sure how that works\nUm I was going through and looking at the various dates of registration and I saw that\nSo for our state of Washington residence\nUm because that is unclear to me if you are not yet registered or your registration may have lapsed\nChecked that on line there will be resources to each of you depending on your state's I'm asked to win exactly you can vote spent some time on that don't just ask somebody I often get asked questions in passing on the last day to register\nAnd there are often um some technicalities that go into that we will begin early voting before what I typically refer to as election day and I encourage you to early vote it's always easier there are typically more places for you to vote early\nThere is a shorter line than on election day and then if you get posted out of town or out of out of the country or you're sick or relative uh is is sick or it's raining terribly or for whatever reason then you don't miss the opportunity to vote so I'll give you early voting days as we get a little\nBit closer ah because I Would really like to see Republicans hold the house the Senate when some governor's races and\nWe are coming to me the thing if you don't want to entertain the Michael very show\nTraffic on TALK radio six forty double duty as the game and got an accident\nAnd ... down below the Judy find west splits do block and a lot blame is asked to eighty five southbound backed up at Washington relatively pie westbound push back\nIn the Clinton County pass Riverdale road also can be used to land on the moral Dr playing Second Avenue and he's like Dr got a little edge and you're getting up in a stall so mountain\nFreeway you sound like my the park entrance of more trouble just off Seventy ...
