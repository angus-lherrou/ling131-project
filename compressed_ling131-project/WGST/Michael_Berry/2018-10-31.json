time while in polling President Obama said this\nRelease of the Taliban who are being held in Guantanamo was conditions\nOn the cars keeping our eyes on them and creating a structure in which we can

of\nAll the prisoners that were released from Guantanamo Bay certain with that has that takes place [noise]\nUm [noise] I wouldn't be doing it if I thought that it\nWas conflicts of American national security\nAnd then there's breaking now that those five men have left cutter and our back on the battlefield working against us and you wonder why President Trump wins elections\nTake such a ...

the mid to upper fifty pen Thursday increasing plows rain showers maybe even a country stormed with a high temperatures admit seventies then friday rain showers for the first half of the day looking for a high temperature\nIn the sixties and sunny by Saturday I'm chief meteorologist Paul Osman\nThe Michael berry show on TALK radio forty build UGA [noise]\n\nTraumas taken back control of the narrative\nVery cleverly [noise]\nWe're not talking about the nut job down in Florida mailing packages any longer\nAre we were talking about birthright citizenship\n[noise] the president has made that the issue before I get further along on that let's go back to where the Democrats were just a few years ago\nThe Democrats have moved away from a position that I think is at the core of America's set of values this is where the Democratic party moved away from\nTheir base\nAnd they've struggled since then it's why they lost the house the Senate the White House majority of governorships state legislatures here is Dianne Feinstein of all people in Nineteen Ninety four\nWe can enforce our borders I think we should enforce our borders to have a situation\nWhere forty percent of the baby born on Medicaid in California today are born of illegal immigrants create a very real problem for the state\nLaws and procedures we have for our employment process\nIf an employer hires an illegal alien who comes into this country outside our employment laws there is a cost savings to them which gives them a competitive advantage over the businesses to their right to their left\nThat competitive advantage by reducing the labor cost me is that their next door neighbors have to increase the cost of their products without necessarily increasing the quality\nAmerican consumers are very cost sensitive there's an elastic demand based on price\nSo if one company can only produce a product for five dollars to the marketplace due to labor costs but the company beside them can put it on the market for four dollars because they don't have to pay their employees and comply with all these labor laws that they refused to about breaking the law\nThe consumer sees a four dollar product in a five dollar product it doesn't take long for the consumer says\nAs long as there is no different traitor oh by the four dollar doesn't take long until the five dollar products sits and languishing on the shelf and that business goes out of business\nAnd that hurts the American worker\nWho is saddled with all of our labor protections because some people are choosing to cheat the system and hire illegal aliens Colin Powell even admitted that he did it there were three straight attorney general candidates under Clinton who had to withdraw 'cause they had hired illegal alien nannies\nThe Democratic party at one time understood that illegal immigration hurt the poor and working class in this country the most but there came a point where they finally decided\nThat it's going to be our future and the poor and working class will have to keep them screaming racist [noise]\nAnd like all day every show [noise]\n... with the Georgia news network to the Georgia governor's race a bombshell GOP nominee Brian capitalist pulled out of what would have been here ... second TV debate was Democrat Stacey Abrams\nCap was set to campaign apparently with Donald Trump Sunday afternoon and making creating a conflict with a five PM TV debate in Atlanta gal says he offered to reschedule but really didn't get much of anywhere with Abrams cap Abrams accuses Sam bailing out on his commitment of federal jobs\n\n\n\n[noise] traffic on TALK radio six forty build you see as the [noise]\n\n\n\nBut he's on December fourteen that is the former ... story is what you're seeing\nEveryone right now I get your ... and they think of all twenty eighty presented capital what\nHey Atlanta area here joined me weekdays from near and dear to pm to get caught up on the stories of the day the day and Barrett show is live and local and right here on TALK radio six or eight W GST\nFrom warm and wet when I'm seeking a fourth fifth sixth year all just fall off most of the clear skies are born with low temperatures by the ... union made up or fifty cents or a snake increasing plows with the rain showers maybe but it's not just stormed with a high temperatures in the seventies then\nFriday rain and showers for the first half of the day looking for a high temperature in the sixties and sunny by Saturday on chief meteorologist Paul Osman\n[noise] or radio is the easy to use that for music and\nDownload the free I work with us today a\n... two thousand and three\nOf these surveys the exception basic humanitarian\nIllegal immigrant industry\n\nIs an interesting how far they've come isn't it interesting how they've changed their opinion on an issue for\nWhich there's been no real change they just all of a sudden when from saving all the reasons is was terrible too\nNow it's wonderful and anyone who states the same things they said a few years ago is also well that's just silly we're not stupid Claire McCaskill\nWho's in trouble in Missouri classical liberals she was the national chairman ... Brock Obama's campaign\nBeing interviewed about the caravan headed northward toward the United states notice how quickly she jumps in and says and notice how often she says she will work with the president reminder she's a Democrat trailing in her election right now\nThe caravan is getting a lot of attention is on the border and what do you do when they get to the border what do you do I think the president has seen every two only has at his disposal and I know a hundred percent backing up on that whether it is turning and back\nUm because we are not equipped to handle asylum claims in July ... sister um by the way that is one of the issues here we've got a search\nAnd yes technology to address when it comes across the border and they ask us for asylum law says they need to hear on the way too long to hear it we need to hear him right away so I get on our borders out for lunch and I support the president's efforts to make sure they're not\nOne of the caravan members played this for you yesterday but as a reminder one of the caravan members had this to say\nAre you willing to break the law to get back to the United states you'll get all the aid but it was better do it she says he wants to apply for part of town you can they can you ask me what happened\n[noise]\nThird degree felony this and this is in the day and my daughter [noise]\n\nWants to get back to the United states so he could get a part\nSchools now I Would say we might be up twenty we might be up thirty percent we might be at forty percent if we go back down forty percent that's okay too\nThat is a lie let me explain I'm sure you know this and I don't mean to insult your intelligence but I Want to make sure you understand [noise]\nListeners will often say to me the right people that don't like usually on the left they'll say oh well they they very rarely said to me but they'll go on social media sites\nMargot Barrett [laughter] the only reason he says all those things about illegal immigration or crime or a desert as for ratings\nLet's unpack that for a moment if the reason I Do what I Do is because\nA lot of people will listen if I Do\nDoesn't that mean that it's popular let's just assume for a moment that I don't say anything actually mean I just pay under for more people to listen right\nWell if that's the case couldn't anybody do that and more importantly\nDon't we subscribe to the theory that that\nWhich a lot of people consume whether they pay for it or not because you don't pay to listen to the show\nBut you do listen and that does drive up the ratings if that's the case doesn't that mean it's a product people want that's like saying\nYou know tied down only make their detergent because people want to buy it and you know water burger and eating out and McDonalds and Burger King that the only reason they're putting\nCheese and sesame seed buns is because people like to eat it well well yeah that's kinda how that works I mean do you say of a company that goes out of business\nYeah yeah ... no there they were great\nThey regret nobody bought they're proud of what they were great they were true to their mission ... sell anything and then their investors lost their their high eighties but they were they were quite people because they didn't give people what they wanted they gave people what they didn't want and therefore people chose not to purchase their product\nIs dumb every body wants ratings every body wants ratings make no mistake about it but let me explain for a moment and again I I don't mean to patronize if you understand this it's it seems pretty straightforward but it's important to understand why ratings are important to CNN\nRatings are more important than CNN than they are to me and let me explain why\nFirst stations like CNN or for music stage stations on the radio [noise]\nMost of the advertising which is where the money is made right you don't pay to consume the show you get it free but the trick is if we can get a bunch of you to listen\nThen companies will pay to have their names said to all of you so that while you were in the middle of listening you'll hear their name right\nNo matter what the radio that's how it works so they pay the station fill the station puts this product out to you free and the station receives money to in addition to the content to throw in some references to car dealers or a electricians or whatever restaurants whatever that may be\nThe higher the ratings are more listeners the more listeners the more they'll pay because you pay more to get to talk to a hundred thousand people then to talk to a thousand people so sure every station every show wants to have the highest ratings the higher the ratings are more of the money\nAnd it's purchased in terms of water called points and I don't want to go too far into the weeds here\nBut the more listeners viewers for TV stations you have the more you can sell your ad to tide or Chevrolet or Ford or whatever food packaging company or anything else so of course they share the same\nThirty second ad on CNN this same at the same\nCreated the whole deal that runs during the super bowl will sell for a hundred times more I don't know how much more it's probably a hundred times do you know why because there is a hundred times more people watching the super bowl and seeing and the more people that watch\nThe more you can charge for the same exact thirty seconds you see a TV station only have so many hours in the day they can sell advertising on they only have so many spots at some point you stretch that you can't go any further so the more people that are viewing or in radio listening well the reason I care less about it\nIs I don't have to have ratings we do but I don't have to because I have qualitative I don't have quantitative you see stations that are talking to people that are Eighteen to thirty for what are you selling those people\nDiapers and Coca Cola\nMaybe some beer\nThe people that are listening to our show have money you're older you're more financially secure hats who the advertisers want if you're trying to sell a roof to somebody or an eye surgery or most anything else you go where the money yes\nRight why do you Rob banks that's random mommy yes so I don't have to worry how many people are listening as we have qualitative but enough of that John Stewart talking about the president in what exactly he does the gets their goat and this is from a guy who's not his fan stay tuned we'll talk about\nTo do things because obviously we're all caught up in this day and he said I mean every single newspaper every radio station every bit of social media\nTo make money too well and I said you got those man you got electric bills you got food you know this guy is he's giving all\nCash flow and the Trump era for a\nFor these teams stations over\nThere's going to say that might have been initially maybe instead of the nation for the people who are the bean counters that we're in the journal is we I think believe that our job is to navigate the truth and to do the fact checking all the rest of this I think that's what most of the other\nTopic [laughter]\n[noise] women do it\nBy the baby's them and they dive in and what he's done well I thought his appeal to their own or sisters\nThat's the line that's what I Want to get to\nAnd that's what I Want to talk about coming up\nWhat Donald Trump has done to the media is appealed to their own nurse [noise]\nThey're not firefighters charging into a flaming building\nThey are in our society\nAs Rush Limbaugh noted years ago
