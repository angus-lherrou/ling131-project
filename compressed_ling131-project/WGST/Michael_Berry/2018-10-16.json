I get the hundred thousand back we might get a percentage a smaller percentage of it we might even get a bigger percentage of it and so we're still in that deal we're still making that\nThat income in that deal but we're able to use the money from the re fi\nTo get into more deals so our first year we were able to get into an apartment complexes will now we've had as many as like Seventeen complexes that were invested in and that's the churning effect of the ...\nAre are selling and so we right now we own sixteen because we've sold one and that was the situation where we did what they call it ten thirty one at strange and that's where you had we had a complex\nAnd we tried it up and in this case we traded up to two more complex as\nWell okay so let's say we put a hundred thousand in that first um\nApartment complex there's an investment well we had an equity gain of Seventy one percent so when we sold that first complex and tried it up and to to\nMore complex because we had now a hundred and Seventy one thousand to invest and we didn't really even have to put a penny into the deal that we handed over it was already in there and we went from a complex to close to two hundred thousand too too complex which total about um\nA five hundred unit I think the two hundred thousand and we went from a complex with two hundred units too too complex that equal five hundred unit as though what that means there's the cash flow increases and um we changed like it it was\nA on one of them they occupied at the was eighty three percent\nThe late investors gotten up to nine\nThree percent and then on the other complex we traded into we found out that oracle was maybe within a half mile of our investment and they were bringing in five thousand employed so it it's just been great or start started about\nLeo and what is it done for you know how is it how it changed your life what are you doing day to day now that you weren't doing that for\n\nOr when you know funnier than just the other day I remember I got it and it was ... or whatever and\nIt was maybe about ... park and ride gotten up at eight thirty instead of getting up at six o'clock Wal Mart and um

have a violence problem\nYou know you're seeing more and more of this from the left and and there's no place for that's what I wrote about was that when you see these kinds of things being said it is inciting people and frankly it's not the direction that we should be going it's not what our country is all about their work great country\nThat celebrates the fact we can actually disagree with each other we can disagree with our government but there is a way to resolve it your result your differences at the ballot box you don't resort to violence and to see the leaders calling ... ah that

leaders on both sides calling it out\nYou're seeing leaders on on the right calling it out you're not seeing any leaders on the left call laid out in fact you're seeing some of the leaders on the left

without working with neighboring counties proposition C could put us in the tenable she says the untenable inexpensive position\nFunding services for residents from other counties San Francisco cannot solve homelessness simply by writing ever larger checks itself\nThere is a limit to what we should and can spend oh meant\nAll what you can spend on the homeless oh no this can't happen there can never be a limit to what you spend\nOn the children on the homeless on the environment there is an unlimited amount because rich people\n[noise] apparently um mayor breed is figured out that the more
