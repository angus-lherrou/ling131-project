college casting out as the\nComeback show you're so wish that the man on a mission marry one bumps back in\nThe last segment the do on the radio show earlier today I was discussing the fact that real estate investing is like watching a trained come down the tracks you can see it coming but you can get out of the way well here's an article that tells you that it's time to start paying attention to the train coming down the tracks and it's an article says the feds a duly\nMore than four interest rate hikes unlikely this year I Do is one is the New York representative of the Federal Reserve and he says hey\nWe've had one rate increase quarter of a point but we're anticipating three to four and more this year\nSo that means interest rates when we were blocking our apartment to the three point eight five a couple of years ago now we're up in the four point five interest rate we could end up at five point five now why do I tell you this because they bought me well no because you need to start thinking about OK any\nInterest rate changes I'm going to make in the future if I'm going to refinance or anything I'm going to have to\nFactor into the act and interest rates are going to be higher now they're telling me a year in advance that they're going to do this right so should not be smart enough to understand that they're telling us this in advance so we can prepare for it so that we don't make bad\nInvestments decisions based on the lower interest rates we have today than higher interest rates were going to happen next year I mean I'm watching the interest rate every single day for many reasons one also that would be able to consult people's what is it a realistic interest rate to look at for\nUnderwriting the project but also for all the funds that I Am sitting around everywhere you know probably twenty or thirty accounts I own\nUm different bank accounts and I'm looking at what those interest rates are doing and where they're at and it it really makes a major difference I mean you think about\nYou know if you've got ten million dollars or twenty million dollars a you're talking about a five percent interest rate if it gets back up to that is a million bucks a year repeat that if you get twenty million bucks five percent interest rate is a million dollars a year\nThat's a lot of money so you know you're looking at the positive side of the interest rates go up all of us with money are making more money to interest rates go up a ... the people that are buying real estate only need to factor that those interest rates are going to be higher\nAnd at some point the sellers of real estate are going to have to be realistic remember what I said earlier\nThe only reason you can't sell piece of real estate overnight is because you're not selling it for the appraised price you're trying to sell for more than it appraises for and then hope that they can squeak the appraisal in and get it done bottom line is\nWhen interest rates get up higher and higher and higher the sellers you're going to have to come off those aggressive sales prices is that going to hurt us no we're going to be buying it a little bit lower price paying a little bit higher interest rate net net net it's got to be the same thing it's a business we've got to make money we don't make money we don't get into the business\nRight now the only people that have to watch out or people that went into these deals are this year and\nThinking they're going to refinance next year but not anticipating an interest rate changed for next year\nGuys if you're buying a property right now and you're in a bridge loan or you're in a hard money loan you need to think about how quickly can I get out of these loans so that I don't feel the effects of three more interest rate hikes\nThis was a timing issue the train is coming down the tracks guys there it is we see it or telling you it's there there's no reason to panic be logical thinking through what changes do I need to make my portfolio in the next six months\nTo avoid any type of interest rate risk that's what you need to be thinking about\nThat will make it all happened alright last article of the day\nI dug this without that just to prove a point that has nothing to do with the article but it was a good segue into my thought process and that was this was from the greater Houston\nPartnership and they're talking about what are the fastest growing employment markets now the reason that's important to real estate investing is wherever there's more important for every five jobs there's another rental unit rented for every five jobs there's another rental unit rented this the ratio they go by so the more\nNew employment coming into your town\nRight the higher your rents are going to be in the higher your occupancy is going to be so get this right here right out of the blocks Dallas Fort Worth a hundred and forty six thousand\nNew people hundred and forty six thousand coming in Houston Ninety four thousand four hundred and Seventeen net grilled\nAtlanta eighty nine thousand Phoenix eighty eight thousand and it goes down the list but here's where it gets interesting guys\nThe liberal states are starting to lose people\nWhy well because those governments are failing they're going broke and their taxes are getting higher and higher and higher their cost of living is getting higher and higher and people are fed up with it and they had a net negative employment growth\nPeople are moving away not to play the growth but net negative um\nPopulation growth okay so think about somebody like Chicago Chicago is losing Thirteen thousand people this year that's tax base\nProperty tax base that sales tax base\nThat they're losing that personal income state income tax base they're losing now\nFor the rest of you out there they haven't figured this out I think a bunch of just get your head in the sand if you live in one of these liberal states like California\nWhat's gonna happen to you this years your taxes are going to go up by twenty five to thirty percent because you have a twelve percent state income tax rate that and you have high property taxes because you're properties are so expensive the rates low but the properties are expensive so you have taxes\nYou used to be able to write all that off the gift your federal income tax returns you no longer can folks that means\nYou're actually for the first time going to pay the taxes that you have been taxed by the government in other words the giant money steal\nThat the state governments have been stealing from the federal government making all of us people in the rest of the country pay for you guys live it's over\nYou're going to pay to live like liberal whacked petunias and you're going to can throwing out money to all these welfare programs all these super super duper giveaways\nAnd you're going to go broke but they're smart people that live where you're at they will they're going to come live with us they're going to come live in a rational society where people no longer try to live off of other people\nThink that went through but remember it's not the money it's alive to see them off [noise] [noise]

anyway I guess it's not important um story was that he said in the book the brother and that he wouldn't hire oh ah\nIt might have been burger I think\nIt might have been chief justice burger can be wrong um anyway then he said that he'd never hire another woman because he hired that first woman a clerk and she would leave every day before the men would because she had to go home and make dinner for her husband\nAnd Leno gr I always said that's not true because she didn't cook dinner for us um but I I find it ironic that Leno growing his wife was the first woman to clerk for the Supreme Court\nAnd Leno grow your himself was nominated at the same time that Antonin Scalia was nominated to the Supreme Court\nIn eighty six eighty seven\n[noise] um ... was the first professor ... was the first nominee\nThat the a P A the first nominee a BA issued a\nNon approval for a BA doesn't get a vote as to whether somebody gets to be a Supreme Court nominee or not but the a BA the American bar association ... will will has historically a done their own review and asked some lawyers and they'll say yes this partial make a great judge\nThe very first time that they did not do that was in the case of lean O'Brien and they did not like his conservative\nLeanings well you may know that the a BA came out against Brett Kavanaugh as well [noise]\nIt's very important to do the autopsy on what happened to deconstruct what happened over the last month because it happened so fast that it's easy to forget\nAll the things that the left pulled first of all a ... and ... when I talk about things we forget the league of women voters came out\nAgainst Brett Ghana I've gotta tell you\nThe league of women voters reaches out to me every year\nOr has in the past asking if we will promote their voters guys and promote people voting and informed I Will never ever do a single thing for the league of women voters ever again number one and number two I Hope that\nThey lose their nonprofits uh status\nTheir charter requires that they not get involved with politics that they not get involved on a side they're supposed to be\nIn favor of voter registration but they are left leaning organization and coming out against a candidate coming out against the nominee like this first of all the fact that they even took a side no matter what the side is\nIs offensive but even more offensive is the fact that they joined in as if Brett Kavanaugh is some rapist and I got to tell you something you don't just get to call somebody a rapist\nAnd then when you lose the vote we all go are are different directions by the way ms forward the original accuser\nHer lawyer who was a hand it to her by Dianne Feinstein we still don't know who's paying them they've decided that they're going to drop the matter they don't they don't want to uh ... they don't want to bother with it anymore I asked Sandy Peterson our research director\nI said could you just make a list of some of the topics that\nWe discussed over the last month because you'll remember the left was coming out as fast and furious they were they were making a different claim per day do you remember when the hearing started\nJudge Kavanaugh's law clerk was sitting over his shoulder sitting beside ... behind him and she was holding her hand on her on the uh the bend in her elbow\nAnd she had her three fingers her middle finger her ring finger enter pinky\nOut the kind of grasping the elbow itself\nThe index finger was in the Wii of her arm and the thumb was resting on top of the forearm along with the index finger and it was kind of class being there so that she could put those two together maybe apply pressure low low relief\nThat she probably didn't even know she was doing\nThey saw that video that picture and the left made that out that she was flashing a white power symbol on national TV [noise] that\nWas a dog whistle to the white power community you remember that that poor woman was caught up\nIn all of that nonsense\nThat's where we started before they started the rape accusations and all and I just want to go through a few things that they pulled to kind of reminds you of what they

TALK of sexual harassment and high school\nBeer drinking and what you wrote in your high school yearbook\nAnd whether that's supposed to be some food we eat most of us are ready to move on from that it's not particularly pretty productive talk and frankly it should have never come up but I Do want to address something\nI have had more conversations about Kavanaugh confirmation process\nThan I have most any political issue in quite some time going back to the two thousand sixteen primaries actually\nOne of the things I noticed was how many women it's actually over half of the women with whom I talked about the Kavanaugh hearings\nClaimed to be a victim of sexual assault not just sexual harassment sexual assault\nAnd\nThat's an interesting phenomenon I'm not saying it's not true I'm not saying even one of them made it up\nI'm saying that if it is true if it is true ah first of all it's a real problem in our society\nHere is the problem here here is the conundrum the dilemma this is a very difficult discussion to have\nBy design there are people who have complicated this conversation and made it difficult to talk openly about it and it is unhealthy as a society\nTo put your head in the sand and say well we just won't talk about it because it will upset people so I'm going to do my best to do so and I'm going to share with you my perception as to what has happened\nFirst of all some women perceived the Kavanaugh case not as the evidence as it was presented but they perceived it through the lens of their own case\nWhich they only wanted\nTo focus on and\nIf you didn't believe Christine forward\nThen that would mean you don't believe them so air go they have to believe Christine Ford in order to ensure that they will be bullied when they tell their story now to a woman\nEvery woman who's told me this story\nHas told me they did not report it they did not tell anyone they didn't share it with other people it's simply happened\nAnd\nThey moved on and now they're angry about it and they look back and they wished at the time they had done something about it but here's the problem\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm not sure all of those cases necessarily were\nSexual assault in the sense that we referred to it in in several of these cases women have explained to me this is what happened this is how it happened this is where it happened they can always tell you the details about it\nBut in some cases it is highly pressured sexual activity\nBill Clinton elected [noise]\nBut she here is talking about what President Trump has accomplished\nAnd I think it's quite interesting um I I think she's right she's talking about the fact that the left has been more on hinged under Trump\n\nThan I recall in my lifetime in my lifetime\nAnd I think that includes a a during Watergate in my lifetime I I mean I I don't claim I could process what happened in the Watergate I'm I'm reading from\nFrom historical sources but I'm\nIn my lifetime I don't recall the left being as angry or bitter and vicious as they have been toward everything Trump and yet you just got his second Supreme Court nominee on on the bench\nMany incredible miraculous things that President Trump has died and this is nothing short of America what he's got he's done it in the face of constant\nWarning and lying and fallacious listening feral attacks on him and his first and then his paypal they're

Allison who is what is this we don't even hear what you mean the I think his medical records\nAnd you know cooperation I cannot and you're just blowing up as life and it's not lie under\nThat really transcends politics\nI think that's true I think that's that's absolutely true her husband I'm James Carville\nBefore Donald Trump when when Ted Cruz first went in the Senate when Ted Cruz shut down the government fighting against Obamacare\nJames Carville had this to say about him\nI I think is the most talented and failed to Republican politicians are saying that the last Thirty years after the fact that he's going to run for president and he is going to create something I'm not saying is that he's got to win\nAnd I think that matters right I I've been listening listen to excerpts of the states and South Carolina he touches every button and this guy has no fear\nHe just keeps piling ahead and and he is going to be something to watch him in a lot of Republicans feel this way going and you hear this a lot if we only got someone who was articulate and\nWas for what we will fall we ... we get these John McCain's and these Mitt Romney's and these guys do anything well one thing this guy's not easily\nAnd that is true one thing Romney is he is squishy and McCain was ... and that's why they lost to Obama and I said it this morning I'll say it again\nWhat Donald Trump has taught Republicans to do is to fight what he's taught them to do is to play to win\nDon't just show up and keep your uniform clean don't be proud of what a nice team picture you can take after the game because you have no dirt\nOn your legumes because you look like you didn't you never slid into the base leave it all on the field\nWhat Trump has talked Republicans to do is what the left has been doing for a long time and that is played a win win\nThere was a moment when Kavanaugh look like his candidacy his nomination was in peril\nIt looked like it would just be easier for him to step back and there were a number of folks Bill Kristol the editor of the Weekly Standard there were a lot of those folks a lot of the Georgetown salon Republicans\nWho said let's just pulled his back is it that this has gotten to ugly there's got to admit to nasty and I'm a ... ... let's just let's just pull this thing back we don't we don't need to ah we don't need to win this uh this much ... it's a ... it's bad\nFor the court banned for the Trump presidency is bad for the Republican brand you know I Will say this and that it deserves to be said\nI have\nAn absolutely profound respect for the way that Mitch McConnell handled this process\nI have an in during ... amount of respect for the way Mitch McConnell handled this process but I Will tell you\nIt required that he and Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz stay the course\nBut the left so miss played their hands I remember when the ... uh Julie sweat the\nDetails lurid details came out\nAnd people that are normally pretty resolute said to me is just too much there's too many that to me this is the third person coming out against him now this is bad and these are really bad I said what does it these are so bad as to stretch credibility I don't believe these are true\nAnd now the Democrats are blaming ... they're blaming the fact that I Would not be brought at that point his details were so over the top so ridiculous that it became clear\nOh no they're now that they're just absolutely making stuff up and not even trying to cover it we may have ... they might be able to go out and find fifty more women and then of course miss
