Mart IRA by savings account or bonds new and he's wherever I've got money that I could maybe go get to put a put to work\nIn a more profitable manner I Do that next but then you're going to bring up the sport but double what about life\nHappens right and I'll tell you\nIt happens for all of us so while I'm On this process of trying to find a new landscaping company watching they are getting destroyed um at the same time I'm watching all this negative stuff that I Know I Need to be attacking there's other major things pop up in your life\nAnd so this one thing is a constant battle to get closer and closer and closer to what is correct\nAnd what was effective and for you your password income streams is a constant battle to get closer and closer and closer to the effect of this that will allow you to retire someday my lawn will get there and it will be so easy to maintain its beautiful\nAnd someday you find that it's will get there and you'll be able to maintain passive income the eagles are exceeds the amount of earned income that you make right now\nThey're both or achievable but while we're getting to the world is going to kick is in the teeth\nThis year alone this year alone\nI have killed six snakes yes six\nKilled one yesterday big giant huge sneak up on my patio right by the door I've gotten to raccoons one possum I've had my pool pump go out\nRight I've had my pool bubble is go out I'm Sorry not pull up to the pond ... go out then I've had my ... go out\nI fell through my bridge it both of my two wouldn't bridges into patio back\nArea were broken apart and falling apart I had to completely rebuild those as I fell through the bridge I broke my leg my elbow\nAnd so I Can't work anymore so the bridges sat there for twelve weeks on repaired or because I couldn't repair them I couldn't do the work\nFinally when I got to where I could actually work again move body parts you and I was able to fix them two or three days that I had somebody coming to pay them\nBecause I don't like to paint is too hot to pay them not very good at it I didn't want to getting paid in the water in the ponds underneath there so I had a professional committed paid I'm good at woodworking of terrible paintings we go we had at the same time\nEvery single year my twenty car garage which has to get into my twenty car garage to jai doors that are motor home garage doors that are twenty five thirty feet tall and then all the rest of them are single doors all those doors are hard war doors and they have to be painted every year because you get full sun\nAlso I have twelve exterior doors this stack up against the pool swimming pool these troll exterior doors because there's Korean in that pool and all kinds of ah plants back there were a recall pollen these stores get rotted out every year or every two years that be repaid is\nAlso [noise] um so all this was going on at the same time also asserted that can ah ... somewhat plants\nContracted white fly and started to die so I had to spray for the white fly to kill the white flight so the plants wouldn't all die off tons of magnolias have gigantic magnolias\nOr I mean I I've got five six seven eight nine ten\nEleven twelve twelve giant magnolias at my house and I was at risk losing you know all this is going on with me getting up everyday and do radio shows\nTried to come back from a ripped off torn off price up it's got re soda and healing from a broken leg killing from broken foot toward not broken for toward the police you pass the eyes\nAnd my foot [noise] just all this stuff is\nGoing on at the same time but I see an end to the tunnel uh things are going to go\nGet closer and closer and closer and closer today I go see the doctor about being released so I can start exercising might try so if I can get back in the gym\nBody fat will come back down because I'm getting fat muscle tissue will come back up that I'm getting weird skinny little arms and shoulders with a big fat ... looks like crap all that's fixable because I've already done the research on it or does it in the past I don't want to fix it\nBut life got in its way and that's what I'm telling you\nYou lose your job that's like me not be able to work out for twelve weeks Eighteen weeks would average bed because I tore my try soap and hurt my leg brought broke material but also forgot about that um so it's been six months since I could work out my body is feeling in my body like my yard\nJust after that six months of being injured or just destroyed but you got to get back up so if you're sitting out there you go into my life to shambles\nYou got to get back up plan you can get on that plan need to get going with that plan you need to start taking things one step at a time\nPrioritize get the ones that are killing you away first move on those stop losing money stop doing wrong things and then start building\nRight now building back by law started after us today Dr board will start building back my body\nYou have to do the same thing with\nYou David ... play it\nBack to play it for your life your finances you break your wife play it into personal plans for relationships and money and they take off their butt river as you go through all that it's not the body to watch the Hubble wonderful day we'll see you tomorrow\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] ah\nRadio show memory you either obtained there was no\nEnjoyed it seven days a week and good enough reason to go on the radio dot com boom was mostly radio show\nAnd ... and join the conversation [noise]\nOften lacking and the reason for that is they lack\nThey do not have\nA central planning organization in a case like this when Obama was running things you have in the White House a staff of strategy is\nThe message discipline can be enforced you you have a plan and agenda a timeline\nYou have someone who's reaching out and saying hey Feinstein you handle this aspect of it hey Coons you handled this aspect of it hey we need to get somebody to get to Jake Tapper we need to get somebody to get to Anderson Cooper we need talking points for all of our surrogates who are out there\nThat the Democrats are in a state of chaos\nThey are a military unit without a leader and they're just scrambling around and screaming now what they have which is a powerful asset is they have a very friendly media willing to help them\nAnd that friendly media is as invested in their agenda as they are and if Republicans had something like that\nI don't think Democrats would win an election this country\nBut this sort of keeps the race close when you've got the referee calling fouls every time a ... you know every time the other team misses a shot and they call a foul and give them another one after a while it doesn't take long to figure out a that this is going to even the game\nSo what has happened we talked yesterday about Heidi Heitkamp in um\nNorth Dakota and that she's now according to the latest poll she's down by twelve percentage points twelve\nPercentage points she's an incumbent senator now that's a red state there's no doubt that say Republican state and she's a Democrat but she's never been a screaming lefty Chuck Schumer\nA Democrat nevertheless\nI think what we've done is we've created or it has been created that you're going to have to pick a side\nThere's not going to be a blue state there's not going to be a place for ... blue state Democrat\nIn this modern environment you've got to pick a sad you're either with Trump\nOr you're with the left and and it it it has fractured so dramatically that you can no longer walk that line where you say well I just like being in power what what do I have to do to stay in power what year either going to have to be with Trump\nOr you're going to have to be with the Democrats but neither side is going to let you\nA a walk that line in the middle\n... screaming populist liberal in Texas history had a way with words and he wrote a book that said there's nothing in the middle of the road except for debt armadillos ... except for yellow stripes and debt arm of the deal is I think was the line and that's just it there's there's no room for the middle of the road candidacy today\nThe idea of the moderate you know Lindsey Graham\nOh what a good week this has been for Lindsey Graham\nLindsey Graham was on Sean Hannity's show the other day I listen to hand the five minutes in the last three weeks and it was such good ... it was the best five minutes probably of his show because he had Lindsey Graham on and Lindsey Graham was going at it and Lindsey Graham was talking about the swamp\nAnd he was saying that you know what the swamp would normally do is kicked Kavanaugh out of the boat into the water throw him overboard and I'm thinking to myself Lindsey Graham is the most ... swamp figure there's ever been\nBut he has gone absolutely Tea Party populist conservative guy over this issue and I love it\nHe was telling reporters earlier today that he's going to vote for judge Kavanaugh hey I Am ready to vote I'm ready I'm ready now by the way they've called a cloture vote\nAnd the theory goes that McConnell would not call a vote for cloture which means to close the the discussion and vote unless he had his votes\nI don't know that in this case that's necessarily true and I'll tell you why in a minute but\nUm that vote could be as early as friday I think it's going to happen on Saturday\nIt looks like well I'm going to go through some of the senators that we were worried about and\nAs of right now here we are a Thursday or as of right now it looks like the vote I if I were guessing\nI Would guess the votes going to be fifty four forty six um there are some estimates that habit at fifty five forty five but don't underestimate the Hail Mary the left is going to throw now that they know that they have no chance of winning they're going to get desperate\nRight they're going to try for a knockout punch and and\nIn some ways that scares me because that means they're literally going to stop at nothing [noise] it it means that the things they're going to try are going to be nuclear options it means that they're going to try things they never would have tried before\nBecause it's their only hope it means that all their trickle ration all their their shenanigans it means that things that you would typically say no if we do that and we lose it it will\nYou see what's interesting about this don't let me forget to tell you in the next segment Ramon what\nWhat what ... what I'm\nLindsey Graham did I'm so you know what folks that I'm going to confess to you I'm embarrassed unlike a kid on Christmas Eve can we just open the president I can we at least open the stuff that's under the tree and whatever saying he brings\nTonight will open tomorrow but can we just ... I Am so excited right now I Am so invigorated an exhilarating over what I think's about half of them was Kavanaugh's nomination [noise]\nNice you can always said on the Michael berry show\nTraffic on TALK radio six forty double duty as the gaming\nThey were ...

and then some cat lady\nIn the background starts screaming shrieking this is\nI Am lucky I've been with my wife since I was Eighteen years old she's very good to me\nShe makes me a better person she's ... she's the kind of person I Wish I was she's kind\nShe's genuine she's secure in herself she has nothing ill to save other people she has no neurosis sees she's not envious she's not pride full she's just kind\nAnd so I don't know what it's like to go through a divorce other than feeling like I've gone through a few with my friends over the years and it always seems that a person that was otherwise a nice person when they're going through a divorce you see the worst of um\nYou you see that the fangs come out and the clause go up well this woman who screaming is what I imagine every man out there kind of pictures for their ex wife\nAs long as I've been alive while I genuinely believe\nI Believe that that that Lindsey Graham genuinely believes that he was stabbed in the back by his Democratic colleagues and that he is genuinely authentically I Want to focus on the legitimacy the real mess of his emotions\nBecause most of what they do is theater\nThe disagreements that they have that's all theater\nWhen when the door close when the camera's turned off they get a law that was a good when you call it my side of budget Tea Party habits and I called your side and on the edge group a lefty liberals but we're going to have dinner tonight in or hear it in the in the club us club members of the\nWell there has been\nThe claws have come out bitchy Lindsey has come out and he

on TALK radio six forty bill you see as the the hot weather continues through the weekend\nI'm CBS with six you from your office for last mostly clear skies and splices those temperatures like tomorrow morning sixty four to six days out friday another hot day high temperatures nearing and I just wanted on Saturday mostly sunny side the high up and I like to\nSit on Sunday a few more clouds but still hot with a high temperature near Ninety I'm\nChief meteorologist Paul Osman\n[noise] or radio is the easiest to use that for music Andrea [noise]\nDownload the free I hardly the U.S [noise]\nIf you're saying is that this is a\n... there are about to vote for confirmation I knew it was one of the Democrats I couldn't remember it turns out it was Joe mansion now this is a tip ahead of time that he's going to vote for confirmation ...\nThese guys something can come in at the last minute I don't mean effect change I I mean a powerful interest can come in and and change their opinion for them at the last minute\nSomebody can say hey you're gonna lose you know the endorsement of the biggest union in the states for instance uh are you know they're going to come out and ... but by and large\nIt's probably the case when a senator like Joe mansion in West Virginia\nA state that that Donald Trump won by ... percentage points it's hard to put into perspective what kind of pressure this puts on mansion or who's up for reelection it's hard to put into perspective\nHow fearful he is of losing his Senate seat these guys will do anything to hold onto their Senate seat in the thing\nAnd he's got to have a lot of people who voted for Donald Trump vote for him a lot of people now even lose and by forty percentage points there still thirty percent of West Virginians voted for Hillary\nSo he's got to keep from alienating them but they typically understand hey he's got to do some things he's got knocked me with us sometimes\nIn order to pick up enough votes to get to fifty one percent because we're not a majority in the states so we're going to let him have their smoke but that doesn't mean that every women's group\nAnd every university group in the state's gonna given a free pass so he's got the challenge over here that he's got to keep his crazy liberal left he's a you know corral and and rally them to all vote for him\nAnd if the state is truly Seventy thirty I don't think it is I think it's probably closer to fifty eight forty two let's just say it's fifty five forty five he's still got to get all his Democrats and then pick up twenty to thirty five percent of Republicans and that's not always easy\nBut mansion has been able to do that he's been able to build support across party lines\nAs the parties have split as they have fractured it makes it very hard for a red state Democrats for a Democrat and a Republican state because it's no longer the case that you can simply say well I'm bringing home the bacon\nOr hey don't you want a guy in both parties represent you how you don't you want to have power when the Democrats are back\nWhen you have a moment like Kavanaugh where the Democrats go slash and burn to the extent that they have where the media has has polarized this issue\nSol sol\nAggressively you leave no room and the middle\nYou you you make it so that there is no agree to disagree there's no respect for the other side\nWhen they started accusing us man of outright rape when Michael ... being paraded across CNN everyday when the New York times is writing editorials that are basically\nBasically saying\nKavanaugh's rapist and so is every white male conservative people at home see this remote will you pull for me the audio remember Hillary Clinton went to India after she lost\nA a good deal on

enjoy music and you enjoy Iraq docks and you enjoy the history behind musicians you will enjoy this\nSo they\nThe over arching issue around the Kavanaugh nomination yes it's a lifetime appointment\nBut there is the big issue of the fact that the midterms the voting is going to start and you know where it what are we thirty one thirty two were about thirty days from election day but we're just a few days from early voting\nI'm going to bag and they don't do that or else I'm going to bag\nOur listeners every Texan out there to cast their vote on the first day of early voting and get your Ted Cruz vote in for a number of reasons I'm not the least of which is to show the left\nYou see\nThe reason they've spent a fortune ...\nIs to send a message to Democrats across the country\nIf we can win Texas we can win anywhere of course the Democrats can win California their politics or lack of course the Democrats can win Oregon of course the Democrats can win New York\nAnd Vermont but if we can break\nThat that red wall of Texas then that means we can begin to take back\nThe new south we can take back those red states we can take back the states of the gun owning conservative rancher suburban night small business owner veteran these are areas they can't crack anymore their politics or to whack\nSo if they could find a candidate a stealth Trojan Horse candidate to send in and they know they can mobilize the left\nThe sort of like West Virginia that ain't going to get you there you've got to be able to convince suburban moms what they called in two thousand what Al Gore and George W. Bush battled over which was the soccer mom\nThey were trying to convince the soccer mom the suburban soccer mom that ... was the guy\nAnd so that's why they had to humanize him you know he loves music he was in a band he said water burger he does air drumming he's just like you he's got a nickname and they needed to excite blacks and Hispanics and young people and that was the ...\nIt's a pie and it looked good because they got a steady dose of earned media from across the country\nRolling Stone magazine took a break from making up UVA a rape case\nA articles which they had to settle for and wrote glowing stories about the New York times wrote glowing stories the national magazine of Texas Texas Monthly which is very liberal but he's read across the state and and well respected they wrote glowing reviews on him\nThe newspapers the Houston Chronicle San Antonio express the Dallas Morning news day all wrote glowing reviews on and what a great guy\nThey never talked about his policies because his policies would turn the voters off they didn't want to tell you he's a gun grabber\nThey they actually originally reported on him saying he would vote to impeach a Trump he was the first member of Congress to come out and say he would vote to impeach Trump\nWell at the time he did it he had to mobilize the American left to get excited about the Senate race down in Texas as we've gotten closer and closer to the vote he's embarrassed by that\nBecause now the Trump voters some of whom had problems with Ted Cruz because they ran against each other and they were still suffering with bearing the hatch it even though Ted Cruz dead and even though Donald Trump did\nA lot of those voters are now going wait a second I don't want the senator from my state leading the charge to impeach my president when he's doing a very good job\nSo that's made people go I'm going to vote against that guy\nThen you've got the Soros money that's come into the state of Texas and that that has really offended people but then you've got this this cabinet case where you know people don't realize how bad it is to live under Democrat tyranny\nUntil they're reminded by having to do it\nYou forget how awful the Democrats are you forget how low morale was in the Obama presidency once he's gone because it's a coping technique\nYou don't want to have to be negative all the time you don't want to have to have at top of mind how angry you were at those people and how they treated you and\nIt's not until you've gotta Kavanaugh case that you see that delivering idiot Blumenthal up there it's not until Feinstein is up there is not until Chuck Schumer is holding press conferences it's not until Durban doing his thing\nAnd a ... you know um\nThat sort of thing just reminds people that sort of thing simply reminds people you know what\nI got to get out I Know Canada is perfect Ted Cruz is not perfect Donald Trump is not perfect Republicans have a tendency to do something that Democrats don't and that is eat our own we have a tendency to say if you are not perfect\nThen I'll stay home I'll vote for the other side or I'll stay home and that's why we lose elections we should when\nI've never seen Republicans this United\nBehind that issue\nLike the Kevin on confirmation\nUh I haven't seen that in a long time in a very long time in in some ways but I I guess the Trump presidency dead because they were uniting not just behind Trump but against Hillary\nThese are invigorating times\nAnd it shows the establishment look\nWhen you guys ... look you can win [noise]\nTalk radio six forty WG as the\nCampaign may prevent you from playing catch with your daughter going fishing with your son or taking a walk with someone you love\nA gas attack may make it difficult for you to help with simple chores around the house or participate in the everyday events that are your greatest joys and the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and men [noise]\nGod is upon a condition that affects millions of Americans\nIn people without Europe gases levels build up in the blood and can lead to an attack which some have described as feeling like a severe burns\nThe pain associated with got attacks can occur in several joins including elbows knees and wrist but most commonly happen in the big toe once you've had one attack you may be at risk for another without active an ongoing management gout may prevent you\nFrom enjoying life simple pleasures learn more about managing this chronic illness that W.
