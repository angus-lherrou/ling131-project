person at a car\nWoke up back there last segment the doe wants the radio show if you'd like to call and ask a question and sweat segment our number is eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven or sat next segment here I Want to sure she'll go with you I thought was rather interesting I found an article\nA that was stating that\nIt costs more to rent that it does cost more to own the dust around in every state in the union every city in the union everywhere and the reason why I thought that the article made sense to bring the blame view is because people always ask me what do you think the market has picked\nBen you know the answer you can look at dating and making predictions that it might be picked or might not be ... but I can tell you this\nIs as long as it's cheaper to read that it is to own investors are going to continue to buy\nAnd as they continue to buy rentals they're going to drive the price up and they're going to make lots and lots of money doing it they're also going to have lots of positive casual so I was looking at this\nIf somebody has to buy living you know by housing\nWhat would they be willing to pay\nTo go from renting a place to owning a comparable piece of housing and it really blew my mind when I look at these numbers\nOh the ... is the key takeaways according to the article and then I'll come back we'll speak more specifically about the markets rent\nIt says owning is more expensive everywhere access to all fifty ... days including watch to see it costs more each month to own a home than to rent the median costs people pay nationwide own a home is fifty four percent more than the median cost or to rent one\nThe smallest differences still third is to a third more to old state where the premium\nTo own a home is the lowest is Florida where it costs a meeting of thirty three percent more to own the direct the states with the next lowest premiums are Colorado forty percent in Arizona forty one percent so you can see why you know it would make sense\nFor people even in these areas where you would think they could get housing\nYou know cheaper\nRight then they can't other places it still costs you at least thirty to forty percent more to own a house\nGoes on and says in some states it costs of owning is far eclipses cost reading in New Jersey state with the highest ownership premium the median monthly cost of owning is nearly double that of renting Ninety three percent more to own\nThat it is to read this is just an unbelievable situation Ninety three percent more so it looks to me that\nThere is no time soon that people are going to stop renting when you can go live for half the Bronx or fifty percent less than why would you want to take the risk of buying a house looks like we have a caller on the line Tom is this need Tom Ziegler\nHello anybody out there ... okay\nThought to have somebody on the line just got so let's go back to this was looking theories local areas here are the first local area or is Texas it cost fifty six percent more to own in Texas the indirect\nFlorida's the lowest two boys thirty three percent premium and Arizona is forty one the second lowest Georgia is the third lowest\nMichigan is fifty two per se and a California sixty\nTwo percent sixty two percent there so it looks like a people are going to be renting for some time in the future it appears at this point uh looks like there's phone lines lit up here is there anybody on the phone\nHello\nSo lost connection with my engineer it looks like All right so moving on\nLast thing I Want to cover here today's this when you're looking at retiring what you're thinking most of the times how can I save up enough money to be able to retire that's the concept right but the reality\nIs that what you really should
