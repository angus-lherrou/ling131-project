sample ballot and pregnant with news and the guy you must be registered to vote on election day\nAre you my phone in your home printing your sample ballot provide that information and like I'm a county board of elections what\nTo to a border reforming immigration reform yeah it's just that we were attacked and do it\nThree weeks before an election it's almost like Donald Trump was like hey guys would you want to creating a caravan and sending it this way and I will do is that we'll talk about it and it will help us win this election and then afterwards you guys can go back home will pay for your boss\nI was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what time for you to walk to the United states and I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group\nWith you and you get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just here in trusting your children to who knows what and where is the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's got to be some\nThere is and I think their case would be or at least the case the left would make on their behalf would be a these things\nAre so bad so bad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot worse she can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's pretty much the opposite like want\nTo say that we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who step and walking the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI've told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's there's a giant bond there in a green area is common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said hey dad I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond\nAlone [laughter]\nWithout your brother [laughter] no [laughter]\nI [laughter] would you stop\nAnd think about how you know\nPretty protective ... yeah exactly I I let him walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk to Honduras\nGroup of people that I don't know [laughter]\nOh look there are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you'd probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there's certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations where like this\nOr is there probably are some but it it's just ... you try to\nIt's the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of everyone has a four year old who came across the border and in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old that this is a different it's a different story\nA and you just wonder first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that mhm when people hear a story like that it it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this it you know 'cause the ward invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it uh you know in a hawkish manner ... right\nAnd you know like a thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion\nRight if it feels like wait a does there just top like the top of the only way they could do anything hears over running but we have right looked over running the security\nThey they're they're coming in or the right way or the overriding security\nAnd you see that Mexico is does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that hearing and of course they're just keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet\nAh the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a fairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful\nOr were on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy of\nCourse if somebody's snakes them from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they're going to work\nIf somebody do that without permission ... with them back then\nThey ... they send back them they'd send back to them if they do it without permissions they send back to them but we can't we're expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to us and Mexico has a pretty stiff\nImmigration law they've got to streamline law\nThat insurers foreign visitors and immigrants are in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society\nThey are of economic and social benefit to society\nWeight you're you expect your immigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding rights or that they think they have coming to them in Mexico you can't even\nDo can't interfere in their in internal politics plus\nIf they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport you I mean that's a [noise] a\nDaily racist right I mean like that is not there's not an argument there we would never know you can't do that you know you can't do that and know should you when you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans in this present we want to make sure we're still Seventy or eighty percent I mean I think I Would you I wouldn't I Can't I Can't\nThink of a warden Trump supporter who would have a ... a support a policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages of white people versus other races you wonder if people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society\nOr going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it ... ... security for me but not for me and that is not a a that is not a that's incredible I mean that's an incredible it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's\nPolitically wanting to flip the bottom line is we're we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up that is a completely lets a larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there is no like this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border of people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting I as a gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that saying hey use their use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration 'cause I haven't heard\nAny of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe some warm someone somewhere is but it doesn't seem to be a general theme\nFor the party I did hear cut all talking about it in the debate I I don't think I don't know that he mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security I mean there's a really close race in Arizona\nA race or where I'm at Sally had I think a great chance of winning or people do it because her thought if there is like\nIf you took Michael Moore and put him in his brain into a female body of a congresswoman\nYou would have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's bashing Arizona oh young if the lab of democracy she's saying people are crazy in Arizona she's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truther shows I mean she is\nAs it's incredible but they decided to run her and just and thought that this stuff would not come out\nAnd and ... you know you're talking about a one of the first female pilots in history and the ... of the air force incredibly accomplished yeah has a great chance of winning in a in a tough environment\nA ... in Arizona adding on this situation where are you know you're you basically have a coat pink worker a coat pink staffer is running for Senate in Arizona\nAnd it\nWas a huge mistake I think for her to be their number literally with code picker denied that\nSocializing her views I don't know exactly she yeah she's been with a lot of these uh left wing extreme groups or some maize any early to thousands to the point where again\nLike she like co hosted a show with someone who was the nine eleven truther while for a while\nThat's like it's crazy bonkers over the line right and and you find that you have a really solid candidate there in Arizona and it's a border state the big deal there ... is another one the cruise cruise has got to lead there but I mean he's always been talking about border security but\nYeah I get a look at the other side of that yeah with Becca\nIs schools some school systems closed when the storm hit and have been closed represents\nBaker county schools will finally reopen next Tuesday Decatur county

I had to do that all sounds fantastic obviously Reno they're making yeah right well the point of\nIt and it's a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that\nYou know we one of the biggest reasons Beto is you know in the public eye in the in the United states and not just the Texas figure is because of this video he made\nAbout it's great it's a great idea to Neal or for the national anthem and what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick saying that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot in the streets for no reason because ah for for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with a new\nStandard in which any woman can accuse man overeat and we're just supposed to believer gonna work out well for African Americans or any ... any race if a male but this is the type of thing that makes no sense I mean there are real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about ...\nOr however this goes back to Nineteen Ninety eight here are the percentages of democratic fundraising in Nineteen Ninety eight they had forty three percent of all fundraising okay a and actually I did in the house two thousand it was forty seven percent two thousand two forty seven percent two thousand four forty six percent\nYou've got to see a pattern of their little bit and you know Republican slightly out raising them they're kind of changes in two thousand six where it goes to fifty percent Democrat than fifty six percent Democrat in two thousand eight that's brought up on his first election\nUh it's been hanging around a fifty percent ever since two thousand ten was forty eight percent doesn't twelve forty four percent doesn't fourteen forty seven percent doesn't sixteen fifty percent so you get that there's a range there from about forty three to fifty six percent that is broken and fifty six was outlier most of the time it's right between forty seven and fifty fifty one\nSo far in ... in two thousand Eighteen Democrats have rights\nAged sixty five percent of the money going to the house well again they've never been higher than fifty six sixty five percent a sixty five thirty five split against Republicans\nThey are out there was a congressman who came out the other day he raised eight hundred thousand dollars in his district thought he did a good job his opponent announced two point six million shoes and this is like it's unheard of when it comes to money and the disparity going on now\nNow we're ... the Democrats are favored to take the house I don't know how much it has to do with money\nBut if they were to lose this race would be a with this sort of a climate it would be not complete destruction\nOf any argument that money can buy elections I mean this is they're they're gonna complain I mean Beto O'Rourke was on stage complaining with Ted Cruz about money and how Ted Cruz is influenced by her and we got to rape me a hundred thousand dollar donation to him like I like this is a big a big deal in today's world um but I mean\nHe's raised this wasn't even close Beto he's thirty eight million dollars more than any Senate candidate himself in history yeah for a quarter a which is incredible you said it was it compares to ... racing and what's your what he wants more\nIn the in the ah if you compare quarter last quarter\nOf the campaign in two thousand eight he raised more than ... Obama during his presidential\nCats is that the presidential election emphasizing this is the Texas Senate ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win a\nNow it's funny to the Senate race record she broke\nWas what was the ... record set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember senator lousy oh from New York running your children sailor he did not win that race was not a close race\nEven though Rick lasagna wasn't a bad candidate it was kind of a close race it was Hillary right in New York expect her to win but I mean again ear to ear around fifty and almost every it's almost a fifty fifty split every year and this you're sixty five thirty five that's a ...\nUm and the other thing that's kind of interesting on the in the bad side if you want to get scare mongering for awhile and why not lens out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately um we haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all week all week on well now in the last two days and it was now and now we just\nYou know we have a going back in history looking at\nTwo hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent only eight percent of them are getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running for Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now is that a big difference I mean sixteen percent it's still not high\nBut it does show that Republicans wind up losing these incumbency races a little bit more often if you're worried about\nThe Senate there's a little bit of there's a little bit of something there should be worried about I think they're going to win the Senate I think you're gonna see a fifty three or fifty four seat majority I think\nThey may pick up a couple of seats oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas\nAre those who were in question ... I I think Ted winds up winning by maybe ten points or more\nI think it'll be a double digit I think there's a good chance of that I wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten\n... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it'll be much closer to barely comfortable yeah fair I think that's where he stands right now yeah uh Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think a ... you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida that in mind set Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't even put that on the top and something like ... yeah ... I saw it's close but um they pretty much a toss up race but those other I mean Florida is a complete toss no reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it I don't know how to\nDo away for ... I mean I'm Talking about West Virginia here\nI think Joe mansion ah probably sealed his reelection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that that is a brand they're all bumped up up the system when I have to\nUm I don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this you complain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain about a summer cold Lisa Murkowski\nJoe mansions voting record is much worse than all of that\nAll of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest conservative of\nAll time I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because I'm a craft or now communist again or social listening communist yeah I mean the most part you think about Jeff Flake here's a guy who's getting flooded so\nSo much by the White House and buy or the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for head for that seat that the seat and mix Sally is running for a well he votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah\nYou know again ... West Virginia is a state it's probably the most pro trumped state in the union\nHe won in West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it was czar they would go for I mean I imagine it's got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate\nOr you know you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capital almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota but I mean in in\nWest Virginia it got mentioned he got his cabinet vote you have a couple of it but again this is a guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a\nHe's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but if that was West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading in the polls is an interesting development there\nUh but uh it is a winnable it should be winnable seat in this environment uh right now mentions leaving that won fairly comfortable but even without the mentioned seat you're you're at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four without going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one it would be a\nReal surprise if they lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there is a good you know eighty percent chance that they are I mean most models are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's a I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota uh she's gone by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven points to the Republican Kevin ... so yeah that is looking pretty good yeah my pursuit\nThere I think honestly you had two races decided by the cabinet vote one was mansion generally like high temp her vote against that feel that I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race though\nI don't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose it and then she's going to lose a pretty big I would not be surprised as you said a double digits situation happens there yeah look again North Dakota as a conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and\nYou know I think a lot of people like to say well we've got this one Democrat this is what we've got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got in a democratic governor we've got a democratic senator and there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way\nWhen you vote against Brett Kavanaugh in those circumstances with the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is embracing the same sort of standards you're seeing from Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and\nAll of these far left figures and good for North Dakota in ... for Jetta sing her as a a as a result of that it looks that way good yeah it looks that way yeah\nYeah there's some uh optimistic things there it could but the dangers there as well I mean is this is going to be an interesting one and ... and not the thing that's really unfortunate is if if all that happens is let's say the result is and I think this will be a good result for Republicans right now which is you get fifty three or fifty four senators in there and you lose the house but you lose it narrowly\nYou lose it let's say by eight or ten or seats you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in certain circumstances but it's going to be difficult and that's the thing they're going to be almost nothing they can get through\nAlmost nothing with the exception of maybe some bipartisan spending bills which still find ways to get those ... I'm sure of it but other than that you're going to get any real advantage not getting any tax stuff you're you're going to be tough times with any regulation you're going to get ... you know none of this stuff is going to be easy\nAs long as you keep renting a massive deficit you'll get old\nIn both Texas and Florida and reported that the general rule in both states was that miners could not have abortions without parental consent with certain exceptions\nLike a a waiver 'em dead they went the other way and took him to New Mexico for an abortion\nMy math cope with the Georgia news network that GB I held on to officer involved shootings yesterday one in ... county\nA state trooper arrested demand during a traffic stop but the suspect reduced to gun even though he was handcuffed and shot the officer in his bullet proof vest the suspect was shot and killed than in men role police were called out I'm a ... with a gun when Monroe police arrive\nAt the [noise] the shy striking our cat\n\n[noise]\nTraffic on TALK radio six forty double duty as the\nPoints out both in county describes I anytime south on on your ... wrote in the opposite side but you might have happened to break the little they're starting to\nFour hundred and stomp on at the north rink markets taste in their price house last aside hand four hundred at highway twenty in the coming area now for the traffic lights they're starting to find a link constant delays on the exit ramp sounds on the poor people who went to fill it back on the side of declaring when I was raised in the left side that high home plate Catholic I cannot\nHave land and Ingles twenty Eighteen percent capital why added on December fourteen at the state former rehash going\nMarshmallow unless\nOn right now [noise] get yours and be more to the Atlanta single both twenty eighty presented capital why [noise] friday silver and I said\nWhat's here today on the radio ads [noise] on\nThe radio podcast assignments featuring a brand new episode with the legendary McCarty to know them and treat to\nNominate film would lead to talking about me when I'm On a given day and then of course some discussion about a little man called ... that we were you when we were just playing music I have a radio was inside the studio ... check it out now\nWhether it's on talk radio six forty double duty as the\nMorning they rally can't can't pronounce and chemistry and that's where we'll be all those tiny three high is even cooler weather\nOn the way crowds will increase the tide only in the sixties after that rain arrives to ... percent chance of rain on Saturday it says they CBS forty six meteorologist chat for about ...\nHi this is Gordon Diehl joined me weekday mornings at seven for America's first news on TALK radio six forty W GST\nI claim that kind of an attack let's do it are joined by Jesse\nHow are you in the fat with Jeffrey a credibly explosive pot cat that was like a stranger that though why the truth about what they do something\nOr you're like oh yeah [laughter] that's great yeah I like it here you can now buy like get the podcast every day every day Monday through friday about\nA four pm central five for you ever used to it drops in or you can get it wherever free pocket or something\nYeah a base chewing the fat with Jeff Fisher is how you\nAre and uh you should do that a and Jerry I had the I think that's a casual story for you today okay or just because we talked about this yesterday but this can be the most Jaffe had lie of the time ...
