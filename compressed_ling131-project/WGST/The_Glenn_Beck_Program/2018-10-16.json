depression new research finds that the words people use seemed to indicate whether\nThey would later be diagnosed the findings in the proceedings of the national Academy of sciences offer a way to flag people who may be in need of help sort of course they also raised important questions about health privacy\nPeople who were later clinically diagnosed with depression used more I language in words reflecting loneliness sadness and hostility\nThe researchers recruited six hundred eighty three people who visited an emergency room for their study and as to see their Facebook pages most were not depressed bought one hundred and fourteen had a depression diagnosis in their medical records\nWere such as tears cry pain miss hate and ugh were more common in the post to people later diagnosed with depression Facebook is also studied this starting a program three years ago a allows people to flag accounts if they thought people indicated suicidal thoughts\nEight minutes now in front of the

dissident Saudi\nJournalist as President Trump dispatched his top diplomat to the kingdom Saudi officials are considering whether to say Jim all cash Yogi was killed during interrogation that went wrong I Move that could help the royal family distance itself from responsibility Senator Marco Rubio on Fox News\nWe walked into that building and there's no video of him walking out so he already stolen or somewhere or that I'm actually the only explanation for it and there was any of them are leaving the facility commonsense out who the Saudis or the producer who did it how they did and I mean we have to assume the worst that will see\nThe case has drained us Saudi ties and cast a shadow over crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is efforts to overhaul the kingdom's economy and attract

President Trump's comments about him personally administering a DNA test to her\nTo prove her Native American heritage is creepy tromp through earlier this year offered to donate one million dollars

okay that will not be something I enjoy doing either\nOrange treated at the president makes creepy physical threats about women who scare him including her I Seventy three year old bottle of French

times the original estimate\nThe bottle shattered the previous record of three hundred ten thousand set by another Nineteen forty five bottle that sold in two thousand seven\nWe got to be careful using the verb shattered I my heart sunk for a moment there would have had half a million and a shattered the shots\nSo to everyone who just donated you just paid President Trump's lawyers over half a million dollars and as the kids as the kids say nowadays [noise]\nHang on until they could pull [noise]\nGoing back program we need to have a power about Elizabeth Warren to now ... we need to make that a oatmeal soup that she made in ... found\nDon't know I think we should try that I Hope that somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing because this is this is just outrageous don't you think\nYeah she released this big uh basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper NATO she was she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and Delaware\nYes ah which is a is something that does not seem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second\nUh Cherokee and then they revise that you won ... ... the media revised that can they actually looked at the report says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve and then they realized hoops you do see we made a a map there this is a serious correction been in the deep sea and the corruption but they pay they should have\nA cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between one uh one\nSixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in in of itself so he got the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them one of those pieces would have a little bit of Cherokee\nNow this theoretically right I could at least give her a\nTechnical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's a you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her stupid super recipes in Palau ... which is the goal of almost everybody\nIn America how how come out child and they don't want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's where I'm going all fall I'm going all full\nI I'm I'm just I'm going to I just thought let's all complain about the names of a ball teams ... how ... from here on out our our audience what's called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans and it's a tribe to trial it does\nThe I mean there are studies that show that the average person of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he ... I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to show that\nThey've chosen show any DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test the DNA against we\nHave to use people from ... New Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well\nWay and there's the the theory is that they those the same people wind up migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she is Native American blood is not even what they tested\nOr and even that is it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you\nIf you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed and like to point out over the years it would not show the his Canadian blood\nSites like that not only did they say oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian with DNA does it it shows a lineage against shows it's it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns since I Wonder\nIf he would it would have his blood would show that he's a thousand times more Hispanic then or other friends disorder or [laughter] that's true it probably would show that uh but so it's\nInteresting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and falling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was\nUm it was her great great great great grandmother I think a several generations back and um when she registers and the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and then this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of saying you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right you and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that\nNumber one obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother secondarily yeah but\nWhat have we learned from aggressive we have learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nNow or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not that was what I was not allowed to vote place\nAny little we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to\nAccept that she is so we can't accept which was a great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous this story is just so rich I don't really care I don't care either I care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just play\nLooking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me or they sell those you have to get them you know we've got to start making them a [laughter] I Want one more than life itself\nOkay so you know where I'm coming from however you know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my my grandfather\nActually took a horse a big a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet and he talked to him and he grabbed him underneath the chair and he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else but\nHe took him and he punched him in the head and knock the horse out okay so ... ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't out okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and we're getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this and he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's true I got to go out and say it's not my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true\nOh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing you oh yeah this is what it was but it was the was it was not true somebody advantages\nThrough your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls\nI was her I almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told us that you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never you you've you've\nYeah yeah yeah I get it again if she is you're trying to play identity politics if you're going to play identity politics you'd better be right on these things and that's why I can give you that I got what it's about it I give you that I found a huge story I mean you know we will you know what is a huge part of this story\nBut you do to how do you see what it used to happen is you'd have to you have to go over to the extreme and then you'd moderate you're not going to be able to moderate but those people how do you moderate how do you go over\nTo the side of adds a fall and say hey I don't think anything is wrong with that divide shout your abortion and then when you get the nomination\nComeback close enough to the center to where people are going oh she didn't really mean the shell the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean as far as that so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nYou're you've been you've been eaten\nBy the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campuses they don't like what's happening in the news they may not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not about the outing their abortion [noise]\nI met with the Georgia news net for\nThe first day of early voting and Georgia saw

in NHL history Katie for second week in Nineteen eighty eight and one of the most dramatic moments in baseball history with two outs in the bottom of the night and injured Kirk Gibson it's a dramatic\nYeah well look at those to those two versions or wouldn't have been that different on friday night at the the guys who are looking for a fight they got in some extra kicks right and so that's maybe five seconds of violence that wouldn't have happened if it went your way\nThat's five seconds out of three days of terror or antifa was was threatening to venue they were giving death threat to this old lady who answered the phone they're\nGay hang on hang on a start but let's go back to what you were doing what the venue is what what [laughter] that and you have to hit on the poster because uh [laughter]\nI think the poster is just a entertaining but go ahead\nWell I Will try it again the coach you kill a socialist would've samurai sword in Nineteen sixty and it's a funny troll that a lot of right wing guys do it sort of like the tennis shaping\nRewrites the helicopter rides for ... early ... fat tire right right so it it it's that kind of set up I announce it on Tuesday call myself a toy again like Gabby\nAnd I bought a shot myself into his Marge Schott\nUm this second we announced that and and you want to know me to notice that a satire antifa goes all the blast they've started attacking the venue attacking the old lady there the calls are coming from all over the country by the way\nSo this was a planned attack that anti for his work I think the and the and the people working in their hand traditional as well organized and well funded so then that those attacks continue that before the venue totally trash windows smashed\nRidiculously pretentious manifesto nailed to the door that says that we put the Republicans on notice a this is only the beginning we are not civil which by the way the Hillary quote\nA then I get to the venue that night for the next night total in outer chaos because we made signed screaming hurling bottles over here and\nWhich one of them hit my car on the way out a ... ... organized rallies like there's this kind of met that you'll see if you really get deep into the foxhole where he is calling in the front thing you know you guys go over there over there a citizen journalists get beat up they take it back pack their police to arrest him and then\nThey they arrest the citizen journalists\n... no no I'm Sorry to arrest three of the of the end who mob this guy okay but I had I interviewed him today and he was talking about coordinated attacks it seemed very military so this isn't anarchy is anarchist circling off\nWell you you know I I don't know I'm sure you are\nI'm into FAA Austin is a on their Facebook page has called for a guerrilla style tactics they've they've called for a what do they call it a black shirt army or something I read a red shirt army I Can't remember 'em but they're calling for\nPeople that just want to go out and do what ... normally does but they're also calling now for a an actual standing army and they were looking for people that know military tactics that could teach people so that's that's happening of course Facebook doesn't have a problem with with covering that but\n... analyst pay the Mets had guy that police are looking for that my citizen journalists told me about [noise] um so yeah that those guys were charged with assault Enron operate because they took his backpack so now you know when I by the way peaceful amount of Martin Luther king guy Malcolm X Ray I saw the same experience right up till now and it's been days\nAnd then when it's time to leave I come\nOut there I've got my plastic sword I make a point at which the joke and that's when they hurl the Internet may I jump in a car\nAnd then a group of Proud Boys are are the last ones to go they they leave and the video just came out yesterday on breaking nine one one on Twitter they were attacked by antifa fully clad with all their gear and they throw a bottle at them and the huge fight breaks out and\nNow in your world that fight would have been you know hey cops cops or something like that\nAnd then Malcolm X well it's a little bit longer but again five to ten seconds different so we're splitting hairs here you know the real issue is we're up against\nHomicidal lunatics with no ... NO PLAN it's not like they know where we're going to get you know our our gas and oil from after the revolution these guys just want to burn America to the ground and the media is on their side\nYou know so it's so frustrating because um we had the same kind of thing happening out in in Portland, Oregon and uh you know Portland has I don't know who this mayor is what I mean\nWhat the hell is he doing where that they're already directing traffic and to follow the police are standing a block away than they do nothing\n[noise] well my understanding with the super left wing towns like Berkeley in Portland is\nThe mayor allows antifa ... chaos and then he can say sorry Trump's supporters are trouble I mean look at all the chaos it happens when someone who likes Trump shows up when when the Republicans and conservatives are around so well that's just you know if you don't want to antifa around stuff\nA that's their sort of motto and it works\nIt's interesting 'cause like because the initial video seemed to indicate that your guys were in the wrong that they had they started this and and they started the violence\nThe second video that was released however shows clearly someone from anti throwing something a at a at a the ... the Proud Boys and and the Mets won the fight breaks out it was not something that you guys at least that the main one that has been covered it was not something that you guys instigated\nAnd it's strange how quick the media is to run with the evil Nazi narrative without doing any research whatsoever and isn't it strange to how the media takes the five second clip and makes that\nThe total story when we have days and days and days are subterfuge stays in the domestic violence\nIt's almost like I'm at I'm at a point now I think they don't just like antifa they aren't you so I think a lot of these journalists visual hospital bloggers will go to rallies the masks on I'm convinced\nI Will tell you I I uh I'm having a very hard time defending a the press which I have tried\nTo be more moderating or on my on my words with the press but the the deeper we get in to the violence on the streets and the calls for kick them when they're down in all of this stuff are you there is no excuse\nWhen when when the when they will not Cole a mob mob an angry mob when everybody knows what that means I I don't know what I I don't know what to say I mean how\nDo you and I can't go to restaurants soccer crossing just today said he can't go to restaurants and they don't want to know conservative can go to a restaurant today that's a new one and it's because the the media will throw around a white supremacist\nLike it it means absolutely nothing oh it's a crime is this is someone who sees white people as above all other races just inherently better and wants all the other races out of America that is that we're markedly esoteric view to have it's it's a crazy if you to have and they just throw it on it and it sticks like glue\nAnd it affects our families affects our lives affects our personal lives there's gotta be some culpability there\n[noise] okay so Gavin hold on for a second I Want to own a take you over across the breaking and just\nAsk you what it is you believe what is the America that you see and that you are fighting for back was Gavin McGinnis coming up and just a second let me tell you a little bit about gold lying if you\nThink this stuff is going away quickly it's not a if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress\nWe are in we're in for a real wild ride um they are going to subpoena the tax records\nAnd when they don't get the tax records from the White House the White House will bring it to the Supreme Court and then the uh Democrats will say the Supreme Court doesn't have the you know doesn't have a right to do this because of of ah\nKavanaugh on and cabinet needs to recuse himself and he's not going to recuse himself then they're going to try to impeach cabin on and they all

a\nYear about a year to a head I'm not sure um maybe maybe because I think more people will look at this as things become crazier and crazier maybe but it's not about\nIt's not about reuniting with the left because I don't think you can unite with the the left the left has gone insane I think you can with a lot of Democrats and I'm not talking about the ones in Washington I'm not talking about political people and talk about your neighbors but the first thing we have to do is unite\nWith each other we have to unite to people people who are are on the right part of the spectrum need to come

capitalism\nCapitalism but not necessarily the way we're doing it\nNow where it's playing favorites the constitution but we haven't been on the constitution or the bill of rights that a long time but

someone's picture on a bench is not is not really a good idea\nJust read the number one part time job in America believe it or not is real estate agent and that's the last person that should be doing you're selling your house don't get somebody who's part time you've got to know who the right person is in the in the cells morals and everybody else and knows your neighborhood knows the price go to

or every country that has relations or with their zeal of a has a reason to be concerned because we still don't have any clarity on how will be a\n... government to project so you don't know exactly what's coming he he\nGrew up in a time where there was military rule in Brazil and that was that was overthrown a and democracy came and he has hinted in the past that\nUh that's the way you know you should run a government he has he has called for ... ... what a Ninety nine a civil war\nUm and the liquidation of about thirty thirty thousand Brazilians he is extraordinarily divisive but he is not he's not talking about a smaller government he is talking about a government run by the military or at least he has in the past correct\nAnd he's surrounded by military so ah he's closest advisers today are a military so a a an exception is a ... just a that is appointed as his ministers economy this guy is a liberal so we have several\nDifferent says regarding President Trump as you mentioned he's a he's a liberal\nAnd he uh comes as he had strong relationships with financial markets in Brazil so this is the man that he points that out as\nA base of the trust in his government but uh\nHe said he uh yeah it's not clear how he will manage his own team he has had some trouble controlling or his advisers that have given a interviews or saying things that he had later to a unauthorized them so\nUh it is possible that uh he will close down and keep a very closed government regarding depressed for example he has been using social media as his basic communication tools [noise]\nDon't ... this is the kind of ... the kind of the same thing that you go job is said\nWhen he was running the first time he said oh no it's not going to be this way I'm not going to do and he immediately came in and he started taking over the media and and the\nNationalizing everything is ... is there a ... ... is that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him that is the military and is it\nWhen you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect here most analysts are don't see any mediate a risk to democracy\nAs hail we'll uh take office and immediately he will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time what is expected is that maybe he could uh promote some change\nIn constitution and it is not clear how he would do it he has a suggested that he could create a council that would ah create a new constitution for Brazil and that would be submitted\nTo a vote or after it so and in ... to to people to a electors in general so it he had\nTo take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back when he takes office\nBecause the fact is that he's not going to debate he uh is giving I'm just a few interviews and usually he controls the process has been speaking mainly through social media\nSo he has no confrontation from the press and death\nCreates an unknown territory we don't know what's coming\nBut analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic at right at the time including because in the legislative elections he got a\nA strong a performance in eh from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of governance ... he and he will be able to do\nSome of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know exactly what\nWhat do those changes come it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\n[noise] uh that ... it ... and he posted online and a while back a photo\nOf him and next to Bannon and said that Bannon as said he would be glad to help in the campaign or something like this\nAt this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved and was responsible in a no great part of a sudden out of strategy but a bow sudden out of himself\nA came to the public as to what\nIt was fake news that has nothing to do with it what we know fact is that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ...\nAn expression of this right wing movement that with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's\nA it's a clear wave in this\nDirection and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there's a picture of him close to the president's ... presidential candidates Sen and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow that we don't know exactly at what point\n... Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nAnd now at the end of the month a ... on Sunday twenty eighth\nOr will have the final result it's very likely dead considering the current polls that they'll send that we'll be elected uh we uh yesterday we had a recent poll that gave us an adult fifty nine percent of valid votes and\n... that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one\nSo it's a big ... and I'm both an idle at poll after poll has indicated that uh his delight to ferry sure of their votes so and we we would have to have a new fact ... thing that would be strong enough to change the scenario and\nAnd it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and find out to some more will be falling out hey thank you so much ... appreciated okay\nThank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history a he has\nA he has a a very very strong history of um\nOf dictatorship a love and passion and uh he is not a Donald Trump he's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's a change demand\nA you know but this is the way things happen you don't come in as a dictator\nYou know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in Brazil the other thing that is we should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world and he is\nA helping cobble together this um populist movement and populism is neither good nor bad it's what are the Ames\nAnd uh what are they what ... what's you know what to someone use populism to get through populism is the Patriot act\nMake it so it sounds populist make it so it sounds popular make it so it sounds like something everybody will want that's populism and you can use that for good or evil and I'm In my opinion Bannon is\nOn the dark side of this one and he is definitely someone to keep your eye on and so we're all the candidates that he chooses and chooses to engage with um because I'm\nIn the rest of the world the the believe it or not softness\nAnd a tempered Donald Trump doesn't necessarily exist\nAre sponsored this half hour is simply safe\nSimply safe is the way to guard your home to watch over you and your family and it's the craftsmanship\nThe craftsmanship that actually helps um a simply safe beat out all of the other competitors and it makes it so worth it when you when you see simply safe\nAnd you see the price of it and then you see the quality of simple simply safe and then you see the quality a and the lack of craftsmanship and more importantly how much you've been paying for the other system it'll blow you away\nFor me twenty in Missouri is not expected to last much longer because it said several years yeah for me to live a selection and the lowest prices of the year and a heavy on sale and certainly not\nFind new roads Tuesday October ...

I mean I think you at the very least are going to do something public right and you're going to do potentially sanctions or something of that nature um you're probably also are going to tell them they need to be a incredibly uh open about punishing these people\nAre and sending that signal a and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with I mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then I remember\nThere was a world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "16"}
