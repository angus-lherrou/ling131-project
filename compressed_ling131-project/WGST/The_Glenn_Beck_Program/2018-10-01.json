last night have you seen the copy by the way hello soup have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser ah Christine afford\nShe was the she was a woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend she well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years\nExperience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by Barack Obama is head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nLet me say that again the woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was ... rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year so she's not a democratic hack\nAnd also not a defense attorney Rashid a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in her expertise is on old crimes\nTo be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right before I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this we're not going to see any uh CNN sock it to be leading with this\nNew York times not going to have this on the front page but it should be the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats\nLeft wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that Dr\nFord identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them\nShe then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court\nNot for prosecution [laughter] but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote it's pretty significant do you think and\nAgain like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah Brock Obama's ah the homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility I mean with the left yes\nSo she's saying that it's it's it ... won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee\nThis explains in my opinion why it was leaked in the final hour because every one who saw this new exactly what it was\nNow she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several\nTimes in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute it may look like she's credible ah but based on what she said not how she looked\nYou're looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this is this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty third team notes from a therapy session lift the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein office the date of attacked chain\nTo the early eighties now you might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late\nTeens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen\nYou're in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years it it gets\nBetter this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report it gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote\nThe alleged attack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens\nIf you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the\nEarly Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false and it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\n... on TALK radio six forty WGN in the\nMorning and good news Cobb County they cleared the cattle ...

are reasonable who can look at Ford and see her testimony and say okay so why why why wouldn't we just do the FBI thing in\nA reasonable world you're if you're absolutely right in a reasonable world you're right but this is not about Ford and this is not about making sure that these charges stick its why as soon as this happened\nAs soon as Jeff Flake said no no wait a minute hang on we want an FBI or investigation as soon as that happened the narrative changed now they're going after him saying he lied about drinking beer\n[laughter] okay he was for the love of Pete people\nSo this is how about how in the back dishes that he wasn't blackout drunk or how would you confirmed he well I Know\nI Know it's ridiculous I Know so uh\nWe're getting to that later because I as an alcoholic I got a lot to say on that one um but ah they've changed the narrative and they are playing the American people and here's an here's how it's working\nWhat they've done is they've turn this into something that is more than Kavanaugh look if Kavanaugh is a guy who did this I don't want him on the Supreme Court none of us do nobody does it's a bad thing\nBut you can't just smear somebody you have to have some evidence so because of the lack of evidence what they've done is they've not made this about Kavanaugh they've instead made this about\nVictims evidence play the elevator encounter with Jeff

J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago that ... that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black men for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life\nAnd they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community they all know that he killed the Nicole\nAnd they all know it yeah so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and and let me tell you\nI think a doctor's poured who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt her testimony\nAh I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws a just a ... it's a series of inconsistencies that would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right\nSo the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications and political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized or to support\nThe evidence just isn't there right you don't crucified someone with zero evidence and then what you're doing now is that they're moving the goalposts right I I saw Laurence Tribe ... this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor\nWho is talking about ah well you know you must have drank when he was in\nIn college or whatever I mean who cares\nBut it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like reading at him hey Lawrence those goalpost seem kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter] so John Carlin we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat or who uh has not lost his footing ah with with reason [noise] um so the address people\nAddress people who are let's say a twenty something female that says\nYou know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\n\nYes and there's also a a a chance that he was db Cooper right it would be ... you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a case it based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular\nSituation or other people that are justice qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system shorter murder\nSo the question now is the commitments right and there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion they in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is the scope of tore right there the guy's calendar clear is that right\nThe testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to cast aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that's the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic\nWhere we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nGoing to me there's is in court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but ... you're you're you you were asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline of when this happened to four times so I think people need to cast aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is to plead guilty by association ride mark judge I I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of this country has never met this man right so we're just going off of here see right now\nOut and beat cop is they'll memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had a serious drinking issues it's not Brett Kavanaugh but we're we're not nominating mark judge for the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut we can't do as destroy solar light destroy his family had like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with them with a clear ideologically\nAt the same that's what they do and and and banana republic that a third world countries that's not what we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we come back I I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second general or do you have to I'm I actually have to run the meeting about okay All right well run ... we'll talk some other time makes you so much [noise] I

want to start at the beginning with him let's go to Larry sure now hello Larry how are you\nAt Glenn how you doing good morning\nThe morning or so I wanted to talk to you I'm really from the beginning if you have time to tell me the story of your life um because you were you've had kind of a rough childhood\nYour your dad was black your well your mom was white they weren't married he was in the sixties\nThat's not a popular thing moms moms family she was afraid wouldn't accept you is that how it started that's true okay tell me the story from there\nSure um I was born in Manhattan I'm as you as you said by racial parents and my my biological mom didn't take the family would accept me so she put me up for adoption\nSo uh my biological father was not in my life\nSo I don't know um what he was thinking about that he wasn't in my life so I was very lucky and I was adopted by a biracial couple um my mother was ah my mom who was my mother um was German\nAnd met my father who was black in the army in Germany they brought me to the south Bronx\nAnd that's where I was raised by Yankee Stadium and you might know in the seventies and sixties when I was raised this was not the best neighborhood um so that's where I was raised a my father was a corrections officer at Rikers out in the jail here in New York City and my mother was a waitress and then worked in a bank\nShe and I left and we all we left together we were eight got enough money that we actually are packed up it was out to Long Island when I was around eleven years old\nMy father finally made enough money to my mother we worked hard to get out we got out of the the bat and everybody got Long Island and when my ... my father died he died of cancer and when he passed away it was very hard for my mom\nBecause how old were you I was a twelve okay so\nWhen my father died um my mother's down there was in Europe and that basically abandoned her for leaving and my father's family I'm a band that has also\nSo we were basically now\nI'm at that point is very hard for myself and my mom of course as you could assume so by the time I was Seventeen I was ready to get out of here and I decided to get out and I thought you know what I'm gonna go off and then I joined the army that's where I saw it on the go join the army like my father would be like my dad and go join the army so I go off to the recruiting station ... in this case they are all for recruiters\nIn the same building and I go to the army recruiter and he tells me\nSon is going to be great we're gonna make you a general and\nAnd the moms and

mid west we have lakes we have rivers we have we have Niagara Falls we have New York city the biggest city in the entire nation we have an old in my state\nHow in the world can that be run by one city it's impossible I Want to allow county has to be counties and regions to be regions and people to be people and it's totally fine the issue becomes why do I want to enforce my will upon you I Want you to be as conservative or liberal as you want to be\nPeople tease me and say Larry you're from queens how do you know you know what's right for upstate\nI don't that's the point and guess what you

just haven't done it in a long time so so Larry tell me your day one you're governor of New York where do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote 'cause it's a five way race in New York state and we are plurality state not a majority states we don't require fifty one percent\nThere's a runoff do whoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race\nSo assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen in ... percent but every time the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be with you when this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nTo does not just a Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is this ... this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York uh would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nIt is that important even come in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it would make better Democrats embed Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our potential Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government that will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant is just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties is supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right\nBut when there's a third party there were the libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened in civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government\nNow they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\nThere will be a massive\nMassive culture shock within within the uh the state of the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back I don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming\nThat I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that\nBut I have to focus on several things one a complete rebuild of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay\nFor things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government\nAnd that that the credit culture of transparency because the problem with those governments now is they're enforcing the kings will\nSo they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and I don't want the state government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution or what is that I don't know I Know\nI Know it's a show where his little ducked down due to document\nBarrier yet they are they I think we sort of the way it while ago yeah [laughter] but yeah that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families who met her individual businesses but individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value\nTo each community we don't do that well in the Senate all we have things called regional economic economic development of corporations\nWhich Albany which is no capital gains decides where the money is spent and opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county\nHow buttons that the county's can start to budget to zero so they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism how\nAbout the concept I'll give you to an interesting concepts one instead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and through the ranks spending\nHere's one idea that those both of those we have a bridges right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial Britain named after our well family that's embarrassing\nHow 'bout instead that Britain is named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights for the bridge\nWe retain the asset I got no business gotten that giving my ass at up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all these companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year on marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that she was on the weekends I got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every\nSingle day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area and\nHundreds of thousands of cars pass at every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nAt bat exes hang on just like a Texas New York's Michael is this guy from Texas you listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but he is the best part now we have them do maintenance again we own it so we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility their job is just repair it right they begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption\nSomeone else's spending and spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges which is right now when you say collapse we don't have enough money\nThese guys do will have to have safer bridge is less money and guess what we can start with holes\nIn New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen dollars you know if you're a truck driver I don't think a truck driver you pay by the axle you're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge\nLess money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea and there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so there you are you ... it's amazing to me how we are running\nHeadlong just
