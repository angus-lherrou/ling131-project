hello Anthony you're on the Glenn Beck program\nI Glenn how are you good how are you doing well so what can you you you mentioned earlier that are really the opposition to the people leading this leadership but the Democrat Party or or we'll have this right Nineteen eighty four with the inter Korean out a party\nAnd what I see happening with my friends on the on the left has their own a party members they work every day they're not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media\nAnd they're being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a cold or the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts are that\nAre I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference and unusual and for Julia people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the right punching back the people on the left and both sides suck\nWhile they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seeing their side being unreasonable violent view see ...\nThe way to answer and so far is not with uh the\nMilitant people it will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets\nThat is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment\nThat Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and you don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly\nAs we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer a A R a Judeo Christian country\nWith those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know\nCommunism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group you have to act wild there still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways\nTo be peaceful and not part of that angry

want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess okay you're you're um you're\nTalking about how am I going to come in and replace almost all the jobs and and I know you don't necessarily agree with everything that you've said that we need at least have a conversation about\n... because of it yeah and I you know I\nThink we need to be careful about even considering heavy I I think that there really is a fear over a I to try to come in and Institute which is something that they want to push that sort of socialism\nI think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other\nTechnical on ... where\n... you know the ... they were afraid that technology what's going to come and direct place their jobs aren't there probably are correct and so\nUm I understand that hey I definitely I mean and it's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people that want to create a\nMachine that can keep running you know there are certain things I just can't they don't like I'm being a ... a leak in her climbing in her house probably not going to do that\nUm as far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think many people are going to be upset if they go into the Donald and not have to deal with anyone that chick fillet is known for their service and I know that\nLet me ask you this let me ask you this first of all just and I do there's a don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this um ... or ... what books are you reading on AI ... or or you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general it cannot than paperwork unless I'm so I'm coming to you know different perspectives\nAre having the research that I Know that you have sure\nOn that but you know just my feeling like a a I was going to absolutely they will to diagnose cancer um quicker and are accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nCase so have there are there is a there and I can't remember the name of it on the uh uh this particular subject but I Will look for it or there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a that was if we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see our emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but a while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while\nI'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment but no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that through a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to go through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died they'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal\nThan anyone else the bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago\nThe uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board and what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that is seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it is I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today\nYou started your comment about the section of the book where I Know there's a chapter where I

three teenage boy I Am a higher instructor\nI was a police officer in Arlington beliefs continue for thirty seven years\nI've wanted their politics to be very very different\nI Would be probably

almost four hours I'd like to share with you the three biggest impediments we came up against because in this new era of communicating and communication I think there was considering remember same children\nSame goal impediment number one opinions outnumber people\nI Do realize that in this age of unlimited access to opinion that although there were seven people physically sitting around me there were many more opinions and voices brought into our conversation listen to the polling exchange between two mothers and I'm a progressive and mono a Christian conservative\nAnd see how many people opinions and perspectives are brought into the mix other than their own\nFrom my side what I hear in\nOh I don't infringe on any of my right and I don't want any restrictions on myself and it's kind of and I'm not going to my job I think it's kind of a bank that's been in place\nLike come on there are reasonable idea if we can come up with that ... going to end can stand\nBy and you're right
