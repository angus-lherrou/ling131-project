it's a massive turnout massive\nTurnout uh if the the red parts of the state don't actually turned out this state\nCould be in big trouble because it is a massive\nTurnout is there any thought or with the caravan of just learning from our friends to the south\nAnd what we do is we just let people come in and we just kinda guide them until they get all the way to Canada and they're walking north they'd never that necessarily they're stopping here a candidate beautiful this kind of your time of year we didn't kinda it's kind of walk on the side of the streets and just kind of having them\nAnd we would if it was going to Canada\nAnd they were protesting Canada I think there'll be a lot of people have said just don't cause any Trump just let him go to Canada I'm sure a lot of people in Mexico are saying that just running just what at least not our problem they just want to go to America just not our problem\nI have had [noise]\nHow can\n[noise] I Can't believe we have to have those announcements are but we\nWe did um and the crowd was more than ... sick if I was a Robert Francis a O'Brian or what's his name\n... or ... or running against Ted Cruz I Would be a little concerned um because it was an overwhelming response from Texas where Texans\nI thought were a little um\nI don't know calm about this election and it didn't really realize how much money Soros and others have poured in to make this a blue wave here in Texas\nMore than any other Senate candidates or for any quarter and history thirty million dollars for better or just for him that's not all that like that's not including the Soros money but it's going into the state outside a lot of money and tons of that\nUm so uh we're going to talk to the Governor Greg Abbott we're going to talk to him a little bit about the caravan and also about what's happening or here in our state he's also running for reelection but his knees so far ahead of any content or he is\nReally the greatest governor I have ever\nEver lived under I mean I've never had a governor of a state that I've been more proud of\nA than a Greg Abbott um and\nObviously a lot of Texans feel the same way because if they don't run away campaign for him\nBut the state of the state and the election when we come back to Governor Greg Abbott mark herring\nClimate to cook with the Georgia news network looks like hurricane Michael was so bad that it's\nGoing to mean a special session of the general assembly governor deal made the announcement this morning I'll speaker David Ralston quickly confirmed it is such and we'll start November

thrilled to have a the a great governor from the great state of Texas Governor Greg Abbott on with us now hello governor how are you sir\nReally and I am doing terrific how's it going\nGood it's always good to talk to you I'm a I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how's the turnout the rally around the rest of the state\nWhere this may be frustrating because the true answer is it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this a front running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're saying with regard to the turnout is a smashing records are not just for mid term elections which is what the stairs a but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds\nThe amount of votes that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is this and that is a massive\nNumber of people are turning out to vote will know that part but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up there and we want to make sure which people are going to do something to stop it but here's all I can tell your audience and that is\nIf you care about the future of Texas if you care about the future of America or you could not sit on the sidelines this election we're because there are other people out there who were casting those\nWho might be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this\nMe to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor and a lot of times people have said this is the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing a ... a election is it not\nWell he he captured the U.S it was very correctly because it just to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either rent under do label or they would call themselves a conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and didn't they were a progressive and now they are openly or lifting themselves as\nSocial with us and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor in Florida a is an out and now he says he is a\nSocialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism is not even further to the lab at the same things happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as\nThe open border policies that is socialism or with a look at the the wealth distribution policies that is socialism and these people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the recorded inflation rate and Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's\n... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and uh the you know unbeknownst to most people is Soros has dumped millions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing and so many of your listeners need to understand is that George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles a two years ago he gave a half a million dollars a directly to a candidate in Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly\nTo candidates in San Antonio on top of that has funded these grand games to get out the vote\nAnd so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like better but let's go back to the first part of your questions\nAnd listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities and counties you have a Dallas year after year and you have San Antonio Austin you have to El Paso and so you have these massive regions across the state of Texas that makes it so much harder for people who are conservative people who are Republican to be able to\nI've been there I Know what it feels like and that's what I decided to do something about it after listening my home with some agents they just could not get

minutes\nWhether that holds or not it's hard to tell us forty seven forty one and the latest poll um [noise]\nI don't know I mean I think you know I I feel like\nA conservatives and Republicans get teased by Minnesota a lot and you think oh well maybe this time is going to be the time and a lot of times that never has\nA ... we saw that in the presidential election too I mean we how many times the Pennsylvania seem like it was out to me that that happened and they never did until this last election where did turn over I think the more interesting race those the ones\nFor attorney general in Minnesota we know this one because Keith Ellison is running and normally I don't think we talked about a specific attorney general race not necessarily national interest is one with Keith else that I think is Alison was up by five points in the last full however that Paul happened right before all these sort of accusations started flowing against\nPeace that will not true though is it him in the bathroom with the guy is that true [laughter]\nI don't know what allegation that is I don't there was a new allegations again I Want to repeat it I Believe you're thinking of Cory Booker there was an idea that in our area do yes yes you are a little bit or for that one or not true is it I mean I don't\n... as I think you should all these things you are innocent until proven yet either Simon charges against Cory Booker one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every policy everyone up which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man made an editor's\nBut we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them for 'em so you know that's the way I think you're supposed to have let's why innocent until proven guilty is facing\nA and I think with not only a Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism about some of these relationships break up and there's\nThings that and who knows there's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing to what they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country believes\nCabin or should be you know I don't put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to ... they don't care about it he can do whatever you want they've completely ignored these allegations ... it was fascinating at the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happen ... latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda\nWow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well known is on TV all the time\nAnd he's she's credible she's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy dated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses\nThere's Dr reports at the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt to the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't write your phone and to win for I mean it's just crazy\nIt's an amazing one so that one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they thought they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up\nA instead it's forty three thirty six so right now we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go\nUh there's a if you're looking at right now a forty four seats are that are safe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have a seat it's forty six excuse me forty six\nIf you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you couldn't get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes Tennessee which is\nStill very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head there are ... and then in Texas still leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer than you did a few ... a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got to another six races that are toss ups that can give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're going to be fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can\nPull off six or six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things passed\nSo you know at that level of whether it's a him and they could lose it to that could easily still losing possible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six is is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that is a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it\nDid a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nThey lectured by numbers\nOn the weddings are pro over twenty third that is that going back program\nAll right when I take a break and we'll tell you about our spots and then we come back and I'm going to tell you about\nI mean there's a real problem and you haven't even\nConsidered it to really know what you know that which is er out but he ... saw Donald Trump you know and which is er\nI I did not do that you haven't been keeping track of all the ... the the which is that are putting X's on Donald Trump and\nAnd Ted Cruz and others now and what are they what are the Texas board of the ... actually intended to accomplish destroy them to destroy them yeah I have not seen this no oh okay well I've I've kind of brushed off myself I'm In I'm up on it but I got a brush it off I like I which is\nNo there is something else that we now have from a credible source that I think every American especially women\nNeed to be aware of what's coming up in just a second\nYou happen to see\nStories to a [noise]\nA\nIMF financial warnings and the escalation in the central bank gold buying in Hungary\nIs making the news ...\nHungary has in Greece dates gold reserves by one thousand percent\nIn a due to increasing quote safety concerns this the first time since Nineteen eighty six that Hungary's central bank is buying gold bullion and it's a lot of it up thirty one point five tons of gold\nAh they also have repatriated their gold from the bank of England to Budapest central banks in Europe are diversifying or moving in and repatriating to take possession of the gold and their own country\n... we were talking about that for a while really ... who knows that are hungry\nIn Poland or the most recent central banks to do this but Austria the Netherlands and the Germans were the first to do it uh they had been repatriating their goal from the bank of\nAnd the Federal Reserve in recent months and years just bought it from a goal but within a lot easier right why ask for it back on and doesn't really\nThe reason why repatriation of gold is dangerous is because of a word and write this down on\nNow and they're going to do good rehire path occasion thing again are you I'm just saying that brave yet\nWhen you hear it your blood will run cold when you hear people actually talking about well the problem is ...\nThat's when you had to the mountains [laughter] that's when you know so that's the only reason why I bring this word up when you read about it in a serious way that they are now starting to discuss re high ...\nThat's when you run for the hills okay right now we're at the beginning of that possible wonderful thing by um you know everybody claiming their gold\nAnd who's gold really is it all\nAnd all of the central banks buying more gold\nShe ... what is it that they know that perhaps you don't know\nMe I suggest you cold gold line and I'm not asking you to buy and he goes I just want you to read just their report that is out now on what\nA democratic victory may mean to the United states and to your financial status read it read the report I've read it I recommend you share it with everyone you know\nGet the

know this is the\nThing we were talking about this off the air a little bit because you know Donald Trump used the word nationalist yesterday when we're talking about nationalism and what the definition of nationalism in history is is at times very disturbing way um however ... you know I don't know I'm sure that's not obviously no one is citing\nThe really bad examples of nationalism as it as where we are trying to go with your Donald Trump or not they all we want to be like those terrible countries he seems to be referring to it as like look where the best country and we were our Arctic and we have a great the best you know culture and the land and we should be\nA you know patriotic and and and be a you know sure excited about that but when you talk like this that when you when you play a clip like that it's hard to kind of argue that we don't have a superior culture and a lot of ways\nYou know like I can say that because you've probably been possessed by a gym\nOr go to the gym talkative and now it's a different kind of chance for a long time and I've had a lot of of ... ... talk or in my life I lead struggle yeah it it gets you into believing in the ads that man dearly love or you know\nSixty shot of beer on a program that Lee alive on the air or it could be an issue and I think I'm OK thing that a culture that embraces women as equals is superior to a culture that that puts them but won't let them drive and and forces them to address a specific way that you can't even see their face like that it that I mean\nThey are enjoying a literature but those are all just social construct\nMaybe it's just a good social now sometimes things are built and they're good to know the good piece of can no jobs out from the west a lot from the west\nWhich brings me back to the caravan when we come back\nI met cook with the Georgian news network governor deal is calling a special session of the legislature for November the thirteenth to deal with the costs

to do about it\nWhat do you think we should do about it and you need to have this conversation with all of your friends right now\nWhat do you call people Seventy five hundred who are political Marxist activists that's what they are political Marxist activist marching with the Honduran flag\nIn protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them as they're marching towards our border they're not refugees\nThey chose to leave their country they're finding their country\nThey were trying to get a do a political stunt\nSo what what are these people where did they get the money who's doing the supply chain how how do you even have the bathroom services all along the way who's providing medical aid so it's not a death march you can't march\nTwenty five hundred miles and expect everybody to be okay and in good health when they arrive\nThings happen\nWhat do who's providing medical aid who's providing the water\nWho's providing the trucks that so far we haven't seen anywhere else we aired them yesterday on the news and why it matters in fact there I don't know if we have this video\nBut if we could play this a video or if you have it at the video of a these migrants being loaded up into giant semi trucks they're being trumped from place to place from photo opportunity to photo opportunity\nYou pointed this out there that I I didn't notice it initially but there's there's women walking with strollers\nAnd it's like well a stroller is not designed for a thousand mile walk number I like that's not how that happens in them or they're getting out there grouping up their racking for a couple of miles cameras get them then they get back in trucks and get their major they drive\nLooked at the ... video again role that video again please tell me how many women use spot climbing into the back of the semi truck [noise] just count them\nEven just count them as of right now you cast out if the that well you know all of them counted right one all of them county was counting one one and he said and by the way just to clarify you want you want me to individually point out the women that are women that are quite a big crowd but the women that you can see that the one they're one and a on the um\n[noise] one Mm okay now [noise] so this isn't women and children who are these people are we know that MSN MS Thirteen now has embedded the people in to this group I mean style Seventy five hundred people\nAnd I want to play some audio uh this is ... let me see if I can get the right one uh\nYeah I think it's a I think it's CNN and Cuomo can you play this here on what the military is going to do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you put military down there we know what the God Forbid is in this situation\nHow was that good for anybody if cars you know is it you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that send who wins and\nBut I don't think they're going to wind up in the country a wreck and can I don't think that it has to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you have a must happen what do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be hearing you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in\nLearning passwords for America can\nYou have a ... year you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and to turn them away right there it's an invasion treat it as an invasion turn way\nYou said is an invading force these people they're not come anywhere lately\n[noise] now the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away and\nThey didn't like that they decided they had to put a shutter on it and then they started looking for shutters that would make the right noises so when and when did you catch and close you could hear it and then they had to find the right material that could do it you know five thousand times without any kind of wear and tear on it\nThat's the work that simply say puts into your

going to go a different direction okay is MS twelve available you know no no they're found out on [laughter] yeah yeah I mean that's a I mean\nYou know we've talked about this before MS Thirteen the United states constantly is is that is just a Donald Trump fever tree it's nothing it's not a big deal where they're killing people at four times the rate as of ...\nShooting so if you think it was Thirteen isn't an issue\nProbably don't think school shootings or an issue which I tend to hear a lot of people on the left speak very loudly ... about school shootings when they go on and what exactly is that cause uh for them so I mean I like ... the real issue I mean and this goes to a a deeper part of this which is\nYou it's not even if let's just say we thought they were all really good people we didn't know that there are any gang members in there that's to say that again come in that way you don't come in that way that you have to have a process to be able to decide whether people

to be fascinating to watch because you know there's a good chance that you know as as Greg Abbott talked about that you know Mexico doesn't want to deal with the pressure from the United states and the ... issue they're going to try to find a place to settle them within Mexico so it's a good outcome that are not on our borders\nCause you know what that is that's the Palestinian people yeah but we don't we don't know I mean I think the point of doing that is to not anger out right so you would think that they would do it in a way to avoid that and then you end is going to be very helpful\nAgain I mean the governor a tech I Know I Know that so I Know I I Know dumb reason to believe it's possible but ... if it doesn't happen and they get here and try to over on the border this

spirit to make Republicans winners in the mid term elections two weeks from today the president saying yesterday\nAnd likewise when they share something you guys been offended um so it's really the app is but it's gonna come out later this week on 'em\nAnd Google Play and the app store but it's the twenty first century version of Drudge Report it is for conservative video content\nUm that out there that's being pushed to the side and and hidden by these tech company\nWhat platform you're keeping it all on what do you what do you I mean you're going to Google Play I mean you're going going right into the hands of the beast or what are you doing to ensure that they ... they aren't um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody else well what we were trying to\nDo because I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's going on with some running and conservative content so we said\nYou know if we can find all these great conservative publishers and say hey here's what we want to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play in the apple store but I think this is I'm a sort of the first step to be able to counter\nThat suppression from YouTube and Facebook so who do you have on board so far so we have a conservative review we've talked to Breitbart we had a great meeting with Prager you last week they're on board obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time hearing of it but I Can't imagine we're not\nYeah so and what we're really doing is you know we're pulling the content from your Facebook page and from your your tips so\nUh the blaze channel benefits because the view ... to you guys\nAnd the other thing that we wanted to do I'm In this we're we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook and so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it and then we'll work with our team at our network to make sure that\nUm you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your content\nSo what do you think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um uh it is um [noise]\nIs something that I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives are just now starting to say hey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together um because they're starting to see the writing on the wall or in many different directions\nAh so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who is trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices [noise] what do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we need a conservative Facebook\nNo we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean we need to be a if if it's known as a conservative thing only conservatives are going to go there so how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first kick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with the swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the Capitol we talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this is a\nBernie Sanders ... light shared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys name that was all about the contest\nAnd that's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really weak mobile application makes it easier for people to interact with the contact\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in Brazil with a with a young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going\nYou know you can't sell that we can sell the libertarians to Staci into older and you know\nAll this freedom and talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to the youth and they are making huge gains and headway because you know they're twenty somethings that have\nWho are are naturally attracted to freedom and said there's a better way to package this I think that's great\nAnd anything you're doing to encourage a you know twenty somethings to do that I think as time they take\nCharge yeah I think so I think you know having the big conservative publishers on board um does banding together you know with this program\nWe're going to find a lot of talented people out there who are you know frustrated who are amazing videographer isn't filmmakers who go out there and shoot this content um and let them be the bridge to reach the next a conservative or libertarian generation\nSo you're the update dot com or let me let me I'm a switch topics with you 'cause you know you of consulted a with candidates et cetera et cetera but do you think is coming our way to places first\nBlue wave red wave ... wave\nYou might as well flip a coin so I live I it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat so you know I talked to a lotta guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said oh it's you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media sang\nIt's always about local that as a the Kavanaugh saying coupled with Cortez coming out and saying you know capitalism stock going to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think that Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bad\nYeah I was telling somebody earlier this week the orange he just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted democratic ... can you continue to vote Democrats\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean these are radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was in rod blooms district and these are we went to a machine shop and these are life long you know Democrats a lot of them switched over to vote for President Trump\nBut I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I still you know identify as a Democrat voter\nSide just rattle off a couple of issues and I'm like\nI hate to break into your man you're you're you're no longer for in this Democratic Party right so yeah it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out two weeks away\nHow do how do you think the president and ah the Republicans should respond to this caravan coming up\nStop it I mean I think the president's made it clear where either country of laws or not and\nIt it you know the the roost that they're using that this is\nUh it's amazing how well the left uses terminology to try to convey people to their side\nBecause now they're asylum seekers you know their asylum seekers or their asylum seekers you apply for asylum in the first country that you arrive to which would be Mexico so it's not about that it's about getting to the United states is about sending money back to their country uh I don't even\nKnow if it's about that these guys are\nThese guys are Marxist or that are upset at uh the the the politicians in Honduras that kicked their Marxist a guy out who had ties to Venezuela and to Castro in Cuba\nThey've been trying to do all kinds of ... in in Honduras they're ... they're\nCarrying the Honduran flag that these guys are Marxist radicals at least the leadership is\nI I Would have to imagine that if I was in a their situation if I was legitimately or refugee and I got to Mexico in Mexico was willing to hear my case or process may\nI Would wait in line for as long as it took the helm ... you know myself or my family for them to just break down the barricades and and charge the police officers in Mexico and say guys that you can't stop us we're going all the way the United states and right you know singing Honduras national anthem\nYeah it's this is about politics and who's funding them yeah it's a great issue but I'm\nThe president should stand strong and stop it if they make it that far [noise]\nAll right but the uh the name of the athletes launching went this week launching this week you can go to the update dot com or give his\nEmail address and we'll send you early access end of this week when it hits both um the apple store and Google Play\nGreat thank you very much for coming by thinks All right it's a the update dot com\nOr the\nCar and let me tell you a little bit about the American financing [noise] I'm I'm very concerned about some things um there's going to sound insane\nShortage of dollars a there is a shortage of dollars coming and I know that sounds crazy because we we we've been printing all these dollars where are all these dollars\nWell the problem is is the government keep spending more and more dollars and the government is looking for people to buy our treasuries which is a giant loan with US dollars\nI'm Matt cook with the Georgia news network I Want to deal with calling for a special session of the legislature to pay for the costs for hurricane
