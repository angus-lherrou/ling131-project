evening temperatures falling into the seventies quickly after a sense that it dry hot pattern will continue all week long for CBS forty meteorologist smelling a call on\nTalk radio six forty WG as the making your day just a little brighter no really we do just take out those sunglasses look again\n[noise] [noise] Mm [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] Mm [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] Mm Mm Mm\nMm [noise]\nThey if they claim that command\nAll right now we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the background check on Kevin a neat\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and you were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned Oh yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets him and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOr like you are in the south but yeah every important it's so important is very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not ... the role that really closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like a judge\nOr ... or ah or um [noise] ah\nGeneral general attorney general would really like one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up mhm because there's cause for certain candidates or who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been\nA a credibly accused or by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this ... there's a separation between the capital case in the house in case of the cabinet case happens ah thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's the one difference ...\nA professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nIssued a very spotty memory and now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between word and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that really got both of those so there are a little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay and so does\nShe ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\nWell yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from their donor who around those cases yeah the the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison teeth Allison's I'm a former girlfriend a doctor new name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries ah um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction\nBetween those two things one has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll usually meeting me\nYeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos of the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not\nUm being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with the of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties\nNone of them can remember it happening the people Ford named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them said I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way a key those in a girlfriend has also\nA named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um\nIncluding things like tax I'm writing um pictures and those are things\nThat she showed two co workers in real time real\nTime and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like who Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at\nThat time yeah but but but lives and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well there was you know\nTake no we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm\nOf course there's no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck
