there and I'm doing well how are you\nGood I'm I'm a I'm I'm really fascinated by how we make the turns in our society for the future\nAnd a ownership is a big part of this because in the future I don't know how many people leaving on cars I mean it's just it's just all changing but do we really own things when we buy them on line\nSo I think there's a real concern here that consumers go into transactions when they're buying things and digital goods are especially digital books movies music\nThey go into this transaction that sooner than they were the same way they do in the in the world is tangible goods where if you buy a book\nYou can give it away to a friend you can lend it to someone you can leave it in your will or in the future and leave your book collection a two or your loved ones\nAnd the rules that control the digital transactions when you buy something on your Kindle or for my children's are very different from the rules that we expect in the physical world\nAnd consumers don't really understand that distinction and I think that causes a real disconnect between what we all expect to happen and what happens in fact so to give you a a quick example I'm just a\nCouple of weeks ago I'm a consumer uh a customer the apple ... a movie store found that three movies purchased had we had been deleted from his account there were no longer accessible and I think

things like that happening in China if you're ... if you're in China in the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that\nEvery copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it but it's also real concern\nOr from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history these books are ... are are stored on these centralized servers and only the hands of\nYou know the the the two or three companies um that dominate these markets\nThen there's a real risk that um we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to uh to to uh to archive and preserved um these these works\nIn an air and it was a movie it wasn't because they found it objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nTo their number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know that a factor totally clear on exactly what went on so one way this can happen is that as you described\nUm the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires they no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or a movie studio decide that they want to put out the new updated re mastered directors ... edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo hell home I Do [noise] um\nOh my gosh ... almost ... force you to I mean 'cause they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and the you know fully restored but you still had the old copy now threat you can't you I mean even for thinking this even just for comparison\nYou can't if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed in our war huh well I Want to see what it was like when they originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and the and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer and people have a local copy stored on their computer or their device\nUm and and this is this a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally when these services are often trying to\nEncourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own set of cloud storage solution and seven times um for with the Apple TV for example\nThe Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of a movie you have to access it through their ... servers\nExactly I'm\nSorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded or something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\nSo that allows you to store those files locally on your own device\nBut cars that Kendall is tethered through soft where right where connections to Amazon Amazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it move those files stronger\nWhen my ... ... you're talking about or go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years ago two and a very different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way David forest everybody to have it exactly [laughter]\nIt's bizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making provide tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\nYou it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they're constantly knowing what you do with that product and you have that ongoing relationship\nWhere they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk of but a little bit about the change their cars that either but that's a real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break and then we'll come back and get you to answer that question a and just the\nChange in in capitalism change what does it mean to enter a world where there's really no ownership of anything\nFor years now relief factor has been helping uh my team here in the studio\nAlleviate pain late last year um oh ...\nWell I Want to tell you about really factor really factor take it it's a really good [laughter]\nI'm married and you can buy really factor with gold one thing you can I don't think you can mount a case I Want to tell you a little bit about the goal line the new silver maple flex allows you to break off a smaller pieces are for barter Andrade of sub silver\nUm there's a really I mean we just talked about the debt\nI don't know what's going to happen to the dollar nobody does nobody does nobody knows what's gonna happen bitcoin what's it going I mean there is if there ever is a time of of catastrophic change there's going to be a time when we're all going to have to kind of work together and figure things out or because of the things aren't going to work the same with with dollars\nMay I suggest that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a they have the maple flex going which is this\nThis bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it around it has a maximum flexibility you just break off pieces and uh you can have you know one tenth one quarter of an

I don't I have a heater junk I Can't do anything with it because I don't own the software that runs it\nI think the cars a great example um we see this issue come up and the motor vehicle contacts or the ... the way it come up um [noise] uh most most recently in most often is actually not with cars but with tractors or John Deere\nUm the long a running American farm equipment company makes exactly

dealers\nThey can't do it themselves they can't go to their local mom and pop a you know farming and repair shop [noise] um I think those kinds of changes are really troubling\nBecause they go to this sense of independence in the sense of autonomy that we're all independent actors in the world who can make our own decisions who can decide what's best for us do we want to keep his tractor as it is do we want to modify it do you want to repair it\nThose decisions are being taken away from individual consumers and you're doing forced to play by a set of rules dictated by the companies to quote

going to jump in or off this cliff with the rest of humanity\nI Do not believe the victim I Will take seriously the account of the accuser\nThen I Will look at the facts if there is a preponderance of evidence then I Will presume that person either innocent or guilty\nBut after I've seen facts is this kind of stuff was going on this should all be in the court of law\nIf you are a victim\nSociety will do nothing for you because we cannot do anything for you\nIf you haven't gone to the police and reported it if you believe that we live in a rape culture then you have a responsibility to go to the police and document everything that has been done\nThen we as a society need to do everything we can to make sure that justice is served not on a collective basis but judging it by the individual case\nThat is a just society that is America [noise]\n\nWednesday until they're in air listening to that going back program one\nOf my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gay that was an interview in fact where he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go\nAnd then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and Eric Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it he said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's up to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he he doesn't sugarcoat\nIt and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... uh and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google or hasn't takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been they are more than just a company and making money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it and Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that\nIt's not just about privacy is not that they're taking all this information\nGlands are using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the cabinet case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming ah understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen\nThat right yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... Stein a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it's secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yes it's it's a verb I dunno Google it yes well I'm from Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed\nRight that's like going to a dictionary that will always change the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's a real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly well because it's occurring and real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about\nUh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't like you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news this competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put up my fake news story the point is is out in the open you have combat and by the way the news doesn't really convince anybody\nYou know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you voted in different\nThat wasn't that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\n[laughter] but you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm trends parents right why will you know I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back\nDo you have an answer their answer on why they won't make a transparent\nYes and it's not very good and you\nKnow that it's not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line the ... dot com Peter ... is with us and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\nA and kind of a role in from our last conversation about\nInformation how

own platform together we don't have to join business area but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies are are going to de platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing ... here yeah I I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine Google actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning\nThey blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you the ... the scope and size that Google has wait a minute if if the ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an area that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous and a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google products somebody will say why don't use the mail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but is your company ... you know it may be John Smith at acme incorporated dot com\nBut his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example\nRobert apps signed this caller who has been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran uh did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this is back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they hid shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech yet on general a gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from the point being that have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy\nThey are more than a traditional company they say so themselves they view themselves as a company with a mission\nSo here's what people say when when you know what I use Gmail well you know\nGoogle is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually\nYou are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their age I research so Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look you know there's ... this is just at the beginning let me tell you is bouquet story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay\nThe center is the main city of Beijing how many people that you just look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy picked somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide K [laughter] they had a picture of the guy", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city":
