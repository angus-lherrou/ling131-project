you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines law that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors are always working uh you know even even when they listen to their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nDo you know and everyone knows humans are kind of already headed out when people are you yeah\nOf course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause they think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm I can trust ticket subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what higher up in the list they think the the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product\nIn search results uh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of that now we've now done with for national elections involving\nMore than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes which no one having this light is\nIdea that they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track you know that is scary\nIt is you um you leave this out in the in the creepy line I'm about how\nGoogle has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda [noise] um and then\nA ... ... how they have ... you know\nThe ... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where you were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added\nTo search result of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect is absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the last almost no one was aware\nThat they were saying biased or in a search result socialist that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nSo you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you uh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent of people in the study uh could see no bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs\nAre in their voting preference says so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability\nTo shift people's thinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know you that's a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and it was they had the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs or around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and\nWithout leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results have felt like a news story they just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know Wilson and Bernays a in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that\nThis is the this is the system that they would have dreamt of propaganda [noise] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article a called a can of ways big tech\nCan shift millions of votes in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem as the eye me that's just one of ten ways\nUh that I've identified over the years and then I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment\nAh that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they are I mean some of these the effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they're ... or ... years and there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\nWell into thousands sixteen early two thousand sixteen or working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people are seeing while they were using the Google bang\nAnd Yahoo search engines that was the election related votes as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system and so it was a first ever created and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nAh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now and that's that's pretty blase that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nOr you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think the able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point\nUh you know I Wish we well I Wish we could be fully up and running and time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but\nWe will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nOr that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which\nHow am I travel [laughter]\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay um it was ...

control or the threshold of mind control doctor\n[noise] [noise] uh well we've been here for a long time then there's a you know yeah there's no question about it there's they're literally right now more than two point five billion people soon to be over four billion\nA whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences are are affected are dramatically uh every single day\nBy a some minute elation is that the big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I just I I Want to re sad that you did a study during the last\nPresidential election you are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were\nTrying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's the only one way we then have the search suggestion effect now target messaging\nAffect what is the target ...\nSure targeted messaging T I may recall that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing effect\nIs really scary ah this this means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to but if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November\nTwo thousand sixteen is that morning and mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders uh mainly just supporters of Hillary Clinton or exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that was even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day and additional four hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh I\nDon't I I don't think he did that because you know he was very over confident or you know as as we're Democrats uh I'm not a Democrat or not\nI'm On a ... a moderate and an independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so I'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data that\nThat just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifting boats and think about it no one knows if if something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there they were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't what\nTargeted advertising is all about but you see targeted advertising though is competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something that's not competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive so\nCan I mean this is so dangerous\nUm and it is I mean it's everything that aside fi you know a writer has envision forever\nOr and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise] Oh yes they can they in fact they know who's an unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican

talking about for years I mean since since we you know we're working together just the two of us in the nineties and I said some day it's going to be that you won't believe your eyes because they'll be able to create a video of anybody doing anything and you won't be able to believe\nYour eyes while we're there I've been talking about the coming of AI why did last hour\nWhy did that affect you so much\nUm couple of things uh one I think like we all\nThere's a lot of people who claim that that these big tech companies and stuff have biases and I think that there's some evidence that they do um you know and it but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they may lanes like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true and a lot of cases [laughter]\nUm you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter would do a\nTest of the two thousands sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really a major thing this is a ... you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks they down and all this is like a\nLot as a leader in in in psychology yeah it's I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I mean this guy is the real\nDeal with some real credibility again it comes to it it's almost hard on the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate as he described as Hillary as voter right right\nUm but beyond that uh ... seems incredibly helpless to me\nTo stop it I mean just you know 'cause we talk about this all the time how do we\nMove how do we how do we convince people how do we persuade people to look at the world and ex slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right ah and we talk about that stuff all the time\nBut I Know that I can easily supporter you know a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily 'cause I just do it right it but it's harder to make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to own my one myself from Google I honestly have no idea how I Would do that\nAnd I'm and I'm not even use an Android app me so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating as you know a spot for use shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're nuts if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go Google device yeah not use them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance\nApparatus only\n... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I\nMean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know in one of the reasons they do is it's the best what right like this is a problem because the the part of the reason\nWhy it's the best one is because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right um you know ah the search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used as it's been a you know I'm ... I mean you know as you get into deep stuff and you but I don't even know how to unwind myself from the basics there how it would even do it\nNot to mention the stuff that you know what you talked about with um\nCertain browsers or use other uh you know at all apple products right use Google\nFor the injured search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about the someone will will say hey what about duct duct go duck duck goes a a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using and I want to go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell it's gonna make any difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on grown\nSo now I've got ... I gotta switch emails I gotta switch phones I gotta switch browsers I like my whole life is turned upside down and I can't I Can't come up with an up personal\nCost to what Google is doing right now to justify a life altering move like that what did he say\nThree hundred million word yet documentary million ...\nIs like a ... of of\nData on you\nAnd that ... million pages pages of data and again like but I I don't know\nWhat is the personal cost to me\nIn that data well there's several things there are some things that could turn into I think there are several things that could turn into that are really negative for society he talked about how you could take a fifty fifty proposition\nAnd just by Google suggesting one way or the other can move people to Ninety ten Ninety percent go the way that Google wants them to go that's in that's incredible it's a great argument to have real principals right make sure you actually know what you're a ... or what your\nFeelings are on an issue before you are you are influenced like this because we can see how voters do that but I mean the other part of that too is you go to a place with no cookies and no none of these things tracking you well they don't know your preferences and they don't know the things that you like and there are negatives to that it is a real struggle I don't even know how it would do it if I Want it to the problem is not\nToday this is not today it's just\nTechnology is now starting to a compound upon itself exponential growth\nIn ways that we will not be able to understand I mean as the book I write about this in addicted outrage and\nYou know use it you said when you read the uh chapters on a technology I remember you came in and ... okay well that's a little bleak oh yeah but I mean they fail in their right right it's it's\nIt I mean it ... you just heard that from a guy who's been studying Google for ten years\nAnd he's a he's a Clinton supporter ... is he saying anything less than I Am saying\nNo I mean I think if anything it backs that up yeah and that's that's was terrified because we can all look at the potential future of some sort of series of events that could go negatively and you know you've talked about that you've talked we've discussed openly sometimes you think as a catastrophe pissed right like you think of the worst case scenarios\nBut these are measured results these aren't worst case scenarios the fact that the top ten Google risk a rare search results are returning things favorable to Hillary Clinton is not some wild crazy theory it's something that already happened in his over where are they now\nWhat are they doing with this now and imagine if they get over more overt we talk about you know Trump pushes a lot of buttons of people you saw how they acted with Kavanaugh\nRight you saw how the left really act ... acted crazily towards the Supreme Court justice when they feel so justified\nIn the way they act they get crazier and crazier and crazier and as this stuff escalates they're gonna feel justified to take more overt action and you got only knows where that ends up I I ... I mean it could go in really bad directions [laughter] this is um uh\nWe we are entering a ten year period now where our lives\nYou really will not recognize your country the world or our lives by twenty thirty you just will not if you when you see the rage\nOn the faces of the leaders of\nOf the left and the Democrats and they're saying we have to get more radical remember you're already talking about a group of people that believe the ends justify the means\nYou're already talking about a group of people and let's make sure we're not like this a group of people that believe they are right to the point that the others have to just be either re educated\nOr eliminated let me ask the Democrats you you have\nFifty percent of the country that just does not honestly seen the world the way you see it\nWe are just as set against what you believe is right if you believe that socialism is the answer capitalism should be shut down and freedom of speech needs to be curtailed\nIf it stays on its current track the southern and central portions of the state are expected to receive heavy winds and rain on Thursday the storm is expected to move quickly east poured out of the state Black Friday\nWould that county fire officials are investigating a huge fire that destroyed almost Ninety boats yesterday morning police broke out road boat\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nTraffic on TALK radio six forty double duty as the\nPunch out first all the economists six Seventy five north on the right to too many times you sound picking up the right lane there should be getting moved\nOn the side also right lane with construction he'd see north on before now said and weddings throughout both directions there I inside meanwhile in West metro it is at least one lap lanes lock orange barrel by twenty west on the highway twenty seven sketchy bumper to bumper traffic am I going to count on [noise]\nEngineer solutions to Georgia experts you can trust service you can count on lifetime ... just ask satisfied customers deep sternly\nInspectors recognizes injured and solutions for us that was the first call we made it was to engineer so we should say we like your beer and we need to get this done and let's get started they were very responsive email phone anytime we wanted to contract and were questions or concerns and say we're right on the response\nEngineering solutions provides qualities for his service to their customers are officials and professional and everything that they do the richer for his outstanding and they've provided a quite an extensive warranty for the work that they do as well that really like what they did and I like different version was a [noise]\nI'm In [noise]\nMonday October eighth what's new today on the free her radio [noise]\nFor decorating the house for just sitting there scary movies\nDuncan spicy platelets has killed tracks with labor is by the way you know after [noise]\nThe flame mainstream break out all our great daily party playlists whether you're at home or the stadium\nAnd the new I our Radio Free ... collection that come out now [laughter]\n[noise] weather on TALK radio six forty double duty as tea\nFor CBS forty states meteorologists sounded like how I look for increasing times every night as temperature and stay mourn only in your family five Monday morning Monday afternoon in the classical continued vanity temperatures slightly cooler type type out only in\nThe mid eighties we'll see if you scattered showers across the area on Monday watch for an increase in the rain this week thanks to tropical storm Michael expected to arrive later this week for CBS forty six different meteorologist smelling the column\nServing Atlanta with mostly better than average broadcast for a large portion of the day talk radio six forty WG as the Atlanta is compelling talk\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd then come and do the left and the New York times and the media don't seem to really have a problem with is uh the left believes they need to become more radical uh and they need to turn things up\nA notch now I don't know how you do that\nI mean now I did recommend you know get teams I guess they could\nStart using ...
