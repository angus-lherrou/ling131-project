mention the media law to poke him where the big wall our next our Bill O'Reilly ...\nSo I the last uh last weekend I was at a um a tech and a economic conference and\nThings are moving so fast\nWe haven't even talked about the five gee network students about five gee network no not too much going to change absolutely everything absolutely everything\nSixty five million sixty five percent of Democrats\nBelieved when George Bush was in office that he had something to do with nine eleven and that conspiracy was started by someone they claim is on the right and he is not\nA it was started by what's his face loud mouth guy what's his name is do a no no no uh Alex Jones sixty five percent\n[noise] whatever it is a you know and I and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensively and he basically said factor that's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one so Donald Trump could have done that easy\nBut he chose the fight back trumped it and he said I'm not going to let these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end and the American people uh see me as a fighter\nThey see me as a person who strikes back when attacked so while I'm going to do that so then you have to say okay well who started the fracas who started this and you can make a case that\nTrump's bombastic a tax on his rivals in the uh in the primary process um started it you can make a case for that\nHow how he's he's a table names yeah\nHe's a symptom the American people have never been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them on your feeling be ... and ... to death by being called racist and homophobia and everything else came\nLater when it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win\nSee what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could do anything if you're going to have a chance he was he was like entertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear\nThat out of the press saw him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed\nAnd I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does okay so then it was destroy him\nDestroy ... that that would be orders that came down from the editors of the New York times not in those words but it was very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nElemental Facebook I mean they're on their ... their own video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered\nHow does Trump\nCounter what does he do he doesn't have surrogates\nI mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it in a very bold lunch and sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what\nHis choice what if he doesn't do it\nThey are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah you know liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that but he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him\nAnd the reason he has it been is because it gives them no quarter yes he fights back but now they're turning it around saying well your your fight back like Kavanaugh\nKavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if not fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament oh come on you're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion it's the same thing\nSo now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it when we see it and we're not responsible for any of it all in all ...\nNow I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people understand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch that so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh\nHow much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times literally paragraph thirty five\nIn the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened to us from the jump of course they're cartoon bombs they are the only thing it it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight or gay or straight this is ... ... who was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy\nCould be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really\nUnbelievably worst bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt it could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these to the press wrist and needs to all of the all of the enemies of the right obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence them in terms of putting my money on ...\nYeah [laughter] [laughter] how do how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank with no political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when I was why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flashes up pretty quickly\n... Howard the press handle what I think that they would um look you have to understand it every morning out of the Washington DC think tanks progression fish tanks and stuff\nTo Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff so that they'll they'll sit down and go okay now how are we going to spin this uh may be the person and sending it was insane or you know that kinda thing

ambushed after having a Humvee take a hit from an IUD\nHe was treated um he was a treated or in the wounded man and needed to carry one of the soldiers off to another Humvee to be met it backed out\nOne of the soldiers had his arm severed just below the elbow when he was in shock\nHe handed the soldiers his own arm after applying a tourniquet and told the soldier he needed to follow him as he got another soldier out at the was unable to walk the man looked at his own sever an army and his hand and repeatedly told the medic that that helped him that his arm was fine and this was in his arm\nSometimes we just don't know how to deal with things\nFor two solid weeks I lied to myself my daughter was fine and this didn't happen didn't happen to her it didn't happen to us and I broke down in tears finally able to process what had fallen my now seven year old daughter\nMy wife forgave me for spending those two weeks\n\nIt wasn't until months after\n\nThat we would figure out who had done this terrible thing all I wanted to do after she told me about this\nWas\nFind this uh this guy and cut off the offending appendages\n\nAs it turned out it was a twelve year old boy he was in my Sunday school class for ten months\n\nI had been teaching this boy in Sunday school\n\n\nOh how I hated and wanted to hate this young man\nI wanted to ruined his life before it even began\n\nI wanted to let you know\nThat in the height of my hatred I downloaded your book addicted to outrage on audible\n\nAnd I heard you speak that I\nI realize that my outrage was justified but it was also toxic and it would become a force to be used to destroy me I needed to forgive this boy because we are required to forgive all\nMen I forgave him in my heart\n\nAnd as I did I felt the burden of my outrage and anger lifted\nYes the pain of what happened still lingers and the reality of the situation is still very real but my outlook in my spirit or no longer held hostage by my hate\n\nI just wanted to thank you for writing this book it literally helped me pick myself out of darkness so deep that I thought there was no way out\n\nI wanted to let you know that your work has helped save at least\nOne

think about my children all the time\nAnd\n\nYour email has reminded me\n\nThat it's not just me I haven't talked to my wife about it\n\nFor the last few months and I know how much it still bothers me\n\nHow we're responsible I had been to not realize she is probably dealing with it as well\nThere are things that we don't want to think about that are truly frightening\nAnd I think\nWhen we look at our country when we look and we really realize\n\nWhat we really stand to lose it's not our job is not our money it's the unsinkable\n\nIt's something that doesn't happen to us that happens to other countries but it doesn't happen to us\n\nAnd it's so scares us that we avoided and we talk about other things\n\nBut that's just as dangerous as the outrage and justice talks toxic\n\n\nIf you
