west titled championship round for the arc series and\nAs you heard a dolphin say I'm Tania votes are and while that Bob you understand asphalt racing and the south is just not what it used to be\nA race fans for whatever reason the disenchanted ah it's hard for drivers to find a track that even open in the state of Georgia but up north in the mid west there or the fans are packed every single weekend we got why do you think that is a Bob\nWe'll tell you one of those guys are at their roots they love the short track racing big names coming out in the mid west you were talking earlier with adult in one of the names you mentioned was time\nComparing rage to help you said call are quick today and find out how much progressive could save you but set upstairs now to the gentleman who will guide us through this afternoon broadcast Joe more just regal and NASCAR hall of famer rusty Wallace\nGuys you know uh there's not a whole lot that junior control here as you guys were talking and you you're thinking about high speed you think about the draft and try to to get hooked up with a good teammates\nAnd probably rusty Wallace the main thing is trying to avoid the big crash which you know is it never really going to happen during the running of the race it over the years drivers have tried all kinds of techniques to try to avoid the big one but none of of worked\nThey really have it in one of them they do is they go to the back of the pack thinking they're going to go back there and stay out of trouble everything's got beat by but here's one thing that we've seen happen a lot they go to the back of that ... when they get back there the draft is not near as strong\nAnd they find yourself run by yourself so many times drivers lose the draft the big pac comes running laps some so my number one progressive Keenan the race for this racist dumped me one of those guys\nThat goes to the back the pack to play it safe and you end up losing the draft that's a bad deal and you get lapped that's another bad deal number two would be be loyal to some of those good drafting partners that you're going to work with throughout the day\nBe loyal to him so he can count on those guys late in the race because if you mess with them halfway through hung them out to dry trust me they're not going to help you very in the other one pit stops going to be very very important today so when you're picking Meg tree pit with everybody else\nAnd try to pin with a crowd that's really fast a lot of cars that have been up front leading you want to hang out with that crowd because if you don't and you know maybe a lap later you might get hung out to dry all by yourself\nAnd trust me that's going to create a big problem it's so easy isn't roasting here at Talladega I Wish it was that easy it's just not you know\nUh you you and I were talking a little while ago about what is the plan to stay out of the wreck and that's the reason drivers agonized so much and they don't know how to do that they know there's gonna be a wreck and they just hope\nThat they don't being like we said earlier ... go to the backup pack that doesn't work some I Try to stay up front that doesn't work some of them everybody thinks in the middle that's a big problem it generally it is so what I'm trying to tell you there is no way to do it there's no expert at knows everything it's still a Daggett baby and that's how it happens\nNASCAR hall of famer rusty Wallace than guys here's what we got to keep in mind here it is round to raise to you've gotta survive coming out of here if you do not you face that\nDifficult challenge a candidate worthy uh about going on to Kansas in a must win situation it's going to be a good one here this afternoon\nAbsolutely Jeff directly thank you certainly don't want to dig yourself into a whole here at Talladega those are some of the key to winning today ... by progressive in and tell me what do you like there are a couple of things you can control but even if you get those things right if you follow this progressive key for the race we heard rocky talking about it's not going to guarantee success here at Talladega\nI Love it when he said don't be that guy that went on that God Knows what the differences that used to be a cut off race elimination race now at least if something goes a ride you have one more chance to try and make up\nFor I don't know that doesn't make me feel any better 'cause I thought the hybrid all again and they there is no states spot on this race track\nGo in or I coming up on NASCAR libraries day will head down to the

what\nIs going to happen and what we do know to do that we need to talk to some of the drivers after the race will named the end zone driver of the week presented by auto zone it could be Joey like auto and he's standing by with our western Kelly\nWell he won when we were here back in April we've got three wins beer Talladega so clearly knows how to get it done distorting Smith pack\nOr not as quick as we thought you guys would be qualified but from everybody we talk to in the garage area but we keep hearing is no matter where those forward start they're going to be strong do you share that optimism about your car\nWhich I had to be a you know he was trying to be companies again when you're pulling their ... like this that we've had some success that before so uh yeah were fired up about

Alex ... alongside Kevin Hart driver a beat Jimmy Johns Ford\nWho started position number three is killing with him by Kevin as you get to go today strapping yesterday was just so poor says one thing to get some get some data under your belt but how difficult is it to go out there and race around thirty nine other drivers with very little practice in that type of draft\nOn this for a long time so I'm pretty good idea of what's going to happen and the things that you need to do in\nOur cars are fast that's the main thing or Jimmy joined Ford is fast and\nHopefully we can keep our self up front and and I have a good day\nI'll difficulty to remain up front knowing that everybody else's work on the air to\nMean everybody wants to be up front and everybody's gonna raise harder to try to keep track conditions so we'll just have to see how that goes in our cars drive and go from there he's got all of these teammates running\nThat's one of the field with a with a sort of the race or Fort Stewart hostile towards in the first four spots horrific qualified or they've\nBeen very fast so far so let's keep that string going another four driver from essay jar with are the post\n... going to roll off your position number for a looks like the steward high scores are pretty good here or how how what do you feel about your particular restaurant\nI feel good I mean you guys got that a lot of things go your way here now and I feel good about it a car's been fast and [noise]\nHopefully got a good plan together so\nNow he just got to go get a good plan and executions that's where we're looking for that is ah I just don't roll or he's going to roll off from position number for once the Kelly\nA ton together we've had an amazing run 'em but you know just feels like it's time for us to to pursue different opportunities we're still here for one another to support each other and and still very very close friends um but it's it's just just kind of time where we're going to go in different directions and I'm going to be the biggest cheerleader route and him on and I know the same for me\n... years ago at some of anti ... motor sports I got a chance to peek in your office some kind of a tour and it was needed a pan there was hardly anything anywhere except there was this one trophy from back in two thousand two auto club speedway you could pile up seven championship represent ... percent you want it to why that one [noise]\nI don't know it's still there you know that that is the only trophy that I've kept a was a very meaningful moment I think in our lives\nTo to go and get that when in in ... in two thousand two was very early in her career a way I feel like the debt that is what set the course for the the dynasty that we've we had you know it was it was a pretty amazing period there was a huge growth moment\nAfter that happened and I'm Talking not just from from the team standpoint but from an emotional standpoint I'm a level of knowing that you can be successful in the sport for both of us there's there's a lot that developed right there from up a friendship a bond of a team and accomplishment that's that's a huge huge moment in our lives\nIs there any bitter sweetness to the fact that if there's an eight championship it will be with each other\nYeah I Wish that we're still in the playoffs right now and then had a chance to close you know our compete for an eight um unfortunately that's not the the situation we're in but there are six races left in uh we we want to keep our I'm\nWinning streak lives and you know we've had sixteen when seasons together it'd be amazing to have our our entire run together but the winning season so that's high a high priority for me and and I know from Chad standpoint as well it's important to him but we just we ... we ... ourselves with standard we wish one race and that's that's honestly will wrap more ready to get that done and I think\nFor the last month we've shown that we're getting off the coast on that\n... what a common misconception that you think people have about Jimmy\nI think the the the big thing that people don't understand is because he is such a nice guy that they don't understand how fierce competitor he really is a the the desire to win and go fast when races really stumps or the core what'd you me that\nHe doesn't necessarily I work for a really project um unless you really know when you're in the environment with them to to see that and I'm\nGoing to quality that's that's pretty unique as well to be able to have that desire and have that ability\nTo be able to temper ... outwardly known and seen too much\nJet can can you and and William beat Jimmy and uh and Kevin mixture\nJust got a point of this thing right so split Kevin says amazing guy Kevin is very very intelligent he's a heck of lot smarter than I Am so to be able to put Kevin with a guy like Jimmy that's going to be a force to recognize so [noise] uh\nThe goal is to go out there and compete with the twenty four and ... says the goal of those guys just to go out there and went racist and engineers deserved a voice smarter for cheaper than what he's had with me so um he's got that now with Kevin and it's it's going to be fun to watch\nKevin meandering obviously coming from J. R. and he currently who treats or town Sadler but this will be his first foray into pet theory\nOr they're trying to get a championship over there they are I Love the question you posted can know can he and well yeah and the beach\nHeaven and Jenny and I got to tell you how how they would give me this morning and before I couldn't even get the entire question I don't know about who's gonna win first yeah Chad and William or Jimmy and cat in guinea\nAny job you know you're jumping on me we're going to win Kevin ... before chatting William Penn who they're like they're going to be keeping all of your car yeah absolutely\nI loved that enemy though and again Jimmy mentioned the friendship between chat hadn't he echoed that sentiment and not that I have this morning just saying that this new separating each other is actually going to help them off track their friendship grow even stronger than Ardi at\nThe certainly going to be interesting to watch if nothing else\nThere is a full video version of it right now by the way at Emory dot com\nComing up we'll hear from what you are with our ... inside track and following will head back to the story written here for more competitors of debate field\nFor allied race day [noise]\nFrance on the\nBoom [noise]\n\nWould end up but\nThey haven't been racing and if you don't know where to look you can if at all but legend raising tonics you'll never miss another moment legend gives you live video cameras stats\nThat NASCAR and other ... theory that in and the next generation ray scanner for filtered driver and crew audio motor sports event nationwide NASCAR fans have never been closer to the action welcome to the future than experience learned more by visiting racing like ... dot com\nOr I get your phones out get your parents out your laptop whatever you got it's time for the first MR in fan vote of the day and get a good question\nTeam is one sixth of the last eight races at Talladega which team Pinsky driver has the best shot at getting when numbers that Ben is it a ... the job and like\nI Know or maybe you think it's the right way and they all have a a blue oval on there who they do and they're all really typically track research\nOr I go to him already dot com slash vote to be a part of the discussion right now from Talladega super speedway this is the motor racing network the voice of NASCAR top forty ... feet\nDan Berrett here joined me weekdays from ... pm to get caught up on the stories of the day the Dana Barrett show is live and local and right here on TALK radio six forty W.

ringing Dave Mike in Dan kind of an observation time here or in the break we used a variety of different words to describe what we've seen here for the first forty seven lapse in one of them is straight surgery or disagree Dave absolutely\nI and I would cite Italy on back home side of strange we'd seen we've seen the dark side of wild side of strange hearing downloaded over the years right now this really\nA bunch of teams are playing their cars there but that's certainly the steward obscene playing well with the top four spots will get a long way off points are right now it jumps outlook feeling my bag with a lot of guys that are\nYeah you're exactly right David and however though with the new spoiler that we have all the car you can't afford to wait too much or work yourself out of\nIran has about how you found a line you know well\nThere's not been a lot of that there's been a lot of single file raising but what's on\nIs that we had a pack of seven leading now we have a pack of for that three that are falling back or in the middle country when that big pack that third pack absolve church do bullied for already out of term for they are picking them\nAnd laying them down in a very odd beginning of this race bad how about ... well I tell you what Mike I think the reason we have the top for separating themselves from the rest of the field as they are showing a tremendous\nAmount of just\nThree and four inches if they're driving like one car Kurt Busch lead them into turned three and foreign everybody takes the exact\nSame voice their shadow when you go to various\nWhatsoever who turned three and four and they are writing unreal they are visibly quicker\nThan the rest of the field the animal\nRate discipline\nFor those guys are totally hooked up and

generally\nTighter together we were proved that many many times as the heir history are spoiled with the air goes way up in the air opens up a big hole kind of like when you're on the highway bottle no transporter and an extra car draft done\nI'm not seeing that work as well now that has in the past so I'm sure the technical guys over at NASCAR will be looking at that\nA little bit and getting ready for the next race so really no no wonder that things are a little bit different today with that you\nAre all the cars and I like I said let's talk about the fact that this was sort of the beginning of a total change and super speedway racing next year at Daytona it'll be similar to what it is now but after that restrict or plates are going away we're going to the labor in space or this might become a whole new game\nStart with the papers face or paper to force\nMe to go from one side the bigger size down to a smaller size think about your blue jeans or a little wider around the by
