not\nThe author is not even the the last word on this is the the post modernist they can take and read that tax any way they want direct\nAbsolutely yeah I mean I think that there's a slight confusion because that that probably ... to ... it out if the cultural philosophical problem but\nI ... and look for example would be a very different thing it would be something that had made clear that they could have an an ending that the one with which is just the beginning of last histories which doesn't add up that said that is a style that is oh\nOkay completely separate from ... learn they stick

no way to read you a [noise]\nKnow have been better or up a cup\nOf three or four days we've found the stock market you're right about that and and ah at so I'm like but I remain pretty bullish um look at the dollar is down down to twenty five thousand four hundred was up you know well over twelve hundred ... a week ago\nA I liked it by these steps but um you know you look at the fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation that high employment I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still I on the stock market\nEspecially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what spooked it\nWas a good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to fake it was the ... and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly more people out of stocks and bonds because one interest rates rise and\nBonds are more attractive relatively than shocks I'm usually those effects of of ah\nFat changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to show long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we dollar shave real signs of inflation although energy prices are rising but the other commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling price so I don't see a big inflation gain and I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth that says\nTo the fed and and uh John John Powell why you take it a punch bowl away from this already just when it's getting boring and I\nI tend to think that he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but\nJust that's just the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that's\nUh is through the squash shows a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation revenue believe lesion watcher guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and the tax break and we haven't seen it\nWe show me the inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but\nI did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we are international trade we have um\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and trade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I my only point is I just think the fed acted preemptively and prematurely and raising rates\nIn in a in a way that wasn't necessary I Am a little concerned by the way out of climate about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like equivalent of four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why has it gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon sooner you there yeah maybe I didn't hear what you just said okay why I'm a why did why is oil going up\n[laughter] that's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the um [noise] in the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off it was a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um [noise] you know about the price of the global\nReduction and suppliers result\n... bring Texans back a green Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nOil prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean I don't know where you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick a stick\nIn the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next year or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just fear you know that's the stock market is driven by fear and greed [laughter] that's a true except for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and and by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred\nI said to my wife funny let's let's take some of these profits and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true\nOr this is an old wives' tale but the last president that I heard really take on the fed [laughter]\nWas Ronald Reagan and the we had Nineteen percent interest rates right certainly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's it's it's a\nA you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week on why the\nPresident is the chief executive officer of the country right he is the one who was supposed to help manage our economy he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out I'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fed correct but I I think there's a lot and said look what are the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years\nThat these are not some kind of or falls on high at the fed they act as if there was a temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence but they've made so many mistakes so you mentioned I remember the seventies as you do when we had\nLiterally twenty percent mortgage interest rates that was all because of fed mistake and ah you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know was the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in\nTwo thousand seven and they all yeah I keep thinking these people are somehow like God like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nUh and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars are and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think is it Stephen [noise] that's what he really fundamentally believes that terrorists are good\n[laughter] here's my view and I've talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I Know trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of apocalyptic view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals you got to deal with Mexico he played candidate like a federal or where he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before that\nThe deal had to be seal candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and this is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with I don't know how you and I haven't talked about this one but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheated\nThey're stealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an actual property they're building up their military they're like you know the\nOld Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics they're using on so I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nUh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction uh when it comes to China let\nMe challenge beyond that whenever I uh you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way Trump looks at it and I think he's right about that it's like if we can't trade with China we sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't they get their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets\nMean damn near everything you buy and Walmart yeah I was made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that card and saying look\nWe're not gonna give you unfettered access to our markets if you're not going to\nPlay by the rules I talked to a company CEOs all the time of blend who basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market and you've got to give up ownership of your company has to give up your a trade secret ... I mean we can't live with that is right I'd write when he says look I didn't start this trade deal this trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also weren't believe they also weren't or bank at the same time I would feel better about it\nHey Stephen quickly one quick question for you you probably have a real insight on the ah the we were kind of talked about the steel tariffs in these things going on our allies\nAre ... like Canada and as a way of negotiating bring these contracts at the table for what was kind of like a ... a NAFTA two point oh type of situation\nWell that happened but the steel tariffs are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change in any point\nWell this is one of the issues that I find my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy lyric I thought so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum tariffs or auto tourists but especially not steel and aluminum 'cause you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto but\nWe've got six million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum and what they produce I was over at the end how has your Bush a couple of weeks ago they you know when they make\nA you know Budweiser is they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans and they showed their prices are going up and the judge that's going on around the country our auto producers autos are more expensive because the steel doors so my point to Trump's position even creating factory jobs were going to lose factory jobs as a result of that so\nSo far we have at least one death reported an eleven year old girl killed in southwest Georgia Seminole county\nWhen something fell in our home it's part of the state that saw the highest winds and the most rain this storm entered Georgia as a category three hurricane and they didn't drop to a category one with Ninety mile an hour winds until they got close to Albany G and it's\n\n\n\nTraffic on TALK radio six forty double duty as the ice skating at each other I dynamic like we are scams mailing lists\nSound flooding on the roadway sounds ... are going to be close to the damage from flooding and we're also looking at the incident on ice when he found around stare burn around with it down he left wing [laughter]\nBut it looks like we are just restricted to the shoulder at this point so limited getting these right there I send me by south down main street that crashes walking through ... as well we're still working on that\nI'm the Tony ... that she chats weather\nOn TALK radio six forty double duty as the\nMorning to CBS forty six meteorologists Jennifer about that as Michael continue to push further away we will see interesting whether this afternoon Neal raining which decreasing clouds and eventually to shine they will remain breezy we'll see when that's up\nTo twenty five and thirty miles an hour today as temperatures warm to the upper seventies then tonight gets chilly we pledged dropping to the upper forties and low fifties this has been CBS forty six meteorologist Jennifer ...\n... ... show Saturday's new until two on TALK radio six forty ... G S T e\nWe're more on Florida coming up in just a second can we take a look at\nA also the ah\nAh the election numbers I think it's about time we started getting a you know your analysis do 'cause I Know you love stats and there's nobody better looking at the numbers than you\nThank you the polls are hitting and they're coming in fast and Ah yes there's a lot to ah to understand about where that's going to get into that I'm sure we start there or do you go to start with the some of the hurricane stuff\nUh well I don't know if I Want to talk to somebody who cannot agree with NBC News that we are not natural disasters these are man made disasters now\nSo it wasn't manmade that we want an entire decade basically without getting one hurricane hitting me let me ask you something about that sir yes\nUh would you agree with me that over the last ten years in the last ten years mhm we have seen a dramatic increase in hurricanes here in the United states since we dropped out of the Paris accords\nYes sir no sir is a yes or no answer\n... you're saying has it gone from zero to two and the time that I mean since he's been out of that ah ... I mean the trend is not increasing that we we have one year they had more than another year is that what you're trying\nBecause I'm asking you in the last ten years have we seen a cup of these ... these so called natural disasters I Want us in the last couple of years\nThank you for your question NBC there has been an increase from all over the years ... very much [laughter] that journalism these days it is here's what the\nPCC says remember this is Al Gore's a favorite place to go for climbing permission to this is what they say about hurricanes numerous studies toward the end beyond the fifth assessment report of the Irish ... a PC I reported a\nDi di di di di\nGreasing trend in the global number of ... of tropical cyclones\nAnd or the global globally accumulated psychotic energy there's low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cyclone numbers under global warming over the past four decades there's consequently low confidence in the larger number of studies reporting increasing trends in the global number of very intense cyclists the\nView and I pay cc report the latest the latest update\nTo bring out of a boring un talk what they're saying is total number of a hurricane's going down\nAnd there is low confidence in any change in the I'm In ... like what they say it's like well because they used to say there's going to be more frequent and intense hurricanes than they realize the frequency thing wasn't happening there it's going to be more intense they don't even have evidence of that and so\nThat was me Mr ... here is this not the strongest storm\nA it on record\nThe vet is hit the Florida Panhandle that is the reporting you sir I rest now here's the summary [laughter]\nUh the PCC once again reports that there is little basis for claiming that drought floods hurricanes and tornadoes have increased much less increased due to a greenhouse gases that exactly the story you're getting on the media when they're trying to say it would have tenure so we have renewed this they've they've\nThey've up to their commitment and in response I tell them up yours\nAnd [laughter] so [laughter] ah [laughter] it is a pretty remarkable\nOkay let me let me ask you this as we get into the poll numbers\n\nI Believe there is a chance we see a red wave because of Kavanaugh than we were concerned that there would be this massive blue blue wave in both the house and the Senate I think we see a red wave not a tidal wave but a red wave\nIt's possible first of all I Would say Kavanaugh if if the last two years have been any indication Kavanaugh will be ancient history by the time this election happens it's like three weeks from now\nLike these things go away for example uh the the Access Hollywood tape happened right about this time in two thousand sixteen right about now you have to ... eighth or ninth in September eleventh that I\nUh and that by the time the election came as we saw had basically no impact on news ... I mean this stuff goes away fast and I think there will I don't think this is because because it's not just Kavanaugh if they would've yeah left\nIt alone leclaire Williams", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "11"}
