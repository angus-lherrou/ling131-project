Serious come on come on back I'm I'm really you\nYou know that I'm the most brilliant political analysts in the country now I don't I Am telling you that she wants to run again for president and\nTo you know I Know she wants to run do you really think she will\nIt depends depends a lot on Biden\nIt depends a lot on um whether she feels that the field against terror is weak which it is absolutely

could she come out with this whole thing Elizabeth Warren without having someone on record from the Cherokee Nation to support or I mean I she ...\nShe has her grandmother who once told her when she was three [laughter]\nThe jihad high cheekbones and that's because\nWay way way way back um she was a chair\nOr as a mother or\nYou know was a source of all of this but look I'm getting back to to backs a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is a ... oh yeah\nAll right John shut didn't fit in to the me too movement obviously she doesn't fit in there because she has her husband um and she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because\nShe didn't receive Scully she's you know some\nYeah she's a system\nA Paul would they call and New York she's a Paul so but she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game and I talked to Bill Kling about twenty minutes\nOr I mentioned to you last time I was on um she and her husband say you know why they may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than ... is up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg\nIs going to run for president of the

... and it's the it's the reverse\nYou know ... but they're they don't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like them I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPersian near the you know I'm not sure you need the uh the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock\nSay you know if I'm going to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself my not sure that matters really doesn't matter anymore\nYou know smash that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\nAwful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right\nYou might you know this is in her time the next time around I just want to go up against Trump or certainly doesn't want to do that but to twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it\nI think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk to about ... and what is going on

down in Alabama\nBill the frustration is growing in America the press is excusing or antifa the our excusing everything the Democrats are saying uh than another Democrat up in ah Minnesota came out over the weekend and\nSaid it's time to bring the gear teams out for the Republicans I'm I mean it's it's it's remarkable what is being said and dismissed when there is the actual violence\nOn the street you um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\nWell you do a peacefully number one and I think it's a\nNice area it's a people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we'd go out and and stand in the park which some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper\nOr with five hundred signatures are attached to it so the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have um some space for not bad we have a community group and it's just the way we feel about it the right things you can do to be visible when your local community it doesn't have to be a big national\nIn 'cause that's homeless some possible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the s._s. was really essentially about and and a lot of people still want to look away at it they they don't want to engage\nAnd um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive\nThe most and our ... elements in our society the pressure sympathizes with all of them\nThey sympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes and there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive causes\nSo ... that's a big difference we didn't have that what was that a left wing press we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's why we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um\n... uh I beg to differ with you on the and the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties those some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say as a you know some group we're standing in the community uh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever right\nUm and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nA that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties the press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody\nElse will take a cell phone video and throw it out which is what happened is that an over the weekend is that and you know he grew up\nDoing that would have to hire security they'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes it\nTakes leadership it takes organization but but on the first thing you look what's what's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press is\nActively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes solidly still try to do with Trump into basically dismissing Saudi Arabia All right well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad\nOkay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran and the middle east which the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading the charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen any history we outlawed ourself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're in Haiti it because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nYou can do something else information technology I\nKnow what you're thinking but I'm not a math and science person no problem no excuses it's not rocket science it's my computer career

I think actually we\nShould start a team of some sort and we should come up with a Native American name\nOurselves really yeah yeah I'm a you know people seem to be going the other way but they're all yeah and I do think it's about\nTime that we go the other way [laughter] I think it's about the I had enough of it so you know\nYou have a if you have a name a for something you know that we started baseball team or you know something you know and just\nInside the blaze with that'd be cool you can send us the the team naming the mascot and we'll get together and have a mowing about it and see what we can do\nWhy why were all these people executed in\nThese people were executed because they were leaving the caliphate these were people who had been wet and do are\nMore than likely the full three years of the ISIS occupation and ... and they were done they wanted to leave they wanted to get out of there because as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS you know supplies and food and water are becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so\nLiving behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolutely health of these people so they tried to break free and run away and so when\nThese people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacre I think that day there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by the ISIS\nHounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true [noise]\nWe we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there um and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground\nYou know and and it's it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in ... a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens\nAnd things like that ... and the reason for that is good they they have no choice but to fight and die they can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because they you know they looked like me are white guys read beard and ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so yeah so\nYou went from that um to say and I I've got to do\nI got to keep doing this ... um and that brought you to\nBurma mhm right yes and now you're working with an as Rene fun yes in Burma yes and last week talk you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update for us\nYes absolutely so ah also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from than as her infant or getting out of the ... you were telling me that you were trying to organize shows people yes and you were going to bring them all together slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago\nAnd met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border\nThey they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to have been as or infants help okay now this is a group of Christians\nYes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist okay on all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe 'em and they are all all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's a really really good thing um [noise] and\nSo I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their eyes are done several trips with the ... find in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to have us because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then to the brim are removed all of those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive so why\nWhy are they doing this why are they doing this\nThese tribes [noise] it's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic burns who control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lands they want to control the entire\nRegion and so if you're a different ethnicity you can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject\nA surf class you have to basically serve the ... and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just as a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because where there's ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacked them even more tell me what you wrote me so I brought ths abroad with me several photos\nHave somebody I'm over his mercy pass their apologize and they were getting so I brought with me [noise] several photos of of what I see all the time when I go to these places [noise] [noise] and these are ... I bought my brother\nAnd these photos [noise] sorry [noise] of of one particular um attack that happened\nUm this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you handy photos of what's happening and what's going on and in these photos you see dead civilians you see\nKids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage these or intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's that's a baby that's a baby\nIntentionally killed and the baby didn't die right away I'd survived for about twenty four hours and then died\nAnd this just looks like it's in the woods\nYeah they're out in the jungle these people have nothing and where I'm army still wants to attack them and take more from them\nSo every time I go there every time the ... shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and I can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the artist for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we save a lot of people's lives and a villager who had been pushed out of his home by the army him and his family had fled the army and they and they had built they built a a a new hot out in the ... out in the jungle in the middle of nowhere\nUm he he heard that than as rain fun was there and he came and found me and said hey I Want to I Want to I Want to thank you please come to my house for dinner tonight so they gave me on a motorcycle and I drive at this man's house in the middle of nowhere\nWhen I get in there his wife is cooking pigs that for me to eat because that's the big fat and rice and ... and ... leaves and so we're sitting there and he's like hey I I when I was like I Wish I had more to give you a he's like this is all I have for a snack and he pulls out a bag and it's literally tree bark it's bark from a tree\nAnd he's like this is all we have to snack on while my wife prepares food and he gave me\nTree bark to eat and I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this guy and he has nothing has literally nothing and she wanted to give me ...\nBecause that was the best that he had and so I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this man and\nI I was I was so overcome was just like I\n... his gratitude at the level of gratitude he showed for us for that for the mouser infant being there it was it was unbelievable it was so touching and then later on as I was leaving as I was leaving the jungle another man barely speak any English\nUm he's um I'm On a motorcycle and he's driving me out of the jungle and he ... he as he's driving he turns me he says thank you and I said oh like oh good English uh what I'm trying to paint him and talk more about um\nUm I'm about what it used more English and so I was like oh like what what do you what are you grateful for what you know yeah and he's like is that this is amazing he said thank you for giving my people hope [laughter]\nWhat he says to me this kid who's maybe Nineteen years old they know nothing but slaughter an aspirin these in these terrible things but\nWe're there to bring help and we're there to bring help and it's it's an honor to be there it's an honor to represent the ... it's an honor to do what I Do every time we go out we save people's lives and it's\nIt's it's an incredible thing that we keep things like like those photos that you're looking at you can't even show them we keep that we're actually happening\nBorn on\n\nIt doesn't become real to people until they see it and then you don't want to show it\n'cause it's it's awful it's awful it's horrifying mhm um\nI don't know what to do with them ah I think I think I'm not sure but I think we have them on the ... dot org if people want to go over there and see first\nHand like what's happening I I Believe they're up there if they're

I\nTend to think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean nine or ten is definitely possible um interesting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for ah governor here in Texas\nIs winning by a much larger margin a usually is there I don't have the one in right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know there's so much he's up uh Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were Abbott is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the\nResults of the same poll is\nIt the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um\n... you think of it break bread country right in Texas ... however are the poll shows the fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance and only forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters where it's a forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas\nIt this way try this on for size\nA a Donald Trump is everywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right and it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life um\nAnd Donald Trump has a really good side and a free leap pad inside and it depends on what day you're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh can we not talk about today and I don't want to talk about the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "17"}
