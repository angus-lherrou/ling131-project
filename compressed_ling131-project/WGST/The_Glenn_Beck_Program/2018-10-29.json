a difficult time I mean I just\nDid you guys watching the news all this week you know as little as possible I write a little bit because of the shooting because I get the updates but yeah yeah so only to get the updates on stuff I I don't know who's watching cable news anymore\nYeah I I never watch cable news never mind the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox News or CNN heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN jet why don't you don't want to lose\nI don't know who's doing that and they do I really don't know who's I think you're on fans was Fox you know

all\nThe people who hate Trump ... yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly out\nIf I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would listen to him talk about early do down the synagogue thing is he's oh literally it's quite ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's ... Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of very slowly but surely but he's like you know did he he didn't go there to help with today is the first question was ah you know but what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country\nAs a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life\nHe yeah he he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah [noise] this is a terrible tragedy\nThey're like well ... ... what part of a bet you think is is the the climate of today change and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this shooter\nA outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah we do not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or as I knew that don't tie him to be a ... more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment but again has nothing to do with this and all\nThese cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us we don't blame it on a dull Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight now is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever that guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot all of the geo ... and another guy and tried to tried to bring to kill thirty Republican seat\nThat's tenth of the Republican and was working for Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault\nNo we never said that and neither did I say ... today yes of course not but they didn't even talk about it because they had a very balanced view of that one for a understood that individuals who are responsible\nFor their own actions that time that's right he understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes\nWe can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the python think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt 'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie\nSanders situation but both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individuals shootings\nAnd I'm going to do with it and you do not ... discourse does not commit murder\nDoesn't happen so the reason why Rob ... pad in this morning is because uh you know he he's he's doing more on trivia\nUh and pour a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a bat\nHorrible practical half\nAnd ... for up to the rafters because that is something that we have a feeling for a very very long time and for someone in your position to actually said out loud and don't you dare apologize for that\nSo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know that when I'm never going to bend on that one\nAnd in fact repeated it consistently gets repeat it and it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nThank you thank you so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's on day coming\nNo we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really because I Do to get free tickets but seriously low now all of a sudden you're in the navy can change that I ... you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my ... that that would I change my plans okay All right I'm doing All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you or what is the Sunday\nUh lately I think it Sunday yeah or it's going back to ... tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ... it's going to be fun there's a lot of election stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff you were given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the nation's turned completely insane so it makes the comedy\nFairly easy answer does ...\nAnd up Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and and comedy but uh also uh I Am taking all of the\nProceeds from the I'm from the event and um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to the uh the refugee um oh yeah a group I'm not sure we are going to give 'em to yet but we're we're\nUh we're we're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um\nTo a a local Jewish um\nCenter perhaps the the synagogue launcher an odd stance from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I notice you went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros judo\nOr and I remember and you came back after this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know and then she posted here's an example of ... supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros\nOr as as an example of how much you hate the Jews now I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard a that was shot by somebody national award what are the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh\nIt was just it was just presented by the the prime minister of Israel though\nWell that would that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of bed not a big one so\nIt's just amazing you know 'cause this is not just a criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporter it's all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite it's completely insane if you are a ... a conservative\nAnd I the the people in this audience I Would sleep all would fall into this category many of them would criticize drug stores but they criticize him because he's a liberal has progressed its policies he supports a policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him every around to him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he is a very shady history\nOr around the world that but anti Semite patriarch source to weigh in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew or the way they don't like\nBeen Shapiro because you have written winning Shapiro party the policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew no because\nHe came up with the idea of communism\nI'm not a bad no not a fan of fat and the ...\nLike you're in these liberals have never criticized Ben Shapiro before is that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like what Ben Shapiro said they will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal and they don't like him because he's conservative is this distinction difficult for people\nCan you really not understand I mean we all know lays hand on the night it's not all under\nState it they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives are anti Semite\nWe you you're telling me you with a you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who is one of the biggest part of the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\nWhat it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas or they rape\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas is legal opinion because they don't support what they believe it's not about it it is if you try to make these into cartoon arguments which is such a\nA ... a cat is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive founder in America\nYou're calling everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they\nSay it anyway 'cause they don't care\nAbout it that that is exactly what the big big claim to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear solution there too [noise]\nYeah ... I don't know what I have a good point and ah we're we're going to talk about one when we come back and\nSo let me talk to you a little bit about um [noise] buying or selling a home if you are if you're buying a home right now or you're thinking about it do it now get the low interest rate right now if you have to refinance your loan\nDo it right now do it now I'm\nHome equity is at an all time high homeowners are starting to cash in and pay off high interest or that there is there is a way for you to do this with people who are are working for you they're not working for the bank so if you want to consolidate you\nOh we didn't want to get rid of the character\nSo now they're complaining about the fact that their little movie got a a ... this this character removed from the show now they're complaining about it we just wanted him to be I mean basically what they're saying is no we don't want you to get rid of and we just wanted to write everything that he says\nWell I mean that's not something The Simpsons signed on for yeah sorry\nTwice label raise and this is a great lesson for everyone who tries to please save Megan Kelly I think the same type of thing right you can't you can't no matter what you say they're never going to be pleased the people who come after you for these in these nonsensical PC issues\nWill never be pleased no matter what you give them no matter what apologies say no matter how sincere it is no matter ... they're not asking you to remove up who they're not asking you to change they're asking for something that you can't possibly give them any earlier you realize that the better\n[noise]\nLet me change the subject to enough is enough when America will enough be enough\n\nNew polls Americans fed up crave unity admitted violence now\nThis one should terrify you\nBecause fifty seven percent now say they want a third\nParty they want unity that number is even higher but I'm not sure people actually mean\nThis I'm not sure what unity even means they say that we no longer really uh agree on the core values of our country which\nI think is actually true we don't agree on core values\nBut what are those core values\nAnybody know what are the values\nThat brought up what are the things that were actually arguing about now\nWay things are going in the United states twenty five percent are satisfied fifty eight percent dissatisfied the state of politics nine percent satisfied Seventy seven percent dissatisfied\nThirteen percent are like a ...\nPercentage that say Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen Percent\nFifteen Percent of us they were United on the most important values my question is\nWhat are those values sincerely what are we fighting for\nOur we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's the surveys uh shows where we divide on our quote the most important values politics in this country\nIt's politics of value um moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value\nRace relations gap between rich and poor the state of the news media the way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state\nRights for algae beat the status of religion homeland security\n\nWith an exception of a couple I those aren't values\nThose are issues that is a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing\nSee I I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted to outrage we have a few things we have\nTo decide we have to decide one so western world war it's saving\nIs freedom as our founders saw it is it worth saving yes or no and I don't want you just to you know jump off and yeah absolutely why why why is it worth saving who can articulate this\nWhy is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics\nWho can make that case among us who's making that case to their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place we have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half\nThe country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place which are we sincerely which are we we have to choose deli because it's a binary choice is in it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one\nNo no you don't it's not a binary choice the answers were both we're both\nWe been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell was paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions what\nAre we going to do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone actually make the case for America and not\nJust in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\n\nWhy is the constitution\nWere fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it man\nLet's just move on\n\nI'm I we cannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our basic essential values in line\nLike climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth\nOkay that's a value that's not climate change\nClimate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem\nIs there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the ice age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nThe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion in ... in the scientific field\nYou gave me clean cut studies okay\n\nBut that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it\nSee they keep making a about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nWell the solutions are insane the solutions don't work\nThat is a political discussion that is a political discussion you know where our values coming in on that particular discussion when someone says the sciences settled a shot up that's a violation of our values\nWhen people sit down at the table and say look I care about the environment I really do I disagree with the science and here the people on my side that are showing you that this is co workers in this this collusion\nAnd that your your system that you're you're you're you're you're touting is nothing more than a political system and it doesn't\nWork\nThat's a political discussion those are the things we should have what brings us together at the end\nOr the values\nWe both care about the earth who doesn't care about the earth sincerely who doesn't care about the earth and I'm tired of being lectured by people who will go and protest and leave us see of garbage buying them for others to keep and clean up\nI'm sick of it\nDon't tell me you care about the environment and then after a protest everything is not about litter\nYou either care about it or you don't words don't mean anything anymore only actions do\nIn China so wait a minute hold on just a second so are we supposed to get involved in everything or are we not supposed to be involved and everything when we get involved you blame us for getting involved in saying we're trying to jam our stuff down everybody's throat\nWhen we don't show up you blame us for not showing up either way according to you we violated called our values\nWhat our values\nWell our values used to be we our enemy of no one friend all now that gets a little\nDicey gets really dicey didn't get dicey apparently when the Japanese invaded China yeah\nThat's because they only care about Europe no actually no we couldn't fight on all of a from we had to choose we didn't even want to go save up America didn't even want to go into war\nWell could you oh my gosh how could you ... your oh wait a minute\nWe're supposed to go save the white patriarchy where ... wait a minute were to blame for all of that because we didn't go in and save the white hierarchy I thought you just said that was bad should be destroyed or\nIs America bad or good let's have that discussion I\nMy math cook with the Georgia and

the state for Maria starring Sean Mendez\nWe see\n\nA drier and these are on sale to everyone right now [laughter]\nGet yours and be more to the land the jingle twenty eight presented by capital one\nOf who voted in the two thousand fourteen midterms have already voted already down or so you know this is going on constantly now in the last couple of weeks these elections is totally different way of thinking about this\nAnd of course you know these campaigns like it because it gives them a chance because I'm so many chances to get people to go and get people to to the polls and force them to go early to get all the activists out then they could have them go and you know bill passed out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck they're right there there are ... are doing on that particular day\nBut there's one interesting way of looking at this we talked to a lot about\nA district that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then changed to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that if people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton\nAnd there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if it's Thirteen district that voted for Mitt Romney in two thousand twelve and then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand sixteen so two thousand twelve on average squirting FiveThirtyEight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nAnd she doesn't sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats\nSo what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling\nAs of right now are we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states so if you look at it kind of took to summarize those kind of lost three points are well well the\nThree point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate into two dozen sixteen but a big big move from two thousand twelve done it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correct team\nNow they were Twenty one district that voted for Barack Obama and then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one\nSo in two thousand twelve with Iraq Obama they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama\nOr in two thousand sixteen that swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs it you would think of these real swing districts so far polling you're showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points but it's big it's a big change to it and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting rung around ... time so\nIf you look at that the people who were voted for a bomb and then switch to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Brock Obama with Romney\nOr the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton\nThey're in between those two positions but leaning towards Clinton\nThat's where these districts show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive states or Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for a bronco Obama been changed to Trump in the Obama election that had about five point advantage for Obama and those states in the Trump election there is about to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing eight twelve point advantage for Democrats show now that part of that it's\nIt's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time we're this is some of these races are just there's popular Democrats already Pennsylvania is a good example of that where they have a just a big lead or not because I don't think it's necessarily solely because of some switch like just\nHave to tell me what all this means from last week or the Democrats making is is the momentum start just starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say it doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is\nThere was an I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers are showing that I mean it right now ... like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid in the Senate right now when will we see\nAny movement at all uh due to the shooting in the bombing\nHi Matt cook with the Georgia news network nerves have been a bit on it since the discovery\nOf those mailed a package bombs last week it might have been in the
