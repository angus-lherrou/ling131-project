so this week I've been doing a lot of promotion for killing the size which came out on Tuesday\nAnd in that promotion I'm basically saying that\nWe in America are seeing a rise of hate and evil\nAnd I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that are tied it in\nWas that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees and they said that they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the ...\nAnd and camera right behind a woman's screaming at him because she was a victim of something and he was an idiot for not the siding with her who's the woman the woman is an activist and a Soros packed making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year [noise] All right so I tell that story which is a fairly accurate a hundred percent correct and media matters\nWithin a half an hour says I compared the woman to the third Reich\n[laughter] okay\nNow that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never\nHaving pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened to Kanye West my favorite guy

anybody if they don't know who you are explain who you are\nI I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio\nA wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist [laughter] are you living in the past when he said the second best why here's we did have had it he's number one and in space by our space butter space by your number\nTo help move in that I can understand why this is why he is a genius [laughter] do\nYou know I we actually talked about the things we're trying to conserve a the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them because we think that one of the big problems in our country there's this idea that we're really divided in where\nArguing all the time has run that argument at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the ... factory uh of of ... the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convinced for right about absolutely everything over lobbing verbal bombs that our neighbor over there and we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nOr you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend and I am perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them by myself I got a doctor or a diver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had Dave Ruben who else a student here recently Michael reckon walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything [laughter] but\nI'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody\nWho is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress\nAreas and you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and enemy\nAnd a liberal and a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees with you maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and the arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nIn any me if somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you a little league game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between that liberal and the left is that you know a liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nThis is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God's says or immoral and dumb than us Eric Harris and likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it's it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore and the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are though outside of the side of the media Rena I agree that there are\nYou know I see people people think that I Want to have conversations with you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no Nancy Pelosi I Can't talk ... she has no interest into she has no interest he wants to end you want to share country with a ... it's the best thing is\nIs that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win ... so they'll do anything to win and some of them will do so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped\nUm and that's a dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot I talk about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen share pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy to\nEnroll the way it happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex ... cheating wannabe kid of the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people that they can't do for themselves you know and and and ... and has a different view of politics than me and for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more and conservative media we disagreed with and bring it up when we got together as a family has gotten away with everything funny things happened the last few years though guys she's bringing it up now to me\nAnd she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news at all and I ... I Can't I Can't ...\nDo you watch them never was it was up when I'm On the air down there for us to India and unless that status and hang on just a second I Want the audience to know that's unheard of in our business ... that you could not have done this job agree without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go violence ... feet long form it's just toxic ingestion in the ... yeah and my mom watches a lot more of that she actually likes your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant but one of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election\nAnd she brought it up she started bringing politics that to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watched the things he says and he does that he's actually a communist [laughter]\nLet me away while I'm and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is fine Weiss Obamacare\nThinks that Medicare for all his okay we need to be provided things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail and she's not fine if we we get five hundred million dollars a year have your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not find with\n... so I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems um of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care K we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side they're not for communism they're\nNot for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help and so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like we're not communists right\nAnd so we have we have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nAnd made them feel like we're calling them communists\nThey don't feel like they're communist and they're not communist but it is provide that cover has provided cover if you will for the actual Marxist communists that are that are trying to say and capitalism\nWe when you look at you know for the last twenty five years I've been involved in full time a political advocacy either as a host or an activist or I worked on numerous campaigns are run the gamut I've done everything in our movement other than run for office basically myself\nAnd I'm ... when you look at the for the last for all the course of our careers that GOP consultancy industry has has designed a strategy to chase a voter that does not exist\nAnd this is filtered down and do the talking points we in conservative media get from these people\nAnd that is that the average GOP consultant believes America wants on wants limited government like the Koch brothers and Saddam and Gomorrah at the same time it actually totally in reverse the majority of it and and you know it's fascinating is Putin a huge study on this\nBreaking it down into twenty sixteen electorate at the libertarian myth of the libertarian voter rounds how they define them that that voter largely does not exist as a unicorn okay the reality is and I've seen this on every GOP campaign for every candidate from state house to president I've ever worked on\nThe amount of pushback we get on our social beliefs compared to your the party of big business who wants to leave me off and doesn't care about me guys tend to one at minimum it's not even close and and the reality is most voters are in favor of bigger government\nWith better moral values and this is the secret sauce that Trump tapped into in the last election the irony is that the ultimate heat nist\nI met cook

Osman\nOdds are you'll like what we're talk radio six forty WG as the Atlantis compelling talk\nGlad that probably\nTalked about this a little bit on the news and why it matters last night uh\nAnd I and I asked the group it\nWas a turning point for the Democratic party the leadership\nI think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they denied God three times in their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm\nAnd you are you are seeing\nA in the near seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of ... people don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but\nThere we are repeating Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\nProgressive as him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because\nIt is it it looked at the clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them at the table at the moment is\nOr a Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you're right but I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative ... and so there's a lot of a discerning people and our hope is that had decided they don't want to be the next Ralph Reed clown show on cable news basically they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nBut and it's because they don't understand that progressive ism isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I say this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on ... you know great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is of this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth dosing Darwinism it has its own in ... where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts and said when the government removes the God the government will become the God\nAnd that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from leftist when you trigger them on their on their state isn't it the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk down the walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan a quote unquote moderate Arab nation\nWalk down the streets of Amman, Jordan where they're queen as a Seventy five on a scale of one to ten and became seems to be a modern her mind in his right walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan and say this okay say I'm Christians and Muslims worship the same God makes year where in ... and find out first that they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan has your life will be in danger\nAnd that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor\nYou're you're attacking their idol this is not near political disagreement this isn't even just fundamental existential philosophical disagreement vicious religious fervor you're dealing with the elusive sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that a dissertation dialing the understood about ten\nPercent [laughter] they couldn't short were they so they can translate that into human language\n[laughter] uh I I I think we see that with\nGlobal warming with a with their reaction to abortion within his Robie weighed thing that means absolutely everything they worship at the altar of these things [laughter] it it really is a religious fervor\nYou know that you see with them and and this is kind of the the point of the ... ... ... is\nThis is ... this is his\nYeah they if they don't necessarily know they don't do it but that doesn't change the fact that what they're doing it was the worship of the environment and the sacrifice of your children he wanted your children to be sacrificed on an idle\nYou would have permits Q A sex at a celebration of bail you could do anything in the woods and the groves in the groves and then when you got pregnant he would call you back and they would slaughter the newborn baby right I I mean it is exactly the worship of bail\nThere's nothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period whom himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one\nWhere he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff it would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing
