going to sit and let people destroy destroy the great city that you have\nYou have all of us are honest and we really look at our situation we all know we all see the same symptoms we all know that we as a nation or sick were really really sick\nAnd we have we have each of us have doctors and their each prescribing the opposite medicine and each of us as patients are also desperate to cure or what is killing us killing our society\nThat we will follow these doctors directions because they know better they know better they know more than we do that they've got the answer and we become more and more vested in their cure as our friends and family say that's not the cure\nBecause we're taking this medicine and we believe we just become more vested in our doctor are doctors write yours is wrong\n\nWith the same time the doctor is not going to get more humble because the doctor will know he or she has everything to lose if his or her patients begin to seek another opinion another diagnosis another remedy it's in their best interest to keep patients busy looking at the other side\nSo they're not questioning what he's doing\n\nAnd well we're all fighting over the cure none of us even if stop to ask if the diagnosis is even correct were just too busy fighting what our doctor said\n\nNo I don't know about you but I Know you know we're sick I Know you know this society is sick\nWe are sick and we are in pain and and when I Am sick or in pain I'm usually at my worst inner personally I usually am not good at making friends at that point and I don't think you are either we snap at each other\nWe act as our lesser selves because when I'm sick I'm I hurt and I am full of despair or I'm fearful or I just don't have the patience\nAnd every time I'm really sick or in real pain it usually is followed by a time where I have to begin conversations with I'm really so sorry I I was just in really bad pain or I was really sick I was having a really bad day\nAnd I know I'm not alone\nAnd judging by our society today we're having a really very bad most difficult day every day it seems and it gets worse every day\n\nI Want to those doctors to know I Want those\nI don't want those to know that actually do just want to watch the world to burn I Want you to know that it's true we know there are dangers in difficulties crisis that lie ahead of us\nBut don't just assume that we're just going to lie down and watch our country burned down it's not\nIn fact many if not most of us who voted for Democrats and those who voted for Republicans\nHave a ton in common and a ton in common with those who voted for neither\nWhile the parties and the politicians tried to convince as otherwise and many of us may have believed for a while or even engaged in this warfare it's

Eighteen\nUm and every single dime a goes to the hurricane relief so please we desperately need your help a it is is a bad one so very very bad one\nYeah actually you know a little over a year ago at a year and a half ago I heard you on on your program reading out from the paper I wrote previously with Peter ... the ... as a social construct\nAnd I ended up going to one of these\nHey hey uh to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was and we learned or was it was really fun I like that you know a fun right hum that innocence\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight [laughter] that [laughter] um but yeah so we\nLearned our lesson we we took the criticisms we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense\nA secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge like a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people continue to address that uh secondly we decided that\nUm we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it we'd go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise] that would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong\nBut it's it's not what happened um and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been a recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took\nMay be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same time you talk to hell and the other day yeah\nAh so this was in in in the men's amount of work it required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard and we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work there was an insane amount of work\nAnd these are all fields we have no expertise and note that Helen has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily\nHaving to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers in striking us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines I mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I ... is a\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars imbedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure um our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spanned Fifteen some disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven\nAnd\nSo we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more had we not been a short\nSo there's you at the un who you at twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end we not gotten cold\nOkay so when we come back we'll we'll go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so uh I mean as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and unable where they got a little gold star for [noise]\nAlright are a sponsor this half hour\nZipper critter zipper critter is just as great company of ah of dreamers indoors\nYou know when they first started they were a this company that uh you would send in you know what you were looking for you would\nYou would write your job and then they would go around and they would posted on all the job sites well since that time they have now become the leading job site or and so they they they have just as pool that you ... their poll polling from that is remarkable they also\nPut it on all of the other job sites\nAre but super critter has gone a step further they have just a floor full of um of I'm\nA software I'm a experts and and scientists that are working on

pain relief product not until now\nNot until relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain quite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to\nAging exercise and everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks or playing golf or tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick started from relief factor maybe all you need\nTo lower or even eliminate these pain\nWhole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start now

dollars for you to be on every issue we now see the nine thousand dollars off the end of the model year means the guns are huge sip on again\nBecause these are these are moving van millionaire where were these costs less Parkland highly Ninety to mind is the really got\nLike the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport bodybuilding as a category in which is display all ethically fat as just considered another issue or that equal with muscle\nAnd to say that that's not true is to be mean that it will phobic as they call it [laughter]\nAnd if that was accepted\nYeah that was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting except that um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar let us use his identity who wrote that reclaimed wrote a paper and you actually is a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just in the picture in my mind this guy being the author of this paper for fat body building was just kind of a Larry\n[laughter] because then I think to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking what would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean this kind of a tricky point I don't want to get too far into the to the we use here but honestly scholarship stand or fall on\nMerit on it and so a lot of people are making that point and we deliberately chose the name of that would be hard to find in a Google Search in a district which I was very common names on purpose I actually used a or a roll dice the kicker for off of a list of\nThe most common names for certain years and the way they were to land in with lots of people\nTo hang on I got to take another break and we'll come back in and finish or why ... why you thought that was important and go through some

follow him mad consensual or conceptual James a on a on Twitter he is one of the ... if not the mastermind behind\nA the a papers are of record that were were being written a four four feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals er and er and critique but\nI'm not really critique in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are\nGoing in through the back door which is then that's something we're going to discuss here it's really great rubbing one out of the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation are then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive\nStack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it does not get accepted the\nJournal was inviting us to re submitted and [noise] um\nDavid another go they just say this is just an artifact says it's a solid as say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nOnce that are determined how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means they\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chained to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the re privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers than either the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being comforted and so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what already exist in a great deal of the a feminist Senate race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrifying this was not accepted because he didn't he wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly papers they claimed for example that we grew on too many concepts and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on but um but the idea that that giving\nStudents experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to reach ... over him interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\n\nWhat if this were published and that we're real if this were published what what would that\nMean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo there are all events is a really complicated I'm there would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some sums are educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics courses I get the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general and stuff who would take up some degree of these suggestions as\nThis had to be one of those things that you entered into and hope that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad and my right\nThere are things that that is exactly right so especially with the ... paper I think the one that got accepted\nThe idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine off of course do I mean as you are one to one day a but the ... the the politics of grievance through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that if I can\nBecause all it takes a grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate we called the stuffed grievance studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to get in touch with you but you're real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole May of ... about how\nThings were going for you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge that was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left were left liberals I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right\nThat's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that you\nKnow we're left wing people who want the left\nTo come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all star I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially um\nWe're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to production politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this ... stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media here as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\nReally remember you know you are an American I'm an American your person I'm a person\nWe have ... most of the things that we think\nIncome and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversation we want to move society and a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working at the details and I really hope that you know that our project kinda reaches reaches that point does that make sense\nIt totally does I I I Am I I hate to say that too I'm Out of time it could I invite you to come down and uh and do a pod cast with me you know when you spend an hour and a half

control of the house\nKind of mean\nI mean look at the X. dream policies that the left is looking to push in through the Democratic party\nSingle payer sorry single payer health care free health care free college I'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger\nA infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way it will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's gonna be a lot more than I think uh but\nMean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and it does endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there are many of them were cosponsors of the bill uh it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are\n... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible yeah we were scare\nMongers in races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stories will go through this tomorrow but it's just I just\nWant to throw these at ya I'm Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\nHey no that is a fundamental um a a a a fundamental aspect of what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state's said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything\n... what do we have it can't be that way so we had the electoral college\nWe are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose taxes and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter\nIt will be those three states you\nLock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore that's pretty frightening pretty frightening so now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make\nAll of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right\nIt might have to do is just just appeal to the big cities\nAnd by the way this is a this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and I know Trump sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but uh there is a there is some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities\nAnd as you know it'd be which it wants that like as a Republican or certainly don't understand why you'd want it but it ... again like it shouldn't be that way\nRight that cities should run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb do farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has\nTo do and how to live they don't understand it taking any of my former friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them but I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nRight and its ally the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the hit it right\nYou know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could a race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate the way they got elected yeah it it used to be\nThat the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly\nSo things could be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next ... the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was slower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq during I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was Senator Barack Obama was center I shouldn't care about\nThat because they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power\nOf their state then it goes to the president and the president\nOnly supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas like no that's the opposite it's the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\n[laughter] are you arguing for king right with these the several stories in a row the mic give you the argument for it came right I mean okay really\nThey've failed or have we not been using them properly you know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife and saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber\nAnd this Swiss army knife has failed [laughter] uh no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for\nAnd I would also argue the failure park right you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland but Portland but that's how I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ... last week\nThe Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nUsing ...\nCan anybody just get up and start directing traffic in Portland and then just can I just\nGo on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared\n[laughter] I mean especially if it was a union job would be you'd be in the bottom of the river\n[laughter] ... what what laws\nDo you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not garnered year young women they break his window and chased him\nDown police nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob and yes and I did use the word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they had a a a law and order march and anti fall showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law the browns shirt stuff\nStarted beating kicking\nBurning flags whatever\nThat's pretty scary and and the mayor ... release a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I I don't\nMy computer career dot edu that's my computer career dot edu\nHi Michele I'm often hear one of the biggest outrageous I recorded on when the trial of abortion doctor Kermit got now\nHow's the woman goes into a clinic comes out down there is no police report\nI helped expose crimes the mainstream media
