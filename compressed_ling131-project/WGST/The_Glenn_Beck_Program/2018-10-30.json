while carrying another country's flag\nWhat what what do you call that\n\n[noise] you know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming the reason why you have to stop it is because if you don't stop this one there will be an invasion because America can control our own borders\nNearly eight thousand troops to match what four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand so any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is\nAnd I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no but what does America say\nIt is classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before but I said I Want to be fair here unexpected in a\nRegular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing that men and women and green

they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got two thousand people here and you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're

that are qualified\nCome in through the front\nDoor and stops all of the side windows and the back door and trees\nThe country needs either serious policy on the border that will stop this or you need to build the damn wall\nBecause quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution\nBut I'm Sorry CNN I don't know what\nYou want to call it I mean after all you don't like to call you don't like to call and to fall when they're throwing Molotov cocktails you don't even like to call them a mob\nGlenn Beck program direction by numbers\nLet's take a look at election by a numbers hello do tell me what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get policy with a chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category I'm pulling spend close and now we start to\nTry and move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are down to only three tossup races or we have moved uh Missouri and Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident of Indiana\nThe polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican that the lives there was a Ted Cruz is still a lean Republican state\nA ... and a a Mississippi and North Dakota we're going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure toss ups Phil and we couldn't really move them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved to Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points place falling has a lot closer a really a toss up race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tossup category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean democratic\nState uh again this is a tough race 'cause you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen a movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one is a lean democratic state um we've moved from Minnesota as well\nFrom safe Democrat to leaning Democrat\nPolling there [noise] yeah I still think that's going to the Democrats but it the polling is closer then I think most people expect there's two reasons in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well or was a tough race for most of the time it looks like tester has not enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point uh and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin leaning Democrat as well so if you if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three forty five for Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat as a starting to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida was discouraging I think for Republicans in the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we've seen no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big culprit pick up again this is a state that voted for Trump by thirty points\nAnd Joe Manchin I think he you know I think he's solidified his seat there with his pro cabin on flow yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's that the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slight leaders were moving these days I Would normally keep those in the ... category but for a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now yeah I mean people are voting all across the country right now uh it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break and come back and give us some of those results on the

I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just\nBecause I constitutionally I think you know the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included\nAnd it will be entirely there is yeah I think it would be interesting to see like how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts\nSo he needs to the judges he's put in would now rule on this than with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not it was going to\nBe fascinating yeah that does happen imagine Chuck\nSchumer and uh and Nancy Pelosi writing up that brief as a friend of the court come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh we we really believe this that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh really\nI mean you can usually come with the Pittsburgh shooter and say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it that just goes\nOh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership trying to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play we play just a couple

you have to destroy her and\nSo they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized\nThat the social justice warriors were against it they did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy\nDo you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a

of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not\nUm being used in a way that it was a God given birth to a ... and I think that that is is one of

Smith are saying there's nothing to worry about this isn't an invasion\nWhat what are your thoughts on the caravan [laughter]\nYou know I think that it is something that [noise] for whatever reason the last ten years the left is completely changed their tune on\nUm in regards to our borders are open borders I I feel like it is\nA we actually do an episode a that's coming up that looks at this kind of story of you know is there actually jobs Americans won't do and we follow to construction workers that um I I don't want to give the you know the end away\nBut they've completely this prove that ah that that argument and I think at the end of the day there is a lot of people that in America that we've forgotten about\nThat have lost their jobs\nTo chew a much cheaper labor that comes across the border and I think that we're seeing this here I think that is the care of and it is not for political refugee status if people are looking for its economic and it's going to hurt the the most vulnerable people in the United states\nWell I think it's what's causing the homeless crisis in in Los Angeles is that fueled by any of this\nYou know that's a funny thing that you you asked that that it does um one hundred percent fuel out of that because a lot of these kinds of a labor type jobs have been taken away um but another thing that is causing the the homeless crisis and you in Los Angeles is is that there is it the drug epidemic\nThere are there's a thing called patient and we actually have a story coming out on that I'm patient brokering where people are using Obamacare to fly to fly people out to Los Angeles to rehab centers and then when they end up using then\nUsing the the health insurance or\nThey end up getting stuck here in Los Angeles and there's been this huge surge of of ... basically ... rehab tourism here in the in the Southern California area\nThat has been a it is it being attributed to the homeless surge of course last you know basically follows me the passing of Obamacare and I've spoken to parents\nThat have basically been through this and they went directly to Obamacare as being part of the reason why uh their kids have gotten out here in Los Angeles and then get end up getting stuck out here\n[noise] um you're covering also another story I went to a cover with you why does the black community vote almost unanimously for Democrats

told is is that they've been condition in their entire life to vote that way\nAnd um they use the tool of racism and and the and the and the\nI guess it's just time to turn it off\nAnd and I mean does today is the day really for me that I'm like okay I don't have anything in common with the mainstream media at all or ... or meet the press a lot of beyond last weekend and like I said oh no\nThey said sure why you have so much to say we are yeah they got what you say to every you know and the reason why he is I don't think\nGoing on expecting to have a conversation and with an actual solution

near landfall in Panama City and Mexico beach in Florida the media kicked into high gear as usual the reporters were positioned in areas where the wind would be you know the strongest looking at me about blowing away don't go outside all that stuff\nThe animated countdown clocks began to pop up and the lower rights of all the cable news broadcast and the great questions which now served as headlines in lieu of actual reported facts began to surface in the lower thirds of all of our TV screens hurricane Michael that global warming super charged those storm\nOr is a rally the best use of Trump's time during a hurricane horror the politics of hurricane Michael when do politicians take it too far\nIt's nothing new this is what happens is natural disasters it's a cheap and easy way to score political points you know grab ratings sell newspapers get radio broadcast to being listened to whatever especially during election seasons\nBut this time this time I had a unique insight into

small town Mexico beach that's\nWhere we're all seeing there was nothing left at the time he said this details were scarce but things were looking you know like it was going to get really bad I said just go take care of your family if you need anything call me a mercury one is already they're providing workers eight in the area so whatever you need just let me know\nSo he left he disappeared for about a week under the radar\nAnd he came back\nAnd I said how are your parents how what's the situation what does it feel like\nHe said glad I've never seen devastation like this before in person I've never the majority of the town was just wiped out\nHe said it was so weird driving up to the town that I I go to all the time I visit every year and it's not there it's just an endless field of debris\nHis family home was still standing but it needed to be demolished and bulldozed\nAnd they were joined in that regard by many of the friends and neighbors in the town he told me about the storm
