factor dot com and here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start now only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more\nWhen you are listening in Atlanta and program\nI Want to think and the answer he is um he's a guy that we had booked last hour and a guy kind of went in a different direction but I it it fits\nIn in uh to what we have been talking about today I had a caller uh about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we are going to fight back and we should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the crew and steady we have to speak truth\nDo not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know\nAre true to\nBe civil and kind to one another but we were not at a place where I think he grabbed the gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books on outrage I have a nice time to talk about outrage\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen that before in my lifetime and rage and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage and I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it\nBut not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you walk through that with him he's clearly outraged his response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges as Dan's response is I mean they just\nSaid I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel right I Know you are there's a lot of built up outrage that is and it's it's you know you both\nOn the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nUh and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but it but I but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about bond offer\nAnd that we have this closing window bond offered did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were\nThey wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts open\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not every we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation has face their challenges\nBut this is our moment and in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now the views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe\nA better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to hum we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians\nBy who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around the Samaritan woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know well don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said you fight fight or a you know for example you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're user titled were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and falls crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically\nWere winning I mean look at the Supreme Court ... Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways ... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know\nAre trying to get into people's face and getting them to react or out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because it they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... it it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attractive to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a there's a difference\nBetween the two and you know I'm so for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have the kind of you know they're the go those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just telling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them yeah and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life not yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much\nLike them and I don't think\nThat that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot in Christians in the age of outrageous is to I used to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some approach and and and gun for what's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey\nAs well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the game for small just ... you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus and\nWe take Jesus and Moses out who are we modeling who are we modeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type back in just a second\nFirst let me tell you about gold lying or President Trump has been a warning about the risks to every American if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress this November um we will see an impeachment proceeding that does not mean that they will remove him from office but they will\nAnd leave we'll be or you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death and they live because they stood up with Peter unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from Christians are ... there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate goes you know Victor is right that history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about or try to hold back the advance of course to the bank and\nAnd he says this I'll watch the pagan priests neglect the poor hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these are biased Galileo's empire scout only and that only feed their own poor but I was also\nWelcome them into their a guy by the name of the book is the name of the book is Christians in the age of
