rules for\nUm he says the same thing she thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the ... and lose the house or at least it makes it possible ... since Kavanaugh that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are at Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... she doesn't six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nYou know relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races their favorite and\nUh and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races as\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some places you know whatever the down by five in the polls winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that's been losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are going to wind up getting split and then of course bill has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power gonna have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation\nOf oh\nYeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had a they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that look like leaning Republican we're all toss up or in some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's a real a real it's really going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\nAt the ... in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten where at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that's like of course a blanket role but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kevin I was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with him and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from ...\nOh yeah but I Wonder because I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know with that four percent jump was\nIt a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone in\nPain right and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being tired light like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independence and libertarian libertarians say don't vote for Democrats like yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that is growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming\nA more rigid in ... or\n... could come down to the independence mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent mhm\nYeah I mean\nI Would think they are disgusted with what's going on right [laughter] if if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting it was sad to hear Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\n... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo uh in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nOn the scene I'm callers and for Bush ... well before it was well she gets it done ... junior guy don't get appears to be like oh\nYour home from Austria energy NASCAR cup series playoff sincere motorists in our voice\nMore weeks eight and a twenty eight team monster energy NASCAR cup series season\nAll lives are focused on a\nHoping to be crowned champion at homestead Miami speedway around debate begins today Martin real speedway at chase Elliott is red hot winning two of the last three races around twelve\nSally pulling away from Denny handle it off turn number four he'll sort of second wave of the year one\nYear ago with the same track ... hopes of winning were dashed and the closing laugh\nFactory\nKyle Busch defended wind from a year ago because of the line or when the state of five hundred a ... warrior make it to read for other clocks in twenty eighty\nComes up when he received a check or what\nWe're live from Martin real Virginia the monster energy NASCAR cup series present the first data five hundred from Martinsville Speedway exclusively\nThe motor racing\nRacing that were present\nTo you by Toyota for the latest Toyota Racing information is a Toyota Racing dot com [noise]\nBeautiful fall day Martinsville Speedway opening up this round of the play offs solo again every one I Would again alongside Kim\nMoon and Kim even though this is the first race of around when you might normally expect some guys to play it a little cautiously to make sure they don't take themselves out of the playoffs this is still a short track and ... has no shortage of drama\nYou're right well you're pretty much guaranteed drama when it comes to short track racing especially here at Martin though we've seen in the path\nThen add to that the fact that all\nEight of those playoffs drivers are hoping to lock their spot at homestead with the wind here this afternoon and I'm going to add another kick into things we got a full of cars starting from the ... for a variety of reasons\nDoes include Plaskin tinder Martin checks junior as well as others that include ... while the Jimmy Johnson problem in our data grade and by the wallet so I expect there's going to be no story tempers here today at the\nPaper [laughter] there's a playoff guy I met list of once one of the back that just kind of follow suit which back the uh the unexpected I guess you could say at Martin's bill okay let's check out some of the headlines here at Martinsville\nRacing network news brought to you by ... dot com\nFor the latest news staff of information and check out the exclusive award winning motor sports coverage on M.

it right we've got a lot of cars the past like you said but I should be fun and uh you know five hundred lasted a long time to get it done so hopefully we'll have a good partner you know good enough to get up there in a battle for the large\nTrucks junior starts today in position number thirty three after failing inspection earlier this morning before the race\nFor a long way to go and certainly a short time to get their promoting trucks junior and can you mentioned chase Eli being concerned about getting laughed early that's going to be job one for a lot of these guys who have to move toward the back of the field\nAbsolutely 'cause you think about it and the leaders are basically on the hill the field within a lap or two so that all of those drivers that are at the back of the field the ones we mentioned Martin checked senior Jimmy Johnson tell them in our David Reagan bubble all those that had\nTo start from the back because of different issues they're going to be looking out for drivers in the lead coming up in just a few lasting\nObjects and your mirror closer than they appear absolutely\nBut that back into the grid and the steep caught up\nWith well we're talking about well robbers but that's all good you're Martin's old Virginia and all really doesn't have all the drama going around the house was brought to closely qualified in the fall of the ... the most was bought ... how good is your race car I think it's pretty good um [noise]\nA team was really going to wherever they go to fourteenth really good I think yeah\nYou know we're starting to the back but uh\nI think we can get some transition keep her car one piece will be racing for the win at the end\nI Know the goal is to be in the playoffs not being you know how does that all through the way you can approach this race and and and doesn't allow you to be a little bit more Russell and thanks\nYes and now I mean you know you're given dang factor kind of goes down which is good 'cause you don't you're not worried about their new carpet just worried about when\nWell there we go see what happens it's gonna be fun to watch right just as long as you're going to roll from the southern spot once the deli\nOr let's catch up with ... he's got a wind just a couple of weeks ago so that the rollout fit just ... points outside the cut off spot this track is kind of been hit or miss or you've had some really good runs more of late or how good is this race car now you feeling about your chances today\nFeel good about it I think are pretty good and and then you know five hundred lab that Martin is a long time to track changes a lot um and you just have to keep up with so I feel like we've got a good starting spot I'd be like are you know ours Mikhail forward is decent and then we just got to go to work we've got to execute them\nRoad I got to do my part um and then we just got to keep up with a track as the robbers up and changes so just looking for today it's a great a great place for us and and opportunity\nFrom a driver field standpoint you talking about this race track changing how does it feel from the driver standpoint\nWell it's just it's tough it's a really challenging racetrack um you know where there's forty cars on this little tight half mile race track there were beaten in banging in fighting for every inch and um you know you\nI Know downpours is not really important here but you still want to give your fingers on the car you don't want to get any damage you don't want to have to come back to that road for an unscheduled pit stop for any reason and lose track of this and so uh yeah you just it's it's about being smart and um you know aggressive but you've got to be patiently aggressive if there is such a thing\nAnd we should see some of that and hopefully a patient just going to be one of the keys to the right I'm sure we will hear that from rusty Wallace back to Alex\nWith a driver who will start today in position number twelve talk to him yesterday right after he got don't qualify and That's Kevin Harvey we are talking about it when uh when we talked yesterday after qualify you were happy that at the time you were Thirteen why are some technical problems with some of the other teams you start twelve today\nIt's about the race do today the ballots up your Ford how pleased to argue with that their practice yesterday\nThat was good yesterday so hopefully it stays that way today this\nThis race in particular always seems to have a big balance which at the end of the race starts to get dark\nOut attracts rubber up so that might have to try to keep up with a racetrack and and be brave enough to make the right adjustments to the car when it's not doing anything wrong\nWhen it's sunny like it is today is first time we've seen this on all weekend well that change things much as far as putting Robert down on the track well even with\nNo sign yesterday you know I thought the trucks with a fair amount of rubber down compared to what I'm used to seeing so I I Would say that I Will definitely help by some rubber perfect day to race\nI think so too That's Kevin Harvey he'll go from position number twelve is Stuart horse racing teammate is lucky enough to catch up with Steve ...\nWell Stordahl racing certainly been stalled here in the ... also looked at an apple go here today at least put border is going to have a front row starting spot when we get to do here today starting in position number two is of course\nThe when when we were here in the spring earlier this year and put 'em ... raised in the spring good starting spot today what's your thoughts are ready to go for father loves the Martin so\nI don't know you know that's your thoughts are what am I think you know where where do we need to be where the gardening to be\nHow do I need to drive you know obviously the\nAll the disciplines of getting around Martinsville or any short track for that matter is is you know don't overcharge corner don't own reviews you brakes don't hustle distraught all the discipline in a race car do your job\nSo that my team can do their job to help me I'm whether that's a judgment and the parents are are a good bit stop or anything else um had a great day yesterday grey day a practice I'm gonna just methodically went through every day I was proud of our efforts and um you know the decisions we made um\nWeather's a little bit different the sun out a little bit warmer today a still a cool fall day and you know nonetheless a a good opportunity this is a huge opportunity to have a car as good as we had a yesterday I'm going into to ah you know such an important race within the play offs I mean literally you win this re\nDuring the day you know uh you're one of four guys with a chance to win a championship I'm back at all the bad here today but you don't have to do that that's not the only way to get to the home and said you know we have to capitalize on a ... a good weekend for us we gotta kept that often\nTake care of business any stages accumulate as many points as possible um we can't when they're saying we all by all means we've got to finish the best we can to um to have a little bit of blanket going in these next year\nWe'll see what happens with the yesterday you drop her today may be a great day here today for when you start sucking strolling along several because she's alongside Winston telecom\nBush picking up where we left off when we were here before he's been up front the last five times here a couple of wins a couple of seconds and and a fish so a very strong here at the track should be a little bit different with the warmer weather than we had back in March ... how do you feel like it's going to be different\nUm I don't know I don't know exactly but I always like it when it's a little bit warmer here I feel like we run better when it's warmer and\nWhen it gets too cold it just doesn't feel like you can I that I can also the car enough in order to make up time so I'm looking forward to today though we've got a awesome Halloween evidence Camry and uh it's been up front\nHere at Martin's the last few times as you mentioned in ah would love to keep that trend going here today\nDid you like to package it your head yesterday\nYeah we um you know I felt like we were pretty good in the long run we made a few long runs and um you know yeah I can make speed on the front around which I thought would be okay for qualifying and obviously that kind of showed but also I think we're pretty good on the long run so we'll see what happens there today and um you know it at that time of year where you you better be good and um you know I think we're I think we're there\nForty points to the good looking for when number eight this year and one number
