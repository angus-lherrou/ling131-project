Republican\nA percentage of people who are really interesting the election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked\nUm you said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats it started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate ... ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... cents Kavanaugh that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance\nOf very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are at Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid two dozen six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nRelatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know what to look at kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is they've Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races their favorite and\nUh and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point\nSo all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is the idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happened the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where there was a down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that get them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that have been losing tens seeds from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still hasn't even they're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power gonna have subpoena power are going to have an\n... it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive all we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of [noise] [noise] yeah well we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had a bad a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all taught supper and some of them look like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's a real ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\n... there is an interesting group because they are not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten or fifty percent\nNow independent are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that type of course a blanket rule but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until cabinets\nForty two percent and then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents\nAnd that may just be because they're overwhelmed with and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder\n'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump\nWas it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independence that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever be right ... that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so and the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line that\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid and and more of\nThis one could come down to the independence mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything uh they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting this data here Glenn if we could get 'em as we're talking about the caravan\nOf of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so uh in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ...

and one is a well hobbyist\nThey don't like each other they want death\nFor everybody in the other state they want the regime of Saudi Arabia [noise] Saudi Arabia stopped [noise] turkey because they're Muslim Brotherhood [laughter] and Saudi Arabia wants turkey stopped because there will hobbyists\nWe're being put in the middle of a fight between to Islam assists both of them want the caliphate both of them want Islamic rule both of them want to rule ah with jihad and they also want to rule with Syria law\nWe don't we don't want any either of those so now let's put this into perspective Saudi Arabia horrible place\nHorrible horrible horrible horrible place they execute kids as long as you've shown any kind of signs of puberty you're tried as an adult they execute through beheading ... there was a woman who was raped gang raped by seven men not sure if one of them was\nSupreme Court justice Kavanaugh yet uh but uh Saudi were woman was gang raped by seven men\nThey each got you know between two and nine years in prison however she she received six months in prison and two hundred lashing ... with a whip\n\nBecause she was in the car without a without her husband and

we're new ... cautious last summer when I when I Need you mind if you're really dark\nAnd so I think it's very important to um as far right as they come on the right versus left continual but it's very important to remember that the purpose of politics is to maintain a framework for ordered liberty so that you can go live in the communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and build\nBetter mouse trap or ... or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are\nThey're anti constitution so you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people say\nEnough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end ... what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to\nNancy Pelosi in California how are you aware does did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao and Kentucky exactly ...\nBecause there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off the table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff\nDoesn't actually have persuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch heads to a pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book that different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta\nAnd taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I I'm In\nI'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now\nAnd ah there's no end to fight here and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about am to ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media college in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties sixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy\nSo that it was sixty eight percent of households that men are basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it was shared content\nThere was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two\nThey're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world\nIs so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like anti ... her do who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should\nDo is ignored them [noise]\nSo what is are\nAre we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time is the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone\nYeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nSo yes it is a ... a ... soon them out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right if protests\nAll of those things flow from a fundamental assumptions about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with eternal souls and with dignity\nThat's way bigger than their policy preferences and so what is unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this\nTension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation the nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness\nIs do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do\nIf those four things are true or even if three of the four true\nYou're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less\nAnd so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of stick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and what you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to

I mean but I mean the conservative position for multiple decades going back to Ronald Reagan is is is is not protection and so he's the one being consistent there or you know whether you know I Know a lot of people have changed on that at some level\nUm but still I mean it's we're seeing the effects of this in the middle of the country right now the terrorists are very harmful to the economy it was about to get worse a spending bill\nHe voted against the Trump Administration ... I mean I think everybody knows including by the way if Trump even said how bad it was he still voted for he's still signed it and was you know what I'm supporting it in the end but he even said it was terrible\nI haven't you know what it against that I have a new argument on spending that you have to remind me of a scarcity of money we're about to hit scarcity of money\nWhich is all tied in to the spending bill and it'll boggle your mind\nWhen you see oh well you know it doesn't matter you know it's going to matter it's going to matter on whether you can afford to buy a car or not in a way that you've never thought of\nBefore ... voted against raising the debt limit extension of government funding for a couple of weeks and imposing sanctions on Russia Iran and North Korea or another separate one uh imposing a ... a sanctions on Russia\nThe another a free trade thing as an opposing the nomination of Lighthizer I'd say like these are all wrecked traditional conservative positions that he took it I don't think anyone in our audience would be like oh well I I'm mad at Penn that for for warning for opposing additional\nNo ending I think and it is a legitimate concern it's a legitimate concern and it's a concern about you\nKnow um it's a it's a battle that I have in my own head\nUm\nYou know when is enough to know\nStew is the press the enemy of freedom ...\nThe enemy of freedom no enemy of of of the people you know I don't agree with that a terminology I understand there's massive problems with it at times and ... and you know sometimes there's so much and all I\nWanted to make them the ... I mean if you are if you are running things that are not true and they know they're not\nIf they are silencing and smearing voices on the other side at what point is there a tipping point\nI mean ... I I agree with the first amendment you still have the right they have a right to do it but where is the point to where you say you guys are when when you are covering for ... when you are covering for people who say I want an end to the capitalist system\nAnd you say which she's she's advocating\nSocialism not ... not Canadian socialism socialism communism she's talking about state run and owned property in businesses now that's that's not a welfare state\nOh you're a conspiracy theorist weight she just said it at one point [laughter] oh I mean first of all\nThat ... you know the press is a collection of individuals\nSome of what you do a good job some of which do not\nAh so it's important to make those distinctions I think um and you know look at that is a this was just this is going on at our founding you know people were doing it at our founding and I know and and it at our founding but we but we are we realize as when we were in a gauge and informed populace we chose correctly\nRight I mean I you know if we're not\nWell we know what the ... we know a Republican you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchases lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nHere are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage rich nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing rate shield\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nIt's in writing where he said in comparison to deter records Rachel approval only about I'm thirty three year project ... information and conditions equal housing lender license and also the state and wants to be thirty thirty additional conditions works loses may apply\nTo get this was my main y'all have another great they help you get to you know you kind of thing you got some ... feet this way\nLike char grilled police just\nIndia share\nPound a bladder ... owns and telling mountains\nBeing removed all the phone from the top of the melted butter\nAdding to keep things fresh garlic and then in places well ... years on the half shell onto an open plains grill and sprinkled with graded ... cheese on time cooking until the keys to brown some\nForeigners drizzling the garlic butter over that way to cook them find nothing many they paid them the needy lay down with a little extra butter and good bread sounds made\nSure to tune in to get cooking with the only thing Monday through friday right here and it's always love and then the\nRamsey or when you think about where you should keep your hard earned money it's always smarter to consider a bank where your money takes you\nFarther and there's no better place to get the most out of your money then at delta community credit union delta community has been around for more than Seventy five years and it's just about everything the big banks have to offer but with more value for your money\nThat's because delta community is not for profit credit union where the needs of the members\nTake priority delta community works hard to help guide you with personal service and\nTrusted advise stopped by one of the delta communities twenty five metro Atlanta branches today you can become a member and minutes or go on line at delta community CU dot com that's delta community CU dot com and tell them Dave Ramsey sent you\nDelta community credit union is federally insured by and see us\nAtlanta jingle bombs twenty Eighteen presented by capital what happens on December fourteen of the state farm arena starring Sean ... would you feel\nMarshmallow LSD a car\nHe's wrong everyone\nGet yours and be more to the Atlanta jingle twenty eight presented by Capitol line suburban\nCoke I Love or that it was again I'm I'd come to the point in my life I'd much rather err on that side even if there are certain things that uh you know I might disagree with libertarians on a ... I just would rather err on the side of someone who's saying take the power away from the government to make those decisions\nUh and you know I mean I'm pretty much a libertarian or at least close to it um as you can be but still it's like it's it's bizarre how many people say they agree with the ... the principles and then the end you know I don't yeah either and\nWonder what it means what ... yeah yeah when it comes to that but the ... no no wait a minute I can get that so\nNo no it only works if we if we all are like no I'm really going to do it\nI really got to do when it affects me I'm going to do it that's when that's when it comes from Larry sharp candidate for governor in New York next\nSo uh so it was just at a a economic conference I'm a ... over the weekend\nAnd learned a lot to worry was there he's the guy from the Palm Beach letter and he's the guy that came out said what was it last year hey bitcoin it was a thousand dollars going to go up like ten thousand get it and it went up to twenty thousand now it's crashed and he's now saying it's going to go forty thousand get it\nAnd it's what six thousand\nShe did a presentation that I listen to on what is coming with bitcoin it's ...\nI just think it's inevitable it's just inevitable it's one of those things where you like and it's the telephone and some day it'll be on everybody's homes and it was like oh yeah it will\nIs exactly he becomes amazing they have no idea what he did they have no idea who he is but he's the rebellion guy so he becomes a symbol of it by on the left I mean don't get me wrong or that people in the left or exactly who these people are of course there are but that's often the leadership I'm Talking the average every person who votes\nThey just know what's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people better I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life\nLiberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness sorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI ... I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system\nI'm making hemp and the candidates legal I'd hang on weight before it surely stuff let's start with me I should go into education absolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all standardized testing proud of high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because satirized testing is it unfair way of getting teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who at ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well ... and there's no indication success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests or the feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy it's so nice testing is very good when you're in high school and try and why you should go where you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do think that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and he was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really wasn't a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information and he was really do anything mhm somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read\nWrite survive in the world without at at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked\nThey had the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nLet me give you a quick rundown of every single time centralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want I Want to make sure that we have some localized central I'm the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting started testing you will lose about we will do is in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nTo Loni but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion back into the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose that four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strikes\nWhich means administrators go away and then it shows while riding granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why regulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one saying these things because I cross the entire state might say that the the two counties I crossed all if you\nGoing to fool sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more than a traders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average ministry makes over a hundred and fifty ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you hide my teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve when e K through ...\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed ... that's all they're doing how do we know this\nBecause the first year of college for most kids is their teeth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college was terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally\nNow I have people who tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one ... told me said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that's so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get a high school diploma number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high skilled plumber and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk in front of computer all day ... that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think called you right for me I go to a two year ... to ... prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nDon't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan love I\nI'm an actor who have had to get tired I sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different story\nData okay yeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be bored in school and they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now worries go to a two year trade school\nChoice could become a plumber a carpenter whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately\nThe average tradesmen in New York state it's over fifty ... that's a problem I let my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough and Yossi to doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that go get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation I just feel the need to go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nLoudly sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth grade I'll pay for the last two years to I still have warm here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck\nHere's an here's what I promised going to happen a bunch of coup prep schools will pop up a\nBunch of great trade schools will pop up yes that much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars ... going to say well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will actually give loans to make these schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere is the best part when he schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year for these last two years the ... states spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each\nTwelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders is more than four billion dollars\nWe've said all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel is appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders added at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... ethnic or the unhappy kids now thinking about this a lemon twelfth grade your ... that's what greater you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nTo build their kid isn't there to build a kitchen something else the kids bullied because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's a bully but now he go someplace else your teacher lemons fourth grade this one problems almost go away why all the kids want to be there they've taught was killing our children isn't guns was getting our children is lack of community\nLack of purpose and loneliness that killing our kids put them in these worlds\nAll that goes away I Can't go shoot my fellow friend the teachers have me you know build a rocket with my class I Can't go she ... the farm and he's been a fix a tractor I got things to do I've I've purpose I meaning I don't do things like that anymore\nWe're living in a world of massive change yes

state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit\nEspecially when it comes to the second amendment a and trying to de platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for a governor to impede business\nPeriod no ifs ands or buts if I don't like in the industry or like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief I should be the marketer and chief\nNot not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality is he's always\nNot only doing that he's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often it's normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants to insurance force firearm\nNow we can't get it there's no way that the individual and there are at least for me and I'm gun owners in New York state if not more well how do they mean insurance now when\nWhen when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore\nQuit for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yeah and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by default no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant\nSay fact was passing twenty Thirteen and if a fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal literally ... what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now you but which by the way you purchase the day before a complete legally totally above board you are now a violent fell and it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all bottom to tell them to\nNot joking district story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes all the top scores added ... revamped or because of that in other words but it now if you're retired cop what you retire well now you're a felon again\nBecause you don't want her to come up\nThis is this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy constantly project I care about the little guy
