I think he just\nHe contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist with the New York where he's written it's relatively new yeah because he left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might\nBe on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new and you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... a first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean any porn that we are able to air those things are but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was the one he's made like he's tried to capitalize on that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now with her and I and I live in the first one was the biggest a political documentary of all time up\nIn that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like they've got to go all out there and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven um right so this is not\nA new accusation um when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about\nFor the business our allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Iraq Obama was plenty friendly with them to exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there was no way\nObama would've done\nAnything a severe to Saudi Arabia\nBy this point there and it wouldn't have done anything about this it's a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of media coverage today the difference there is that they perceive ... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker who is\nExpensive right we're never good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again\nThe big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the\nRoom remembered this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as the bad guy who ... who was who's incompetent\nBrock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything and it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years\nSince the lower than me so it was a decision made sense Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is it a tough decision and in the minds of people who want to praise the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking admission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military member especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on with investigate this before we act irrationally if for Rocco bottle was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker\nHe's not being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThat it may be overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who is a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's brought about by or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC is certainly on this board and and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is our this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nA potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by a mistake of falling with your ... something happened there ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't there are more of a story here maybe that's the story you run in three weeks\nWhen you're looking back at this incident but like is it the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still in the age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune his reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nAre actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of the show the um Saudi Arabia publicly pledged payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into\nOh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that is kind of I mean look at it if not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations and that is why when you're making a decision of the\nPresident of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term\nBy a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority your\nTop priority is not a ... murders in Turkey\nRight like the beginning or I don't know if anybody knows this but we're ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time or you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the rent free anymore so studying like that's off the table now\nBut this guy's been doing much worse things all over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a\nJournalist or a column this is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it and they're prioritizing it over and you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like it's this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up a working for an American newspaper\nSo it's a big story and the and the details rounded are so crazy like such a twenty four story line that I can understand why it captures the interest but being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative\nAnd there's a lot at stake here a lot at stake I mean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they are going to retaliate and it's it's gonna cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in\nOil ... that's what they've already threatened All right go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply while I think we get scanned little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got to all your\nUh T's crossed in ... before you take any\nSevere action I Would think you know look there's a global market anyway yeah so if it all affects ah each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a principled moral decision outweighs that a lot of times but American interests are have to be factored into Asian we think we see that\nMy math cook with the Georgia news network a number of elections offices around the state might have been blindsided by the interest in this year's midterm elections one of the more visible examples as a county where people have been standing in line for three hours sometimes in order to cast a

incredibly dangerous in our society and all too prevalent in that's a Disney Princess is um we're being worn by ah some Hollywood actresses\nThat there is some danger there Karen nightly is promoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by Disney by the way the nutcracker the realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produce because Disney Princess is don't uphold her feminist values ... so she is forbidden her three year old daughter ET from watching certain movies like Cinderella which is\nA been banned in her household because she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her\nAnd she says don't rescue yourself\nObviously and this is the one I'm ... mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and there's not really as a self yes should in polar self out of that situation\nShe's also quite annoyed by the Little Mermaid she's banned that as well she says the songs are great but they don't give but don't give your voice up for a man\nOr a man yeah thank you ... there's a lot of women are doing that today\nThe main message modeled on a ... of really they'll tire movie is to give up all of your rights to bed and wait for them to rescue a especially a rash of rich guy\nThat's the message you should be taking from those movies I'm\nChristian bell is also fearful that Disney princes are sending the wrong message to her children she's actually the voice of the Disney Princess uh Anna and frozen wasn't that done by Christian Bale yes\nSo she tells her daughter's Lincoln and delta that ah when ... when she read Snow White del taco bell ds and Lincoln bell yes and when she read Snow White two inch closes up the book and she says every time we close no way I look at my girls and ask\nDon't you think it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple or where she got that apple\nI say I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no and I'm like\nOkay I'm doing something right yeah you've proved it a while you nailed that one there did wrist and then she'll also say and girls don't you think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission well no because she's in a coma\nMom [laughter] can't give her permission and she'll stay in a coma if he doesn't cancer right I mean she's advocating for the government can to continue right the ... that's what gives her out of it right and bell says uh because you can't catch someone if they're sleeping on the different I mean in my circumstances\nThat's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book\nRight the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there's a magical apple there's a\nA a prince a that was a magical spell round the princess yeah and she's sleeping 'cause she can't wake up right unless the prince kisses her that's kind of the premise that\nYeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that pressure lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so weird I even get yourself still worked up about that I you know what I Hope happens every day it every day when she

Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice ... are just unbelievable I Need to ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no corrupt ration and no evidence\nYeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't you're occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know the debate still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest eight Brett Kavanaugh\nBut I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations\nIt was always about the ... the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning\nThe Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court would that was one hundred percent of of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and\nCertainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story\nWe don't know um but\nThe other people and Cory Booker do not care won't for one second about what happened to this one not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so you could call themselves Spartacus or and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and yeah and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nAnd again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but if you're judging by the standards that they're putting up\nIt's totally different ... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating\nAfter I think of how recent is Brett Kavanaugh thing was an ... that story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find that Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what happened what mine of it it happened ... none of it right [noise] um and we were basically the insinuation from the media was if\nLet's say one of the witnesses she named instead came out and said yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know marry a distant and I I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on for something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident which just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party occurred none of the incident happened just at the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the an accusation of rape not sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape\nBill Clinton Broderick initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to wind down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the stories you tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against her\nFive people said ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred\nWow so not while for one person who was at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred\nUh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn pantyhose in their shared hotel room Broderick explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband that her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Campbell and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of corporate by the way I'm going to renovate the color of their work\nUm NBC News found a date and which endorsed nursing homes seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended newspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area\nAnd had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was a prison outside the hotel window wow that is a\nThousand times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and yet that was ignored for ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats and now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after\nThey never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again to them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump and that's why they have no more used for them but I mean Bill Clinton goes on and still\nMakes a big level speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there it's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so bizarre\nAnd the fact that they that that the media actually thinks we should take their ... current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when your report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system with actual standards\nAnd if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened\nI mean that is what that is the system we have it's the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we're now supposed to go through these kangaroo courts and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court\nIt's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it\nIs now or standard that didn't sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference with a was between the two when she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is some Pancho evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy\nBlasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated or exception\nOf Michael ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy their so pissed off about that and they do not want I'm running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then my club and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even Trevor Noah who's the [noise] I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but\nI'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other day I took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit actually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's the best person to be speaking out on sexual allegations here's what he said\nThe grounds to Glenn today and tomorrow it's going to south in Pennsylvania he's up there on the Web at burger\nOr are you doing good a lot when you were talking about her read a story and how we kind of make fun of the reaction mhm where you are not that kind of stuck really impact on

interesting thing for the New York times today and is they do this little pod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage\nEver ever um you did things in front of girls right after he asked them if you could\nYeah and then they said yes at odd part of the saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing something\nThat against it as well right like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where um he\n[noise] again like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure in himself while\nOn the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics Howard on Eric absolutely yeah powered enemy that makes you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian he's in ... he wields incredible power in this country now incredibly led to ever\nFired at any job in the nation any job you're a sarcasm is just reality\nAnd the situation that they're going to go and what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them people were other comedians\nAnd one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there is something invited her back to his trailer to do its thing in front of her which apparently was\nWas this is ... ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't force her to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation last alert to do this thing which is on believable obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have a I I have issues I'm Sorry\nBut that is is that sexual assault the accusation there and know that that show was shown pushed she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right now and he admitted in such a general way that people kind of uh making eight people he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make the right and I think\nThat the what I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like so yeah it was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no\nAnd and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nOf that he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again just making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was supposed to scares away from right you're not supposed to just a Seattle and people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedian you never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks and it doesn't ... or Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while because that are loose okay well I'm In a doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he's bounced around just several clubs around New York since and they let him on stage so the New York times there's an exhaustive report about trying to talk to the club owner but why you let him onstage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision was some\nOther people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy said he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like never ... might never and he says never\nWell can you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence never work again he says I don't care never this is an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the owner of a place where you would say\nUh they're able to not deal with all these commissions and not be incentivized to give you a bad loans\nAre they actually I'm a are

happens on December ... of the state for marina starring Sean Mendez\n\nIs wrong to everyone right now [laughter]\nWe can do about it\nWell do you how did he lie what are you lie about it he said he drink to excess from time to time yep\nWhen he lie about the idea is that while others because other people around and we're like well I think he ... he ... didn't blackout how the hell do you know not\nOnly he would know that right or maybe he did I I don't see how that's all that ah there's no way to know that I Am too there's conversation but still there's no way to do it it's a ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this\nIs the subtle\nAccusation that everyone who supported\nBrett Kavanaugh was a terrible person\nEven from people like you know there are people in the left but you know I'm sure as I said I certainly know them\nAnd they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they're saying which is they accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want him on the Supreme Court right and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... ... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over the line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accused me of of the ... of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I think I don't think it happened yeah\nI don't either if it hadn't been I think it happened with somebody else maybe believing that is is this is a I don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't fair but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official\nOr in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades then talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party like\nWhat are we and the person who's making the accusation\nHas an overt uh dislike for the\nParty of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist his marched women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in that motivation forty years later into account I always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost it's like it's got some bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty\nIt's a weird way of seeing what about it yeah I Am I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors no no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor that indicates that vis a vis a vis occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would I ever called the victim I called them survivor but then I wouldn't they Levi\n... survived this assault by this man maybe if they've assault didn't happen they didn't survive it and [laughter] yeah I guess we could all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us in our life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible what you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make it up\nWhy would she lie about it that's a good question because I Love this one mhm\nWe possibly can ruin your motivation [laughter]\nUp with an accusation should like this I don't know when I told her to go we\nTalk about uh yeah I Know we talk about the the\n... were women's right to choose it is just fainted as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one I wouldn't defend my children's lives\nAbout as strongly as they would they defend their right to kill their children is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so vital is insane we seemed far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week and we're five\nFive accusers accused the high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle and receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay this happens all the time\nYou know why people are horrible many of them are off older women are awful men are awful they do terrible things\nThat you can explain it happens all the time and the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing was swastikas on their door for nothing\nTo like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they do we know for a fact the fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them\nWe know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother right any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or what had happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusation we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats\nWere the first two and in the second one is is that there's ... there right when they the person who made the allegation said I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen and she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly ...\nEvidence on that one either and there and look the Fort one was only ... I think taken more seriously than the others because there was an obvious\n... person saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people there was no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In it of course obviously people a cabin on his uh his or what this is worth saying though um but\nThat one was serious because she went in to you know took the step of going in front of the of the of the hearing and and and doing it relatively credible job at recounting what she believed the story was\nWho knows if it was true or if it was completely felt false the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's just completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you could do it I mean that as we heard with Hillary Clinton\nShe said there was a vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this like in the media access if this is entirely foreign world where someone could live on politics [laughter]\nDon't of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd you you brought up to high school situation in California where they call it the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and\nThey they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault\nOr and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk I don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him the credits didn't like him to really encourage\nOr how about the Ohio University student who ah got threatening notes about how they didn't want her in her el GB chi lifestyle to them to be in the students' Senate anymore at Ohio University\nUh she was a angry and frustrated and disappointed she said I'm a ... you may find my me revolting and worthy of a threat of my life but in reality it's your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head you eh thing a whole I Am proud to be who I Am and nothing could say or do or ever change that\nBy the way these huge ... of course admitted to sending the threats\nTo herself ... or or the woman and why would you do that yeah why won't curb motivation possibly be it's hard to do in this case it's not hard to detect with Brett Kavanaugh\nOr a the a woman in Texas who said a state trooper sexually assaulted her until of course the camera footage came out and her own attorney had to say we're sorry for bringing in this case we didn't know about this at the time\nOr the charges against the for dentist accused in Las Vegas of raping a ... a people and that was also found to be completely false\nAnd untrue or ah how about the racist receipt we don't tip of terrorists to an Arab a person at a restaurant\nUm who again later I had to admit that yes he actually wrote this stuff on the receipt wow or the former college student who claimed rape and then it had to admit in court that it was completely false on Long Island\nOr a Kansas man who said he put racist graffiti on his own car\nOr or or the races note at Saint Olaf college\nIf you remember this one uh that was one where they talked about uh once again the this terrible race racial note do everyone apparently the racism is rampant all crime F pure white complacency all over the place where we find out later of course not true we can go on and on and on and on with these stories\nIf you say you had a realistic looking air stuff got ... that may be a lost it a little are you I assume they all the orange thing on the end of the sacred and let's just say that fell off or something like a good idea that black right which is a\nBig walking down the street or he's walking towards the school I can understand someone passing by like a what the hell is going on and on the police yeah and what happens if they show up\nAnd they talk to them they owe the nurse offered us off guard letter that things are getting at the arch these are people gonna freak out and then you really\nOh max the maximum penalty but we will look we're going to take the God will return\nIt to you later instead they found the air sock gun in his truck and arrested for disturbing they realized it was an air so yeah they knew it was a nurse aka they said it was a nurse off and they're they're still being congratulated for the next week six [laughter]\nOr I don't know I don't know what are you going to do with an air so I mean if you're shot somebody in the eyes yeah you're supposed to work out those right when you were like that\nIt would hurt ... or you might put an eye out my mom warns me more than me about that or whether it was a kid\n... but other than that I I don't know where you're going to do with yourself God\nThat's so dangerous that they had the rest of the kids when they found out it's an or soccer\nBut he wasn't even walking down the street used posted a photo you
