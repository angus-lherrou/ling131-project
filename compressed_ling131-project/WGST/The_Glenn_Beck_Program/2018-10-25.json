to go piss dam road runner keeps go getting away maybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see of or Amazon Prime order came in and do you think George Soros does\nEvery person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening\nThese devices were not designed to kill but to be detected caught and seen\nWylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one now I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left I don't know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives\nBefore the midterms no one knows yet this could be a kid that just thought this would be funny\nAgain there's no chance these bombs would go off so maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up he just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other\nThis however is not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste by noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's all wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\n\nYou know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a left wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that\nCould I ask when the president has actually called for violence now you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\nCalling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I did go on\nBut we all know the left narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue\nOf our friends and the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred one person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first\nOf all that would force one to deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep in your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapists to bring this memory back at it so long ago\nOh wait a minute no it was just a couple of

ramp everybody up\nWould that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters\nAnd blaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts\n\nYou do something like that and something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold credibility but you'd have

I'm\nA former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat\nThese Jason how ridiculous\nIs this bomb the most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it sort of when I first looked at I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder\nAnd um I I was looking at it and I was like no not really\nI mean it's a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel was what's dangerous and a pipe bomb the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal\nOkay we don't need [laughter] [laughter] right\n[noise] um but there's another ingredient they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it um they said they did detect some of that and there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything's spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing\nA lower or\nSomebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want\nIt to work right\nIt had no I mean you're looking at this thing there is you know and I've also spent some time and some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to they have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN all media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person wouldn't know what I was no chance just gets\nTo the coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and serious the situation but there was a level\nOf sophistication levels first occasion because he had sent her or she by the way\nHe or she had a had sent 'em some of these bombs to home offices and and read that in ... where there wouldn't be the screening rather than setting them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely\nBe scrawled can I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from the get the paper in the mail every day when she gets\nUp whose home did it go to that they did have a Scranton ... both of them have private security course or Stuart service at their horizons\nA there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of the continued attacks on the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand there was words matter that's far they've shown no comprehension about it I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't really like everything that he says about the media but we have no evidence\nNo evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else that into these bombings we have no idea we have no idea who get the we have no idea what the motivation was he I mean I think you could probably say there's a political motive but that's\nClearly a political motive but that's all you could say you don't know it is such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who was mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off yeah the sticker the ISIS me right here on that clearly marks that as somebody from the right why would you\nPut that on there and why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope God glad none of them went off by the way\nUm but it seems to indicate someone who wanted these things to be seen every single part of this that we're just talked about a no leads to that and and your in your in your point about the timer before it's like ... there's a reason why there's that acts and be a shelter like that because the postal service is not an exact science\nOr you can't say I go up as you point to our ... that are on timing to you could have blown up the post debate and yeah it's so bad I mean there was a photo timer it when it was just probably a digital counter that was doing nothing but that was was kind of funny or the wires are going into that or whether a\nHi

looking up on my a leftist anarchist cook book a that was put out\nA by the left in the Nineteen sixties and seventies about pipe bombs and you know it's really interesting is um uh it does show how to make one you know with a clock a but it also shows how to make them you know so they go off like let's say you\nOpen an envelope mhm you would call a string in that era in that area which would make the bomb go off I'm I'm trying to figure out welcome to the program path grave from pat gray unleashed\nI'm trying to figure out ... what was the timer timing to\nEither this is the worst bomber of all time in human history or something else going on here\nBecause you would you put a a sticker on about like I ... I\nGuess I've seen pictures of people in the military for example we're about to fire a missile and they put like Osama bin Laden name out or something like I get the theoretically possible\nBut if you know of bombs going to explode why would you put a sticker of a right wing me mom and ... and less and less again potentially a you've thought maybe they wouldn't blow up and that people would see the right wing me right like\nIt's almost as if they put on the outside of the envelope open with care this is an explosive so that they wouldn't explode it's one of the nine has gone off\nDial up but they also put glass in instead of ball bearings or anything metal you walk metal as your as your shrapnel you you you wouldn't go\nI see in the bomb would just disintegrate the glass even more ... you you don't want it in PVC pipe you wanted in a metal pipe because of the shrapnel this is just it's\nThere's just too many things wrong with this and again it might just be somebody who was sick and demented ... and ... and the stupid or it might be some kid that thought this would be funny it might be some\nYou know mentally deficient a right winger that did it it also may be somebody who was on the left is like oh I Know how to change\nThe narrative could be that\nToo of course I don't know I mean you have to have some\nLevel of skepticism of the of the of the of the obvious narrative here right a which is some right wing or did this I think the first thing that makes you lead to that is it's not they haven't exploded\nRight so if you are trying to harm someone usually you'd be able to do it okay the same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing or figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think if someone who is opposed to them but would take a ... minute here and consider that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figure look like they're under attack especially when it turns out not to be rights and and just white powder\nWide and someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened a hundred times unbelievable so much just to listen to this I suppose he thinks the communist didn't set fire to the rice dog as well [laughter] I mean\nYou of course take a moment to consider and and there's no reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point but you see these statements that have come out from CNN\nAnd ... you know people just outwardly blaming\nThe rights and Donald Trump for this\nLook I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George Soros is how well no but I think a virus that might have [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that\nBut beyond that if you're going to you you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive to make America ill that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off it's certainly possible but\nI've been following the caravan news here locally and then I watch your episodes on line\nAnd I have to tell you and we'll continue that at the\nTop of the hour and a path grade from ...

bringing that up\nShe was very serious and one of the biggest critic of NBC and the way they handled some of those allegations seemingly they are really\nFinding a a quick way\nOr they seems to me to me that maybe she has a target on her for some of those\nAre things that she said which is kinda fascinating because that'd be the I mean as we know that they're going to do good to talk to us constantly about the inequality between the sexes and and and how how those conservatives are really about Roy Moore oh he's a he's a bad guy\nA but we're going to find when it comes to people like Matt Lauer and Brokaw and how many more\nAt NBC it's when one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it to the New Yorker\nOr you know all of that goes on and maybe Kelly happens to be one of the biggest critics of what happened and NBC and yet you know she has one comment that people don't like and she's gone as fascinating\nNBC News uh chairman Andy lack released a statement following her comments there is no other way to put this but I can Dan those

think it's Americans I really don't I don't think that it's a vast but I don't think it's eighty or Ninety percent of the country that are cry babies they're sick of this\n\nIs about maybe five to ten percent of America and many of them in the media and many of them in politics\nAnd the last place probably the last comes first academia [laughter]\nOh you should be coddled\nThe slightest thing upset you well that's not American it's not where are the ones you know what I have a picture of my grandmother she crossed the Rocky Mountains and in a um a in a ... a wagon train okay\nIs she was she looks like me in a dress with a bomb it okay she she ... she also kind of looks a little like a pirate\nYou know why because on the wagon train her I was poked out\nYou know she did she wiped her face and ... and kept going she didn't wine she didn't cry about it she's like oh crap [noise] shouldn't around with that\nI pulled my eye out and she moved on that to Americans are yes bad things happen we move on that yes people say things that I don't like we move on that yes\nThings have changed were involving we're learning\nNew things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's not throw that away\nMegan Kelly ought to know blackface is awful yes it's no longer acceptable but you know what if it's a costume that his\nPurpose flea ridden a ridiculing race as black faces done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly ... is being fired not because she wore black face but because of words and I the ah question it's not even she was advocating she was questioning why why\nIs this wrong if I'm not ridiculing people why is this wrong that that person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume\nWhy is this wrong\n\nI think that deserves an answer instead what we got was an apology\nI Am so sorry I should know oh please don't be me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want to know are whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me how are we supposed to learn if we don't have\nCivil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far\nThat it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river\nIf she floats we know she's a bigoted racist if she doesn't well we will will know that will know that she was innocent but it's just so ridiculous how similar it is to the thought crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't thought of something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crimes stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe set to work to exercise himself in crime stop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ISIS heavier than water\nAnd trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then they yelled at you from the tell a screen\nSwap tell a screen swap tell a screen with what Twitter\nAnd here we are in reality let me read that one more time if you said something unexpected if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you through that tell a screen\nThat he sees that they're not trying to be racist but I started trying to say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who thinks they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black\nLab mix right you want to be black and white they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well if you think the kids it's not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true we may say\nAs a society that we think black faces too far and we'd have to adjust some things but okay but the issue with her asking that question she's saying if it's a good motivation is motivated by racism and therefore shouldn't be treated the same way as she loses her giggle where that I mean\nIt's just completely insane and we are not adults if we can't handle that level of Congress and\nI met who forced to Georgia news network a federal judge expected today to file an injunction ordering the state

socialist nation and they're now on the left pointing that out that we're calling for an end of capitalism\nI mean we've gone we've gone further than just saying yeah were you know we're socialist

to you that this isn't shocking at all\nI think the Democratic party is not doing themselves any favor by by moving way to the left about Obama at the time\nWas seemed like Gehring Lee far west but that's that's about as far left as they really should Barrett to go they really should stay out of all this transgender stuff they should really stay out of this open borders stuff\nThey should stay

program sir how are you\nDoing great thank you very much Glenn\nSo you um [noise] uh you wrote to me last night and I'm not smart enough to understand it uh you said there is a there is a procedure that you're pushing for 'em to hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was that a set of Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they had said the department of homeland security and the department of state suggesting that they work out an agreement\nWith Mexico whereby a or Mexico would require people to enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from or any of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people are coming from\nWith the intent of claiming asylum that they would have to claim asylum in Mexico rather than in the United states\nWould be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada and a rule imposed by the\nEU refugees are arriving in ... countries from Syria in other words when people were fleeing a ... a country that's dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them for some particular racial such a ban on asylum claim\nThey ought to apply for asylum and the first\nCountry they reach that could be potentially save your that should be Mexico\nIsn't that normally\nWhat happens I mean I saw that when you wanted asylum I thought I personally I think the United states government should be running ads do not come to America with your family\nBecause you will be turned away if you were in danger come to the closest to us embassy and apply for asylum\nI mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\nWe ... it should be more like that and that's not really how it works and that ... ... ... these people end up applying for asylum with Mexico they're\nSort of going for the long bomb Hail Mary pass and tried to make it all the way the United states but this jury is itself dangerous this journey itself\nI'm right with opportunities for people to be exploited\nUh it it can exceptionally dangerous journey for many people especially for children and\nFor young women many of whom are sexually assaulted during a churning mhm and a lot of the people claiming asylum turn out not to be able to make the case that they're even eligible for asylum but once\nThey're in the United states it makes it much more difficult to get them back and we think that the asylum application that they're coming by land for Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as they enter Mexico\nI talked to a great guy but the other day and he said that he thought Mexico was working on something with the UN to put some sort of a camp there in Mexico for these refugees have you heard anything about that\nI have not but I\nDon't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a a lot of potential magnet agree for bringing people here\nUm if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the journey from somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become more of a problem\nAgain you you you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is the crisis with the refugees themselves\nHaving to make this long dangerous journey and then knowing that when they get\nHere the odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event at this creates a whole lot of headaches for them in the process\nSo Mike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native ah in Honduras said been following the news or on the caravan here locally\nOr been also a fan of your show watch your show and I have
