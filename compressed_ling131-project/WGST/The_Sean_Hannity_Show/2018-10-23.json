pose it a second I Do have some verbatim as the president was leaving the White House earlier this hour and again bringing up middle Easterners embedded in the caravan John Call from a BBC World news I asked\nAbout this and that if there's any proof and Trump said you know what you should do John go to the middle of the caravan take your cameras in search\nAgain I I I I Can't sit there and say there's any proof of middle Easterners that have infiltrated certainly it's a possibility but I haven't seen anything to suggest that it's actually happened let's go back to ... bill is in Amarillo, Texas bill Iran Schmidt welcome to the program\nI think you have to go ahead bill we don't have a lot of time\nOkay yeah my my point is is with Donald Trump when it's absolutely correct we have to protect solvency about war and it's pretty obvious you keep looking on it to do this you don't want this many miles and have food and water and all the supplies and people running around with new banks new carpet kids\nGetting ridiculous they only want to come across the border and challenge on military let them back from a hundred\n... al ... and lives in a bill I agree with you a I Believe in a show of force I Believe in protecting our borders was I I agree with virtually everything Trump is said\nAnd the threats to Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador I Can't jump on board with the middle eastern claim I don't know if that's a\nFactual but I agree I Want a president that will protect our borders\nAnd let those countries in the people know you just can't watch are more just because you want to come to the United states and you've got the alleged sob stories it doesn't mean we have to open our doors ...\nEvery body so long as we're agreement here folks phones are loaded you want to get back on here will log on to falls again an hour to eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine [noise]\nAnd ... and ... why I say it's curious is because the the caravan ers those that are trying to hit the United states border\nThey are apparently some merrily rejecting\nWhat the Mexicans are offering and the reason why allegedly is they don't believe that they're really being offered a asylum\nA per se they believe that the Mexicans are trying to round them up in order to bend the port them back to their home country of Honduras has\nA ... it's what we should be able to do to them you\nKnow I'm not I'm not arguing I was on I was telling you must be understand\nYeah oh yeah I'm I'm telling you wants to claim is that the Mexicans have offered these caravan ers asylum but those in the caravan are turning down because they want to come to the United states Linda thanks for the call\nAppreciate it Jacob is a next in Birmingham, Alabama Jacob Iran Schmid welcome to the program\nOh thank you very much appreciate your taking my call I'm going to touch base is on the migrants\nHere and um but it's\nIt's a big problem we have on the border um I Believe that Trump's definitely riot act as murder Syria should call up military and stop them from coming in our borders a lot of gang members they're criminals and also people who are getting up one of the important ideas as well as\nDiseases such as polio is the problem though and now in Africa there is a problem with Ebola and after\nI'm not I'm not going to dispute health issues is there's a whole litany of of issues on but the number one thing is we're a sovereign country we have a right to protect our borders and we don't have a free flow or\nAs many Democrats want many progressive as one there's one open their borders just come in everyone just flood or a country that's the main concern you know the unsubstantiated stories or even President Trump pushing to sort of middle Easterners in here and there could be terrorists didn't listen to\nI mean if I put that aside I've seen no proof of that I as far as a\nGang members and criminals in the caravan\nI'm sure there are those with some unsavory records that are in this caravan I think the bulk are law abiding individuals that are looking for a better life I think that there are politics attached and there is an organizational effort here I I I think there's some USA\nSwimming that's that's a at play here but the book I think are not criminals or they want to come to the United states which I guess well I guess what you know I I I'd like a ... a gulfstream gee six fifty jet but doesn't mean I I'm going to get one right\nRight right [noise] but once they get here though they're going to get the benefits and there'll be here that you were a lot of these are not going to have passports what they're here I don't know anything about\nAnd there'll be voting for a Casio Cortez and and Beto O'Rourke a [laughter] than the cook thanks for the call Jacob let's grab us Susan in Texas Susan you're on Schmidt hello\nYeah Hi Susan ... welcome to the program\nThank you thank you for taking my call I'm earning okay concerning the caravan I totally agree with Trump protect our borders protests\nProtect our freedom and all so you're not you're saying that that's our may not be any terrorists and they're okay what are these people carrying in their bag we don't know I mean we know what they're bringing in what\nThe hell we ought to send the TSA guys we're we're we're going to put them through airport screening with the TSA what do you think\nThat I Am [laughter]\nSorry\nStarting they ... they Middle Eastern way American girls have been recruited from you know I ... and then they just like that so I Know\nWell listen I mean have\nTheir bed and again it's been a while but there were a couple of stories where some\nSome teenage girls are from the U.S said a made connections online and they were headed to join that the ISIS harem and then be turned into you know sex slaves or whatever yeah listen I saw the stories but however was if we can instantaneously\nAnd fully make the leap\nThat there must be middle Easterners in this caravan I just I haven't seen I'll be honest here I I just haven't seen any prove to substantiate what the president's cleaning on that front and I went to sway President Trump from using that\nI fully support the president in we're a sovereign nation we need to protect our borders\nThese other countries need to stop their citizens from trying to rush our country and make up the line well they're Fifteen hundred miles away to the U.S border I fully on board with the president on there's a hundred percent but just don't go down\nThe the conspiracy stuff for the you know the the the the angles that are that are unproven bowl and uh come off as being a little willy nilly and little a little crazy thanks for the call Susan gene is next in Florida and punt to go to Jean you're on Schmidt hello\nHey how you doing\nWell go ahead\nWell I don't think they look like poor refugees they may there well dressed they're wearing my shoes backpacks and they're

kids three years old five years old\nThey're all climbing down a ladder suspended by a rope off the bridge connecting one model with Mexico they're being lowered onto a maid shift wouldn't raft with

trust me has not missed the meal I don't know if they've got Jenny Craig or weight watchers down in Honduras but I'm just saying\nI I agree I don't think they're poor wreckage eighth I think they're being paid to come over here [noise]\nAgain there's there is an organizational effort of some sort here I don't know if all of them are part of an organized effort but I mean there's there's just too many suspicious a story repetitions\nAnd to organize something this big they're they're clearly is\nA an organizational effort of of some sort I don't know on what scale but it seems to be fairly large gene thanks let me grab one more before break time how 'bout Murray and South Carolina Marie you're on Schmidt hike\nYeah hey Mr Smith I agree with every color and R K you what\nI Want to say
