Bush or whomever so again I support the president going to Pittsburgh the president\nOn the temple\nThe synagogue\nSays he's my president he's welcomed but you contrast that with the fact that the mayor of Pittsburgh the mayor's name is bill ... do though\nHe wants no part of Trump's chief ... ... I'm not I'm not going to be with Trump I'm not going to be at the airport when he arrives which is pretty standard for mayors and and and dignitaries to appear he says no not going to be there are also the county executive his name is rich Fitzgerald he's not going to be there\nThe governor of Pennsylvania is Tom Wolfe and he will also not meet with Trump and interestingly all of the congressional leaders also declined the ride\nTo attend with the president and first lady so Mitch McConnell\nThe Senate majority leader\nPaul Ryan the outgoing speaker of the house of of course on the Republican side they said no that they did not accept the invite to go and then on the Democratic\nLeadership side Chuck Schumer the Senate minority leader and the Nancy Pelosi or the the the devil leader for the house of representatives of policy\nAnd Schumer also declined\nBut let me before I Move on and we're going to monitor the president when he arrives in if he speaks and we'll bring you audio during the course of the show this I'm telling you right now that this is a Trump damned if you do damned if you don't situation\nPresident Trump deciding to go which again I think is the right thing to do a he's being met with some resistance but again you have the leader of the synagogue that was the center of the attack the target\nThe head of the synagogue you're saying he's my president he's welcome you don't want that to me is what counts the most\nSo if Trump didn't show up it'd be attacked it ah how ... you know he's on Twitter is talking about this and he hasn't gone to Pittsburgh so I think this is a classic example of\nThe president is heading there and he's taken flack and and criticism from individuals but if he didn't go he'd be take the same individuals probably would be saying the same thing about uh just reverse it that can't believe the president is not making a trip so again damned if you do damned if you don't\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine in the nation wide number Iran Schmidt I did see in Pittsburgh media\nThat a Mayor Bill or William for judo the mayor Pittsburgh he wanted President Trump to wait\nSo hold off on his presidential visit until all the funerals had been completed of the victims\nWhich again I mean could the president have done that and made a statement that he's going to wait\nThree hundred of but again I think that in a time of uh of grieving and morning that presidents do make appearances to the best of my recollection on a similar timeframe so I get I I I don't fault the president and I'm guessing that if he didn't show up\nThat he'd be the the subject of criticism and and ridiculed for that I Want her to show today you know Whitey Bolger them the famous uh mobster Whitey Bolger apparently why\nIn a federal locked up in West Virginia he said no home to the players\nAre so in West Virginia and Whitey Bulger he's been moved all over the place very big Boston mobster and then he was on the run for what about sixteen years and he was finally busted at some you know nondescript a condo or a little apartment complex\nIn Santa Monica you know one couple of blocks off the pier I think about a half mile off the the Santa Monica pier so Bolger\nReports habit for multiple sources that he was white in prison by somebody connected with the mob so ... and ... eighty nine years old\n[noise] eighty\nNine and you know Bolger head FBI protection for years because he was an informant so I Wonder if that has to do with\nYou know why he was taken out and did they know that they put them in a facility apparently with some other inmates connected to the mob or ... more is going to come out but not those are the early rumblings so Whitey Bolger taken out which is\nQuite incredible what's the fiduciary responsibility of the federal prison system to protect to a guy like Whitey Bolger\nCertainly caught some

I Am absolutely she's done that where is the outrage [noise]\nAlso is they do points to the un hypocrisy an NBC there is a a Lester Holt story there's a Jimmy Fallon story as both with respect of races decided at one point to go the other way you hold on\nYou know we'll have to wait and see what we do ... still calls from last our birthright will finish up with that in a second I Want to spend just a little more time here on Hillary and the fact that\nAgain if this had been a conservative if this had been a Republican\nOr even other members of the media or even even if it were a I'm a morning liberal member of the media not just you know somebody on the conservative side of the media I Can't imagine one hell what a broken lows\nThe fire the fury the conflict gracious that would ensue if someone suggested like Hillary\nI tried to make light trying to make a joke even in that context to suggest that all black guys look alike really and where is the outrage torn to Hillary Clinton or the interviewer here\nAnd the waivers thing unfolding and then the laughter afterwards\nIf you're unfamiliar if you miss that I played this at the very end of last hour I Want to play it again there was an interview some kind of a ... interview a panel discussion of some type or a monitor this woman in an interview with ... code and the woman's name the interviews name as Kara Swisher about\nIf I'm pronouncing that properly and she\nAsks about uh\nThe comment that was made about encouraging you know Democrats or you know kick Republicans when they go low Eric Holder said that that was on video and audio we played it a couple of weeks back\nAnd the interviewer confused what Eric Holder and said and claimed that it was Cory Booker and then Hillary corrects the interview were from Reed code however\nWhat do you think of ... I had ... start to get to that\n... here and called her ... [laughter] yeah I Know they all look alike I think that\nWas [noise]\nWhoa [noise] so she says oh well done you know Hillary is snickering and laughing you can tell she was trying to make a funny there but\nIf anyone else it made that's funny my God I don't even know what\nYou what would happen\nIf a radio talk shows that said that if they were not fired than they would be boycotted there'd be

a nationwide number ... if you're on hold hang up\nI was talking about race here I Want to just pick up I comment that we have a Lester Holt situations Jimmy Fallon situation we have what happened with Megan Kelly at NBC then we'll go back to your calls here and just admitted so it's been uncovered that Lester Holt\nFor Halloween once dressed as Susan Boyle so Lester Holt has some percentage put on an essentially Lester Holt put on white face\nNBC nightly news is Lester Holt so on the heels of Megan Kelly who didn't own Berkley\nUh say that a black face was\nShe didn't say hey what's wrong with black face a I've got no problem with that I ever wants to be able to do black face if they want first of all I disagree with that and I I'm also offended\nBy the the minstrel show black face and the exaggerations and the the attempt back then to make a black people look are uneducated and stupid I I find that offensive\nAnd I had a conversation with my kids about this and the whole Megan Kelly story we talked about this last week and in fact went to YouTube and you can find some old black and white or Nineteen thirties a minstrel show or or black face acts on YouTube and it's like oh my God\nWith the dialect in just it just the cartoonish it's offensive\nNot Megan Kelly again she didn't put a a seal of approval and say hey what's wrong with black face what she had done and she stepped in it you know a little bit but I don't think she meant that I I don't I'm not a professional Megan Kelly defender here my wife can't stand Megan Kelly\nAh I I don't dislike Megan Kelly but with what happened with her it was not recognizing when she claimed that hey when I was a kid you know if you were put on black face a white face was part of a kind of a costume it was okay\nUm instead of outright condemning it I mean that was more peripheral and look what happened\nTo Megan Kelly and of course ratings were not good and I I think looking for any attempt to try to get out of that deal maybe try to hit it with an ethics violation of ethics clause try to get out of that huge sixty nine million dollar contract but here\nI saw a piece earlier today that\nLester Holt once dressed up as Susan Boyle the singer that won the the British are singing competition and and heralded and and I want to say represented by Simon ... if I'm not mistaken so that occurred Lester Holt dressing up as Susan Boyle some years ago for for Halloween\nOr and then Jimmy Fallon\nEarly Jimmy Fallon once put on some type of a costume which was you know according to this you know some type of a black face uh to to look like Chris Rock\n... so that that's OK\nOr if they're there again there were videos are available of of a Jimmy Fallon and I think even I think even Jimmy Kimmel so both Jimmy's I think you have done something similar\nBut I mean that's that's unbelievable\n\n[noise] so again is there a double standard overt NBC and we'll Megan Kelly use that are in any type of a defense that she has in trying to collect on her sixty nine million dollar deal if NBC is trying to wiggle out of that thing\nIs the bottom line on eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine
