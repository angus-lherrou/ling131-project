that Joe Manchin\nOf West Virginia Democrat very very red state a mansion also as soon as Murkowski or as soon as a Collins finished\nUh as soon as Susan Collins finished uh Joe mansion his office\nOut that he's a yes vote so mansions a yes vote Collins is a yes vote Murkowski is a no vote but she's not native teaser relevant at this point because they have\nThe votes and Kavanaugh will

is the number to get in here on Smith or any aspect your thoughts on Susan Collins your thoughts on the fact that it looks like a cabin on is an absolute shoe in here folks\nAgain it's a it's a fifty one forty nine\nIs the way this thing is is shaping up you know flake or has not determined or hasn't while I'm sure he's determined but he hasn't said which way he's going to flake is most likely going to be a a yes vote so and that we have the interesting case of\nSenator uh [laughter] not a household name for me but we have this this is a really interesting case of\nFits the senator Steve games\nOf Montana who will not be there tomorrow for the floor vote for cabinet because he's going to be walking his daughter down the aisle\nShe's getting married so if his vote is needed and of course listen even as a fifty fifty times if it was fifty fifty then that's when you bring in the president\nOf the Senate or the vice president of the United states and Mike Pence would cast the tie breaker ah which I don't know if that's going to be needed here but as with Danes who are ... he's gonna potentially fly back\nBecause Mitch McConnell can keep the the vote open\nSo if needed Danes who's going to his daughter's wedding to walk down the aisle or right after the wedding he can get on a jet and fly right back and then cast a vote either in the middle of the night or cast a vote or early on Sunday Morning because Mitch McConnell can keep that vote open\nI'd our number eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nAnd again and it looks like Kavanaugh is a done deal\nAfter we witness just an incredible display by Susan Collins and Joe mansion\nOr having the courage to also say based on the evidence and what was presented that he's a yes vote as well\nJoe Manchin Democrat West Virginia incidentally I just saw during the top of the hour news break and ah we're we're going to try to grab this audio as soon as we can turn it around Joe mansion emerging ah from the the Senate floor\nA was a swarm by reporters talking about and he was answering questions I thought a very professionally was answering questions there were a litany of of protesters in ... in the whole\nUh uh you know calling him a sellout they when they were shouting at him\nThey were shame on you shame on you and the the reporters are asking mentioned questions were essentially getting drowned out or you can still hear what was going on but it was just really annoying with the protesters shouting down Joe mansion as he was being interviewed and asking questions\nAfter he left the Senate floor after the uh the announcement from Susan Collins and she was a yes vote on to the phones here and I think we're going to be very very heavy on phones on this remarkable day you know there's another issue that I that I Want to bring up a lot of grab some phones but just to uh to to lay things out here\nUh this is just absolutely disgusting and despicable\nThat Leland Kaiser as Susan Collins brought up on the floor and legal in ties do this friend of Dr Ford that doesn't know Brett Kavanaugh cannot recall the incident there's a report that came out last night\nFrom the wall Street Journal and I've got I've got the wall Street Journal piece right here a friend of Dr Ford felt pressure to uh read visited her statement so the report is here that Leland Kaiser was pressured\nBy that very good friend of Dr Ford that Monica McLean to change her statement on the allegation that is tantamount to ah to witness tampering here I Want an investigation on that\nOh Monica ... claim that name sounds familiar\nWell Monica McLean is the retired FBI agent and friend of Dr Ford who are former boy for I told you about this earlier this week a former boyfriend of Dr Ford for six years claimed that he had witnessed\nDr Ford coach this Monica McLean on how to pass a polygraph\nAnd I remember that boyfriend a former boyfriend set a whole lot more out of fear of flying and and I never mentioned sexual assault I mean there's a whole bunch of things we went over all that early in the way that significance where I Want to go into that coming up a little bit

I'm originally from Bangor Maine grew up in little city ah exactly where ... lived in a spent\nA Ninety percent of our time when she was in Maine and I got to tell ya oh from the heart that I I mean I I definitely don't always necessarily agree with her political views\nBut that is the woman that is the truth senator from Maine that you thought today and that that's how you treat the the people in our community that's how she treated us as a kid when we saw her it was very accessible and you know even at her\nShe was just like that at St Mary's Catholic Church in Bangor and I got to tell you I'm I was very happy to see how is it called a\nA presented her case today I mean you're dead on it probably got to go down as one of the best speeches ah and ah in arguments in American history I mean just tremendous and Brett Kavanaugh uh definitely needs to be on the Supreme\nCourt well he's he's got the votes at this point I thought Susan Collins did the state of Maine and incredible service today and uh Ryan it's great insight from you or knowing Collins a growing up essential now are you how how old are you are you near the same age\nI Know I'm almost forty so called grew up in

me just incredibly proud of a Susan Collins from his home state so ah any aspect listen if you're on the other side of his argument\nIf you're one of the individuals that just flat out\nAlready convicted Brett Kavanaugh with ... zeroes proof and even the names supplied by Dr Ford that cannot can firmer corroborate the story and then we find out that this legal in Kaiser\nThat they tried to co worse or they they try to get her to change or ah or testimony essentially a to the FBI\nIncredible like eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine gets you on Schmidt eight hundred three

of the absolute best\nMr President I Will vote chickens for judge Kavanaugh\n[noise]\n\n\nNo [noise]\nI some of the other audio bites on a plane now we do have\nThe Joe Manchin audio or this or just being too was a mansion was shouted down by protesters this happened after the uh the the Senate floor impassioned speech by and fact filled impassioned speech\nBy Susan Collins on why she was going to be a cabinet ... yes vote so let's listen in to this\nMansion leaving the Senate floor is obviously swarmed by reporters it was within seconds a of a Collins finishing that his office tweeted\nThat Joe mansion Democrat West Virginia will also be a yes vote on Kavanaugh and here are reporters questioning him and then the protesters in the whole way of the U.S said just trying to drown him out try
