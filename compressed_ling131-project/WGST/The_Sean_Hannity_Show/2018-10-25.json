New York studios I Walk by the CNN\nTime Warner center every day I just went by there just a little while ago I Walk by not fifty eighth street is back open the\nNorth side of the street which is on fifty eight straight and just before Columbus Circle and that's where the the curve Time Warner building is that's where the CNN New York operations are and you know hop off the train and Columbus Circle there and I walk right to you know right\nOn the outside of that building there's a there's a subway stairs that come up right there and then it depends which entrance and I I use different entrances depending on the day if I Want to stop that gets me so uh but I literally walk right by the CNN\nA Time Warner center just a short time ago and the media's all over the place hey another reason to follow me on Twitter 'cause when something like this happens obviously I'm going to opine I'm going to tweet in this case I was just right there so I uh took a whole bunch of pictures and I tweeted pictures out\nIn fact [laughter] to the you know what this is the the you know this is right here\nThis is a fish will CNN pipe bomb incident police NYPD caution tape it is for sale if you'd like to buy vis caution tape a highest better right now eight hundred eight\nZero one eighty nine Ninety nine this is from the event folks or or maybe I'll just put it up on me but I'm kidding around it but if not for sale I'm joking but ... this is from the events and all that you did you are destroyed police property that you take down some of the caution tape\nNo this was in the street because they pushed the perimeter back\nSeveral times and this apparently was up and\nThen they pulled it down because they stand the perimeter when the N. Y. T. a PD bomb disposal truck when they were leaving I order when they were bringing the bomb out the the pipe bomb or the suspicious package\nI was listening back to the level of city block I mean it would probably blow somebody's face off\nA and and their fingers in the hands off but if if it were if if the viable bombing and authorities have said that at least the George Soros bomb was viable but now this was in history and I didn't rip it down but not this is real this is official a police ah NYPD cautions have\nFrom the incident which I collected just a little while ago\nSo now I did take a couple of pictures those are on my Twitter feed again you ought to follow me on Twitter folks at Todd sniffed\nMy Twitter is ... T. O. D. D. S. C. H. N. I. T. T. N. as in November Todd Schmidt at touch on it because I took several pictures of the media throngs and actually if you were watching cable news earlier\nThere was a the bomb disposal truck that was parked in to a doorway into a an inference garage or that goes into the underground parking area and the service area of the time Warner center and I walked by that every day\nAnd that's where the bomb disposal truck was that side of history there's still blocked off but I was able to walk on the south side on fifty eighth street or on the ah the south side of the time Warner center and I took some pictures again I tweeted all these out and they're on my Twitter feed\nAt Todd snip AT T O D day at the age and I teach the now I suppose already loaded we'll go to phones here in just a bit I Want to go over the facts as we know them I'm looking at\nThe the current rundown of who got suspicious packages now this goes back to yesterday and the George Soros story and I said flat out I said loud and clear on that show that I the poor George sources politics\nThe money he spends a the ideas he tries to a push and foment I don't like George Soros said oh I don't want any injury or ill will or hurt to come to George Soros I can still be vehemently opposed to his political strategies and ideas and his\nActivism at is funding but I don't want the guy blown up by a pipe bomb nor do I want any of his staff\nAnd that's why I was very clear on yesterday's program that there is no place no role whatsoever for whoever put this and George Soros his mailbox\nIn northern Westchester county in New York that I Hope that they are apprehended and brought to justice and then of course here we are twenty four hours later and we're discussing all these other pipe bombs which authorities believe that it's all related\nNow the interesting thing on the sorrows pipe bomb I came to mind none of these have detonated\nAnd that's incredible and you know as far as this ought to be a treasure trove of clues I mean even if they did explode there should be a ton of clues on these on that NATO's bombs in packages that hopefully authorities will be able to hone in on\nWhoever did this and we'll go over those details in just a second but with the Soros package there are numerous reports that they believe that that package might have been home delivered and place it as a mailbox\nSo I mean that bring somebody maybe to the scene or is it a career or what was the actual bomb major was it some do that was just pained to deliver a package you know who knows\nBut I have the liver and then we have what happened today so the Soros a package that we have what was delivered to CNN which caused this huge evacuation of the CNN New York headquarters at Columbus Circle and a fifty eighth and fifty nights for\nA\n... this this ... this this building is a humongous building restaurants and shops there there's more there's a giant whole foods in the basement of the time Warner center which is a zoo I Would avoid that one at all costs by the way\nYou've got CNN with their studios it's just a a lot of activity you've got residential and the time Warner center so you've got a hotel vi is it the Mandarin is is on me the north side I mean the places a gigantic complex they used to be the old New York coliseum\nWhich was abandoned in shuttered and for years I used to walk by that\nWhen I used to work at W. P. O. J. radio back in Nineteen Ninety One and Nineteen Ninety two I used to live right down the street\nSo it's a beautiful complex so CNN or they get this package but the curious thing on the CNN package it was addressed to John Brennan\nFormer CIA director John Brennan very outspoken very critical of President Trump but the issue is here John Brennan does not work for CNN\nJohn Brennan is contracted to MSNBC and remember when he had a security clearance strip by President Obama or by uh by President Trump brother he had his security clearance I was a big story so it was intentional or when was this just a goof up\nSo to to send the pipe bomb to John Brennan care\nOf CNN at ten Columbus Circle of New York New York one double o two three whenever there's a ... over there I you know that that was was it a goof\nThat was that a a a mistake because if they were trying to set the John Brennan a trip and care of M. S. N. B. C. and not CNN\nAlso in the pack himself to CNN and John Brennan there's also some kind of a white powder in an envelope so not only the explosive device but also some type of\nWhite powder then another package was sent to Hillary Clinton explosive device was sent to the Clinton residents in chapter ... also west Chester county not far from Soros\nAnd that was in throughout a intercepted by the secret service member rock Obama\nA was sent to his Washington DC residents upper rock Obama was also the recipients of one of these explosive devices as well on the latest now is Maxine Waters aid package was intercepted at the congressional mail facility\nAnd that was apparently address the Maxine Waters are very outspoken we you know we don't need to go over a you know her issues and problems\nUh Eric Holder and this is where things get even more interesting\nThere was a report that Eric Holder and got a suspicious package and Debbie Wasserman Schultz got a suspicious package\nThe deal [noise] [noise] yeah the package was addressed to Eric Holder\nPeople in New York City will not be intimidated that we're going to go about our lives undeterred the very concept of terrorism to

Jerry Jerry listen uh is the president responsible and I'm I chastising of I ... as you know I voted for Trump I don't always agree with Trump\nAnd I'm not afraid on this show is the conservative

as you know the the congressmen in the body slamming I spoke out against that that they have the gene forte rally in Montana\nAnd I I don't think that it's funny to make fun of that that was that was a battery and that's and that's not that's not funny but again I'm not willing to suggest that the the president because\nHe has been unconventional or he is a fomenting anger and riled up crowds\nAnd he's turned crowds against ah the opposite side or the media market to even jump on the possibility yet that the Trump causes this individual to send these ah these pipe bombs in the mail or have them delivered Jerry thanks for the call let's go to Boise idaho\nAnd Frank Frank you're next on Schmidt hello\nHello Frank here yeah I I just wanted to make a point that none of these people's sorrows

at attention that's all I see from it and that's really all I have to say\nWell Frank Frank was a good point and because you're right I don't think SARS is going out to collect his mail order or the Clintons so if these devices went off most likely or it could have affected and hurt whatever help for employee they have\nUnless it was put in a pile and then the Clinton's did open up the mail but I

again I'm not jumping on any theory I'm not making any suggestion of what's happened with is obviously some sick though that is mailing these devices or having them a courier or hand delivered\nAnd you know the these are devices that were or or the device was originally sent the first one was George Soros yesterday then we have\nCNN evacuation of Time Warner centric Columbus Circle in New York City in Manhattan\nAnd that was addressed the John Brennan at CNN\nBut of course John Brennan is a paid contributor to MSNBC so uh they got the network wrong a package sent to bill and Hillary

eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine will go to phones right now again thanks for your patients everyone held on eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of course the series which again I'm not jumping on any bandwagon here but I'll tell you when people are talking about\nThat the Democrats have done this or a Democrat or a liberal sympathetic to democratic causes\nAn anti Trump a Democrat has done this as a false flag so then Republicans or conservative or a Trump praying supporter can be blamed or did I did a Trump supporter do this in target Democrats\nAnd of course the other area of talking point is that well what do you expect Trump is is fomenting this violence on Trump's discourse and are these rallies that he's holding at AOL calling the media the enemy of the people\nOf folks come on I mean to suggest something is simplistic is that that that causes someone to do this\nThat's preposterous now I Wish that Trump would tone down their rhetoric I sat on day one\nThat man he had a whole lot of ... going on during the the campaigning I now turn it off I stick to your guns follow your policies which I I like the president's policies\nAnd I wanted them to become more presidential obviously as he does he ah you know went on with the job and certainly I I Wish he would have changed as some of the tenor\nAnd some of the discourse\nBecause he he wants the president I mean you know you don't you don't have to be a campaign mode just get your agenda done\nAnd you can do that while not being as predictable and becoming a little more presidential but again I Am not at all comfortable with suggesting that oh Trump cause the pipe bombs because ah he wants people beat monopoly he talks about the media being the end of the people give me a break\nSo I'm jumping on that bandwagon a eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine nationwide number here on ... back to the phones and let's let's do a long chunk of calls here riches next in white plains New York rich Iran ... and I\nTried to disagree with you on two fronts were [laughter]\nFirst of all you know I think it's perfectly within the realm of possibility that Trump's rhetoric could inspire somebody to do this you're saying you know the the way you frame it is that that this is absolutely are chain that there hasn't been anybody as a noxious ... as president\nI'm as Trump in history okay and on the other front with regard to the Democrats being or a Democrat sympathizer\nBeing responsible for the bombs I think that's within the realm of possibility just by virtue of fact we're so close less than two weeks away from a major election\nSo rich as I said I've laid out everything you just said I laid out what everyone is discussing or the realm of possibilities here on who the purposes with these pipe bombs but I'm not going to jump on any particular theory I'll discuss what the possibilities are but it's too early just let the\nThat's the gay shouldn't happen yet but I mean yuletide everyone likes to get and if you don't do it I guess you know that guy I mean it really think it's a coincidence that these things happened less than two weeks before major election I don't believe in coincidence is like that\nThough I listen to how about the Access Hollywood tape being leaked just a couple of weeks before the election a little between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump back in twenty ... I don't believe in coincidence is and I'm sure whoever did this was trying to disrupt the process but again we have no idea who this is\nThere is a slew of possibilities on what their intentions motivations are what drove them what inspired them at this point I don't know rich thanks for the call let's go to California now Robert is in Ventura hello Robert Iran Smith\nHello good afternoon\nI'm I'm fairly convinced that this is happening just because of the elections coming up and I guarantee you sorrow Feinstein the last minute ... they absolutely know what's going on and I guarantee you are over ... none of them\nWould explode they they know what that is that I'm wrong I supposed to end it no more than most people don't mail this whole thing you one hundred percent on the Democratic side of the tickets\nAre sold this you think this is a ploy before the election done by Democrats not unless you really suggesting that the Dianne Feinstein knew of this\nShe knew she knew what she was doing the last minute captain all\nHung on on the lives lost their lives you know ... ... ... ... Robert there's no doubt about it and I\nStood on top of this microphone and yelled at firing of Dianne Feinstein was disgusting and despicable the way that went down with Kevin all you know holding on to that information\nOn the major was leaked was that don't even get me started on it again I deplore what she does what she did what she stands for for the most part but Robert what I'm saying is\nAre you you're suggesting that Dianne Feinstein had you had knowledge of of this this plots\nAnd that's all money in the realm of the senators\nAnd what she represents knows what's going on one of those people whether it's Obama that was it was that was sent you George saw somebody behind there's no guarantee we won't find out who does it we will not find out in ...\nOh I think we're going to find that I think there's going to be enough trace evidence they're going to be able to find a common thread it's going to be something\nSilly that they overlooked I think the purpose is going to be fat I I Am guessing there was going to be an arrest in this matter but to suggest that any elected Democrat\nWho um you know ... for the most part uh ideologically on the complete opposite side of the spectrum is these individuals I Can't sit here and say that yeah I'm sure it's a foregone conclusion that some senator congressional Democrats knew about this plot\nTo to make things more sympathetic toward the Democrats by having some high profile Democrats get pipe bombs in the mail two weeks prior to the electric Robert I I Can't subscribe to that thanks for the ... or ... with all all all Robert ... well ... all around and what was that\nWas sort of holding look what look what happened to Hillary Clinton I elect to look at the FBI ... that the the the oj\nI get less that Robert ... I understand but like you go\nYeah listen I I just I don't put mailing pipe bombs to Democrats or to CNN and John ... I don't put that in the same boat as you know certainly so things have happened to Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump prior to the electric eight hundred and eight year old one eighty nine Ninety nine
