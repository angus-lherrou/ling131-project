C. H. N. I. T. T. as an end not an M ... some say Schmidt but it's not it's Schmidt S. C. H. N. I. T. T. I. so I found it a second if you're on hold thanks for your patients\nI mean it's wrap up with a couple of things here and again uh some of these tweets okay so\nYou're a sixteen down in Florida now is what we're hearing in Florida so it's jumped by nine and Florida apparently we'll get to a will get into more details here and just a moment to stand by ah as far as ah the tweet it\nFor the back and forth tweeting and also some mainstream media commentary and then we'll grab your phone calls here\nSo Elizabeth Warren is now trying to a play on the Trump arena as Trump has been a whole different type of president obviously\nA with his tactics of labeling people in and using name calling and and just being you know a whole different type of commander in chief and so that's one central we got him elected\nA and a that's a lot of what Trump's audience expects so Elizabeth Warren is not try to play in this\nArena so she tweets outs\nWe all know why at real Donald Trump makes creepy physical threats about me right\nHe's scared he's trying to do what he always does the women whose scare him\nCall us names attack us personally ... shrink us down to feel better about himself\nIt may soon his ego but it does it work or it won't work is what she says and then she has I mean literally if you look at her a lizard live for ... so Elizabeth for Massachusetts this is her campaign Twitter account not her Senator Warren account there are\nAn entire string of tweet after tweet after queen or just a going after Trump's so [noise] I\nPick them up play out of his playbook with the tweeting and in your face tactics so she's giving that a world even though the whole DNA thing has completely backfired I mean when you lose you know MSNBC hosts when you lose someone like Craig Melvin\nWho they're starting to integrate and use more on the today show on the the big NBC network but Craig Melvin yesterday was kind of mocking the whole deal and said that I might be just as Native American is she as well you know is\nWhat we have some other issues with that which we'll talk about and just a second because now uh some experts are saying wait a minute\nIf she Native American at all oh no I'll I'll bring you that little quiz here in just a moment\n[noise] so the president's with Elizabeth Warren and is back firing whole DNA deal and her tweets trying to get aggressive and then from his face the president has tweeted\nPocahontas the bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed\nTook a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth far less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her DNA test is useless even they don't want her finally exclamation point\nUh now that her claims of being of Indian heritage of turned out to be a scam an ally Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetuating this fraud against the American people\nI have some audio here and I got I got to take this up and I if I I think I have a chewed up yeah I Do like this is Oklahoma Republican U.S representative mark Wayne Mullen and he is a member of the Cherokee Nation\nAnd he was on Fox and friends this morning and listen to this\nBut it is extremely disappointed when she's out there claiming that she's Native American just because she's from Oklahoma and look there was a twenty four teams study scientific study and they said that average European American walking around his point one eight percent Native American she's half\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on this why is the most disgusting thing to me is the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and I it is backfiring on her and I I'm Glad to see it because she what she needs to come out and apologize to all of a slow\nSo there's a U.S Republican congressman member of the Cherokee Nation ally backfired apologized to us all\nHey Elizabeth Warren is that what you had in mind I don't think so a race in America couple of stories I Want to get to in just a moment a former reason last week or so

not we'll push calls off to our number two coming up in just a minute I wanted to talk about a couple of these racial stories and the last week or so has delivered a a trifecta of stories that I found interesting\nNot last week there was the incident where in the Atlanta area\nCops were called because there was a black male driving around a couple of white kids are six and a ten year old and cops were called because someone said oh man it's just black guy abducting the white kids or the white kids okay turns out that the guy is the babysitter [laughter]\nAnd the parents can believe in a trusted babysitter who is a black guy babysitting the white kids so that the turn down his videos it's you know it was a ... that was last week crazy incident and then we have to others\nWhere we have video one of them\nIs corner store Caroline and this has made some national lose a circuit activity a big in the New York area it happened in Brooklyn and well one of these bodega is one of these corner stores or bodega markets a common all over a New York\nAnd a mother was in there with her nine year old son Jeremiah\nAnd this woman French sound accuses the nine year old kid of grabbing her but\nIn fact you know the the audio is ... ... and she's captured on the phone calling nine one one telling the nine one one dispatcher this can't just grab my ass and she sent like fine time she's telling nine one one\nFolks the nine year old and the woman is white this corner store Caroline who's ah her name is actually Theresa suit climb a she's white the mother and the kid are black it turns out the kid didn't grab her bought\nStore surveillance video shows that the kid walks by a she's kind of bent over the counter or or leaning on the counter and the kitten walks by and as he walks by kind of turns to his mom and his backpack he's wearing a nine year old kitty school backpack his backpack\nGrazed her but he was completely unaware never grab so that's turned into an incident and then we have this story out of St Louis Missouri Hillary Mohler who is a a young white woman who actually looks like Amy Schumer a little bit of it's kind of bizarre\nBut I also want to say\nThat she has not experience any advantage by claiming to be a Native American because they have not had an advantage here in the United states\nAs a matter of fact it was under the Obama administration that they decided to try to rectify the fact that the United states government has never honored contracts with Native Americans that they had written\nA you know Elizabeth ... Elizabeth Elizabeth I I I I don't want to hold dissertation here all his with the the question I have for\nYou is do you think that Elizabeth Warren made a grave political Arab by trying to play off this DNA test and she was caught with deceived by a mission and has become a laughing as we know laughing stock because really\nNow I Do not I do not because she does have some Native American blood in her\nWhen we don't know but even the even the even the Cherokee Nation as saying that there is no way to distinguish whether its North American or South America and she could be some it'll parole beginning Indian descended\nWants to be white now they don't want to be copper ore Bryan and\nElizabeth you clearly have an agenda here are so obviously Trump has your vote and twenty twenty right\nNow at them [laughter] Lauren it's smarter than\nHe [laughter] [laughter] oh yeah I like and I I Do you like your like your like socialism right that you like socialism\nThat no one of the first thing that Donald Trump did was got rid of the restrictions that were on the oil people from contaminating the water supply in the Native American lands Donald Trump doesn't care about human beings area you care about\nYou know what I think you want to you want to jump on the Tonya anything you want to do something like a you remember George W. Bush doesn't care about black people you you you want to say something like that Donald Trump doesn't care about Native American people\nSo Elizabeth thanks for the call and he clearly you know you have an agenda but I I I heard you out I'll let you speak a lot by moving on let's read Darcy\nIn Michigan Darcy you're on Schmidt welcome to the program I\nWas when I\nI don't know you call me what can you tell me\nI just want to talk about the ... position senator facts and here's I'm a Vietnam veteran fallacy\nAnalysts reporters are native Indian fellow I Believe the equivalent of each other\nAs our commission commissioners omission all the more liquid loose of each other and I just don't listen to anybody in point that\nWell I'll tell you we don't want to be really special Darcy what would be amazing is their Blumenthal had claimed that he was actually\nA Vietnam veteran member of like the Apache pride that would have made the Blumenthal lie even better thanks for the call Vivian is in Austin, Texas you're on Schmidt welcome\nHi I just wanted to comment\nAbout Elizabeth Warren\nI had forty eight percent Native American in may period\nAnd I'm not getting on my big tall building carrying on all of auditing using that as a weapon in fact I never have second I Want her and people with the Democratic party like pull out to sea and humor\nAnd Maxine Waters and many other let the Democratic party is because people are Elizabeth Warren\nGood guy we don't need people like that period in our country I feel very strongly and yes I live in Austin, Texas but that's not making me a Democrat because of what I have a against me\nHello\nVivian I can tell you're fired up I thought that your comments were\nWere well thought out well stated and it sounds like she's insulting you it sounds like that that her that her attempt to a layoff I told you so I has insulted you it it's uh\nDid you ask someone that actually has almost fifty percent Native American\nExactly and and let her know that that's why I left the Democratic party I no longer want any part of it because it's crazy people like this had been warned not the water and\nAnd I can go on and on and on the map and you knew what race had allowed them to do with race of everything you're fired on ...\nOn than Trump a hundred percent a hundred percent and will continue to do so\nWell very and it's been a pleasure talking to you know I Want to we just have a call from Ohio we just had a lizard ... you know I'm thinking maybe I I should like conference call you too that's what I should've done conference call a lizard but it's always defending a Elizabeth Warren from Ohio or the caller from Ohio\nAnd uh I I should a conference call those so that would have been like a a a phenomenal cat fight on radio that would've been a fantastic spectacle hey our living room one more call here then I got to move all we got a lot of ground to cover today Troy is in Traverse City in Michigan Hello Troy you're on the net welcome\nA job that you're taking my call while I all live in Elizabeth Warren at the moment that they open up Pandora's box ... jump the shark on this one and we could look back at the time\nThey're making the whole ... of the check the box in the college admission and affirmative action this is all gonna backfire beyond backfire at the clock themselves that racial weapon I ... and victim would end the call 'em on it and then you're a racist and then they get called back\nAnd then they're going to come back with this go why doesn't justify who quantification pleased to get into these university a show on the lunar the the ... the entire system is going to crash down from that I feel\nHey let me add something because the Elizabeth Warren DNA tests that whole backfire which really is unraveled honor and unraveled fast\nA low point is that wasn't really that was in a democratic consortium per se that wasn't part of a democratic strategy she injured herself\nShe took her bow and arrow [laughter] she she unilaterally shot herself so that wasn't 'cause the point is is that even many Democrats\nOr liberal sympathizers or mainstream media democratic sympathizers or calling her out and saying that old she stepped in it so that really that wasn't a concerted a plan by Democrats with a a a target\nTactic none of that was her team that was her advisors or maybe hurt maybe she overall I'd love to know I'd love to have been a fly on the wall inside her political advisors her campaign folks\nYou know those that she trusts and bounce ideas off of since clearly she's going to make a run for the president's seat for the Democratic nomination and twenty twenty\nI'd love to know if they all were like oh yeah it was just great let's go forward or if there were some that try to overrule her and then she ended up over ruling her but it was ...
