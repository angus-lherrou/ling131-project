I'm a white male and I am not a big terrorist threat\nHas he apologized for this yet anyway let me give me some of factual backgrounds here let me just take a moment before we move on so during the toss and that's where a Chris Cuomo ends his show and then throws it to Don Lemon\nThey do a little back and forth banter I guess I I don't watch call though I don't watch Don Lemon in fact uh I don't watch a lot of the the nighttime a fair I'm you know I'm having dinner with the family and we're watching some entertainment stuff you know I've been doing this all day long\nSo okay sue thank you [laughter]\nSuicidal peanut gallery comment if I say it all the peanut allergies these days diamond said peanut gallery was that offensive I get to get my wrists slapped they do know is the peanut free zone I so I and I understand yes it's deadly for some and you know the whole allergen thing really just kinda\nAccelerated rapidly over the last what ten Fifteen Years or so anyway back to Don Lemon and Chris call those so almost hard to get the lemon and this is what Don Lemon actually said on CNN this was Monday Night I'm\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest ... in this country is white men most of them radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\n[laughter] just gave her real biggest terrorist ... what about most on the right what what about the maniac that shot up the the baseball practice in northern Virginia where Steve ... was almost killed and we'll walk with a limp\nAnd a need for assistance with devices I Would imagine for a long time if not the rest of his life I mean really\nIt was a unless the he was a liberal targeting Republicans was I'm not going to go down the list here employees Don Lemon that was an offensive\nIgnorant Rahm is comment that you made and I'm Wondering if he's going to address it or if he has addressed that uh to correct it started don't be stupid statement I I Want to get into another serious matter and you know the discourse in this country\n[noise] and I just want to tease those 'cause I'll get into this in a little bit of all just following stuff but the discourse of his country is getting horrifically toxic I mean I Know I mean we get a lot of it here on the program you know some of the phone calls we get hey guess what folks I got a death threat today\n... that's right I I got a death threat today\nSo I get a call from a management at our flagship station this morning someone called in and I'm going to share this I was debating whether I was going to share this or not but but I but I Am going to share this morning at my local flagship station\nA call comes in during the morning show and some creepy sounding color says or something to the fact tonight\nTodd Schmidt is going to die\n\nThe the guy hung up and of course authorities were contacted and and managed\nWent and our flagship in Tampa you know called authorities or talk to the the Tampa police department and you know they're working on the case and we have you know engineering methods in and phone line tracing capability so ...\nI I was debating whether I was gonna mentioned it but I think it's important to mention because of the toxicity that is occurring\nOn so many levels whether it's talk radio whether it's television on on all sides I mean you've got Don Lemon calling white men the biggest terrorist threat in the United states\nThe what is happening here folks is a slow motion or medium motion unraveling\nOf American society and I don't want to watch this I don't want to witness this the environment is getting extremely toxic it has been for some time it's not getting better\nIt's getting worse you know in ...

not nuclear but you know conventional wars obviously still happened but what is happening behind the scenes is\nHas dangerous on on certain levels\nAnd that is trying to destroy us instead of attacking us head on with a armament and proves there's an attack that happening in this country\nAn information level\nAnd the Russians the Chinese the box than you've heard about\nTheir sowing

just don't know if people understand the depth and this was the number that's fascinating\nSo we have the president's\nMaking the caravan of a big mid term election issue as I said I'm On the president's side with the caravan of stress it's unacceptable that a group of thousands and thousands of people\nFrom a ... and whatever else was clinging on along the way\nA but mostly Hondurans it's unacceptable they think they can just get into a a big group of people a caravan is what it's called and decide they're coming to the United states were marching to the U.S or in some cases the reports that\nThey're being busted than walking but then they're getting on buses and driven but I I don't know to what extent that's occurring because you know there's still quite a way off I mean they're not going to be here for quite some time and the caravan the bulk of it apparently is still around a thousand miles away but the president\nHas made this big mid term issue\nAnd listen I understand I mean the the less they make their issues are election uh you know of a model tough cocktails as well they toss their their info bombs are as well as it happens on both sides of the aisle here\nBut here's the issue the discussion of the migrant caravans and\nThe different opinions on the Caribbean and some are downright nasty\nI it turns out and this is what's a standing that last week sixty percent and this is the issue of social media\nLast week said and foreign interference sixty percent of the caravan conversation on Twitter\nWas driven by bots sixty percent\nAnd I'm telling you right now that this is the kind of thing that the Russians have their hands all over it's finding these divisive wage issues to rip apart the fabric of\nCamaraderie or a unity or you know what we believe in as Americans it's to drive this this spike this steak and to to really separate us and social media is a platform to reach even deeper and it's just another avenue\nAnd you have so many people that clean and are so into social media whether it is Facebook or Twitter or other social media sites that it's another tool that can be used to drive us apart and I'm telling you\nThey're trying to rip us apart from within and what I say they I'm I'm Talking about foreign governments like Russia and China there's no doubt about it you know even a few largely agree with the wave of the

you look at what happened two days ago to the Mexican military and the dangers of people they're not coming into our country back on\nI Do the president\nTaking some reporters' questions as he was on the law the White House heading over the marine one all the way to Ambrose to grab the air force one flight down to Florida a couple of comments here\nBecause the president was asked or is he fear mongering with regard to the caravan and is it an election wedge issue is he throwing red meat at his base but the ... of course there is a some a political aspects\nOf use all using issues this close to mid term I'm not going to deny that but also pro did not create the caravan\nThis microwave assembly of individuals saying they're coming to the United states amassing by the thousands and moving and Mr Reginald be up there for a wage still\nThey did this prompted notch this wasn't a a a ploy on a plan to to drum up propaganda\nThey decided that this was an organized and we we've gotten into we've talked about the organization and who's behind the organization of this and no it's not the Democrat is not George Soros per se he's been involved in you know some of these micro groups in the past\nBut you know we've had some names attached that we've talked about and I I don't want to re litigate that the fact is Trump did not create the caravan they've a simple they said they're moving here there are coming into the country\nSo why should the president of the United states react to a migrant caravan you know those that are saying oh they're not the boogie\nMan I guess you know Shepard Smith\nOn Fox News or I don't dislike Shepard Smith and there were times where I agree with shepherd Smith and he does a toll on the line of all the other Fox commentators are which sometimes I think are a\nBit ridiculous I think that sometimes you know some of the Fox folks are just too far off Trump's asked and they don't have the ... to be used college because the care of and by the way 'cause they understand the war and they don't you know they they were afraid to call out Trump what Trump is being done\nYou know the truth allegory if Trump is wrong on something\nAnd sometime Shepard Smith does I don't always agree with ... but but there are times like you know what good for him you know I said something similar because I'm sitting here by this microphone every day I'm calling balls and strikes as I see whether you agree with me or disagree with me\nListen and figure it out as I go along\nWith the fact is that I agree with Trump I a hundred percent agree that you have to take a stand he got like the Caribbean no they're not coming you\nIf you've got a stock the border with support troops\nAnd it seems like we're going up\nOr from the fifty two hundred it seems that the president the safe to say something\nThat uh up to Fifteen thousand troops are going to be said to the border so I was able to glean that I think the president said up to Fifteen thousand\nMight be stationed at the border of course the logistics of support roles are not an actively or you know a barricade again keeping these migrants from coming into the country but Shepard Smith you know he had said\nNo the migrant care whether they're not they're not coming to get you this is not a Halloween pool I listen I I I don't want to trivialize it like that too I think the caravan is coming to the United states to you know invade your house and to ... I don't\nI don't think that's the Iron Chef is correct in that but still we're a country of laws were a sovereign nation that has all the right\nAttacked our border and the president is one hundred percent right but it is it's his duty as the president to make sure this doesn't\nHappen I mean we have\nAn audio bite of of Obama back before he was president he was Senator Obama from Illinois and he was talking about you have to immigrate to this country legally\nOr you can't just a bar John in Obama's said this and I I don't want to plug for the year I'm sick and tired of a double standard\nSo on this Trump is one hundred percent right\nAnd as far as you know it's a lot of this a caravan and don't be scared of them was again I'm not scared of the caravan I just want our laws and our borders protected that's all I'm asking for\nAnd the president was asked by reporters as he fear mongering\nEllis I Do I think that the caravan is rife with all kinds of bad actors and do I think the Boulder or there are many MS Thirteen gang members or Middle Eastern terrorists I don't think that's the case\nBut can't set a ... you don't and I ... I don't even use that as an argument it's just we we're a sovereign nation should be able to protect our borders and you just can't bash in our back door and say I'm coming\nIn that's what I Would stick with it or not drum up you know some of the bad actors\nThat have infiltrated the allegedly other care of it we have all the right to defend regardless of you know if they're all good people just want to come to the United states well\nGuess what you just can't snap your fingers and Sam coming in so I I don't\nThink the president is really fear mongering I just don't think he needs to talk about the you know all of the bad element which I I think he's exaggerating a little bit\nI and as far as I and I was talking about I see the phones were jammed up here again a eight hundred eight zero one eighty I still give them a Halloween pile eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine is how you get on the program and then regarding his commentary and again I joined the press or a little late as we're coming on the air at six minutes past the hour as the syndicated radio shows do\nA and the president was was talking about the DACA apparently and that if President Obama could a centrally uh bring us DACA by executive order that the president can cancel birthright\nWhich the fourteenth amendment provides for via executive order and I from from my standpoint I'm not a legal expert and I'm not a lawyer and my wife has a and I've got lots of lawyer pounds here I've done a lot of reading on this obviously the last couple of days and I I just don't you can't compare\nThe fourteenth amendment and taking what's in the fourteenth amendment and trying to issue an executive order I don't know I I don't think you you can't compare that\nTo dock I think you're dealing with two different types of produce here apples and oranges\nAre however again I I I agree I don't like the anchor baby situation I don't like illegals coming into this country\nI and and a woman dropping a kid out of nowhere and suddenly that kids a U.S citizen I'm Sorry I don't think our founding fathers I had that in mind\nWith that with that said was that said\nLet me be very clear I think that the president if he does issue an executive order essentially turning the off switch on elements of provisions of the fourteenth amendment it's going to be ruled unconstitutional the constitution allows for it\nOr do I agree with it uh in all senses no ill illegals coming into the country and having a Ken I'm Sorry I don't think that kid ought to be a US citizen automatically\nBut the way our constitution and the amendment the fourteenth amendment to the constitution is written it allows this I don't agree with it\nAnd if Trump does try to pull the executive order it's going to be shot down or in in the federal court system it's going to be shot down on the federal court level the appeals level and ultimately the Supreme Court level I'm just telling you the way it is\nAn eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number here on Schmidt eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you want to get on we'll go to the phones coming up in a bit I've got the Halloween pile but of course Trump just breaking news with him making comments to reporter so I wanted to jump in\nWith uh the caravan and the fourteenth amendment debate which are obviously we ... we handled extensively on yesterday's program\nThe Schmidt rules on momentarily and I'll hang up from my Halloween ...
