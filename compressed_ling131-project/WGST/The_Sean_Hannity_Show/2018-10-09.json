{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "And this is a forest this is a sham gave me a break I I mean you look at the primary accuser you'll walk at Dr ... Ford and the people who she supplied as witnesses or those with the greatest amount of knowledge even one of her friends\nCould not come from her story and in fact never even met Brett Kavanaugh\nI saw the whole thing started to fall apart but again I was chastised a so how many calls I wasn't I ... I've got no problem if I say something controversial I have no food no problem polling callers on this program that disagree with me\nCall me this call me that call me names they assume I executive producer\nSo quick question on friday the twenty eighth when I said hey guess what this flight don't get picked off folks a flake is not siding with the Democrats per se here I think flake just did the cabinet favor I said that Jeff Flake\nSame the cabinet nomination so how many calls as executive produced a deal remember as soon as my phone screen as well about how many calls did I put on folks who are angry at\nMe screaming at me right yeah ... said she had a couple of dozen calls and how many made it to air that we're able to take a right yeah right oh aren't yet as soon as soon as\nSoon as says she says she had over four dozen calls it was screaming at me watch do not always Schmidt why is he agreed that the one we pause because they didn't have the votes it was the one we pause that brought Susan Collins into the fold and was enabling\nCollins to deliver that I'm believable speeds on friday\nThat it was amazing it was incredible and remember also\nAnd this is what's amazing even President Trump Pence said okay I he's OK with the the the pause button the White House the White House signals and from signal that they were OK with the one week FBI investigation because why ladies and gentlemen\nThey knew the votes weren't there just so says she's screened or talk to over four dozen callers that was screaming at me what's the matter with you said what are you talking about why you allowing the Democrats because that was the catalyst that was the only path forward\nThe delay the pause that brought Susan Collins into the fold and that one and also brought a fleet flake was going to be a yes vote\nThat got Kavanaugh confirmed with out it toast\nNo go whether he was going to be re nominated or Trump was going to come up with a new nomination we don't have to worry about that now but all those were possibilities\nSo I was I have no problem with folks yelling at me but I Want the record to show that ultimately I was correct and I'm sure my other or cohorts and talk radio we're probably not saying what I was saying I'm sure they'll do with the mob mentality rule when in fact\nTake the emotion out and look at it more as a strategic play and that's what I\nTodd Smith did on this very program\nAnd I feel great about it and listen I don't want to brag about it that's not my style I'm not the bragging time [laughter] [laughter] I'm just making it really really clear a welcome to the program folks and of course uh you know I got some of the staff here\nOn a premium Supreme Court a confirmation vote some of the tallies going back you know\nA number of years

what's the status ah I I I miss the intermediate at two PM well let me bring up the the latest fear because you know and on talking about a wind speed and and all the facts I meant I was\nA sand again yeah yeah so we're\nWe're we're out of a low category one was tropical storm Michael so now we're at a low category one according to my my team over here\nAnd I I just want all of the folks along the Florida Panhandle\nTo have all of the warnings because the projection\nAnd you know they've gotten good as far as tracking for the most part I clearly a jobs is way that way there was the or encourages\nBut they've gotten much better at the corps projection versus intensity projection I mean look what happened in the Carolinas that was supposed to belt the the the shores of category for it did not\nAnd of course of the intensity was much less there are calling for a major hurricane here a category three\nTo whack into the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday night and the difference here folks isn't for all of those affected along the pan handle you know from the Alabama line and across the Florida Panhandle to the big band where the state makes that turn\nUp you have to listen and he the warning we hear a storm surge could be intense and the time to prepare\nIs nowhere near as long as it typically is with the previous hurricanes that head toward the United states there's typically you know watching as the motors through the Caribbean and he gets here and ... and it's just it's a slow steady path\nAnd with this it's much different because of the late formation right or you know all the Yucatan Peninsula it's already right in the Gulf of Mexico so the amount of time that you have to prepare is\nCut I mean dramatically it's cut by like Ninety percent\n[laughter] those are my numbers but that's the way you know I I'm an vision so you have to ... you really ought to be in full blown preparation mode as this is going to be a Wednesday afternoon to Wednesday evening event so you don't have as much time and I just employed or my Florida Panhandle listeners\nPlease take he'd take warning and\nThen the projection on the track

but as far as this this horrific limousine this a stretch SUV crash\nIn New York state now where this happened is a place called sky Harry and sky Harry and I think I've been through there is about forty miles to the west of Albany and when you think about twenty people dead Eighteen andme a limo\nSeventeen passengers limo driver that's Eighteen died in a limo and then to people\nOutside of this farm stand a restaurant now we're in the parking lot at the wrong place at the wrong time for a total death toll\nOf Eighteen people the governor of New York who I Am not a fan of at all obviously I find them to be quite an in Brazil actually bought a he had said and I the politics out of the equation I just you know I'm not a not a Cuomo fan or obviously\nBut he had said earlier today the limo had recently failed its inspection\nAnd this vehicle should not have been on the road\nAnd all and that the driver did not have the correct endorsement he didn't have a limo license so I and the limo company\nApparently has a litany of issues where vehicles have been taken out of service due to inspection issues\nAnd their problems are multiple times the national average from limousine companies with a number of problems they had just just an awful awful story and as I was telling you before a not a tweet but a text message\nFrom one of the deceased\nInside this limo or turns out that uh she sent the text message to a relative that the vehicle was in terrible condition this was prior to the crash just awful now as far as my little speech here\nI don't know why people drop their guard\nFor whatever reason people will get into the back of limousines and one is this feeling of inherent safety that oh we're not going to have a car crash there's not going to be an accident don't need to put my seatbelt done I don't know what it is but it's not just limousines\nIt's also people that ride in taxis\nPeople that ride in the you know ... for instance or a Juno wars you know some of the other uh you know v is some of the other uh you know car come in a nationwide is pretty much all Britain lift but you've got some places that are that have some of these other young up and coming services as well why is it hey I'm Bob Simon\nThe CBS News corresponded sixty minutes Bob Simon\nHe died in New York City a couple of years back Bob Simon was in the back of one of those little black cars you know the Lincoln town car services and he was in an accident he was in the backseat didn't have a seat belt on\nWhy is it the people that there's a false sense of security when you ride in the back but especially I feel that when people get him to liberate cars\nTaxis or over type vehicles limos that oh what changes\nWhen you get in your car\nIn the front seat or the passenger seat buckle up most people buckle up but there is this this this dropping of people's guard when they get into certain vehicles and I was mentioned Bob Simon from CBS News he got into a a one of these black car limos\nIt's home state on Saturday he wasn't president or Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or was not at a winning a she was the lone Republican who voted against cloture to end debate\nOn friday and you know at the last bit of she offered a little bit of an olive branch to Republicans ah she ended up voting present ... instead of no against Kavanaugh and when Murkowski voted present\nWell that was more of an an optics thing so if Kavanaugh was not confirmed by just one single vote since Danes was that his daughter's wedding and was not there to vote yes you know the last time and this is where I Want to look at these stats here\nThe last time that a justice was confirmed by that slim of a margin was in a team in eighty one wins family Matthews was confirmed twenty four to twenty three\nAnd even Clarence Thomas going back to Nineteen Ninety One after the whole Anita Hill affair Clarence Thomas was voted in with a former vote margin\nSo that's the way that Kavanaugh ended at a fifty to forty eight\nVice president Mike Pence see did preside over the vote because the vice President Biden states is the president of the U.S Senate and he was there as a tie breaker if needed but again you know he was constantly interrupted by these of noxious screaming mean these\nAre protesting yeah they were they were going off like depth charges it was like every you know it was like a what a what a building is demolished and the charges are are staggered\nI've yeah these protesters daisy chain staggered and one would scream they'd be hauled out and then they get going again another word starts screaming and then rinse and repeat it just happened over and over again or\nThe president tweeted a and for Fifteen PM so the the confirmation happened in the Trump tweeted I applied to congratulate the U.S Senate for confirming our great nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court later today all scientists commission of appointment and he'll be officially sworn in very exciting\nAnd he was sworn in using a family Bible by chief justice John Roberts and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy was there at that private ceremony because Kavanaugh uh obviously clerked for Kennedy also replacing Kennedy now some of the confirmation vote tallies going back\nTo uh the last well we'll we'll go back to a certain number of years here will go back to the seventies\n[noise] uh
