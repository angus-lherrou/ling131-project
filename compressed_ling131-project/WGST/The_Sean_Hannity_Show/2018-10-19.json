couple of tweets here\nFrom the president today I'm watching the Democratic party led because they want to open borders than existing week laws assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras\nAnd El

said that is in dispute here\nIn addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seemed to have almost no control of the population I must and the strongest of terms asked Mexico just stop

not listen\nA Trump also try to preserve the arms deal I get it I understand that but\nAgain you got to put a human decency above all else theater and Mike Pence the vice president is clearly taking a little tougher than ah than the president right now but it was this administration and Trump is going to end up doing the right thing here I\nI don't know I don't know what the ultimate\nStory from

eighty nine Ninety nine but the news is very fluid and break runners that's why we're spending a lot of time on it\nOr the president of the southern border I Want to pick up where I left off 'cause I got to the end of last hour I Want to just address is a little more and again the threat from President Trump to send the military to seal off the southern border\nBecause of this uh Iran flocks and the inability for Mexico to stop ... Guatemalans et cetera uh those from El Salvador from coming\nThrough Central America into Mexico and then trying to get into the United states first of all these countries need to stop this\nEl Salvador Honduras Guatemala they need to stop this and then the Mexicans the Mexican government certainly can do a hell of a lot more if their respective governments where these people are\nI mean from can't stop them all the Mexicans can certainly do a hell of a lot more\n[noise] and we have this this humongous caravan you've got an estimated four thousand Central Americans on the way through Mexico to the United states they don't have these is\nThey don't have American Express cards they don't a master car they don't even have diners club\nAnd they're headed to the United states they say they think so they don't have any travel documents so the president is talking about sealing the border the president is talking about setting the military to seal the border\nAre talking about threatening to cancel a U.S payments including humanitarian aid to these countries like Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador\n[noise] you know the stance that we have the U.S border agents have arrested six team thousand six hundred and fifty eight at the border in just the last well just September you know like last month\nOver six team and a half thousand to arrest that is the highest one mom total on record\nOh they've clearly doing their job\nThat shows in eighty percent increase in the number of illegal aliens illegal immigrant families tried to cross our border\nSince Trump ended the policy of separating parents from their minor children\nSo it's climbing higher so the policy and I never thought the separation of the kids was a good idea and the administration even said not a good idea and the Trump kids have said yeah that wasn't a good idea Milan is that not a good idea\nPresident Trump has acknowledged that that wasn't a good idea I tell you what though I and others I don't support that I think that you want to keep them together but let them know you're not getting into the United states\nBut I Can't look the other way of the night of the fact that once the policy was officially ended here we have the numbers skyrocketing the number of ended at sixteen thousand six hundred fifty eight busted\nBy immigration officials here us a of a you know bordering customs agents\nSixteen thousand six hundred and fifty interests in September and of course that's after the policy was ended so it wasn't that policy obviously kept a little more white now they're saying oh let's when I got to get separate let's go let's give it a shot\nAnd was going on here and I said this is not a good situation but it is a fight that President Trump likes and yet this is being used as a rallying cry and this is a total based gender upper\nArea it's a ... sounds like a soft drink doesn't it hey you want to generate rubber so or maybe it's a ... maybe it's a stimulant it's it's such a great drug general upper uh but no this is again the Trump position which is the correct position will also help the juice up\nThe base I as we head into the mid term elections here\nAnd President Trump has been advising Republicans to make immigration a key election issue and it should be\nAnd he blames Democrats entirely for existing border problems you know Republicans have been a as you know ridiculously gun shy due to the fallout from\nThe zero tolerance policy that produced you know all that video and this sob stories of kids living in barracks without their parents buy fences\nAnd again you know we gave that same narrative it's it's like a pamphlet was being handed out what to say what the claim oh a drug\nGangs are threatening my family and me and if my kids don't joined they're going to kill them they're going to kill me we got to come to America\nYou know it's the same narrative and their own reading virtually the same script\nHad eight hundred three eight zero one

of homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nOne person familiar with the manager said Bolton criticize Nielsen a former Kelly deputy a whom he advocated to replace him after the department of homeland security trumps sided with Bolton\nThe person said which may once again start speculation that Kelly\nJohn Kelly chief of staff will soon the part the White House Trump has lately express

because I don't think it's serious and trying to make you laugh as a relief from the stress and aggravation of how frustrating those things are\nReally helped me because I mean that the real fear or how they're trying to just trample over everything the fat on it get on it you have to let you do and I will tell you [noise] the inability\nTo mark the things that go on in this country is the greatest weakness we have in the greatest\nAsset the left pass is the most comedians are naturally liberal\nAnd if a comedian is funny they know how to take things and make you laugh at them and in the midst of that laughing they're shaping your views\nAre problem is a lot of people who are middle America conservatives have no sense of humor\nAnd they have the mistaken belief\nThat if there is a serious topic you don't laugh at it because of laughing at it means you're not serious and they need to be serious so we're real good at pound the table serious all the ... man very serious no laughter know funny\nOkay\nThe left will take that or anything else we do and make a joke about it and make no mistake is no laughing matter\nThey are shaping minds when they do that they are changing minds if you can get someone to laugh you can insert in the middle of a comedic routine you can insert a very powerful political opinion\nMight be outside where they were already\nAnd get them to experiment with it and potentially make it their own but\nWe don't do that we pound the table and just keep repeating the same thing over and over you know laugh no funny no funding no laugh we don't laugh laughing is not good because if we laugh we are not serious and we have to be serious because these are serious times a serious issues but you fatigue people over a period of time\nAnd that's
