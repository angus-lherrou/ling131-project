from the White House lots of ground to cover folks back to the phones let's hit fill is\nOn Long Island in New York Phyllis Iran Schmidt welcome to the program I\nThank you very much I just find to say that the optics of a Trump going to the rally may not have been good\nAt it is not as bad as about that going to play golf after Daniel heroin they had it and after James Foley was they had it and then he went and got the after four Americans for ...\nSo that was not good\n[laughter] well listen I I Know that when an event happens with Trump we can go back and look at you know there's been any previous criticism and\n... this the the tit for tat back and forth it's it's going to go on there'll be comparisons it always happens regardless of who the president was or use whether it was Obama and comparing him to Bush or Clinton or whomever\nSo it it's always going to happen you know one of the things that has have given the Trump critics a little bit of animal here feel is\nIs that back in November of twenty twelve Trump actually tweeted out or his displeasure\nBecause uh he tweeted that yesterday Obama campaign was Jay Z and ... and spray steam while Hurricane Sandy victims across New York and New Jersey are still decimated by Sandy wrong\nOr exclamation point so you know Trump even he tried to tag Obama for campaigning with Bruce Springsteen and rapper Jay Z or in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy and of course superstorm storm Sandy which I did a lot of damage in New York and New Jersey\nYeah\nSo you can see it go it goes both ways so I went with Trump going to the rally you can understand that his critics really criticize him when in fact he did something similar by criticizing Obama\nYes I think okay fine thank you very much\nWell thank you very much for the call I appreciate Brian is next Brian is in a beautiful Tampa Bay Florida Brian you're on Schmidt hello [noise]\n... it's strange to me how the press treats meetings with Trump in tiny west like he's meeting with potent are some world leaders that she only bizarre thing I think about all I think she's a friend a Trump whatever but\nWhy get so much press and Tanya is got to understand that they're just waiting for Trump to say something or him to the to slip up and say something that is that they don't\nReally care what Conway has to say\nNo I don't think I I I think you're right I don't think they care what Kanye West that's to say however uh what is the press or you know especially with the Trump presidency what what is the press waiting for what\nWhat uh what do they have the best thing that if they're waiting for them is when\nI never listened to his music you're right that I I never listen to music or anything but I did think is is statement on\nUh how did it go uh they they were talking about slavery and the slavery you know been on for ten years or something he says it sounds like a choice to me and I thought that was just\nFascinating and I never really thought about that but it's it's just like you know you're Jewish I mean you know there was times where there was five or ten thousand a Jewish folks there they could overcome the guards you know some sometimes you got to just make the move and break free and I think\nLike Bryant Bryant Bryant as far as far as you know you're ... you're suggesting that that uh during the Holocaust city in the concentration camps that the Jews there could have overpowered the guards in these concentration camps when that's\nNot that don't get me wrong yeah you're you're my buddy I I'm just I'm thinking if I was there and\nYou you and I went there [laughter] we want to get something going\nYou know well let's talk by by any means well isn't it it's a hindsight\nIs always twenty twenty number one but also a lot of the Jews were deceived they they they didn't always know what they were in store for granted a last week we can talk about the Holocaust for a a weeks straight on the program but yeah the the fact that he had\nIt was all all all ... us\nYou know you add a s S. guards you know with machine guns I you know it's not it's a lot easier to say oh yeah they should have risen up and overthrowing the guards I listen to it it's a lot easier said than done\nYeah I was in a bank robbery about Fifteen Years\nBut I Am right buddy saying 'cause it turned out the guy only had a a pellet gun you know what I was crossing a black guy yeah now whether or not that I was shocked I [laughter] this way I said you were you would have probably you know you're Nate in in your ... and I almost that also and there was an ex police officer and the bank to and then you get scared when there's a\nGuy so they'll get I get the spin it around on your your your criticizing Jews for not rising up and actually I had a\nGuy thing I I'm I'm just I'm just saying that that that I think that at some point you know slavery whatever becomes a light I think he's saying that becomes a lifestyle and you just gotta always resisted constant region is trying\nAnd I again I\nDon't subscribe to that the slaves or could have prevented their plight I mean there's a lot to discuss regarding slavery as well we don't have the time but one last thing before I let you go where was this bank robbery that you were in Fifteen Years ago that was\nThe Miami it used to be a you know a daily thing back in\nThe eighties so my question and my question is this how many people were in the bank other than the bank robber\nUh probably three or four towers only about ten or eleven folks and maybe five or six out in the you know on the other side of the\nThings okay so let's do that doesn't people against was one bank robber why you guys rise up have a nice day Brian pre shared a let's ... in Austin, Texas them you're on the net go
