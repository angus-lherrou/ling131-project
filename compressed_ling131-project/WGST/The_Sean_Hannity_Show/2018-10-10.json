{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Now poll we saw that ... D intensification of Florence Florence was supposed to smash the Carolina coast and a cat for it ended up as a cat one you're not seeing those factors which could mitigate the intensity\nOr I really don't I mean the difference here is is that it's going to make landfall in about twenty four hours and right now it's in a it's an intensification stage\nSo even if nothing happened it made landfall as a hundred and ten mile on our hurricane that's still a pretty big deal I'm you know I I Would think there's a higher chance of being a three or four that is a one or two but you know we've learned over the years the intensity forecasting is not perfect\nAnd I think regardless of the cat number two three four it's going to be a really big deal for the pan handle\nPotentially catastrophic and or if you're familiar with kind of the vegetation up in that part of the state it's a lot different than it is here in Tampa Bay is just a lot more trees\nA it's a different climate and there's going to be just widespread power outages that could last days weeks maybe a month or so in some places and then\nIt's not just to be a coastal Florida thing that's going to move into Georgia and the Carolinas and bring some wind issues and power outages this is not going to be just the state of Florida storm it'll continue moving northeast up towards North Carolina\nAnd Paul I know you're in a tight schedule doing whether graphics for your for five and six PM a cast a storm surge now if you couldn't let let's direct this directly in my listeners that are on the the the Florida Gulf Coast in the pan handle the Panama City listeners those to the ease those or to the west\nA let's talk storm surge protectors are potentially eight to twelve feet of storm surge and of course that can be deadly\nYeah and that's always an eight to twelve feet a Indian past his to cedar key\nUm even here even here we've had we've had high water around Tampa Bay and there's been some flooding are way down towards Naples or what some high water she got to think of of the Gulf of Mexico as being like a big bath tub\nBecause it's almost close close circle and that water when it began slashing\nAlong our coast really piles up a ... it's a whole different set up here on the Gulf of Mexico than it is on the Atlantic side when the water is deeper into the water off the coast of the panhandle in off our west coast is pretty shallow and it really piles up quickly so on our west coast storm surge\nIs the big problem up in the big band and the panhandle storm surge it's wind and it's and it's rained so that's that's how that's\nGoing to play out and I saw in the Tampa Bay area which is my back yard 'cause my home is you know is right on Tampa Bay a tuna for the and I I you know I don't know if we'll see much really that will affect us but\nI you know I just I feel for the people in the panhandle right now if you want to do as as a a well trained a meteorologist who's dealt with the hurricane activity for decades Paul what do you say to my listeners that are in this path\nOr to the east and west to Panama City beach\nOr the water always wins don't don't ever try to fight the water because the water will end up in places you never think the water is going to go if you're told to evacuate\nGet out I mean there's always the chance and it happens a lot that you can leave and the next day is as I probably should have stayed but trust me it's it's not worth\nA try to ride out a storm on the coast especially a storm of this magnitude if you're told to leave just find someplace away from the water again you're evacuating from water you're not evacuating from when\nYou got to get away from the water the only time you're evacuating from wind is if you live in a mobile home and there's a chance to your mobile home can be compromised you've just gotta get away from the water the water by far is the number one killer when it comes to\nHurricanes and Paul last thing here I'm timeline we're looking at about this time tomorrow\nYeah to get bad late tonight and then tomorrow will make landfall a and then it'll move inland but it's not going to be just a quick deal it's going to the impacts are going to be far ranging and we'll be doing stories of storm damage in Georgia South Carolina North Carolina but obviously\nA it'll be worse where the storm does make landfall and you know Panama City beach is pretty built up now there's a lot of lot of stuff up there that wasn't there ten Fifteen Years ago and and a lot of stuff literally sets on the Gulf of Mexico\nI'm driven right by so I see all the buildings on the construction on the high rises though the motel the hotels and and then the condo so I'm driven right along\nThe road there right adjacent to the beach and uh if we can call this a lighter note did you see that the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office issued a press pass warning to Jim ... of the\nWeather I doubt it I saw that tweet that's kind of funny or you know they yeah he's yeah he does a great job and and you know the thing is you know you when he when he shows up your your town you know the stuff getting real yeah\nAnd and that's the point is it's it ingests there was more of a a joke from the Santa Rosa accounting for the sheriff's office they don't want you can't totally their nose when Jim shows up it's it's going to be bad typically I\nCome down in the summer just don't come down in September and October\n... that's that's what they said Paul Paul delegate into chief meteorologist on Fox Thirteen and Tampa Bay Florida Paula thanks we'll talk to you soon OK buddy have a good ...\nThanks so there we haven't uh again I Want to take this time out on my national program\nAnd also let let's keep in mind that a lot of the oil platforms have shut down and evacuated in the Gulf of Mexico so you're saying you know if you're in Las Vegas our why does this concern me or if you're up in the Pacific northwest you know one or or Minnesota why why should I care about this well one of the reasons\nIs this does have the potential to push up\nA gas prices because\nYou've had a whole series of the oil\nAnd gas so natural gas and oil producing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico\nOr have been evacuated so a lot of\nThe production staff have been taken off of these platforms in production has been shut down and over the years we've seen that that has had an effect on oil prices which in turn will ah Jack up the prices at the pump\nAnd of course we know that the market looked for any reason to raise prices whether it's a Texas crude whether it's you know a gasoline futures whatever\nI'm sure the the prices are already rising it at the pump so that's why the whole country you know needs to be aware that it's not just you know the impact of the storm itself but there is an economic impact in many cases for the whole country when we have these storms because of\nThe oil production in the Gulf of Mexico so again a semi Florida listeners\nOn the the the northern ah a part of the Gulf of Mexico in the Florida Panhandle please heed all warnings were going to follow this we have a lot of ground to cover today or next I Want to get into Nikki Haley so why did Nikki Haley\nResigned as you know if you're a regular listener I I have a a great affection for Nikki Haley I thought she did a wonderful job is to South Carolina governor I've got a lot of friends in the low country and and uh and upstate in in South Carolina Evelyn I really love Nikki Haley and then as UN ambassador\nShe's done a fantastic job again uh another thing that Trump is done right is\nIs you know announcing pretty seriously hey there's a new sheriff in town here and we the United states we're not going to get beaten up any longer by the United nations and the bulk of the countries in the UN that that hate us\nA it's America first I had no issue with that that's not code for anything America ... at first and white supremacy you know someone's gonna say America First that's that's code for white supremacy that is that's BS\nI don't care what color you are I don't care what religion you are I don't care what floats your boat in this country if you're an American citizen you oughta want America ...\nMichael's expected to make landfall on the Florida Panhandle sometime tomorrow afternoon forecasters say life threatening storm

zero one eighty nine Ninety nine nationwide number here on shit you want to get in\nRegarding the breaking Nikki Haley news from earlier today [noise] eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine we will if you're on hold that Nikki Haley will get to your calls here in just a moment so why did this\nIs there more than the story on why she resigned yeah many people think that there are a couple of factors that potentially are at play here out one of the factors is she wants to make some money\nYou know you look at what she's made as far as uh in in South Carolina politics on them as the south Carolina Governor and now as the U.S ambassador to the United nations uh Nikki Haley has earning potential\nUh clearly far greater or in the private sector then she does in in public service and you know looking at some of the research that's available online\nI if you look at her a twenty Eighteen financial information that was officially disclosed\nShe has a you know outstanding debt\nA\nCredit card debt between twenty five thousand in sixty five thousand dollars there is a mortgage\nA of more than a million dollars\nAnd there's also a line of credit between two hundred and fifty in five hundred thousand dollars and with kids college age going to the question is is Nikki Haley\nAre energized to hop into the private sector and\nMake a big score I mean she a clearly will have any number of options available to her in any variety of fortune five hundred companies or a board seats I mean she has a chance to make a lot of money and certainly clear all that debt and\nAnd have a whole lot more additional income so is that the reason is Nikki Haley\nReady to parlay her experience you know prior to running for president on the Republican ticket in twenty twenty four which I think will happen or is she ready to take the next let's say five or six years\nAnd try to rack up some pointed ... I think that\nThat does make sense to me I some of the other possibilities are some of the other rumblings unwind Nikki Haley is calling it quits that it might be some pressure from within\nI don't know if this is as likely as the monetary suggestion but some are suggesting and floating that are hard liners inside the administration like a Mike Pompeo secretary of State John Bolton national security advisor\nThat well they don't see her as enough of a hard line or could there have been a push again we don't know the whole story well there will be leaks or will there be additional information surfaces on why did Nikki Haley really lived and who knows\nBut these are the the ideas that are being a rumbled about being talked about\nAnd uh\nYou know of course you know running for president in twenty twenty four ah she's not going to challenge Trump those that say oh she's going to try to primary Trump in twenty twenty I I don't see that happening I think twenty twenty four is likely and\nWould believe that she want to maintain the visibility inside the administration for as long as possible uh on the national stage if she wanted to go in and try to parlay that into a potential run and twenty twenty four I for me\nFor me the the most likely scenario is trying to use the next five plus years to make some serious calling to make a over seven figures a year which I think she can easily make\nI'll hang up and listen to your response\nWas on a ... you know most of those names are all you know potential you know or ... or obviously who has announced that you know he's he's splitting we know that he's he's going\nTo do with Trey Gowdy make a good uh attorney general I think the one I think Trey Gowdy as an excellent and brilliant legal mind I I I wouldn't wouldn't a problem with that\n[noise] ah yeah the Lindsey Graham thing here is to be a non starter but you know who knows people say no but then your approach to join a presidential cabinet and who knows what the endgame would would potentially be let's go to Laurie in Danbury, Connecticut hello Laurie you're on Schmitz\nHi Matt I'm going to go and ...

Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump that was also before we were able to listen in on the president of the if the president this of this tape started rolling on the networks are before we started our

nations are but I Believe that he brought up\nA you know any you know some some nepotism issues and of course he'd be accused yeah I don't think the optics would be great even you know Jared Kushner\nWho for whatever reason Nikki Haley\nWe did fee praised Jared Kushner was that unilateral or was there some discussion that hey could you give a juror to a nice little uh embrace on the way out I I don't know\nNot not quite sure what the detail is there but let's listen to some of Nikki Haley uh at the White House ah Oval Office spray where it was officially announced that she was

they\nThrough with that but then if you look at these two years of the last one point three billion and the un fight we made it stronger we made it more [noise]\nSouth Sudan we got an arms embargo

that from Nikki Haley's hard I mean or was there any prompting I mean they dress it sounds like there is a um a sort of um a push here or there laying the groundwork that's what it sounds like\nFor new expanded roles for Jared Kushner\nIs is that or this is headed Jared Kushner a hit ingenious that nobody under ... don't want to understand is what she said\nThat's quite incredible you know listen a real ramping up on Nikki Haley here I mean she's one of the few traditional Republicans\nWho has thrived inside this White House she's a hawk probably\nMore so than the president you know Nikki Haley all you know really kind of comes out of the the near ... school\nAnd that's that's not an insult 'cause I think she she does it very very well but Nikki Haley's her hawkish instincts have server or served her very well they've served the president very well her hawkish instincts I have served you and me this country\nVery well during her tenure at the United nations [noise] she took Trump's mandates she made them her own she boosted Trump's credibility on the world stage in the process\nBut we've all seen as delivered tough and much needed speeches that Martin Sheen Russia even
