to go view this in this skiff this a sensitive information room or in a in the Senate building\n[noise] it's uh I I Want to suggest have multiple copies inside the skiffs\nSo there's one copy and there are some ... complains that the time slots to view have filled up and\nUh you know some of the center is might not even get to see them till tomorrow afternoon or whatever the story is I think that I Would have provided multiple copies to get this and again not to leave the skiff and to have a full accountability for all of the pages\nSo nothing is take is full Loni is one of the senators

little more freely and a little more quickly\nYou know it has prompted our top security officials here in the United states\nAnd I can even see the video in my head in the last six months or maybe last year of a top\nMilitary officials being questioned on Capitol Hill asking will you own a Z. T. E. or a hallway device in just down the line they all said nope nope nope no absolutely not\n[noise] and now we have a new company to add to the mix here by the way oh wow way or the CSI team makes a cell phones and there was even a Porsche at some of the PX or some of the the the military exchanges\nWhere some of these phones are Huawei or Z. T. summers equipment is being sold there was a move to get those phones out of the bases out of the exchanges\nSo ah they were sold to military officers are enlisted a at the naval exchanges are military exchange the PX is a a around the country and and or even overseas\nBut in this story from Bloomberg is just really amazing and it has to do\nWith a mother board specialist called super micro and the details here are are really just riveting so the Bloomberg reports that the U.S based\nServer mother board company called super micro was apparently\nInfiltrated in China with some of these boards so all of a U.S base the mother boards were being produced in China\nAnd you had government spy connected groups that was able to interject interfere infiltrate the manufacturing process all these mother boards and put a tiny little chip in to the circuit\nIn to the mother board I mean this is this is you can't just do this overnight just had a a you know they had to be engineering here and and did ability to do this so they infiltrated the supply chain\nOf super micro\nAnd the Chinese production facilities and his little Biddy chip was being put on to these uh these boards these mother boards for the service now the tip they said was the size of a grain of rice or a pencil tip and those mother boards ended up in servers here in the United states so with that\nThe Bloomberg report says that the Chinese military spy agencies government they were able to have an access point in two companies systems that have these servers and they were able to potentially steal intellectual property anything confidential\nI mean there's just shows the extent that the Chinese will go\nTo steal from us\nThey are decades ahead that's why David van so quickly or a technology wise military wise because they rip the world off they didn't do it on their own they stole the Chinese government\nThey are the haves and may have stolen I'm sure hundreds and hundreds of billions and intellectual property and this is just another example\nOf having a tiny little Biddy chip the size of a of a grain of rice or a pencil tip installed on these mother boards for servers and then being used in here in the United states and around the world and in major corporations\nWow a stealth doorway that would allow these China operatives to control these devices or have a back door to get whatever information they wanted\nSo once the program with these little chance once this was discovered our government we spied on the spies\nThat were behind the placement of the chips\nThat's how this thing and I started to unravel a the story also talks about the chips are were discovered and\nReported to our fans to the FBI\nBy Amazon and this is also and then we'll we'll wrap it up for grabs and calls here\nSo Amazon Amazon dot com they're the ones that initially had discovered that a whole bunch of their servers were compromised with these chips and the way this thing was found out\nThis is incredible and ... and the reason why this is important is because Amazon it's not just ordering cramp online that shows up in a prime box and your doorstep\nIn two days it's not just Amazon also provides\nA they have these data centers and they they supply a cloud computing storage for a major corporations for the federal government our agencies are using Amazon so Amazon discovered they had an Amazon figure it out and this is what also to me it's fascinating so Amazon\nThey alerted the FBI why because\nAmazon was looking to acquire a streaming video company so Amazon with all of their uh expansion into streaming video\nThey were looking at a company called elemental technologies\nAs a possible acquisition because Amazon was expanding obviously it's streaming video services and Amazon Prime video et cetera so\nElemental national security contracts weren't the main reason for the proposed accusation because of this nice fit Amazon's governmental business and just their their technology et cetera and you know the the the\nOut in the Amazon Services uh and uh it it ... says to help with due diligence or\nAmazon or eight dollars us which was overseeing the perspective acquisition hired a third party company to scrutinize elemental security\nAnd a mental apparently on this elemental they're based in Portland, Oregon in Oregon they\nHad some special software for pressing huge video files they help stream the Olympic Games online so that's part of on multiple levels why Amazon fault that acquiring this elemental might have been a very good fit so here's what happened\nWith due diligence on Amazon hired a third party to look at this elemental companies security\nAccording to one person familiar with the process according to the Bloomberg report the first pass uncovered troubling issue is prompting eight of us to take a closer look an elemental main product the extensive servers that customers installed in their networks to handle this video compression\nThe servers were assembled for elemental by super might grow computer the San jose based company but there are parts and boards were being made in China that's where the infiltration happened that's where the Chinese government the communist Chinese were putting these little chips on the boards to gain access to these companies\nWe've got the Russians situation today seven Russian
