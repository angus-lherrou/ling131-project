{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Uh he ... are you familiar with it at all\nI'm not familiar with the article I Know what Kanye West was speaking to okay\nAwesome and in the article about act on it said it ... it either way late that is what he he three I Love that word\nThat's really the black community thing parking lot well he does that way\nWhere he is he he later clarified that as amending his statement and let me explain for anyone at home was wondering what we're talking about Kanye West has called for abolishing the thirteenth ... that was those were the words he used\nThat it's not exactly what he meant to say\nAnd um I I think that the group of people who let Morocco bomb and get away with saying I'm that he visited fifty seven states should recognize that sometimes you misspeak when you're making a statement what he meant\nBy this is that there is a provision in the thirteenth amendment that allows it's not actually slavery\nThe thirteenth amendment reads neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United states or anyplace subjects their jurisdiction\nThat was the meat of the thirteenth amendment\nHowever it doesn't just read neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United states\nIt actually reads neither slavery nor involuntary servitude comma except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted\nShall exist so there's a carve out it's not really a carve out to slavery is a carve out\nTo involuntary servitude the concept of involuntary servitude is requiring someone to provide labor against their wishes labor that they don't want to provide\nWell if someone's in prison and you say go bust some rocks or go plant some things are do make some license plates I don't want to make license place well it's not for you to decide\nWhat you're not even paying me for it no I'm not now go make license plates\nHow does the state have the power to do that the thirteenth amendment has a carve out and says you can require someone to engage in labor in work\nThat they don't want to engage in for which you do not pay them that's involuntary servitude right it's not really slavery in the traditional sense\nBut you can make someone do work they don't want to\nDo if it's part of punishment for a crime and they were duly convicted\nSo they've had their due process they had their opportunity to mount a defense if they melt that defense and a jury of their peers convicts them\nThen as part of their punishment process you can make them do work that they don't want to do\n... bigger issue has been prison reform and criminal justice reform and believe it or not he's on to something we have created in this country over the last fifty years an entire criminal class\nWe have created an explosive growth in the outsourcing of criminal justice we have created an explosive growth in the size of the criminal justice a apparatus whether it\nBe the the the um the straw or whatever the machine that you blow into before you can start your car be shocked how much money those businesses are making now because everybody has to have one all the counseling that people are being sent to the council you know everybody's getting a psychology degree now\nA because it's easy to go to college and get a psychology degree it's probably the easiest degree and be\nBecause we have all this court mandated counseling everybody has to go to counseling as as part of a whatever they've done wrong you've got to go sit and talk to a counselor\nWhat Conyers point is well taken which is that the criminal justice system needs reform we're we're sending to many people to prison and the reason we send so many people to prison is when people have anxiety or they're confused or they're frustrated or they're sad\nBecause something happened their kid oh deed for instance their goal is will make that a crime and the next person's kid who takes drugs they may not O D will catch them before they OD will throw them in a cage and ruin their life that way whereas I Wish they could O. D.\nC. so the mother who loses her child to a drug overdose\nWants an outlet for that which is perfectly understandable so the outlet is she goes to the politicians are politicians say I'm going to do something about that\nI'm going to be tough on drugs oh great we're going to be tough on drugs part of being tough on drugs is it we're going to arrest kids teenagers high school students college students\nPeople who are using very few drugs people who were using drugs because they're in a very bad state so you made a bad choice to use drugs and therefore we're now going to ruin your life we're going to put a criminal\nOr a record on you were going to attach to you with that and you'll never be able to work again\nAnd that's how we're going to show you that were out to help you cause those drugs are bad for you\nWell it's hard to get people to buy into that so instead what we've decided as well we're not actually trying to help you were just trying to punish you because if you're using a drug you're breaking into people's homes or raping women you're stealing cars and you're killing people\nWill most recreational drug users aren't doing any of those things well that's okay never mind who's going to stand up for the drug user because the only people standing up for drug users are drug users and nobody wants to be a drug user is why you can put penalties on going to a strip club you can put penalties on porn use you can make any law you want going\nInto someone's bedroom because no one wants to stand up and go that's a violation of our civil liberties well you must be a bad person that's the old Salem witch trials which test and it's wrong\nSo what Kanye was saying was actually a head of the curve the media just needed a trash him when they used to love him because he was saying that President Trump's doing a good job and guess what\nYou can say Conyers crazy all you want Donald Trump for the Republicans are doing a great job that's why we're going to show up and vote in a couple of days [noise]\nTo give on two more years [noise]\nTalk radio six forty build U.
