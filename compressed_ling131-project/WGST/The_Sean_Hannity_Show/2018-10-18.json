{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "It was naturally to you to insult them I wouldn't call that courage and I wouldn't call that Texan but the beauty is starting on Monday in Texas we have\nThe first day of early voting and I'm going to ask you today when you get home to take a moment look it up and see where your early voting locations are here me out on this ... this is important\nWhenever you go in to vote\nEarly voting is typically in the county that you live in not where you work the county where you live now there will be some distinctions the parishes of Louisiana for instance there will be some quirks in each state look it up it's probably very easy\nSpend just a few moments on the inner webs look it up figure it out\nAnd then for a lot of folks early voting will start next week look up when early voting starts and where you can only vote devote five minutes to it's not going to be that hard don't rely on the guy down the hall\nLook it up on your own your secretary of state's office or your voter registrar which is usually a secretary of state will have a very easy how to go and vote for the first day\nPlease vote straight Republican all the way down the ticket in a lot of places you can just choose Republican\nRight out of the gate and you don't have to scroll down you just choose every Republican who's on the ballot and that's it that's it and you're done you don't have to go down you're going to be tempted to go man these judges down he's state reps I don't know these people\nWell those are the people who have supported the party platform that you've supported and don't support the party of Hillary Clinton\nIn ... if nothing else that puts them a leg up\nOn the Democrats voted early absolutely positively vote early on the first day you you can don't wait till election day\nNow you're going to hear that election day is November six please do not wait until November ... we're going to have a window that's going to open it's gonna be different in each of the states that you live in\nAnd I think probably most folks are going to start next week there'll be a few days sometimes up to two weeks where you can vote early\nGo in and vote and be done and no you did your part the other thing when you get to the voting location I can tell you what the rules are in Texas I Can't speak to the other states\nBring your passport bring your voter id registration card if you have it bring your driver's license but if you can't find what you think they lead grabbed the forms of ... you know you have and go in there and insist\nOkay that sound right there [noise]\nRight that's out there that the crunchy kinda\nMetallic he said what is that sound later on we'll play it again and then I'll formally asked the question and that we might have some fun open up the phone lines and and have people try to guess what is that sound\nOn a very serious note here that the ... thing I Want to open up phones early on ... and the situation that we're in here in the United states with our allies the Saudis I reluctantly called them allies because\nI've always been suspicious of the Saudis I still am suspicious of the Saudis there an amount of nine eleven conspiratorial is at all but\nThere there's more inside the Saudi royal family with a knowledge to nine eleven that I truly believe and also remember and the nine eleven commission report\nWe are all of that stuff regarding Saudi Arabia and the Saudi royal family and there's an absolute monarchy this autocracy or\nRedacted that'd be nice big black lines that are are blacked out and with the Saudis a lot of stuff was just block down so what is it that we're not allowed to see regarding the Saudis I've always thought that\nThey were a very um you know what\nHave you done for me lately or or very fair weather up there on our side on some things and then other things I think that the uh the kingdom kingdom\nA has clearly a diligently and horrifically works worked against the United states and our interest so it's it's it's a bizarre relationship I was never comfortable with George W Bush's relationship with the Saudis\nAre the proper relationship it seems to be along the same lines as George W Bush's relationship I just I've never trusted the Saudis but this is a very bizarre\nGruesome and difficult very complicated matter in the sense that the Saudis\nAre good acting as a check to the out of control terrorists in Iran and the mullahs the Ayatollah Khomeini et cetera uh the Saudis or a very good check\nTo the Iranian power imbalance in the region\nSo I Do have a question for you I Want to get into the details here when more a little odd and ... nuggets are coming out about ...\nBut the question I have for you the Schmidt audience if you're watching us on Newsmax television if you're listening to us on nationwide Schmidt affiliate radio my question to you is\nIf the Saudis were completely involved\nAnd executed this American resident empty I mean he had a green card as a permanent us resident Jamal ... living in the Washington DC area writing for the Washington Post as a columnist\nHis kids are American citizens from everything I've read\nOr what should the Trump Administration do so very clearly if the Saudis killed ...\n... the Trump Administration do do we look the other way and this is complicated because of Iraq\nThe federal deficit is soaring and President Trump wants to cut some budgets I'm going to ask each of you to come back with\nA five percent budget cuts Trump told his cabinet secretaries to

knowledge however uh yes his writings are questionable from uh back in the eighties for instance his sympathies are also questionable\nSo it's not like we're dealing with the choir boy here but it still doesn't add up to we should just stand by while a U.S resident living just outside of a Washington DC I'm a D.C verbs are is\nThis mantle murdered tortured by a Saudi hit squad I mean there is still a certain decency a so you're the good the bad and the ugly on Jamal to show you again I was mentioning front a front page magazine\nAnd Daniel Greenfield who wrote a of a long piece on the show he and he specializes in Islamic terrorism and his piece they talk about the show ... or in high school was friends with Osama bin Laden\nOr they talked about establishing an Islamic state anywhere they could uh they believe that the first one would lead to another et cetera the friendship of Jamal to show he\nEndured and ah it's even reported that can show even followed Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan to show he credited Adele ... G listed at a one time as one of the world's foremost terrorists finance there's a finance ears by the Treasury Department bring him to Afghanistan to report on the fighting\nThe media calls because Soviet journalists by his writings from the eighties\nIn Afghanistan read as jihad as propaganda titles like Arab mujahideen in Afghanistan a exemplifies the unity of Islamic law\nWhen Osama bin Laden set up al ... and he calls his show you what the details are after Afghanistan Jamal cars so he went to work as a media advisor to former Saturday and sell boss prince Turki a bin ...\nAlleged to have links to al ...\nThose allegations came from among others Zacharias was Sally or that the alleged twentieth hijacker\nUh when the other Nineteen hijackers uh\nProtect a perpetrator the attacks on September eleventh to show you wrote\nThat the Saudis would not give them to American demands for unconditional condemnation and total cooperation Saudis tend to link the ugliness of what happened in New York and Washington with what has happened and continues to happen to ... in Palestine\nAnd his time in the United states comes to understand the effect of its foreign policy and the consequences of that policy he declared again I'm not saying that this guy was an angel\nAnd again some of ah Jamal could show he's writing I find very disturbing and I am one hundred eighty degrees opposed to no doubt about it\nA Muslim cannot be happy with the suffering of others even if a suffering is that of Americans who neglected the suffering of Palestinians for half a century\nThat's the real show cynical and manipulative apologist for Islamic terrorism not the missing or the mythical mortar dissident who's disappearance the media spent the worst part of a weak raving about\nDemocracy ... was not a moderate some describe them as the leader of the Saudi Muslim Brotherhood or the Islamic network admires anyone goes into all along these I'll put the front page piece up on the website\nOn Schmidt showdown ... put it on today's ... so it's up so it already is up on Schmidt showed dot com on today's Schmidt list\nSo I mean there there are a lot of issues which I'm all for show me however are active in any terrorism per se or nothing we can really determine I\nHis writings I find disturbing from decades ago a where his sympathies lie or lied or lay a or a past tense where they have lane\nAh because I don't think he's around any longer he's in pieces somewhere or it's failed to me it doesn't justify a what the Saudis\nDid [noise] and and ... and and\nAgain it's been a very complicated relationship because he's been very critical of the the Saudi monarchy and the Saudi royal family\nAnd uh the the young block the crown prince Mohammed bin ... mom who apparently ordered his hit\nI was I Want to move on to some other things here today but what I Want to give you the full picture because a lot of the media is not giving you the background in history of Jamal a\n... I\nAm I'm giving you some of the background on him and it's not all lily white however I again I Can't condone what the Saudis apparently did an embassy and as human beings and as a civilized nation\nI don't know how we or how Trump can just stand by Trump said listen Trump said if it was proved that the Saudis are took this guy out that it would be very bad and they will be consequences so the president has said that because that's the right thing to say that's the humane thing to believe and to act upon\nUh let me grab a couple of calls your them now let me move on to some other things are again\nYou have no idea how things are going to take on a life of its own in every line is jammed let's go to gym in New Jersey Jim you're on Schmidt high\nOn a while only Schmidt [laughter] uh yeah this is a freaking mess\nI you know what to me forget the business and it's clearly a human rights violations petition to get them at the un\nDisassociate yourself with the Saudis get rid of them let them go go she looked at doing and and just you know or worried about the separately\nYou know the question is if it is prove and that's not what opened up this can of worms today as I said if it's proved that you know here's the good the bad and the ugly on a ...\nOr if it's proved that the Saudis did a torture him or dismantle him this memory what should the Trump Administration do and that's why you know and phone calls hanging on for an hour here a ... Jim thanks for the call let's roll to Corey in massive peak on Long Island New York hello Korea Iran Schmidt\nVery ... I'm going to respond her and the uh the Saudi Government is responsible for those hijackers that came to these people they're two three thousand people\nThat government Saudi Arabia should be responsible leibel and should pay compensation rep you shouldn't anything they are responsible for basic air and number two which is the lesser of the evil Iran or\nA Saudi Arabia the only thing is we're doing business with Saudi Arabia you know what we don't let them go to how we don't need anything from them they should stop paying out but as far as this guy these guys that I really don't care about him that you hear about Americans\nThat was on and so ... and soon why and I I Want to thank you for being a nine eleven respond her\nAnd I have always had problems with the Saudis I've always spoken out against the ... the Saudis I Do believe that there was a greater degree of complicit there'll be have you on the Saudis parts\nAre inside that royal family and ah listen the redacted portions of the the nine eleven commission report I don't think we know the whole story\nAnd yeah I could do without the Saudis one hundred percent than certainly I can do without the Iranians however
