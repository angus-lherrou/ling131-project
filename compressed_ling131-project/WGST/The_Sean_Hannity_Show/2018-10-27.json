improvised explosive devices and you know he was very clear that\nLeaves a quarter have blown up he said that these were not hoped devices\nI like to know why none of them blew up the components appear to be there you know how significant a blast would have been I think that's to be determined I'm sure we're going to find out more especially on why none of these Thirteen devices\nActually blew up and of course there were more devices that were discovered today we had some ... to to count here\nThe first device was sent to George Soros and that was the the device it was first discovered\nAt George Soros his house the Clintons got a package deal bombers got a package Maxine Waters got two packages and in fact apparently it was a evidence on on one of the Maxine Waters packages there was a late in fingerprint\nFrom one of the packages sent the Maxine Waters that they lifted the print off of that you know with with all of the the potential areas for an individual to screw up\nBecause you look the fees on below she looked at these devices they didn't look very sophisticated so I figured that was going to be\nA skin or a hair or a fingerprint\nIf all the scotch tape that was used to\nPut the labels down that were printed on a laser jet or an ink jet printers to cut out and then plastered on top of these manila padded on blogs\nAnd then you know shipping tape clear shipping tape put over yeah they got a fingerprint on one of these packages and that's what the on well this and then of course some DNA evidence was also on uh some of the other packages as well\nSo a link fingerprints from a was\nIt the one of the water's ... and then maybe some DNA from one of the waters I was trying to write and and pay attention during the pressure and I got something on audio will get you in just a minute so the Clintons Obama's George Soros a Maxine Waters\nYou had um [noise] Joe Biden with two packages\nOr you had a the uh the package to Eric Holder that went back to Debbie\nWasserman Schultz office of course all the return address as well Debbie Wasserman Schultz a whose offices and she represents the neck of the woods where this individual is

very clear I Am going to be very direct\nThat the phones over the last couple of days have been packed\nWith caller is saying that this was a democratic false flag that the Democrats were behind this you know many people thought the Democratic party or or of a democratic operatives were behind this to make it look like a Trump not\n\nAnd I'm looking at the whole screen here for colds that you know want to maybe correct what they said I'm just I'm just not seeing those types of calls on hold folks whether you want to believe it or not I'm going to say this I'm not going to run away from this\nI

going ... congratulations and everything going on what we need you here in Nashville hungrier man um but my point was uh some of these news reporters just seem like they're not too bright a grown in politics\nRight and to the question they're just saying ah you know trying to attribute all this to Trump's rhetoric you know\nI I don't know if you've heard it but it did you hear my commentary Brian when we were listening in to the press to live in of course the parts I'm playing now those happened before we went on the air\nOr and what we did listen to the pressure live earlier this hour and we heard I think it was the CNN reporter is it a Pamela Brown maybe a White House correspondent um\n[noise] I I think she's ... and it sounded like she was trying to play the political a game of trying to get a direct to re to say oh yeah\nIt's the president's rhetoric that drove this guy's engine and that's that's what she was getting on I I assume that's what your point the out as well\nYeah [noise] absolutely and then another question they said was a you know what this guy's motivation is this the the general there's going to have a mind reader with him what's that about\n... you know they're looking for whatever they can glean some of the questions I thought were stupid and misguided but are not all reporters are rockets surgeons Brian thanks for the call and I will try to get on

president has been saying stuff I mean they he says you know that the rhetoric or whatever but they're not going to do with this guy they find out why he did this and if there is a perfect way to blame the president by looking at van for gun right\nNow and I think could be set up because it could be a a a\nR Trump lover you can also be a trouble here by\nThe about apparently he did register as a Republican and he did vote for Trump be voted out\nOr a Republican and twenty sixteen that's a long way to lay this that I just think we were dealing with the ranged individual then I think likes

Schmidt hello Keith Hi\nHello how are you doing are doing well um\nYeah my comment is you know the news media is going to run with this you know they're going oh Trump's rhetoric that's what caused this Trump's rhetoric you know if you go to the rallies and you're listening somebody screaming um you know Trump and the Trump will say you know what no break touched that guy that support him out of there\nNobody taught you let him you know let him be just says court him out\nBut you know they get to the Democrats screaming kick 'em you know are called him kick them on a Maxine Waters and getting their faith and they're the ones that are pushing you know violence and they don't even listen to the Trump I mean he's saying make America great again you know he's talking about the fake news he's not advocating\nViolence or cave hang on there there are problems on both sides and I have\nSure raided the Democrats that you just referred to a with their comments the Eric Holder comment with any try to back out of the you know his little violent remark or Maxine Waters and her comment to harass Republicans and and don't let him get away with it we've discussed all of that ad nausea him\nBut on the other hand I I'm Sorry I cannot ignore and I don't ignore because that's what makes me and intellectually honest conservative talk radio entertainer and host unlike some of the others in my genre\nUh where I can still pointed out the fact that the president of the United states does not need to be calling the media the enemy that people\nAre you know we have you can see the some of the mob mentality of some of the rallies with you don't lock her up lock her up a and I I Do wish a Hillary Clinton I I think that Hillary Clinton should've probably been investigated a potentially charged with what happened with or email in private server and classified information et cetera that's a whole different argument\nBut as far as uh you know the president seeming to support GM forte for instance in Montana\nAnd giving him a thumbs up and laughing about him body slamming reporter I Can't give that a seal of approval of sums up I can condone that\nEither yet but you know what it's nothing compared to the violence that the Democrats you know I mean they are over the top ...\nPercent it's on both sides again the president has such good policies Trump pests such good economic policies are for the most part I got my issues with our growing a you know debt and deficit obviously but you know we'll get into that at all at a later date\nBut the economy has done well a GDP Growth a is a has been phenomenal obviously new news on that\nA list at the bottom line is the president to back off of some of the rhetoric and I wish she would because some of the comes across as just a MBAs silicon childish and he could take himself away from that\nAnd he won't give his critics as much to nail him on and of course you heard it was some of the questions that the pressure and the media the pundits on CNN and MSNBC they're going to be all over this\nAnd they're going to say and they all already started that\nThe president and the rallies and the chance of the crowd CNN sucks\nAnd then CNN sucked stickers on the side of the band of this a pipe bomber who was just arrested in South Florida so they're going to of course they're going to tie this together but the president on some levels is giving them the ammunition to be able to blame him and ... would do a whole lot of service to himself\nAnd we conservatives and Republicans if he would just tone down and get out of campaign rile up the crowd mode\nAnd just focus on making this country better and I that's my advice to him thanks for the call Keith let's grab Russia's Orlando, Florida Russia Iran Schmidt I write\nA book discovery might be a right wing cook [noise] but how about the ...\nHe runs with an assault rifle Republicans with the congressional baseball game last year I mean\nIt wasn't a
