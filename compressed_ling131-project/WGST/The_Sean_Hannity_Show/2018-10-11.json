Dennis is the communications in public affairs\nOfficer with the national Hurricane Center in Miami Dennis welcome to the Schmidt show hello hello their identities let's talk landfall let's talk the latest I Know we spoke and a half an hour ago you guys were ... what's the latest\nWe have a hurricane and is now over land the last position we have on\nVery dangerous hurricane Michael's about thirty miles east northeastern Panama City or about sixty miles west of Tallahassee, Florida it is moving on to the north northeast nice Fifteen miles per hour maximum sustained winds one hundred and fifty miles per hour it's followed category for hurricane a misshapen perception hurricane winds scale [noise]\nA dentist when landfall was made are we using I I Know that you were you when you you guys don't like when we focus on a specific spot but around Mexico beach a little south east of tend to layer force base\nThat is a little less populated then if you go up the road to Panama City beach for instance uh thoughts on that and uh is it ... it was just shy and landfall just shy of a category five\nRight I mean the we had a measurement with the aircraft that one hundred and fifty five miles per hour you got to go to one fifty seven to officially be a category five but that's just the statistic you're talking to different from one or two miles per hour from crushing the threshold from a four to five and the grand scheme of things that really doesn't matter [noise] uh\nThe uh but just because the the founder officially was near Mexico beach that would have put Panama City in the eye wall so they got clobbered [laughter]\nWell ah Dennis uh we're hearing my my show my radio show a is heard on a affiliates nationwide one of my affiliates is in Panama City a Ninety four point five FM and we have heard that there are thousands foot tower\nWas toppled or a thousand foot radio tower has come down and we're also hearing that most of the I Am and FM stations in Panama City or off the air right now\nThat would not surprise me remembering Hurricane Andrew came across South Florida back in Ninety two how many uh television or radio towers came down and those kind of wins that and Andrew was one fifty five one sixty one sixty five so you're in that neighborhood so I I'm not surprised that the towers would have come down\nA dentist one are you hearing as far as from people on the ground or water you gathering information wise on the amount of damage that has occurred so far\nWe haven't had anything on that other than what we're seeing on television right now our focus continues to be not where the storms are already gone but where it's going this is still in a category for hurricane which is going to be leaving the Florida Panhandle and going in the south western Georgia south western Georgia southern Georgia is going to get a hurricane\nA full blown hurricane or with all the impacts of wind and rain or going with it\nA dentist what area are we talking about dust ah we're talking about what what areas in southern Georgia you'll get nailed\nWeren't talking to south western corner of Georgia that will be ... we're talking a going up towards you kept then we're making a Augusta they're all in the path of the storm and I'm going to South Carolina probably right on top of Columbia tomorrow\nNow do you expect it to weaken to a category three uh two at what timeframe you know right now we're ... or ... which still a category for when does that weekend and will it will it quickly weaken\nIt ... it will spend down but they're remembered the storm is so strong it's going to take a while for the winter to spin down so this'll be a good one are good too easily going into Georgia could still be a free uh and we expected to be a hurricane tracking all across Georgia and down to a tropical storm strength is a good set of South Carolina tomorrow\nI saw that as I Know we've got a role here but uh I Would imagine that a hurricane of this nature a category to potentially hitting a well inland in southern or south western Georgia have they ever seen that before\nA in where we're going back to the records or which go back to Eighteen fifty won the Florida Panhandle has never had a category for hurricane hit them never sent Eighteen fifty one so I'd have to go back and see if southern Georgia has ever had anything that powerful I doubt it but I I Can't be sure\nAh Dennis a big difference from southwestern George or to the coast you know over a you'll Brunswick area and you know in Savannah I mean is a big difference from coastal Georgia to well inland Georgia\nAre down ... down triple digits a s impede down\nTriple digits NASDAQ a down significantly S. and P. down double digits I should say NASDAQ down triple digits a

Richards the key Largo, Florida or when you think of the keys you think of you know hurricane activity as well\nOh but uh not right now this is a the panhandle Richard you're on Schmidt welcome to the program\nI how you doing man yeah\nSorry go ahead\nOh I Want to preface this a couple of things are phone engineer or living key Largo I'm a contractor and I went through Hurricane Andrew several years ago which was a category ... storm\nRight in our cat it ... it was a category ... that was one of the Florida yeah August in Nineteen Ninety two west\nOf ... space which was ground zero or anybody that stays in one of these things and I mean we build up pretty significantly down here to to accommodate the wins that we get we we're we're we're very frequent had by by her ...\nUm unfortunately nobody else in the country builds the way we've built um we use all concrete walls a matter of fact was outside it was a a concrete roof as well\nI'm In I feel badly for anybody that would have stayed in this area I Know they're going through right now I've seen it\nA a witness to myself this is a bad storm anybody that's in a what a what brain building or art or for God's sake to a trailer but they're done\nWith this thing is a bad storm\nYeah the only thing that we can hope for now is that are most importantly that the loss of life is male or a minimal or hopefully none are bought with a category for a strong one at that almost a category five\nLuckily hitting a little\nLess of a populated area but again the breath the width of this storm is so large I'm just hoping that the injury and death toll is extremely low but I I understand what you say about structures you know as a Florida resident myself or you know I've been in Florida since Nineteen Ninety two\nA looming aluminum garnering all over the place that again a\nLots of materials and debris in the water\nAnd we're seeing some of the some of the uh as far as the storm surge and again some of the purchase of nine to Thirteen feet or in some of the images I'm seeing every bit of that because we're seeing water\nOr up to the rules of houses water up I mean extreme severe flooding with the storm surge in Mexico beach or Florida\nOr so again I I'm just hoping that we were not going to be dealing with the heavy death toll the damage toll is going to be high folks\nI'm just hoping that again the storm surge is a killer it will drown you water is like a wall of concrete coming at you\nAnd an amazing speed and people say oh I'll I'll be a salt water will hit you like a ton of bricks wasn't folks know it'll flash flooding\nI mean you know unless they're out in ah for instance of those that are out of the devil at the desert southwest\nYou know those that are you are listening in Las Vegas right now when you when your head outside of Vegas you know you you guys have seen even in Vegas so it was some years ago the flash flooding that occurred there\nAnd the cars being swept off the roads and as you drive through the desert areas you'll you'll see some of the run all the areas where you have the flood zones you'll see the flood warnings and you'll see you know where where water can come in from the hills and and just completely annihilate\nAnd that's always a dangerous I think folks hopefully have a grasp on the dangers of water now the other big story today is is Wall Street getting hammered\nOr the Dow fell even more uh we shot or our number one down about two minutes before the top of the hour or we are left with about a minute and a half left in the training day\nOn Wall street and uh the numbers folks are they ain't pretty awful day on Wall street folks of the total is that we have S. and P. down Ninety five points\nThe Dow Jones industrial average down ... eight hundred and thirty one points\nAnd the NASDAQ down or looks like it's going to settle on two Seventy nine I'm Sorry three Fifteen so I I doubt down a thirty one the\nNASDAQ down three Fifteen and the S. and P. down Ninety four point six these six almost\nNinety five so awful day on Wall street and and what caused that storm well that's a pretty much you know tech stocks getting hammered the fears of rising interest rates\nAnd uh we're essentially in a decline now this is the biggest to climb in a well he's got to be what six months or so uh I think the last big decline that we we saw I think you have to go back to march\nUh so you know when I was leaving on the stock market role here\nAnd uh we're looking at some numbers\nThat certainly are giving traders and investors and and four one K. holders a little bit of a little kitten their stomach today but the wall Street Journal reporting a biggest decline and more than six months yeah they're six months investors accelerated their retreat from fast growing technology stocks\nAre major indexes have started the fourth quarter on their week is forwarding since the beginning of twenty six team oh is this just a little speed bump folks or\nIs this indicative of\nThe stock market fears that the certainly exist or if the eyes being a you know opened up in October just because October\nUh is the month where we've seen the obviously the the most carnage on Wall street\nOr you know going back to the crash in twenty nine and and Nineteen eighty seven so I was ... October is certainly a month that that has a you know people always looking over their shoulders and October is not off to a great start here so uh I don't look at your four one K. today\nBecause you get to see the Dow down eight thirty one the NASDAQ down three Fifteen and they asked them pay down Ninety five points to sell reflected\nA once\nIn a ... with a OSU my executive producer wants to know a a could investors have put the hits the fed off until after the hurricane no I I don't think so I just hope this is not an indication of an extreme\nThe rough October\nI Know there have been multiple stories out there that the fears of a of massive correction of the fears of a crash a or a implanted and in some of the big wall street pros and experts a Muslim ups and downs or you know healthy\nAnd you know pull backs are natural and listen suddenly a\nYou know people's eyes are open up here but the market has been on one\nHell of a role obviously uh I just hope that we're not dealing with with the beginnings of a mask the brutal October\nAs the months is known for nasty brutal months eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine to nationwide number you're on Schmidt eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine again Amazon clocked\nToday a Microsoft intel also clock today un apple Netflix all also all getting hammered today Facebook getting hammered today so tech stocks have a lead\n\nMine number ... does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it is there a number three [noise]\nPeople for for police [noise]\nClose to the restaurant middle seat with the stomach problem\nMy fear of flying [noise]\nSound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with a digestive condition called X Okrent pancreatic insufficient see or a pie I even if you don't know what he ... he is you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea gas\nBloated stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still heavy PI because not everybody experiences he pee on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about oh your symptoms and the good news is\n... manageable so don't keep a lid on it goes to identify E.

...\nTalk radio six forty W GST\nAnd what what's going on with this is hurricane and it's just nasty some of the video that is beginning to come in\nYou know it's just sort of a parallel here 'cause we're dealing with with the climate and the hurricanes a current or here in the United states they been happening since the beginning of time folks\nAnd yet this on record to be the strongest hurricane to hit the panhandle\nUh or at least since Eighteen fifty one but I'm pretty confident that prior to records being kept there have been many many years ago centuries ago hurricanes\nAnd strong or stronger that have hit the coast because they've always been around\nHurricanes have always been a threat to the obvious areas in psych loans and and typhoons et cetera so the obvious areas on the planet but you know it's it you know we're talking about the climate at least and the hurricane activity but also we have this political climate we have\nTorrential rain and wins in\nOur political climate and\nSaw for instance a Rand Paul\nRand Paul has said that in this political climate and uh somebody may get killed\nAnd I don't think Rand Paul is that far off unless the look of the damage is his nut job neighbor did them so I Want to get into that in just a bit but as far as the political climate\nAnd the fact that Democrats are vying they're making every possible uh attempt to take back the house of representatives and to make inroads or there is a pipe dream that the Democrats are hoping to take back\nThe Senate and of course was the house it was centered in the hands of the Democrats would certainly cripple a good deal of what President Trump wants to accomplish all is a good thing\nJust in case that he's gotten a lot of top list including two Supreme Court nominations\nBy talking and speaking of the political climate that exist right now and I told you about President Trump or just a few minutes ago I I told you about his tweet that he is going to keep going to Pennsylvania for a rally in the Erie, Pennsylvania ear or area tonight\nOr as to as he poured not disappoint the thousands of people that are already there and the thousands of people that will be coming\nBut the political climate\nWhen you look toward the U.S Senate\nOr there's something very important that we need to attach to this current hurricane\nAnd that is that there is a a a democratic seat in the Senate\nWhich is held by Senator Bill Nelson now and Bill Nelson is being challenged by the Florida governor Rick Scott now Rick Scott obviously leading up to this hurricane and in the aftermath\nHas been very visible he will be very visible he is in the past gotten very good marks or for some of the natural disasters in tropical activity in hurricanes in the state of Florida during his a two term tenure as Florida governor however let me be very clear here\nWhat could make or break a governor Rick Scott in his quest\nTo take this scene away from the Democrat Bill Nelson in Florida for the U.S Senate or is going to be I think viewed through the lens of how the aftermath of this hurricane goes listen we're we're a month shy here of the midterm elections\nWe're right around a month shy so Rick Scott as governor of Florida is going to be judged and he's going to be put under an extreme microscope right now and this could be the make or break\nSo the way the state of Florida under the direction of Governor Scott handles the aftermath of this hurricane I think is going to have an amazing impact on whether ... and the polling has been a pretty close so it can do it once the latest a a real clear politics average can you give me the latest\nGame at school or play or something and they were just do one of us stayed at home and the other went to ... so you know I think I have one regret in that is that Dr Sharon I never get a book together [noise] um\nI never pursued it when they get to see and guy I knew it couldn't be done\nBy myself I couldn't do it by myself but he never initiated anything and I never initiated anything but maybe that's good I don't know I'm ... now he's gone and so you know where his father and his memory\nI'm ... getting right there and I teach at a guy I don't know um\nWell but to think about\nThis moment in such a brief flies in and you know compared to what we've been allowed to live\nAnd to think how much has come out of that at at Texas children's hospital\nTo research the center of the money raised\nThe the body of work the\n... you know increase in understanding and give me the logical deficiency and now it's treated and everything I read is just a I mean this was this was really a lot of a lot of lives have been saved and improved from just one moment that you know you would David father David and\nIn this hour together and others\nYou know others around it lives are saved I remember the first time I walk on immigration and work hand in hand with that you get baby that had been transplanted at their medical center\nI and you know our ... many families because down on the board you give me a deficiency foundation we had been I've been on the board for a long time and we have come finches and I see a success stories all the time\nBut every now and then I Will lead it mother who had fish foster child get an old goes to um although stairs and back to me and I know and I said as much\nAs we know now there is still so much that is not now you know Dr share and the data center and the staff at the data center and many others um\nUm were instrumental in getting get new added to the newborn screening and all you know when they do is you stick around maybe right and all those list of things they look for they added in\nTo the panel in twenty twelve I Believe now current made and this is the latest that room yesterday there are forty eight states currently screening\nOwn newborns for scared or primary immune disorder there are a lot of children that have chronic illnesses that go on diagnosed for a long period of time\nYou know they have recurring find your ... or ... um bronchial infection um you know they have an interest in that war dump want but not like it's supposed to send their chronically ill and what it does it interferes with the quality of lives\nIt erodes the quality of life is as youngsters they have to admit school\nOr are they can't play outside or they always come down with the infection in the wintertime\nAnd they teach and you know home instead of in school were out playing with their friends so\nEarly diagnosis is the key to old endangered um issue now\nWhile we may never while I was there never another child in this isolated you said he was the first to the last where I was not used to get\n'em for one thing and they knew that they had to treat these children need it like that the immune system we're not going to kick in on its own\nSo and then there you know not every city has an institution\nA medical complex the size of Texas Medical center in how fortunate where we\nAre to have lived nearby where we had the advantage of this bash medical center [noise]\nI I feel thankful offered him I frequently say on the air people come from the the the the shakes from\nSaudi Arabia the richest people from North Africa or Mexico or Asia come here for treatment in you know whether it's Texas children are Baylor College of medicine or Indian person we are so lucky that you know in your case imagined he would have had to approve the entire family or you got well stay at home\nYou know what I think and I think I Would have had I not moved to Houston we came from San Antonio ... father night we were in newly wed\nAnd I'm married and sixty eight I Believe a sixty seven and um I ... the belt or a long time and still do had we not moved to this area where we had the Texas Medical center\nYou know a few miles away I Would have lost two guns and never know why ... ... and dumped so you know I feel\nThat it's all part of God's guide and I feel privileged to get there and his mother and a car to bitch I however brief it was\nWell and I I I think your testimony is still I'm\nJust reading some of the emails that were coming in a while I was waiting to get you on the phone from people good oh they're wonderful they sell you know her stories so inspirational she lives\nYou know I didn't know if you moved off I didn't know that there were so many people said you know they've named a school for him up here and there is a drive for him and they're like the the center at Texas children and his mother you know ... woman and and so yes I mean I I think that you know you nobody would have wanted to have suffered the loss you have\nBut I think that you all have a you know use this as a way to improve the lives of others\nWas born ten months\nI was so he would be about my age", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "11"}
