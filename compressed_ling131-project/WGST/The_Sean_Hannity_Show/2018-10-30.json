Chris of the band computer game and New York times best selling author AJ Jay Gould about how we are all family like it or not the way that\nI define family is you know we are surrounded by people in our lives that\nWe consider cousins and close close loved ones that are closer to us at a at a\n[noise]\nAnd again I hadn't heard and I seen you know the time and I I told you what time of nine one one call a came in we know what time of cops got on the scene and I but I hadn't seen or study ... know whether this was\nA official or whether this is just piece together as far as women the officers actually formally went in\nAnd what time they actually engaged so here's the timeline\nThis happens to be published by CNN on their website nine forty nine AM\nAnd anti Jewish or Jewish messages posted on social media can for those Robert Bowers\nThe gun\nAnd this was on this gab Web site which will get into a little bit later on and he rode on this website\nSo about five minutes before he when he and so we must have done this on a mobile device logged in and he left a message I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics I'm going in\nI don't think it takes a genius to figure out that he was talking about going into the synagogue\nTo them\nShoot the Jewish people inside nine fifty for him as I mentioned the nine one one calls started rolling into the Allegheny county emergency operations center nine fifty\nI Am a minute later to police cars are dispatched according to radio traffic posted by broadcasts defy\nThey are told one caller reports twenty to thirty shots her from the lobby numerous other officers say that they're responding about four minutes after that nine fifty nine or ten o'clock officer identifies himself by number and says he's on the perimeter were under fire he's got an automatic weapon\nAnd firing at us from the synagogue\nThen a month later another officer says one of her colleagues who can be heard shouting shot in the hand another officer calls for a medic\nSo I mean within minutes who responded we already have a cop shot so I you know some are trying to say they should have gone in sooner again I don't have a firm grasp of what has is verified reality on the timeline\nJust after ten am an officer says every unit in the city needs to get here now\nDispatcher relays request to all available units there that that will give you chills every year the city needs to get here now\nIs broadcast two minutes later about ten of two AM officers on the scene request city and county swat teams and again they're not just sitting around waiting at the swap members\nAre you know typically on cell phone twenty four seven and they were available some are already on patrol or they're doing other duties and then they quickly assemble\nAnd get to a scene as quickly as possible different swat teams weren't different ways but a lot of times SWAT Team the truck arrives uh whenever I can get there but other team members are typically in there whether it's a their city or county issued vehicle they have all their tactical gear and their truck\nOr in the back of their a SUV the body armor their fatigues a they're a high powered rifle scopes what they they typically have it all with them\nAnd they'll respond as quickly as they\nCan\nTen eleven AM there's the discussion among officers about going into the synagogue one says there has been no gunfire since officers initially arrive\nOnce we have the resources here we should consider going in now this is what and again I don't want to jump down and he wants throat or I don't want to jump to any conclusions yet I Want to have\nAn absolute grasp of the time as a hundred percent right but this is an area where there could be some complaints but remember I mentioned that we already had a police officer shot\nAnd that could have been fired from the windows are out at the police are responding but they they've already an officer was already hit on the outside so ten eleven they're talking about\nGoing in\nOnce we have the resources here we should consider going in\nNow that\nIs going to give some people some pause and should the officers have gone in and made entry into the building sooner did they wait too long\nOr were they waiting for those other resources or a swat and those with more\nProtective armor to show up when they should have gone in and of course this is going to be reviewed it's going to be up for debate\nUltimately you did a four officers shot here and I'm just not going to arm share this right now\nI'm not gonna Monday morning quarterback this 'cause I don't have all the facts and I'm not going to go on just the uh CNN timeline here until I Know all the facts are operationally of things we're not done properly or if they should have been faster or there could have been lives saved if they would have a breach the buildings sooner\nOr without technically swat showing up\nWell that'll be determined but I Can't sit here and this chair behind this microphone and make definitive statements because I just don't know at this point but that's a potential area which is obviously going to be looked at ten Nineteen am\n[noise] a a worker at the emergency operations center said nine one one calls indicated the shooter came into the lobby and began firing\nAt ten Twenty one am someone says an officer fired up the suspect during the initial gunfight and believes the gunman may have been hit\nSo again I'm trying to reconcile an earlier incident so before swat arrived it appears that swan or some members of swat\nAnd again it's not like the whole truck pulled up you know and the back opens up and the officers jump out like in the movies are on TV officers they started arriving at the scene individually some reports have some of the swap members arriving at ten twelve\nAt ten twenty five officers says suspects wearing green vast green jacket weapons slung around his neck\nAbout ten thirty AM so ten twenty nine to ten thirty tactical teams enter the synagogue so was that too long to go in\nOr should they have gone in sooner if that is accurate why did some of the SWAT Team members why did they wait so long to go in\nBut at that point at that point though it seems that\nThe shooting was already done or the the the ... eleven that were murdered it seems that most were already killed\nBefore even police arrived on the scene so I don't know and again I'm I'm not covering for any one I just don't know but there's a chance that both of these deaths were committed before the police are certainly some of the swap member showed up around\nTen twelve but should they have gone in sooner than ten twenty nine and ten thirty that's going to be open for debate and I would say if this is the only information I have yes SWAT Team members should have gone in sooner if that's how long\nIt took\nAnd again when the officers start roaming the building and they're trying to clear areas and they found for bodies in the atrium area there was another person that was hit but still alive then a few minutes later for more bodies are found\nAnd it seems like this damage this carnage was was\nDone and it occurred early on now almost an hour later ten fifty three\nOn the police radio you can hear contact contact shots fired shots fired officer shouts that into as a radio and says that a man is barricaded on the third floor firing a damn it seems that\nThe gunshots stopped that he that the gunman had taken up a a defensive position was trying to hide and then once they finally ousted him and flushed him then that's when he engaged the police by firing again\nBut it looks like the the murders of these ... these are the these are Jewish people have a synagogue that the these are more front loaded toward a nine fifty for when the early reports started coming in\nIs or what it looked like a eleven those three so over an hour after the incident police tell each other there are negotiations\nWith the gunman he's been given orders to crawl out he's not has not done so yet police say isn't a are Fifteen and a handgun they later fight to more handguns and then all of it all for suspect puts his hands and view a few minutes later he gives his name and his age two police officers\nAnd then eleven oh eight officer calls for radio silence because suspected surrendering and crawling out of the room he was hiding in a suspect was hit was injured obviously not fatally\nAnd according to the police radio that's when a according to police radio he tells police in all these Jews need to die\nSo\nThat's the timeline as we have it and of course this is going to be studied it does not appear to be like Scott Peterson situation the officer or in South Florida at the horrific school shooting\nWould be the news radio I'm Brian shrug this aspect behind a package bombs sent a multiple high profile\nIndividuals apparently had plans to target more than a

this was must here as far as I'm concerned this is must here\nAnd we'll get to that coming up in just a bit here on that I I'll tell you I'll get to it before the end of this hour so we got like twenty three minutes left will get to what you want to hear this and it's\nComing up momentarily Iran ... Solis when you're the president\nEverything you say and do what you where the way you look at someone and everything is under the microscope\nWith Trump he is even more under the microscope\nCouple audio bites that I wanted to play from the Sarah Huckabee Sanders press conference from earlier today on the first news or in a long time I think since early September\nIf I'm not mistaken so little um older casual Jim Acosta there was an interesting episode was Sarah Sanders and Jonathan Karl from ABC News will get into that in the bed\nNow with the president when I just said about the president being under the microscope whoever the president isn't with Trump even more so because well he's a different kind of president you different kind of guy and he\nClearly handles the media much differently\nAnd he's a bulldoze\nAnd he does things different than other presidents have in the past the present and I'm not saying that a lot of these issues and similarities didn't occur behind the scenes or cause was\nObama's White House Obama's administration they had an adversarial position with the press the press were locked out of many events the difference is is that Obama would not have these temp source bats in front of the media\nA subtle say hey it's better to have this uh out in the open it provides a or the ability for everyone to see what's happening it it it opens up a green pastures porn can\nView it's happening and see what's happening versus what happens secretly quietly behind closed doors and the Obama administration and his staff talking about the media who they like they don't like I had to keep the media away from certain events that Trump does it\nIn public for all of us to see and you've got an asshole so then if we're able to see all of their Senate if it gets sunshine and sunlight though what the hell happens behind the ... that could be even crazier the point I'm trying to make\nIs the president's tweets from this morning\nI've been very clear I Do not like the enemy of the people\nI think it's destructive I don't think that it as any place for a president of the United states to call the media the enemy of the people or\nThe delineation of the fake news is the enemy of the people but them you know he'll call CNN and then and and the NBC and MSNBC the fake news so essentially is calling them the enemy of the people because you're qualifying so to tweets this morning and again I just I don't think\nThat the president should be engaged in this type of Twitter activity especially under the microscope especially since we've had the pipe bombs from last week the synagogue shooting from Saturday morning the president this morning\nIn his first tweet this was [noise] see what time was this a while and he had actually three tweets don't want to go over because the one this morning rolled out at eight o three am about twelve hours earlier\nAnd in the eight o'clock hour last night so Sunday night the president tweeted the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country\nSingle vehicle not one exception pulled off the side of the road and men who were wearing baseball caps took their baseball caps off put 'em over their chest\nNow if that doesn't hit you in the fields I don't know what does to watch people going about their business mostly trucks\nBut many vans and a passenger cars as well but to watch people pull off to the side of the road\nAnd take their head off some of them looking down to show respect for somebody that they didn't even know to the family members who were passing by to take\nI don't know how long the procession was had to be at least five minutes most people have so convinced themselves that they're running late to life\nThat everything has to be driving up on somebody's ass trying to drive over I'm trying to whip through traffic an endangered children in the process as if that makes it tough I've heard that one of them told ... mind you know it'll kill from kids great that's well that's that's fantastic\nBut anyway everybody is in a rush and to see people stop like that for a moment and just pull off the side of the road as a show of respect\nIt is it is such a simple\nGesture but such a powerful gesture there were people who as we passed in front of their houses very\nModest houses in the cove for those of you know orange ... these are small little ship lap eight hundred square foot house there's no garage not fancy not was simple dot put it that way\nAnd just see them come out on their their front door steps and it wasn't for us in particular I think they do this as as a matter of practice\nAnd when I think back to things that I appreciate about a small town it is that things like marking the passing of a human beings life has value now there might not be as much to do\nThat might not be as many forms of diversion professional sports teams in every field movie theater on every corner coffee shop to on every corner\nNo that's true there's not as much to do there's not as many ways to entertain yourself or distract yourself or make money\nBut to be at a point where things that should matter do matter is to me pretty strong marker especially when you're a member of a family that is on your way to a burial things like that manner and it just made me stop and think the kind of person\nWho values pulling over to pay respect to a family member\nOf a family you likely don't know I don't recognize taking time out of your life\nThat is a simple but profound gesture that people in rural communities make it is a simple but profound gesture that people in big cities don't make which tells you there is a different\nSet of values and a different expression of those values so should we be surprised that those two\nDifferent people who react very differently to something as important or an important as the passing of a family in a funeral procession should we be surprised that two people who view something like that as so dramatically different as to how I should respond\nThat those two groups of people would respond differently to a professional football player taking a knee during the national anthem the kind of person who has an internal barometer that says\nWhatever we're doing right now is not important the most important thing I can do with my life is the sacrifice of ten minutes to pull over to the side of the road take off my cap\nAvert their gaze look down and wait until the procession is gone a sacrifice not saying they emptied their bank account gave up their home but it's a pretty profound statement it's giving everything you have at that moment\nYou're coming the opposite direction on a
