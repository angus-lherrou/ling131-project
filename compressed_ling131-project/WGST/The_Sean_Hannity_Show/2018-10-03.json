we're dealing with water is a solid versus a with the Kennedy incident water as a liquid\nSo ... you can see that and that's clearly a the big difference here I just was thinking about that prevent it I mean really you know Ted Kennedy I don't know how to be starting on this phone calls in a minute or my beef with NBC News here\nAnd again there were some just climbers or there there was more to NBC's reports on MSNBC this is Kate Snow Kate Snow national correspondent for ...\nYou see news in the anchors one of the weekend shows I think the Sunday NBC nightly news ah from New York\nAnd she had to sit down with his Julie sweat ... who ah apparently the FBI bucket even mess was sweating that guy yes which some Democrats have asked that they interview her but you know we know that the FBI is interviewed for we'll get to that and just a bit here but the sweat Nick ... has massive credibility problems now\nNBC News they play an excerpt of the interview during the NBC nightly news or a portion of what ran a longer interview on MSNBC the deal is though is that millions of more people will watch the NBC nightly news\nAh interview and that package that clip on the NBC television network them a watch on MSNBC on cable\nSo while they might have asked some questions or have some disclaimer is on MSNBC they didn't do the same with the clip the theme ran\nOn the NBC nightly news last night first of all my question for NBC News is why the hell would you give this sweating at the time of day anyway\nYou have other mainstream outlets that I think that this woman is squarely she has a host of legal issues\nA restraining order from an ex she's been accused of defamation I mean she's had a bunch of legal issues apparently and a lot of other outlets are staying away from this uh this woman uh CNN they had a avid Audi on a\n... to discuss the issues that I if I have time I'll get into that but ah before I go to phones here from the NBC story you know she was backing away\nShe's she's she's not backing away from some of the claims she initially made when Avon ladies first came out with that big reveal of this new third individual accusing Brett Kavanaugh and she's she's backed off of some of these claims\nSo NBC News Cape snow they said they couldn't be shore\nAh that that they reported that that this sweating it couldn't be sure that Kavanaugh was one of the boys was Salter during a party in the Nineteen eighties so that that's a back off\n[laughter] that that's that's a change in the story\nHey tired how's it going all's well I have a\nCouple of points I'd like to make about Christine Ford\nUm my theory is that\nThat for her this was a get rich quick schemes because she likes to travel we know that she lied about her fear of flying and she likes to fly all over the world and go on vacation and all this kind of stuff I'm\nLike ... one of the reasons I Believe that is because she was on the verge\nShaming Leo crying I'm through the entire testimony with her little mousy voice and\nShy or by the way I talked about the voice last weekend the vocal fry and can the card Daschle in ... which I\nMean I think we were all shocked last week when we heard open her mouth to go ahead sorry\nSo she did not have won cheer string down her cheek through the entire testimony or five hours or something like that\nAnd\n... and I think she stands to make a heck of a lot of money and her or go funny is up you know over seven hundred thousand dollars\nYeah I stopped watching when I when I heard it was over seven hundred grand I stop looking

the necessarily have to be a woman\nAs everybody say what somebody would accuse you of something you're automatically guilty brown you are truly guilty until proven innocent that one of the very very bad thing is like\nThe president's at the White House before getting a marine lawn earlier today and listen I don't know the problem here is when you have these squarely stories\nIt affects and it adds that\nCame in I think some people's eyes those that make real and true and honest accusations that's what I find to be most appalling here especially with the sweat Nick this third accuser they came out with her uh you know daffy stories in her backtracking now it\nIs potentially causes people to not take seriously those that really are victims of sexual assault and that's just flat out
