Americans have more\nNative American DNA that Elizabeth Warren will be fine I mean I I saw this I saw this\nIt might have been on the Drudge Report but I saw this headline about two hours ago and I printed it out of its semi pile but let me see if it's on a [noise] let me see if it's what I see this thing but it's it was it was a piece that I was reading I thought I highlighted I probably did\nBut [laughter]\nAnd I'll find it a second but essentially it's that many other Americans who don't claim that they're Native American actually have more Native American in them a them Elizabeth Warren and I witnessed\nSomething with European European Americans were or Americans with the European descent actually many have more Native American DNA then a Senator Warren [laughter]\nAssume I executive producer just said hey Schmitt you probably have more Native American I I don't know I've never done one of the twenty three and me that I Know vaguely or basically what my lineages I Know

for one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American\nAnd by the way the Boston Globe Anna correct themselves then you had to issue a correction or hang on it\nIt's actually pretty embarrassing here but the the the original the original a percentage from the Boston Globe piece was that she was one in five hundred twelve\nNative American\nAnd they had to do a correction here looking at a correction due to a mass air a story about Elizabeth Warren misstated\nThe ancestry percentage of a potential temp generation relative it shouldn't be one and one thousand twenty fourth\nThey had it

to little song here which might be politically incorrect but hold on I guess not in a second first\nSome news that has broken in the last\nHalf an hour or so here [noise] a CNN is reporting\nThey're claiming that there are two sources\nThat are claiming that ... and by the way this is a flashing on average now tour was a little while ago in big red letters a big red fond of the reports are the Saudis are getting ready to admit\nThat the mall could show gave the U.S permanent resident who\nFor the Washington Post at the Saudis are going to admit that he did die in their custody\nWell that means the facilities they lied to President Trump is President Trump was on the phone with the Saudi king and all we had nothing to do with this well then they uh initially like you know what's happened here folks\nIs the Saudis had no idea that this thing was going to explode into this kind of a story\nThe Saudis had no idea that this was going to be an international press conflict ration of oh my God they killed vis vis a vis a Saudi national or who has permanent us resident status his kids are us citizens\nAnd he was just popping into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey to get papers for a marriage license to marry his fiance\nWho is waiting outside so here's the story according to what CNN is going to report the deaf was the result of an interrogation gone bad so they were planning on interrogating him\nAnd something happened now they go\nThere were a couple of other stories and sources that are popping up here\nAnd if you click on\nIf you go to the drudge link that takes you to Jake Tapper Z a Twitter feed so top a drudge right now in red font reports Saudi to admit killing journalist\nDuring interrogation so again with the Saudis things have gotten so out of hand they had no idea of this thing was going to be this humongous so the story on the world stage and us any journalistic organization worldwide they're not going to stand for this and they're going to make a big deal at one of their own\nWas taken out by a ... a government by a governmental entity so that's going to be the\nClaim and I'm sure they're gonna try to paint it on one of the interrogation team members that it went too far it got on a hand this wasn't our intent\nBut they realize that they were backed into a corner that they couldn't deny this ... he was denied that I Know I we did nothing I we didn't kilometer ... this is there's no way of the Saudi king tells is the President Trump in a phone call my pump paint on the weight of Saudi Arabia or secretary of state\nSo the Saudis realize oh my God what the hell is we've gotten ourselves into\nOh hang on saying oh my Allah or what the hell we've gotten ourselves into so they ... they clearly\nHad to come clean and now what they're going to do is they get up they're going to absolve themselves as a whole and they're probably going to paint it on ah some of the interrogation team members and then they'll probably make that individual individual sacrificial lambs there'll be punished they'll probably be executed\nWhen in fact uh they probably were doing exactly what they were supposed to do\nMake him disappeared like a Roach Motel to show each activity doesn't check out to the the Saudi conflict so that I'm telling you\nThey realize that oh we there's low we we are in deep all events we can't carry this charade and this lie on any further we've got to just come clean [noise]\nAll right so I promise that I Would come back with a little music and of course we're talking about the whole list was Warren's situation and I've got the Trump audio from the rally back in July which is a key here and it really is fascinating audio to listen to\nI didn't say that I didn't\nDidn't get better read it again [noise] [noise]\nYeah I actually did say it but I just don't think that that little bitty ISI we'd see potential sliver [laughter] he's worth a million dollars win or lose with war and wouldn't even qualify for Native American benefits in fact\nI have I have a a whole listing here of Native American DNA requirements\nWhich this is fascinating\nAnd I'll get to that coming up it's probably going to be our number two and again we have got a lot of ground to cover we've got to talk to some folks are glad their homes destroyed or in the panhandle we've got to deal with the latest

percent Native American which is and that's going to be far outskirts of of the solar system folks I mean that's that's crazy and let's do this and every line is jammed here but the question is I think it's a very good question\n[noise] with that said Trump\nHave to pay the million dollars even if there was a tiny thread or or should the benchmark or the threshold be that she has to be at

be from the the mic a suitcase fry those are the the Florida\nIndians are they run a lot of the casinos hard rocks for instance make a silky a there's a Mississippi banned the Choctaw I was I'm not going down the whole list here but you've got a Indian or groups that require fifty percent one and a half blood caught the meaning one of your parents\nUh is is a Native American then you've got a twenty five percent\nSo I'm looking for the tribes of which Elizabeth Warren claims to be of dissent and she has said Cherokee and Delaware\nSo looking here are looking for Cherokee and sharing key [laughter] okay I found Delaware so the Delaware Nation\nA which is a Delaware Nation Oklahoma which is one of the her claims you have to be twelve point five percent one eighth blood clot demeaning one great grandparent\nShe doesn't even remotely qualify for a fact\nTwelve point five percent not even close so then she also claims Cherokee now if I look down and I'm looking for Cherokee now\nFor a Cherokee that for a living will descent I'm\nLooking for Cherokee on my list and I thought I had a a highlight here we go uh Cherokee\nNation is six point two five percent or one six have blood quantum I guess she doesn't even remotely qualify for a fact [laughter] you got to hear this this is from a Fox Report Warren might\nEven be less Native American than the average European American this is what I was mentioning this last hour that I read this uh before the CEO Warren might even be less Native American than the average European American\nRepublican National committee spokesman Mike Green set in a statement today Monday he also called a twenty four teams studying the ports Warren's claims in perspective\nThe study published by a team of scientists in late twenties fourteen and featured I'm In New York times amounted to the largest ever genetic profile of the U.S based on one hundred and sixty thousand people\nThe study examined the average Native American ancestry four Americans including European African and Latino Americans according to the times report in New York Times failing New York times\nAbout it but if Trump closest it won't be the failing New York times that according to the times report on the study which can be found on the national institutes of health website\nEuropean Americans had genomes that were on average Ninety eight point six percent European point nine percent African and point one eight percent Native American\nForeign Latino America as the average percentage of Native American ancestry was Eighteen percent well African Americans average was point eight percent\nSo if Warren is ten generations removed from a Native American ancestor she would be no more Native American than point zero nine percent\nThan any other group study the research so on the outs that there are actual Americans\nThat\nAre more Native American that her claims that don't even remotely there knowing or even climate so\nShe might be less nave American than the average American of European descent by more Native American in European American uh individuals or who descend from Europeans [noise] [laughter] [noise] [laughter] and they\nThink it's a good idea ever tell this\nHoly crap I let me grab some calls here 'cause phones are loaded I still have to get to the Native American DNA requirements some fascinating stuff came up

sixteenth nowadays not on a corner one and one thousand twenty four on the outside if she falls or if the descendants or or six to ten generations back\nThen that brings to the to the one and one uh\nOne and one thousand twenty fourth between six and ten generations ten being the outset a and six being just one thirty second even at one thirty seconds and qualify as I get to the man for the

Fort Myers Florida Rebecca you are on Schmidt welcome to the program\nThank you\nAnd Rebecca your thoughts are should Trump have to pay the million bucks to her favorite charity\nWell the whole thing is arguing Symantec if he said if you can prove that you are part Indian she got him she proved that now for the rest of that\nIt's absolutely ridiculous the small amount it couldn't you know no affirmative action yes you have to be a certain percentage to get anything but he asked he said if you can prove that you are at all you know they can unseat any one what is in fact when I was in twenty four\nYear again it's semantics she\nGot him he didn't he didn't say you have to qualify for your tribe wherever he said you have to prove that you're Indian she proved ... he's got to pay up to her charity or well ...\nI but Rebecca let me come back at you with this\nShould they have to be an independent verification men\nWould probably be within his right to say okay so you use this uh this bustamante guy certainly he's got a very impressive resume and and see me but if you don't mind we'd like to do two additional DNA tests and see how they come back\nTo it's like a second and third opinion if a million bucks is on the line do you think that there ought to be a a a ... a control or should there be a at least verification from a different uh testing source\nI don't think there's anything wrong with going out and get him verification if she thinks she's Indian or he's going to stand by it and what did she care how many tests are going to be done and then I was going to come out that she's a smart Gen that's all she needs that how he worried now that\nYou know I mean yeah try to get anything affirmative action all that she doesn't qualify for any that that's

fortunate sons some day never comes more on the\nBody it came out of the sky proud Mary [noise]\nAs long as I can see the light but a lot of calls\nFor that particular show [noise]\nI feel like oh man see are kind of writing the sweet spot\nYou know we were told there was a blue wave coming [noise]\nIt's almost as if the Democrats and their friends in the media were predicting it in hopes that they could will it to happen\nBut when you get closer and closer to election time what you find is that the people\nWho operate the major media outlets live on the coasts and everybody they know everybody they know hates Trump and wants him out wants him impeached\nThese echo chambers can be very very negative for\nGetting perspective and that's what you saw when on election night\nYou saw the tears streaming down people were shocked the left was shocked\nHow could it be that Hillary lost every body they knew who loved Hillary\nHow good it how could it be\nThat if everybody loved Hillary she didn't win the election because everybody I Know loves Hillary except that's exactly right you're out of touch 'cause you're on the coast\nWell\nThat's what happened with the blue wave that I think is going to end up having petered out and I give you a good example you take this Christensen name all\nIn Arizona she was neck and neck with Martha McSally and then things started coming out that ...\nShe doesn't actually like the state of Arizona she doesn't like the people in Arizona remember this one that came out\n... than that very well that that they started a laboratory that's democracy and then my favorite science and math\n\nHave had that line someone at any have read it but I'm happy I feel it and use all the time I\nUse it all the time that's what you referred to your ... you want to represent these people in Washington DC you want to be the face of Arizona and you think it's the meth lab of democracy well this one has emerged now\nDo they do not what's happening in Arizona and not a good way hey we're not seen is that going to get my favorite kind of making it then the low here in ... famous man\nShe refers to the people in the states she wanted to represent and guess what it made her unpopular I Wish the Democrats would\nDo what they do after they lose a wish they would do that before the election of course they won't they don't want people to know what they really think but if they did boy oh boy would it be powerful you\nKnow Hillary Clinton after she lost she went on a tour does she's all always need more money markets they must chew through a lot of money\nAnd after after\nShe lost she went out and she talked about white women in how stupid white women are and they just do what their husbands tell them\nSee if I have that Ramon did you did you text me or email me that report this morning on on white women voting alright let me see if I can pull that up\nBecause we're back to where we were in two thousand here we go where the soccer mom was the or the white suburban woman was going to determine that election [noise]\nTwenty one days for the midterms white women in past midterms in two thousand six they made up forty percent of the voters\nAnd they went fifty to forty nine for Republicans\nIn two thousand ten they made up forty percent of the electorate and they went fifty eight thirty nine now for Republicans and in two thousand fourteen they made up thirty eight percent of the electorate but they went fifty six forty two for Republicans\nSo do you see why Democrats are trying so hard to make white male Republicans look like rapists because they need white women voters\nAnd I don't think they're going to get them\nHope to see you tonight at our a\nDebate watch party have a beer [noise]\n\nLoves Ted Cruz and good
