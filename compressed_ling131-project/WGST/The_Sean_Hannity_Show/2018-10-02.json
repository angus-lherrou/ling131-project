Saturday right twenty ninth Saturday and one forty six in the afternoon D.C McAllister\nWho has a verify Twitter account to visit or a Twitter check mark she wrote on Twitter Christine Blasey Ford was a classmate of mine that UNC\nWe graduated in Nineteen eighty eight I Want to ask Christine if she remembers partying at trolls drinking at he's not here hooking up with guys that hinders in St\nEating it tight out ... remember those days Christine Tell us about them so this is a a snarky tweet from another female who went to school was Christine Blasey Ford at the University of North

four thousand times it's been commented on Seventeen thousand times it has been like fifty eight thousand times\nAnd then as I scroll up and I look at these other tweets from this D.C McAllister\n\nI Want to know about Christine's high school and college years we've unpack capitals from high school and college how 'bout hers if characters on the line in his he said she said circus let's expose everybody ones and there are\nSometimes I like to think back to simpler times\nWay back to the original Kavanaugh hearings when Xena bash was accused of being a white supremacist for the way her hand rested remember that the circle the okay son\nWhen her her hand was resting on her arm she was a white supremacist remember all the articles about that and have it all was accused of snapping a Parkland victim's father how quaint it all seems now\nThis is sick not a game it's truly sick what\nWe're watching\nWe're watching we're watching the creation out of whole cloth of allegations that could send people to prison\nFor decades and nobody even believes them that's just it nobody actually believes this nonsense I'm not a person\nWho wants one party rule in this country that's not healthy I don't want the media destroyed I studied our system well enough to understand that you need ... you need checks and balances\nWhat we're watching as the wholesale destruction of the left and the media\nBy self immolation\nAnd make no mistake make no mistake I Hope they were routed in the polls\nI Hope they suffer so horribly in the polls that somebody on that side says wait a minute we're not going to allow Maxine Waters to call for riots\nWere not going to surround the president's press secretary and run her out of restaurants we're going to call on those sorts of people to stop this nonsense we're not going to have Steve ... shot on a congressional softball field\nAnd in short order afterwards brag about how we're going to intimidate them we're going to stop assuming\nThat because the Republicans disagree with us on immigration policies that their murdering children and we're going to call for the intimidation and brutalization of them\nBecause that's what has to happen now these people have to be forced to Institute some decency on their side\nJeff Flake getting into an elevator he's one of one hundred senators I don't like him but what if that woman gets in that

if they blind him\nWhat if they break his jaw knocked some teeth loose what if that had been done to Ted Cruz or his wife that's what they're calling for they don't know who they are encouraging these aren't rational people\nThe kinds of people who answered the call when you put out the clarion call to intimidate Republicans because they're Nazis what do you do\n\nYou call upon people to someone a strength to defeat Hitler we\nAll have buried in the recesses of our minds visit to the and Frank memorial\nWe all have buried in the recesses of our minds that late Saturday Night when we watched Schindler's List and we felt helpless\nHow could this happen\nHow could innocence be so destroyed how could women be harmed in this way how could children be driven to their deaths how could gas chambers be created and then used what kind of monsters would do this\nAnd then you call upon that vivid imagery and you call upon the desire to right the wrongs of history and then you cast your current enemies in the light of those gas chamber monitors and guards\nAnd assassins\nYou're no longer disagreeing with\nAn idiot logical position that's a call to arms\nYou're basically saying we've got to have a violent revolution you're using the language of violent revolution\nThis doesn't in well folks\nIt does not end well and I don't want that for my country 'cause I don't want innocent people getting hurt on either side of the political divide\nAnd they know what they're doing\nThey know what they're doing they're playing upon fears they're planning upon anger and they're playing upon for the disaffected the kind of person who shoots Steve ... a guy who's his marriage is not going well as career is not going well\nThese disaffected he the kinds of people who under take those
