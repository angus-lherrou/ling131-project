{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "This week is focusing on leans in Florida a federal law enforcement source said the\nThursday today\nSo Florida I'm Wondering if they've narrowed down I I was trying to think what what point does it couldn't be imposed marked\n'cause ah some of the package as you can see a post Mart or a partial post Mark I'm wondering if they have enough of a post marked able to save the ZIP Code of origin Asian where it was canceled a et cetera but I'm Wondering if\n\nIf anything as far as the return address the Debbie Wasserman Schultz if that some kind of clue there on how quickly she got the package where it was male for I don't know\nI'm just wondering how they decided on Florida is a potential lead on where these packages could have been male as it doesn't mean that the bombers from Florida bummer can be from\nSomewhere else build the bombs in driving and mail them from a location I mean all these tricks that trying to throw people off the trail\nA loss of there's a lot to talk about today eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine gets you on the program radio listeners TV viewers wherever you are would love to have you on the program eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine that we can talk about the conspiracy theories we can talk about you know the the false flag suggestions which again I'm not subscribing to any of this\nI'm going to wait for the investigation there's going to be a troll vague treasure trove of details and information and evidence you know we talked yesterday about as simple as the scotch tape\nThe scotch tape that was used to a fix these\nLaser printer or a check in Jeddah print addresses and return addresses looked like it was printed on you know normal you know copy bond and then you know cut out ... and to our rectangles and then placed on to them and they'll ah padded novel ups and then just taped\nMe any game\nA finger nail a skim pieces hair\nI can be DNA evidence under the tape on the forever stamps which I pointed out yesterday that those those are American flag forever stamps\nOr who knows fingerprints any kind of DNA um components I mean if if ten bombs were sent you've got for instance ten of these digital clock timers\nWhere does someone get ten of these are the all the same so all the components if there was repetition and components\nIs someone gonna be able to say Oh yes some guy bought nine of these are Kennedys or twelve of these clocks and at a hardware store electronics place or a ordered online yeah there's just so many avenues of investigation I Can't even think of all the possible avenues but I think that they're going to figure out\nWho this is\nFairly shortly that's my guess I see already on hold we have a caller that says that he thinks I'm wrong at the purpose is going to be found I hey I I Want to get into all of there's a lot of detail here I'll give you the the ten bombs now there are two new recipients\nAre confirmed today that receive these bomb packages I'll get to that momentarily I've got audio I Want to play President Trump at the rally last night is getting some attention speaking of the president the president tweeted out\nOr not about the bombing something unrelated this is regarding the caravan and then I just want to give you a little breaking caravan news and then we'll go back to the the the package bombs being sent\nThe president tweeted out literally a forty minutes ago\nAt two thirty one pm eastern time today the twenty fifth of October\nOr from at real Donald Trump's Twitter account the president tweeted\nTo vote was the um the caravan turn around we are not letting people into the United states illegally go back to your country and if you want to apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing exclamation point\n\nI don't have a problem with this week this week is up\nOn the money what what is wrong answers to those and they can then turn around we're not letting you and you're not coming into the country illegally what is wrong with this week I Want any President Obama was we played that Obama audio from when he was a senator\nTalking about we won't tolerate the illegal ah migrations into this country and you know come to this country the correct way we have the Obama and Trump that green tweeted this Obama audio from a before he was president so when he was a senator what oh six oh seven whatever was [noise]\nAnd at the president's a hundred percent right [noise]\nWith this particular tweet also we have a\nDetails about James Mattis or\nTo send probes to Mexico border over immigrant the caravan\nOf the latest now on this from ah various wire services as at\nLeast eight hundred US troops\nWill be sent to the U.S Mexico border in response to this caravan which\nLets them some reports have the caravan and fourteen thousand now as it's it's like one of those cartoons snowballs going downhill we got all kinds of boulders and houses and arms and legs hanging out of the things that the second migrant care of and that was over a thousand strong we heard about you know a traipsing through a a Guatemala\nSo took care of ads that they could burns to make a super caravan\nThough or we'll get into more detail on this later on during the course of the program the bombs\n[noise] we have ten devices at this point\nSo we know about the Clinton who's got a device in chapel claw in Westchester County New York and uh that apparently bill was home Hillary was not there I don't think they spend too much tied together a\nSo one bomb to the Clintons the Obamas got the bomb and uh the device at the end of course the Clinton package was intercepted the Obamas a package was sent to the Washington home also intercepted so Clinton's Obama's Maxine Waters\nUh she received two packages or they would address to her Maxine Waters one was intercepted at the Capitol Hill a congressional mail center a that was in Capitol heights Maryland so far a off campus for them and also in Los Angeles oh Maxine Waters recipient of\nTwo we had of course the Eric Holder package which then was on deliverable and apparently I I think that was due to insufficient postage or miss address one of them at insufficient postage and I and I have a picture that\nAre so and that package to Eric Holder was then sent back to the center which the bogus a spoof a return to sender turned out to be a Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nI'm Sorry shows a and her sunrise Florida office we know that the original package went to George Soros his house they believe that was handled liver and they find a courier find out who drop this thing off a we have of course the John Brennan\nAddressed package which then there was delivered to CNN they also think that was courier over and then of course cause the evacuation of uh the CNN New York headquarters and the whole Time Warner center and that was the big mess yesterday and then the two new packages are as follows Robert Deniro\nGot a package at his uh try back a film productions office him fry back to lower Manhattan just you know below canal fried that can mean the triangle below canal\nInvestigators believe some of the ten bombs wouldn't have exploded because of flaws the FBI is not sure whether the bomb maker intentionally made the bombs unworkable or if it was a mistake and YPG commissioner James O'Neill said while the city is safe folks should remain vigilant as the investigation into the suspicious packages continues\nWe're investigating all of this with great precision but I can say with certainty that we will identifying arrest a person or people responsible for these acts\nMayor Bill de Blasio joined other officials in praising the work of first

doesn't make any sense from that point of view just for a talking point the second one is\nI'm thinking that maybe is ISIS it's China it's Iran nobody seems to be giving that us thought or even a talking point about and I want to know your thoughts on that\nWell you'll have fallen out and in fact I mentioned this yesterday is just throwing out possibilities\nI'm like hey I don't know what could be the Russians the Russians have you know proven to interfere in our life choose you know the Chinese are also interfering as well uh who wants to be the the Chinese could be the Russians and you know trying to cause turmoil prior to our elections\nSounds more like a like an ISIS or its allies bond thing if they were going to be anybody\nYou know there are just some weird aspect and speaking of ISIS the you see that there was a kind of an ISIS flag spoof that was included ... at least on one of the devices did did you see that\nYeah I did it was reported this morning and\nYou know I don't know we're just going to have to wait and see but you know Democrats gotta stop throwing the mud at Trump you know I mean chicken when they're down ... civil get in their faces soon as they hit the streets you the Republican yell at him yeah wouldn't be surprised if somebody finally got yelled at and went off\nBy but also I mean I think Trump on a tone it down as well I think that he ought to bank on some I think he ought to back off some of the rhetoric as well\nI think they ought to stand up a forum Schumer Nancy Trump and all of them should just stand up together on one stage and say enough is enough\nAh hey John in San Diego beautiful part of the country thanks for the call I Would have the the migraine ... are you going to let them into your house\nNo I just want

his style as you want to agree with me want to disagree with me eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine as\nFar as ISIS and this is so much crap it's already come out on this so there was an ISIS a parity flag a fix to one of the devices\nAnd that was the device sent to John Brennan the former CIA director address care of CNN in Columbus Circle in Manhattan yesterday and apparently the ISIS flag was printed out on some printing device and then a fixed\nTo the bomb and it was an ISIS flag parity\nFrom a movie and Internet piece of artwork me that has been circulating for three four years I think it goes back to a twenty four team\nAnd uh the instead of having the ISIS a print in Arabic whatever language it is a it shows in sort of\nA an Arabic looking font it says get her done like ... year to year good like ... you know Larry the cable guy his act and\nThen it also had a the silhouette outline and you don't you know the chrome truck mud flap lady you know what I'm\nTalking about on the back of trucks you see them every once in a while I was probably not a very a politically correct in the meat to generation here but the the trucker mud flaps\nWith the the the hourglass figured book some woman with a very thin waist sitting down with her arms that are aside and it's the side profile and they're cutting out a crow\nAnd they they they made their their appearance I think back in the seventies historically as as crook mug flap weights and you see them\nThere there are a lot of times they're chrome and it's just the naked ladies city and there was also with this this ISIS flag looking replica get her done also had a three of these women are two sitting down or you know back to back you left profile right profile and then there was um\nA one standing up or you know different versions so [laughter] you know here we we've got an I ... a flag parity we've got the return address being that Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nYeah so there's get her done ISIS flight thing was done back apparently in twenty fourteen by a world news bureau which is described as a a right wing parity website and you know it wasn't very prevalent but that's where they think this thing came from\nThe war that was the inspiration for it\nSo I mean who is dealing with we just don't know what I tell you what\nI'm thinking about getting some chromosome flaps with the lady on my car but if it makes it a little mini versions that can stick back there that's classy stuff uh eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine let me grab Rick records in Largo, Florida Rick Iran Schmidt him and what do you have\nOkay well it's not Debbie profile that's for sure [laughter] but anyway you know and yeah it's not\n[laughter] um that's probably I was used in Russian intelligence with a Chinese material um I'm Obama and Clinton oh the president's why would Trump have to call them and say hey we're working on and doing our thing they know the procedure they know what's going on and secondly I'm not going\nA word but would uh you know should Trump say hey happened to narrow what's up you know I hear yeah you know what\nYou're back color could Granger duck on to see for yourself Granger are the ones who get it done\n[noise]\nNews radio I'm Brian shook New York's\nTime Warner center is being evacuated due to a report of a suspicious package it's the second time in two days to

return to NBC they did a rerun today we'll get into that and just a minute I just finished up on the audio by Iran\nAt a time I thought I had a little more time to get it in so I Want to pick up where I left off\nAnd this is the MSNBC is Ben Collins and he's talking about that little ISIS parity flag\nWith the two uh the the three women are two of them patterned after that chrome a female mud flap a silhouette of the book some woman sitting down and you'll see on the back of trucks or mud flats from time to time\nAnd that was apparently flag and ISIS ending and instead of the Arabic or ISIS inscription it says get are done in a well sort of a a farm that resembles that so there was\nThis some kind of an accounting parity aspect to whoever put these\nThese devices together at least on one of them with his eyes his parents who was talking about the ISIS parity flag and\nWhere it came about and there was a you know I'm an Internet means started by a guy in Arizona back in twenty fourteen and then\nHe starts to allude to the fact of the person\nWho could be involved here well they view a certain website they watch a certain TV network here is the remainder of the audio clip\nIt's been around like conservative like Web forums not like the young people like for a chance of I'm Talking like you know people who follow the Drudge Report and Fox News and stuff like that it's that sort of circle\nReally so the the ISIS parity or maybe\nThe fact that the guy or whoever I'm sure it's a guy that put the seem to get a grab that ISIS parity thing that was a mean and I never saw that I I I knew all kinds of stuff I see more stuff on a daily basis than Ninety nine percent of Americans most likely because of the nature of my job I haven't seen this parody\nSo it's very obscure I'll tell
