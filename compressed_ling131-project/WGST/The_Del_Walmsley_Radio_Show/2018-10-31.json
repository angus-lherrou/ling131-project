and tackle this so that we can own a house you know within\nFive or six years mhm um it was probably may this year I bought a two thousand Eighteen for runner and to upgrade it package so it was like forty one thousand we put eleven thousand down with\nA trade in and everything I'm about thirty five thousand on it together we have about twenty thousand in savings ... uh she essentially what I got from her that she kind of wants to skip\nThe baby step three that she doesn't have any other day that there are only ... the foreigner in the house mhm um she kind of life gets the baby step three to\nRepair to get out and so that would put her pain you know the normal mortgage and he um gets that all my bills that we have in saving everything else until she gets out another she's still a few teachers ads on the side as well so she's got additional income what's your question um\nI wanted to know if we should tackle this foreigner together mhm\nAnd get this thirty five thousand out of the way ... or if you think that we just keep going about it the way they were going to let her continued to save and then meet tackled a foreigner and that eventually when she\nI think you're running your actual tension that occurs when you're trying to act like you're married but you're not\nYou 'cause you're vacillating back and forth between acting like a married couple are acting like room mates\nAnd your and your ... so it's my bills her bills my bills her bills but we did this and we did that and yeah under in a legal sense from ... from the law perspective there's not a week\nYeah you have a roommate from ... from the perspective of the law you see what I'm saying and so if if she decides to walk out the door whoever's names are on these things or who's going to be holding the bag\nWhoever's yeah named savings accounts which can be there so you're in relation Lee you're struggling back and forth and vacillating so um you guys can do what you want to do obviously you're grown ups and you've done very well you're making a hundred and twenty year congratulations [noise]\nUm you called and asked me so I Will tell you what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes okay yeah\nI Would get married tomorrow and then there would be no you're for one runner your savings account you're this it would only be we and then I Would work the baby steps exactly as prescribed\nOkay so what I Would do I think you're making really good money I think you pay the stupid for rent or off or get rid of it before she gets out and I won't hurt or another I Want her to line up her career\nOr for what she's going to do as she comes out of the military but you ... the thing is you you just can't vacillate between\nYou know looking in the refrigerator and going well that's my mustard how 'bout that mustard\nUm you know back in ... or no that's our mustard because we're we're doing this together oh why can't decide and there's there's just polls at people part is um there's all kind of statistical research that shows you're going to\nHave substandard results in your finances as well as other areas of your life until you put marriage in the equation\nAnd so you do what you want to do I'm I'm just an old guy advising you I've got several reasons for that advice but um that's what I Would tell you to do\nIf you were my little brother that's what I Would tell you to do I'd say get married and stop trying to play both sides of this coin just do it and you know you've been together forever anyway you do in life together it's a technicality really but then you have to say from that point forward\nWe we have a foreigner we have a house we have a savings account we have a plan we are going to submit ourselves to the baby steps we are going to stick with this we are going to go that route\nAnd and you become French at that point we week right [laughter] and so that that's what I Would do it cleans up everything and then walk ride down it and if you want to say well\nYou know we're facing an emergency with the loss of her income and so we're not going to work the baby steps right now we're just going to pile of cash and get ready for a baby step that's not really skipping the baby step three that's just saying we're not gonna do anything right now in pile of money if you want to make that decision you can 'cause you're panicked about the loss of her income\nI don't think I'm panicked about the loss of her income though I'm\nPlaying because a I think she's going to have another income lined up she's got from now the June to figure that out and be I don't know what percentage of your income she of our income once were married that she represents so that that's the other thing you gotta look at the variable will is with us in California Hi Will welcome to the Ramsey show\nA day if they're driving me sure what's up for\nWhat I've got a four home that I own a three hour rentals at this point uh was I was my primary residence two of those trials are paid off and the third I owe about one Seventy on I guess my question is\nI have the cash to pay that a rental property off completely [laughter] um [noise] wondering if I should versus what the ultimate goal is to get more investment properties so I was wondering what your thoughts are about\n... is the ultimate goal to have a bunch of investment properties and a bunch of debt on them or a bunch of investment properties that are paid for\nA pay for of course okay then let's start with that\nOkay that's what I did\nUm the second time the first time I did my last and everything but the second time I don't borrow money and more and so\nBut I I you know paid off all my properties and I used the increased cash flow that was resulting to buy the next property and by the next one and of course every time you buy another one you got that much more cash flow the debt free cash does I mean these things cash brought like crazy when you don't have that\nRight [noise] right changes ... how much do you do your residence\nOr my primary it's about two forty okay the rental rental is one Seventy and you have how much cash not true twenty okay we'll pay off my primary first\nOff the primary first yep yep\nAnd are either way what the either way you're encouraging ... well the reason is simply this year your heart is part of this equation it's not simply a math equation\nUh and when you're homeless paid off for you think differently you can't keep yourself from doing it you will make different decisions um it ... it calms you down\nUm you know you just chill and not in a way where you lose your ambition or something like that but um you relax or because you're walking around the back yard when their shoes on and you're it if the grass field different on your feet\nThe bar or really is labor the lender I've experienced that and I've had many many many people experience it over the years that I've talked to millions of people\nAnd of course that frees up that two thousand or whatever dollars a month what's your household income\nOr about one forty five good you've been doing great how old are you a forty four\nYou're doing well doing very very well so either way out\nWithout these psychological I guess it's kind of what your cars that are there that right on that has money on it oh you should be and my primary residence and probably will be good at some point so if you take the emotional equation out of it doesn't matter which one you pay off versus the other\nThe emotional equations part of the equation\n[noise] so yes it matters is personal finances personal it's not just finance ... when you try to do your wealth building process and don't involve behavior and don't involve relationships and don't involve emotions and don't involve spirit your spiritual um\nYou're you're you're you've got a substandard plan if you're doing it only on my off\nAnd you're gonna miss it\nYou do whatever you want they will shut down the progress but if I were you that's what I wanted to focus our that I've Ramsey show in the Bush will be back with you before you know in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial piece less

sprinkler heads on fixing it because if it was all dry you would use water more if it was all wet you would water less\nBut during the same so\nI just wanted to go out there to investigate head by head by head on the sprinkler system\nYou know what was wrong it would I found was two of the sprinkler heads were completely broken and that's why battle these two areas were completely debt because the sprinkler heads were broken\nFound on the other one the sprinkler heads were leaking\nAnd I also found by research\nThat some of the ... way too large for the small amount of barrier that they're

earlier about you having the right plan financially\nYou got to get the right plan that's why you come someplace like lifestyles you get the plan of how does how does this stuff work what should I be doing what does it work what does work and then you've taken you work through all these different suggestions in your personal situation and see what's happening like\nWe're talking about income here

my\nProcess to my home and my business has the same way I look at what is the dead weight dead weight in my life takes up my life\nSo I was given a a thought process early on in life from my dad said um it's not what it costs to buy something when it costs to maintain that something if you look at your situation go for where you're at financially in your life right now is it worth it for you to have that big giant home\nIs that really the right thing to be doing at this point you know\nMaybe the kids are all God you don't need that big home anymore\nWhy not should that get rid of some of the expense and that maintenance both time and energy and money in maintenance of that big home you got two or three or four cars do you really need two or three or four cars I'm it's ridiculous ... I've had as many as six cars\nAre down to four and I'm thinking about getting rid of one of them I've ever drive it or the other three a completely different vehicles that I actually need all three different kinds of vehicles the fourth one is a sports car I never drivers sports car I'm sixty two years old but happily relationship\nThere's no need to go out on the town and show off or I don't need to prove that it's successful as a business person so I don't need to have a Porsche Ferrari or mind is of a Mercedes I sell\nWhatever sports\nA convertible five fifty or whatever just\nUnbelievably fast car with the ... you know real ... comes off or actually removes itself whatever convertible convertible Ruth industry I showed no real interest I don't even know the names of the stuff in it because I don't even drive and I picked it up one time 'cause I could steal it\nBecause I had something else and trade that I could care for it in your brand new and I figured okay I might as well pick it up [noise] um\nAnd I drove it has a problem with it but it's just really a waste of my time\n[noise] uh I go out to my garage the same thing I got stuff in my garage that I'd never use I've had it for years um it was a project started that never finished the project they finished but stuff left over a all that stuff just gets in your way just slows you down\nAnd you have to take care of it you have to maintain you have to moving cleaned around and clean hundred [noise]\nUm\nWhen I was going through the irrigation situation what I thought was\nIs it I was actually wasting water I was an era gaining above and beyond I figured you know the old thermostat problem\nYou know you sit there and said to the temperature you want it will irrigation system you don't really know what that about is and so you either seen your places to dry and turn it up where you see the places too low you turn it down\nI'm Sorry you you're too much water and you're turning down\nThe problem is you don't know how 'bout you turn in either direction the wise thing to do is to start out\nAnd start moving slowly but surely not crank it all the way up and get now you generally crank it all the way up to if you got to really dry why'd you wanna make sure gets enough water to try to come back but you can't leave it there you got to crank it back down again because once you've got it growing in saturated now you're going to get it\nAh ... keep it so whether you're going to get mould and so on and so forth so it's a it's a balancing act guys you got to stay on top and but we are talking about this just one zone in my house so I now\nI'm working my way out of that so right so you're working your way out of okay what are we going to do with this extra car that's extra car payment we don't need what are we going to do with the you know we've got four hundred stations or cable we only watch the same ten stations every single time [noise] uh you know do we really need all that are just\nAll this stuff in your life you're wasting money it's just a waste that you don't really need to do [noise] um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "31"}
