I mean something's got to give here I don't know what it is but something's got to do and so if you sold a Twenty one thousand dollar car where'd you get your values are those private sale values are wholesale or a dealer all for what\nAre those are trade and values\nOkay so you could actually sell them for more than that possibly yes how's your credit oh no you definitely could encourage you sell it for more than ...\n... value I mean you saw it for a price sale amount on Craig's list so um how's your credit\nI'm lying in the tank I went through a divorce couple of years ago\nI heard your oh there's money to these these two Carlin's where the loans\n\nUm I Believe they're both through Ford Motor credit for\nIt so you've not got any easy way to finance the difference\nUh well my wife for credit scores about an eight hundred\nOkay she would just do it all and her name then\nYes uh-huh okay\nAnd you don't you're going to drive the five hundred dollar cars one driver and then there's other cardio is going to be your second driver\nYes uh-huh okay\nAnd so if you sold the Twenty one thousand dollar car for twenty ... twenty four\nThat gives you about three to throw at the oh the deal and the Eighteen is probably worth more like Twenty one or twenty two shows on one man and the whole if those were trading values um managed to raise your only about six and the whole here\nUm that's yeah that's not the end of the world um\nI I Would only do that if I moved down into a car that had a value of under ten thousand dollars\nOkay and when you're in the problem with your trading them in is you're not going to get as much for them so that part I'm really not up for I'll tell you what let's don't do that let's uh let's sell the Twenty one thousand dollar car that's worth actually more than Twenty one\nAnd by our bike you try to sell it for me I'm going to gas and say let's say for instance it would bring twenty twenty four that puts three in your pocket unless spot three thousand dollar car with that\nOK okay\nAnd um then let's get the other car sold for as much as it will sell for and just borrow the difference from the credit union in your wife's name was her credit ...\nAnd I get your three dollar car in a hoop the but she got still got Seventy thousand dollars over here to deal with a student loans much you're making one twenty six so you can do that and within a couple of years easy Eighteen months or so and so then we're going to move up and car once we're out of debt and have your emergency found in place\nSo we're not going to drive these ... but maybe two years is what it sounds like maybe two two and a half years okay\nOkay and that gets you clear but you yeah your car poor you have a car mess on your hands are right to observe that\nAnd um\nYou know at a minimum I'm getting rid of one of them but I I like your idea of getting rid of both of them if you were to do a trade in with the dealer though you're going to make a lot less on these cars because they're going to give you trade in that's all they do and it's not because they're evil or something they just have turned ... Carmichael profit they don't they're not in the break even business during the profit business\nAnd so um you know a trade in through a dealer probably not going to help you achieve your goals nearly as fast they could throw a difference in five or six thousand bucks in this discussion\nEasy if not more the difference in trade in value improv a sale on these two vehicles Tracy is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Tracey how are you\nDoing very good um I Am here I did buy your book here no I didn't like the whole ... and buy it currently Iran I got\nYou by I ... and then the total

hitting here um I had my fill it out for here mark and I should have about a hundred ... ... ... not not hurting like any money or anything like that it back and forth\nBut how much I couldn't quite a thousand dollar ... correct they live in a category [laughter]\nI Know now it's time to read the books that you bought the book the book\nThe total money make over will explain to you exactly how to take your baby steps\nAnd I'm the first thing we're going to get current with everyone and get on a written budget you don't have a detailed budget yet you've just got along I got a little list that you've made but you don't even got car gas on your list yet so you don't ... budget yet you need to do that the an easy way to do that is go to every dollar dot com\nAnd download the app for your iPhone or your eye pad or hurt\nSure your iPhone or your Android or you can put it on your desktop and it's free to use every dollar and every dollar will help to put together your budget in about ten minutes so the first thing is to get a detailed written budget that you do in the new one every single month\nThe second thing you've got to do as a part of doing that budget you have to have your husband involved\nYou have to be an agreement if you're not an agreement and both of you pulling this wagon the gather you're going to get really tired of pulling the wagon by yourself\nYou have to have unity you have to have agreement in order to win money it's almost impossible to do it with one spouse by themselves\nSo a budget that your spouse or knew both of looked at and you both agree to on every dollar dot com now when you've got that and your current with your bills the first goal\nIs to save a thousand dollars ...\nJust save a thousand dollars for all the money you can squeeze out

their income\nAnd so if they want to do something you know what if I wanted to be I just love cleaning toilets what if that was going to be my career\nWhat if I loved helping people out down at the shelter that's because that's what I wanted to give back to society I have the right to make that choice but I Do not have the right for society than\nTo be for me to demand of society to allow me to live like someone who went out and got a good job made a lot of money or had great investments\nSo it is then thinking it's not their fault it really irritates me I Know you guys would list is right now you're going oh that's so mean it's not mean age humanly normal to believe you should take care of yourself\nTo think otherwise is a brainwash situation that you're educational system is put you into there is no way\nThat a teacher producers as much value as somebody that makes a million bucks a year somebody making a million bucks a year it's helping thousands and thousands of people get a product get a service gets something of value have a place to live\nAnd the teachers taking kids and teaching math the same thing that we do right here in our home this week we have our annual\nChildren come to grandma's house [noise] and we've got all the children here and the grandchildren so all the children are millennials my fiance Melissa ... generation X. and I'm an old dude\nSo we've got people in the house or sixty two we've got people that are fifty we got a bunch of kids that are under thirty five hundred thirty four and then we got grandkids\nAnd it's so interesting to see how each generation believes more and more and more so they deserve everything\nThe babies the kids scream and yell if they don't get their way and you know that's how they're going to grow up you know that's just society they're growing and joined the parents are ...\nThey know better because they've been taught punishing your kid is bad you go to jail for spanking your kids you
