{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Type effect and the front was\nA landscape to with tremendous amount of stuff\nAnd\nLast year I came to the conclusion that had changed a lot of it it just the plant was in place was wrong I Want you to do that with the thought of hey you wake up you look at your finances you look at your age you go my plan\nIs wrong it is it working\nI think I have a plan I Know what I'm doing I'm putting money my four one K. I'm trying to pay down the house and trying to stay out of debt you know I'm trying to keep up my job get a little bit better do a little more get paid a little more at my job all these things is is your plan for it to plan is working\nAnd my problem with my home\nWas every year we have a freeze only one or two days maybe for the most were the temperatures drop below twenty degrees and for every hour that you're below twenty degrees temperature\nOne quarter of your plants tropical plants die\nSo by the time if it stays under twenty degrees for four to eight hours a whole night\nTheir debt they all die\nAnd so every or replacing all these players along with all the angels uh that had to be replaced every year\nBecause we planning the gardens these angles because they're they come in and stay to the heat in the suburbs and those guys who die off we had to put it in other words you can handle the heat but when he got to be whether they would die off so this is the annual thing so\nWhat is inside was is it going to change the plan from my home\nAnd I changed the plan to go away from tropical and go to an English garden where I can fill it with plants\nThat will survive the winter here answer by the heat of summer\nAnd so I drew up a whole new plan of what I wanted to put in the yard Melissa that I worked on it for hours and hours and hours and came up to a conclusion what we wanted and then we paid a landscaping company to come in and put the plants and so forth and get it to where we wanted to be [noise] now\nAs we did that\nRan out of energy and money before all of the particular gardens and this house has like ten different law owns\nA few of the house she got a front yard a backyard and they're both probably not that big this has ten dry lawns and then it has hundreds of bats flower beds planning beds stuff just blows my mind\nUh there's probably a at least a million dollars with the landscape materials planted in this chard right now and I go through ten twenty thirty thousand every year and I'm trying to change that get it back down to some realistic you know um so I changed the way I was going to do the plan you're going to have to change your plan\nIf you want to get financially become financially free you're going to need to change your plan now in the apartment complex of looking at or that we have purchased\nWe had a plan going in the lead investor this doing the deal had a plan he can see what the other guy's plan how the other guys player was wrong\nAnd now he has a plan that he's going to put in place but even as he puts that plan in place there's tremendous number of obstacles\nAnd so she's going through this thing this first week the obstacles are becoming clear to him things some of which that we're clear before we purchased a property others that were hidden very well until after closing you find about and again it's all the due process of getting through the obstacles\nAnd I kind of wanted to work through this with you today because\nAs a working through this yard thing I sort of figured out the ... the process here and hopefully you can learn to take something from this process\nAnd put it into your process to make things better so the first thing I did was I when I look this of soldiers a secondary problem the landscaping company that I had put in my stuff the plants they did such a poor job uh and\nThey tripled\nThe charge of my landscaping weekly monthly landscaping fees\nAnd so I had to let him go so I had no landscaper for about two months and just had somebody mowing the yard and so all of my bed all my plants were destroyed there was nobody watching my yard and all of a sudden I woke up and it looked out there to go man my arch destroyed looks terrible\nIt's all had to take on the project for would've had to do that\nAnd to put it into perspective something I could deal with and so what I did was divided up into areas\nAnd like I said there's like ten different environments ten different areas in my yard each of these ten different areas has different plant types\nIt has different son ratios from the day or night or from you know all day long what part of it's all sudden full sun parts sun part shade and shade\nAll those are different everyone so everyone has to be dealt with completely on its own\nYou can't just go in there and say I'm going to theoretically get in your fix everything 'cause you can't so I took on the very front part of the law and first because it was almost completely dead\nAnd the beds we are just put in we're looking weak\nUm\nI had a flooded out area there were some sprinkler heads were broken river flooding the yard\nAnd so I had one part of this zone\nWas all dead because it had no water the other part of his own was flooded because it had too much water now trying to figure that without because you can't fix it by turning the zone this ... sprinkler heads on fixing it because if it was all dry you would use water more\nIf it was all wet you would water less\nBut during the same so\nI just wanted to go out there investigate head by head by head on the sprinkler system\nYou know what was wrong and what I found was two of the sprinkler heads were completely broken and that's why that all these two areas were completely debt because the sprinkler heads were broken\nFound on the other one the sprinkler heads were leaking\nAnd I also found by research\nThat some of the ... way too large for the small amount of barrier that they're in\nBecause when we read did the yard we had to reduce some of the sprinkler head to head combinations problems so we come back we'll talk about how we start hacking through this stuff and how it relates to your self financial situation right back with the ones readership\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the Joe ... radio show will be back with more life changing principles adjusted human history [noise]\nTraffic on TALK radio six forty double duty as the

minutes to an accident on highway Ninety two and crab I rode bombing a motorcycle now I'm hearing I don't like Sonia of an incident\nAll these different topics are part of working this process\nSo it's not just okay I'm going to go buy a rent a house that has the passage of that is going to be a part of the process but that is not the entire process that is a part of the solution\nBut there's no way the process\nYour problem with the process is all my problem with my landscaping was my landscaping plan was all\nIt was not sustainable in hundred and ten degree temperatures in the summer and twenty degrees freezing temperatures in the winter the plan was wrong and I had to fix the plan for a concert fix the problem will be right back would you do well on the radio show\n[noise] [noise]

today we're talking about tackling big giant turnaround projects something like maybe your personal financial situation something like my personal residents situation or something like the apartment complexes that we close the last couple of weeks I we look at all three of these that these are gigantic\nManagerial um\nWe're if we're looking for the it's a um process engineering situation where we have to change the process completely route so we were talking earlier about you have the right plan financially you got to get the right plan\nThat's wake up someplace like lifestyles you get the plan how to how does this stuff work what should I be doing what does it work with those words and then you take you to work through all these different subject in your personal situation and see what's happening\nWe're talking about income here in a minute which is probably the most important ones but the easy one his expenses what what are you wasting what is being wasted in your life and uh I find myself you know looking\nAt my life in my process to my home and my business has the same way I look at what is the dead weight dead weight in my life takes up my life\nSo I was given a a thought process early on in life and my dad said um it's not what it costs to buy something when it costs to maintain that something if you look at your situation go for where you're at financially in your life right now is it worth it for you to have that big giant home\nIs that really the right thing to be doing at this point\nYou know maybe the kids are all gone you don't need to have been home anymore\nWhy not shed that get rid of some of the expense and the maintenance both time and energy and money in maintenance of that big home you got two or three or four cars do you really need two or three or four cars I'm it's ridiculous I've I've had as many as six cars\nI'm Down to four and I'm thinking about getting rid of one of them I never drive it in the other three a completely different vehicles that I actually need all three different kinds of vehicles the fourth one is a sports car I never drive a sports car I'm sixty two years old happily relationship\nThere's no need to go out on the town and show off the I don't need to proven successful business person so I don't need to have a portion of Ferrari or mine is of a Mercedes F cell\n... whatever sports\nA convertible five fifty or whatever just unbelievably fast car with the ... comes off or actually removes itself whatever convertible convertible Ruth initially I show no real interest I don't even know the names and stuff in it because I don't even drive and I picked it up one time 'cause I could steal it\nBecause I had something else in trade that can get for in this brand new and I figured Okay Michael pick it up [noise] um\nAnd I drove it has a problem with it but just really a waste of my time [noise] ah I go out to my garage and same thing I got stuff in my garage that I'd never use I've had it for years uh it was a project started that never finished the project they finished but the stuff left over\nA all that stuff just gets in your way it just slows you down and you have to take care of it you have to maintain it you have to moving clean around and clean hundred um\nWhen I was going through the irrigation situation what I thought was\nIs it I was actually wasting water I was irrigated above and beyond I figured you know the old thermostat problem you know you sit there and said to the temperature you wonder well an irrigation system you don't really know what that about is and so you either see in your places to dry and turn it up where you see the places too low you turn it down\nI'm Sorry you you got too much water and you turn down\nThe problem is you don't know how much she turned in either direction the wise thing to do is to start out\nAnd start moving slowly but surely not crank it all the way up and get now you generally crank it all the way up to really dry while you were to make sure you get enough water to try to come back\nBut you can't leave it there you got to crank it back down again because once you've got it growing and saturated now you're going to get it\nA U turn its keep his so whether you're going to get mould and so on and so forth so it's a it's a balancing act guys you got to stay on top of but we are talking about this just one zone in the house so I now\nI'm working my way out of that so right so you're working your way out of okay what are we gonna do it just extra car the texture car payment we don't need what are we going to do with the you know we've got four hundred stations or cable we only watch the same tent stations every single time um you know do we really need all that are just\nAll this stuff in your life that you wasted money is just a waste that you don't really need to do [noise] um\nAre you going out to eat too often and now it sounds a little bit too much like Dave Ramsey but the bottom line is there is an expense side of the equation now when I got back to my yard here\nAfter I had stabilize\nThis front area had to let it sit for a couple of days a week or two and see what it would turn into I had to let the
