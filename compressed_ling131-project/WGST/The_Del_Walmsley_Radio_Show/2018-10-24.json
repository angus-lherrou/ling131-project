{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Yep just launched on Monday you can check that out I had him on but we have we have fun on the record show super fun\nAnd Hogan crafts we call him Hogan around here is just phenomenal at what he does so\nWe spent the entire episode talking about everyday millionaires so what does it look like to build wealth millionaires look like the mists around that the truth around that and it's so great like we even sit and George Campbell our very own one here at the Daily Show out in the streets national asked people I'd have to like for instance your job\nWhat do you think a millionaire when he's at our jobs are and it was like doctors lawyers movie stars right like all the answers but the truth is so different it's all in the book\nEvery a millionaire so I was just really encouraging like you said everything from their jobs their salaries these people they are not what you would think are the millionaires but the average a millionaire millionaire out there in America looks a lot different than what you probably have in your mind and so it's really close to the whole episode yeah we have fun talking about\nDid you how to be ... because when I was on your show it was used to hang up for it they could bring a shake\nNo she ... and he said about me money what does she millionaire he showed me a million dollars in crowd in this period for cash ... original crew show if you pay ... August ... too far five to too far but you ...\nCheck it out sorry and you'll see when Facebook ... maybe you Amish and your shows going well to\nYour series irksome down one Twenty one two hundred and thirty remote sorry ... percent back to your calls Tripoli too far far too too far AAA too far far too too far is the number Lauren is up in Atlanta Lauren how can we help\nI think he really when I call Cher and well my husband and I learn where he ... he ... and we get more like a lot financially by family and we don't have any that are paid off all that that we don't know what to do that [laughter]\nAnd you're in a spot where do you say that you don't know what to do to I understand you're saying but what does it mean specifically what your next goals are the what you're asking\nYeah yeah I mean we don't make a ton of money on a teacher and he ... or so yeah our but our family hid grandmother really financially\nVery cool so is this a financial cushion or career course you\nKnow a financial crisis or thing in our careers [laughter]\nOkay ... okay well\nI Would say are baby steps learn if you know is passive except three which is to say three to six months of expensive and the bank do you guys have that cash available ... okay so you have thirty six months of expensive so that's done so then I Move on the baby steps four or five insects\nForests are finding retirement so whatever you guys make than than you know start going into funding retirement ... a four oh three ... is that whatever if there were ... if your husband's church as a pastor has a retirement plan plug into that but the Fifteen Percent into retirement and then what do you guys have kids\nYou do yes that yet no no\nNo kids I'm Sorry no cats okay so then you get to babysit five which is kids college you'd get babies at six 'cause it's done which means are near um baby step seven right now so that is just knowing wealth and giving which is a pretty awesome about to be so what I Would say for you guys is funding our retirement\nBut then also have similar goals that you guys want to me because I'm you know there's there can be this monotonous state that you get in\nWhen you don't have any debt or a house payment none of that and you're just putting money away\nAnd savings and it's just kind of like okay it's just there so you need something exciting that you guys want to do whether that's a vacation you want to take maybe we went to upgrade our home in five years and can we cash flow that can we go next Kobe are upgrade of our house we are going to complete we're never going to go into debt like bless your grandmother like us and say\nWe're going to know that if we sell our house put money towards that so still have some things are working towards\nBecause that makes the saving money fund versus going just as black hole account and so for you guys to your lifestyle keeping in check like you don't need to go strap against\nMaybe you could up it a few a few percentage points each year as your income grows that's totally fine enjoy that because you guys are at that spots\nUm but had that savings goal when I'm you know we we definitely has a couple now we're like okay what do we want to save towards because again like I said I can kind of be monotonous of just putting money in savings so having those goals for you guys\nAs a couple of as a family is huge and\nLaughing at least learn and it's the first thing we always talk about but it's true as gifts you're at a position that you have to it's a really cool giving because you guys have no payments at all not even help pay that much of anything goes out while do really the big things you can do now invest safe for something in the short term that you guys are looking forward to and ... you know\nWe know of course organ talks a lot about this or do you do as well I think we need to do next go to a very nice dinner\nCandlelight dinner and take a pad of paper and dream a little but never that remain because essentially what you just laid out was dreaming yet and I think they're in the position to actually really dream\nAnd even about giving them then maybe your homes to was that your deal you want to buy land and what happens is now that you're in such a great position you're going to get their way faster than you fought but this is a season to dream\nAnd it and for anyone out there like this is something that couples especially if you're married if ... if you're here like us which I think your your three kids but it's like every day it feels like your alarm goes off you wake up you drink your coffee you get ready for it you get the kids up you get them out the door\nAnd how to work on my roof you come back I mean there are saying you know you get home you get kids going to throw in the bath tub ones running out make it you're trying to get them back in the bath tub or mine or do they\nLike it is and you finally get 'em in bed and you're like oh what is it happened like and you could live in that state for you and you never look at a couple of me like what we want to look like in five years and that's the fun part Chris says it and it's true\nIt's marriage you guys like you get to build your future together so\nLauren her husband need to do that debt free but also if you're in that still have those three meetings and dream 'cause that's fun to be able to like what do we want to do even if it's our dreams to be out of debt and Eighteen months dream go for it\nAnd she can make a very key key point I don't want to drive is home to folks some of the out there don't have a lot of hope and it's because you're not focused on a vision\nSo there's a psychology study up there it's very well known and uh it's it it shows that the brain what it focuses on we tend to see you notice when we didn't see before and here's an example of the study that most people\nWhen you go buy a car you buy that car lot you drive it out how many times have you done this and you see it everywhere for the next ... have you noticed yet so that's real it's a real effect in what's happening is is the brain has been so focused on this new car purchase you wanted to look forward to it so much then you go buy it and you're so excited about it\nAnd then all of a sudden you never saw before\nBut it's materialize and in front of you it's always been there but you are focused on is so to your point\nThat applies to this idea of even if you're just just completely covered up and debt right now maybe your baby step one you just got to know Dave and you're you're doing this ...\nIf you can have the meaning that you talked about Rachel what it does is it allows you to see that the end of the baby steps and when you can see it and focus on this desire future phrase we use around here all the time yeah then your brain will begin to see the baby steps and the sacrifices me opportunities to do the long haul stuff to get you there\nThat's the key it's not just as fun romantic dream session it's practical it's what keeps you in the game\nOh absolutely and I said earlier but I said again not fun around here it is it okay well see you're you guys were you know wherever she said twenty twenty three [noise] you know thinking about Thirty years and you're fifty three like what do you want to have a great\nAnd their philosophy they grow up in a area that\nI think it's called the greatest generation where\nYou know you just didn't have that you pay cash for everything and so that's how I was re and so I really had to change my paradigm banking and I've just had to realize that you know that can be good debt can help you build asked would they it can help generate income for you\nIf it's used correctly and it it's not a bad thing it's a good thing to leverage other people's money to create well so that was the big lesson for me I I just had to get over the way that I was raised and brought up on on the Sunday at\nYou know that's what I was thinking about you know as I've heard your your stories through the years I was thinking that to me your your story is a bit is an example of how to distinguish those timeless life lessons that help us succeed that we get from our families\nFrom the ideas we need to transform in order to make her dreams and desires of reality and will unfold that here with your story today [noise] Leo we don't want to forget about you and your parents were commercial real estate investor so what was that like because you were growing up\n[noise] ... um it all started out originally when my father and my uncle or in the ... commercial construction business and um they ended up ah shutting down or business after um gosh for a new like\nForty years of business and I had a cousin that I'm starting a National Book words company and\nWhat happened is a he would come across these particular deals and my father in law or is looking for\nFor a no investments they bar you know cows and and that didn't work out too good and that invest in some other stock and that wouldn't work out too good but it was my uh cousin ended up he was feeding them from the crop roost Tom and I was watching uh\nI saw where they were making money in both mom Bob\n... gosh would've known those men would have gone in commercial real estate ownership business before you know\nThere's some benefits to it so I was I went through college I or go to college and you know what I said what do you think you'd want to do and I said well I Know what I'll say I'll walk and then the commercial real estate business no thought what better way\nTo get started and maybe you know try to\nTry to make some transactions and so I got my real estate license and are for sale hooked up with a group here in Dallas and\nFor a number of years it worked out pretty good or for like five years I made quite a few years for made some retail leases\nAnd that worked out real good and then the mean time I was always trying to make them transaction apartment complex for dropping summer same walk I was always\nA lead towards that direction and after about five years there was Tom before I had money and sometimes for I didn't have money and um [noise] on what\nThe caller brought them back a mom of being in the commercial real estate broker and businesses either really are large apartment complex for sale and I had a bar with\nUh what was going to um by the person you know I worked on this thing I'll probably for nine months and I'm the guy got up and it was just the less you know\nMonths before though when the guy walked out and I thought you know what I Can't do this any more I thought I'm going to get out of this and so\nI ended up going and I ended up finding you know I've gone around and I really didn't want to get into management too much and I did watch sales and so what I did vote but you know maybe it'd be wise to go over\nThere on doing something that's more of a consumable product and be steady your income and wind sales law might have planned that worked at a um\nDistribution company in a anyways I ended up um you know ... down the ins and outs that business and got in with a with a big distributor and did that for a number of years and and that was good and I liked it and it was enjoyable especially in the beginning but as time went on I realized that\nAmong them into my my income level are limited not\nReally didn't want to go into management um bucket help it 'cause\nI just didn't like necessarily managing people in particular um so what I did is um [noise] there's always going along our number one day I thought you know wash them and go back and and I never let\nWe'll stay out of the back of my mind but um you know the real estate with my father my mother and my uncle both of us and\nSo as time went on I ended up um I remember once all down at a branch our show I'm just looking around them I saw was a it was a call the pad printing 'em machine and I've seen some of these women and\nSome more houses I Walk through and I saw them injection motors were important in on\nOdd shaped items like or your keyboard on your computer um it could be football something that's not screen printing is where your print on something that's flat and I thought you know this isn't this is a pretty um a unique type of a business my news there was demand for it and\nSo I did that and um I was doing that as a hobby actually is I sold one on the Internet and I came across a few jobs that really put me on the ... I had one company that wanted me to imprint on a on a coup or a hundred thousand crews and\nPardon me quite a bit of money for it and it was either the getting into a world from and the bachelor had the ... or ... ... to ... go ahead I'm Sorry I did that for a number of years and\nThat turned into a quarter lucrative or the ... the ... um or putting on certain\nThings are wow and\nSo that was that it led me and I ended up you know other than that for quite a few years\nWow that's quite a quite a journey Leo I mean you you you went through so it it feels like searching right and when we come back in a few minutes we're going to continue this story with Peggy and Leo and\nAnd Leo's journey in search for where he really fit in this world and what he was going to do to create the wealth of passive income he needed to live the life he desires you're listening to the doe wants the radio show this is Lynn ... we'll be right back [noise]\nTo do with what we're supposed to\nBe good afternoon got ... on any by north and south on around Jimmy Carter ... job obviously in both directions job I Seventy five north ... patients very road I GB as you're at about ... formerly of tragedy strikes on Wednesday afternoon a fatal accident the songs don't call Dr\nWalter circle the investigation is just be gone to private just come\nDown to one ...\nAt age ... road and I ...

decide what\nTo do next you know sitting there thinking about it you know you've you've worked where you work your way up in corporate America to the point that they said hey don't expect any more money over here right we're done\nAt the system is that you're going to make and then ... you know you built a business in town the point that you're going you know I I don't want to expand this I don't want to please I don't want to do this somebody offered you create pricing and you said OK you sold your business and and you found yourself now\nI'm looking out at in uncharted uncharted voyage\n\nWell\nWhen we started um selling stock options so we'd buy the stock and we'd spell the options and Leo headless had been listening for years on the radio and to this from that was advertising their program and so we got in there and and\nDid quite well in the first because really you buy the stock he's still the option immediately on your computer you're given credit and to your town\nAnd that was great and\nThat we were asked to buy stock ... stock\nEvery month for ten months until we were called down at the stock well and that was fine and good we were cost averaging you know on our stock and um\nIt was good until the recession hit because then the stock prices on some of our holding started going down and I went down so loud that we got to wear on some of them we couldn't build the options anymore so actually our equity was going down\nAnd we were losing our principal and then our income on our stock option income was going down so we knew that we we had to make a change you know we were just looking for something more where um our equity would increase in value and that we'd have a steady income so we decided that we needed to make a change\nAnd how is that from your perspective\n[noise] well I just thought you know we've got we've gotten ourselves to the point where we've gone accumulation from past year\nAnd I thought you know what I kept I did it a couple of times for I Would try to get hold of real estate brokers and try to buy something that's called crippled ... at least and and maybe on a small office were house\nEvery time I Do that I ended up getting um somebody would bought out from war can you get to it and I was really frustrated in that sense\nAnd um so anyway I kept her in the program on the uh radio about this you know stock option than it was good like Peggy mentioned and uh for a while and then uh it got to war I just realized that you know we're supposed to hold on for some of the stocks from him now tariffs on um\nA move China and I thought jeeze you know this that there are some flaws on this program and um\nI told her I said you know what I keep hearing about lifestyle gum limited on the radio and I said you know we've got to go check this program around you see what it's all about it's been on for a number of years and so that's what\nI'm I thought you know uh that's when it comes to lead let us over to uh the lifestyles a two day and a ... you know I go on to it a couple of times and um he was and then you know that it was a whole nother process will tell you getting hurt or you know to\nTo join and ah 'cause we both need to do it together\n'cause we're team and um she's smarter than I Am and\nUm she makes better decisions of either about every one of the time and um it was so all you can you know but it was I knew that lifestyles and where we need to be a ... today and because they talk about everything and really in a way\nI guess my background in the past wasn't wasted um\nBecause what happened is it all came back to me were ... from the family from ... from um\nAh just now going to school and learning about real estate but I had you know uh but there are certain things about the oil states all family you know with uncle and all and cousins\nAll this kind of disenchanted because of after the past you know my parents and the market at all you know people there what they are needed to be a plan and grade control on things and so I was kind of disenchanted with that end of the real estate um aspect", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "city":
