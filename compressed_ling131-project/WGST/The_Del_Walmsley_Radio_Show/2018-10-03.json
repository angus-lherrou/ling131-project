{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "... why would they not be around that's interesting information\nWhy I mean they might not they they they ... they're going to move forward one way or another I got ya oh do they go out and buy another company\nWell ah I'm going to start with the good old fashioned grandma sitting at the dining room table and you've got a piece of paper you draw a line right down the middle and left side you write prose and lie side you wrote your right cons because here's the deal you are experiencing gross what do you think just a moderate projection over the next two years that growth could be\n\nModerately I think you know we could probably [laughter] I'd be confident almost saying we could double our uh our sales\nI just okay so here again of course the alternative ... but I'm just saying\nI Would I Would not do anything until I had a list that said there were double the amount of prose with crazy upside than there are tons and right now on the surface Christie I don't see what the pros would be unless I'm missing something she's gone bananas\nHigh arms flailing ... time to the lady raven\nHere here's a jumped out to me and I hear that's in your voice because I have got entrepreneur in my DNA we get so excited about shiny and new and someone has an opportunity here's my question for you or even if they had never approached you would you want to sell the business\nWere you thinking about selling business is selling the business something you want to do if the opportunity had not presented itself because that's your motivation it's in line with your goals your game plan is that something you're excited about if that person never came to you\n[noise] well that of course but um I Love what I Do and a half the time I Want to know for my hair\nEntrepreneurial dirty that's just a real life [laughter]\nYou know um so I I I think if the situation or write that then we're absolutely interested um you know I I understand what you're saying it's difficult for someone like me to think about working for somebody out\nUm but the the people you know the better interested um uh we believe our values the line um you know they talked about keeping a son and the stuff on it and continuing to grow and operate more or less how we are now\nAll right so let me put you to the test group and let's say you say yes to this they've made you a financial offer you don't have to say it but you know what the number is correct\nOr we're not quite there yet okay\nWell okay even more so let's say that it's a very attractive number\nAnd I want you to say okay they give us a really attractive number that raises my eyebrows and then I Want you to think or if they do what they say they're going to do and you stay around for a little bit but then eventually you're out\nIf you get the number that makes you really excited but you know that it's possible that they push you out at some point in the near future and you are just left with the number and memories\nAre you going to be okay with that I think that's what Chris you said it's really shiny and it should be shining I think there's a lot of shots but let me ask you what you want is that why you cool with that ... years from now ... you would be cool with that\n[noise] yes I think I Would be\nOkay when you know hey you got to go with your gut on the one that's the thing is like in business we would love\nFor there to be an absolute formula that says this is always right this is always wrong there's black and white there's certainly some of that but a lot of times it's business owners were making a value call there's going to be rescued away\nEither way you're going to take on risk of okay I'm going to sell it and then I'm Out like I'm Out forever I'm giving up this baby I I'm giving up ownership to what the growth could be in the next three to five Fifteen Years or you could say with it you know like men there was a risk where I gave up that awesome offered this tiny thing so\nThat's the thing in business ear you're really asking Reuben I think of value decision of what do you want what's in\nYour goals where you want to be in three years you're going to be sitting dreaming about something new with that often I'm Out in your bank account or do you want to be in the business and you actually taking credit for all that growth both both to be great it's really up to the ribbon at your business to try to\nDo with your heart run the scenarios use commonsense go with your heart just go to Adam is on the line in New York New York Adam how can we help\nHey guys thanks for taking my call so uh I'm In a career very started career your income white collar I paid off pretty much all of our data about and uh it's coming to the point right now where you know I had the idea that Fifteen Years and I\nDon't know where to start to kind of watch this is the idea so what it is is I'm looking for a pet currently public way side walkers food and beverage to you know bringing the community together\nUm found a prime location um landowner one two hundred thousand a year for a week and basically it just kinda [noise] I Know there's a demand out there for it I reached search but from there don't even know where to start\nHow would you monetize this this this tale of the food and beverage is\nYeah so it would be failed food and beverage or along with kind of like a membership fee to get inside the crime is\nJust so you can eat or drink we are\nLike a a mix between it's a mix between like a like a gym membership and all the dog park that or just you know unlimited access to the facility but that also food and beverage just for a book\nOkay I've got a question for you for this market 'cause you said you've done research you said there's demand for it for this particular particular market that you're going to serve that's going to pay this membership fee and so on\nWhat problem or you solving for them through this business\n[noise] [laughter] so in the area that I mean right now they don't have any type of public access dog are for at least twenty five mile it's all private offer town rather than ...\nSo this is a dog park meets food and beverage meets tech\nYeah So Adam she's asking the core thing there is no place to take your dog isn't that the big issue you there's no place to take your dog to run around there's no public dog park\nThat though there are um but what the town does is they're constantly limiting the hours that type of access or anything like that so this is kind of just a blend between\nAll three I'm primarily yes dog park um but then also it kind of like a gentrified type of situation where you know if I Want to go there and have some type of craft beer or food truck style food um you know all that is on credit\nI say here's what I meant challenge us Adam 'cause I Know we're running short on time\nI I don't think your idea is bad and you seem like you've done your research and I totally get it so I could totally see hipsters with their dogs and their laptops they eat and drink and expensive ... like I can totally see what I Want to challenge you to do is think of a one point of arson that's the point of ours and\nI Want to think of what is the lowest lowest hanging fruit what is a way to baby step your way into this business without the risk and the commitment of two hundred grand that you may or may not have when the demand may not be there yet\nHow can you start this up on the ground floor organically in a local park in your backyard or really unimpressive version to justify it get some revenue coming in before you take the next step I just want you to prove the idea\nBefore you take out some raskin cost in that type of thing I just want to challenge you what that's the big dream what the baby version of that dream that you could test first\nThat's really good advice this is an idea I don't know if it's a good idea but I got to give it to this might be a thing where you start to sit down with local town leaders and go hey we need a a full public\nParks just for like ... no limits none of this stuff just anytime you want to show up your show that's meeting the first need then go hey what are the chances that I could get a license to sell so the I mean you got to buy stuff that was at one point you got to start getting mines in the room because the two hundred thousand dollars\nAnd it's hard to get people to pay for something they expect for free I don't know what it's like a New York but in Tennessee dog parks are free\nSo I think he's going to sell the food and the drawl it at all yeah but people have a free place to hang out to get food they don't have a membership to I don't know I just got to understand what problem yourself informed jets go Hey Chris here I think they can only think our producer James child's their system associate producer Zach Bennett and of course you America thank you so much\nFor the ranch
