{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Ah so I assume he's a pretty messed up\n[laughter] yeah we had to say the least yeah how old is he a he'll be twenty eight [laughter]\nOkay um is what is one of the nature what's the nature of his disability\n[noise] um [noise] a losing land okay I'm In a a in a concrete labor accident\nGotcha okay leg or arm what leg okay ...\nAnd I'm not to minimize that 'cause that's a horrible thing but that's all\n[noise] yeah and you know I think basically what's been happening is there's been any different if you go back and forth counter stewing going on by lawyers\nAnd that's all us all behind this you think now you think this was coming to a head\nI think it it I'm finally getting to the point to where there's going to be actual real settlement um talk and um there's just been some shady things going on in the court case\nWell what else what twenty million dollars if they're gonna they're gonna mess with it you can count on that [noise] yeah okay\nWow\nAll right so uh and what is his emotional and mental state\n[noise] I think only plea he just wants to be working he wants to have you back at work he doesn't\nWant to get what a prosthetic leg and he'll be able to do something with his mind now he won't be doing heavy lifting things or something like that probably right\nExactly that's that's the hope except for he got a desire to do those kinds of things and so it's really killing ended around\n... around but I mean I'm you know you usually actually make more money with your mind that you do with your\nBody anyway right as a career path so generally speaking and so that's forced upon him here which is I'm not not a bad thing is what I'm thinking so I I think he he gets to sit down and ask themselves the question what do I want to do if I could do anything in the world because now he can do anything in the world [noise] right right\nAnd so I'm going to coach him on finding a career that he loves and I'm going to spend a very small percentage of this money because they won't take as much of that a small percentage of that much money to do some kind of retooling as far as education goes\nAnd saying okay I'm going to get a degree in X or y or I'm going to get some training and X or y and I'm going to learn to be one of those things over there or whatever those things are that he wants to do so what's he want to be when he's fifty five years old that he's made his life's work and his career and he\nGets to choose that now that's awesome to be a self employed track that could be a a track of uh some kind of a a I don't know I mean anything but it's obviously not going to be something that is physically um demanding okay right [laughter] that's okay that's okay\nIn terms of technology though um he's kind of wanting to start his own business now and getting all these ideas that it had no water that actually implication on something like this that you've known it would be facing with\nIt depends on how the settlement is structured and you'd have to talk with his uh uh uh attorney and with some tax advice to find out how it's structured I shouldn't be in California as well\nThat's correct yeah that that's the first thing you need to figure out what the taxes are going to be and what the lawyers' fees are going to be and then you know what you're going to have met the second thing then is figure out what we're going there I Would I Would urge him to pretend like this money's not there by and large\nI mean if if let's say there's twenty million after taxes just to use a number okay and if you if you pulled a million out to start a business and to coast for a little while emotionally\nAnd that leaves you're Nineteen million that you just pretend like you're not there\nThat makes sense that's pretty bad yeah I mean you could buy anything you want to do with that right that's a lot of ... money okay so absolutely something along those lines and then what I Want him to do is to build himself a uh the Bible says in the\nUh in in in the abundance of counselors there are safety in the multitude of counsellors there's safety so he needs to build himself a little board of directors\nHe needs an estate planner\nA that's a lawyer and he's like tax professional probably that as a lawyer but at a minimum is a CPA um [noise] a needs an investment person in his corner\nI'm ... probably you when someone else sitting there that will look at him and telling me stupid when he's being stupid [laughter] and he needs to commit himself to\nGathering information from this group of people before he does something\nDoes that make sense because white people lose money like this is is that they go off on their own and they don't have the tools mentally to to manage this and you've got to put some people in your life not to do it for you but that coach you\nAs a group to do this I don't want one person managing your with and that's how I get ... right\nAnd and and I don't want you doing it by yourself because you're probably not completely equipped but we're going to put a group of people around him if he wants to do some real estate and he has a high quality real estate person sitting on his little board rights but we've got a CPA we gotta stay plan or we got a tax person may be a real estate person may be an investment person in the mutual funds world\nAnd then we're going to build a game plan here this is what we do with like an NFL player that asked us what to do\nThey get they get a ten million dollar signing bonuses and they're really good at football but they are not really good at money\nAnd so they don't if you don't end up on the front of Sports Illustrated be one of those stupid people that lost a million dollars\nHere's how you do it you put some people in your corner that teach you coach you and guide you as a group you don't have one person doing it and then you gradually over the years become very adept at managing twenty million dollars\nWith the help of these people teaching you and they all need to have the heart of a teacher they don't need to be arrogant and bossy\nBut they need and they need to say they need to be able to look at him and telling the truth and kindly but go listen here's why you don't want to do that you can do it but here's why you don't want to do that and then and he needs to commit to keeping his hands off of the bulk of it and put her down investments them forget it's there\nAnd he can live the rest of his life easy easy but if he goes and decides to open a twenty million dollar technology thing he's going to lose it all by the time three years from now all the money to be gone\nYeah [laughter] that's what I'm afraid of too yeah I'm\nSo don't do that you know don't don't don't open twenty million dollar business don't open a business that takes up all this to open a business it's\nVery small and he's got plenty of money he doesn't have to prove anything okay take your time either tortoise don't be the hair\nAnd just take your time put a group of counselors and the multitude accounts for their safety put a group of counsellors in your life that are professionals in the different areas that can speak to you teach you and how old is he today\n... ... so the goal is by the time he's thirty eight he has a clue\nOkay yeah along the lines of managing twenty freaking million dollars [noise] Internet it'll take ten years for him to intellectually and emotionally get his arms around it and he'll lose it all\nIf he starts trying to do one or two plays with all that money I'm going to open a chain of pizza parlors all gone [laughter] it's all gone yeah\nI'm gonna I'm gonna be the next Facebook no you're not it's all gone it's all gone OK so take a small amount of it and get yourself back to work to give you the dignity of work and to create an income where you really don't need any of that money any way and it's just sitting there growing and then this horrible tragic event\nTurns into a financial blessing that changes his family tree for the you know for generations to come because he's wise with it does that make sense [noise]\nYes thank you very much appreciate all the if I\nMay that's exactly what we would do if we were in a situation appreciate your calling or the next to James child's Kelly Daniels and Blake Thompson I Am Dave Ramsey your host we'll be back with you before you know and in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial piece national daily with the price of face\nI don't have the time to do what you're doing could I put my money in with your money uh et cetera et cetera so let's go back down and start over and talk about why lifestyles and design lifestyles as originally designed because I thought that the world out there was filled with sharks and crooks\nThat were stealing your money taking your money away from you and investigate in things they made money was talking about stockbrokers supposed to talk about real estate syndicator supposed to talk about financial planners these guys all talk you into giving you their money\nI see all these guys as people were big gigantic white T da dun dun a put that hand out they got a rap they've got the suits they've got the cars that got the planes these are the most egregious\nSelf centered moral\nSales people that I've ever met\nThey are all about taking your money and putting it on their side of the line\nThat's what they're all about and when I came out of that when I woke up to that as a twenty nine year old kid I said I can lose my own money\nAnd I'm not going to let these guys get rich off of losing my money for me I can at least lose my own but what I found out when I got out there in the real estate investment world was is it these returns that these people are offering guys are ridiculous\nYou've got to understand is when someone tells you they can give you one to two percent of the savings account three percent on a bond\nIf someone tells you into real estate solicitation hired a guy on the Internet the other day bragging that his deals can earn three to four percent now by the way he wasn't indicating that was going on three to four percent of the deal he didn't even talk about how much of that he was going to take out by the time he took his\nOut his fees and his overrides you may only be earning two to three percent but he was bragging about that why would anybody invested that you can go on a by single family houses and earn ten to twenty five percent cash flow from day one\nOr within a month if you have to rehab to house ten to twenty five percent not only that you are lab reached the point where you put twenty percent down you can increase the value that house by twenty percent easily and make a hundred percent gain on your money within one year now\nInterestingly enough I found out you can do the same thing with small deals\nGoing to buy yourself a small apartment complex [noise]\nDo you put ten thousand twenty thousand fifty thousand dollars down you operate that correctly for one year using the tools that we teach lifestyles unlimited and you're going to be able to double\nOr I'm Sorry we call the ten twenty five one hundred percent rule you can increase the rent by ten percent or the income by ten percent\nBy either increasing the income are lowering the expenses which will raise the value of property by twenty five percent\nSet your only invested it twenty five percent that twenty five percent increases a hundred percent return on your investment we called up the ten twenty five one hundred percent rule very simple to accomplish\nNow why would you want to go into syndication some guys often used three to four percent and then bragging that well if you stay with this deal for ten years you know it's got to go up in value\nHell maybe it does maybe it doesn't act I should say maybe it does maybe it does it but the reality is is that\nYou don't know you don't know what's gonna happen ten Twenty years from now all you really knows you're earning three or four percent mine just whatever the guys these are\nThis is nowhere near\nAs good as what you could get by owning your own real estate deal not even close right she want to understand that first I was teaching people how to do their own real estate deals and get massive massive benefits another massive benefit is the depreciation\nDone correctly you can earn enough depreciation to one cover all the income you're earning from your real estate investment and too many times have access depreciation law says that you can carry over to your earned income if you are an investor\nBut if you're not an investor if you're a passive person putting money in syndication you cannot carry those losses over to your own earn income so you're losing that whole part\nOf the investment world not even close so these guys are taking your money from you\nWhether it be the stock market the financial planner this indicators they're putting it into deals that they're getting paid fees and commissions right up front\nMost of the indicators out there that I run into the people I see on the Internet the once if you go look up what they're really doing and read the prospect this was in pro forma votes\nAnd see what their offers are you will find out there taking fees up front these during the middle and fees on the back in some of them take a acquisition the some of them take a construction field rehab the some of them are taking an Asset Management the uh property management be\nAt a liquidation the\nBy the time they're done with the fees you're ready to return\nIs sub par to say the least sub par compared to what you should be able to earn in a real estate transaction right so I was teaching people how to own their own deals and or partner and when we partner were equal partners\nWe both get to ask a syndicator to be equal partner with you asked them to put in as much money into the deal is you do and they will laugh at you they don't put it in their own money\nThey use everybody else's money they\nTheir money make profits put the money in the bank live like a king and use everybody else's money to get rich the same as stockbrokers famous financial planners and the same as these agree just indicators and it quite frankly irritated ... out to be\nHit irritated me so much I started lifestyles unlimited to be able to teach people how to become wealthy on the road without somewhat sick in the hands of pocket will take a short break be right back on the radio\nShow [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd you're listening to the radio show will be white was supposed to justice\nThese people to get paid on commissions and especially big commissions it instantly and over and over and over again\nI Would ever care about business operations success or profit that stop me and you guys all they care but as the next deal the next transaction and the next set up these and commission second or\nThat's what's going on out there in the Internet right now with this indicators around\nThese these these bees and the\nNonprofit Robyn we're right back\n[noise] I I I\nReally enjoy the gel nails will be more like a really supposed to yesterday was [noise]\nHighmark rules are worth of Georgia news network fat suspicious package

man on a mission to retire remember there's bombs [noise] I don't imagine\nThere was a radio show today I'm Talking about how to reduce indications the correct way not the way you see him advertised out there in the Internet on marketing a song soap or\nNot the type of a courageous um types of investments where they take your money they make massive millions of dollars for themselves and very little small returns for you\nThis is not the way these things should be done I see it out there all over the place and I you know on the Internet actually everybody out there right now they're looking for and doing everything they can contact wise to get your attention so that you will follow them so that they can get you as a customer to invest into their deal\nAnd the reality is it's just not the right thing to do and I'm going to I'm just going through I've already done this for twenty eight years no guys and I I've been doing this before any and all these guys ever existed out there\nIn the real estate world I guarantee you bring me anybody that's claiming to have been around longer than I Am and I will show you that it's not true\nSo the bottom line is is that\nWhen we came through ... education program life doesn't limit is a mentor you educational program\nWe were teaching people to do what I did which was my real estate but again like I said in the last segment people started wanting to partner together but partnership being very quickly turned into syndication so the difference between a partnership with the syndication is\nA partnership is everybody's equal partners everybody puts up money everybody gets their sheer everybody has some say in what goes on\nA ... the cages where one or more groups of people get together and they raise capital to do deals they take money up front they take money in the middle that money and many times uh and they just take agree just be out of the deal and almost every case\nSo we started running into these problem number would stop some of the things that we started seeing happening you're lifestyles when people started doing this number one uh people were getting hurt you were getting into deals that were die because\nWell did not operate the deals the people that were doing the deals were either number one just completely unsophisticated an educator and how to manage the property once they close it's very simple raise capital and close the deal they'll let any of these guys tell you that they are the smartest thing\nIn the world that they are like the sharpest played in the drawer they're not raising money in syndication it's so simple you take one or two classes on syndication you go to the bank or get yourself pre qualified you do it's a simple stuff to do guys\nIt really is we teach it we'd been teaching it for twenty eight years now it's not hard to do what is hard to do is to do it correctly to where you are\nPreventing the problems that these people are running into where you are giving your investors\nThe safest possible investment out there so we ran into the people who are uneducated unsafe escape didn't know what they're doing and we ran into the bad actors the greedy people that want to take advantage of everybody\nSo let's talk about this we started seeing people doing bad deals we started seeing unfair splits to where the lead was just taking more and more and more get I call lead\nThe guy putting the deal together truly that the master syndicator unfair splits where the the syndicate it was just stealing all the money out of the deal bad operations the the syndicator could not operate the property and they were going down people were losing money\nI'm\nBad financing I saw people with they didn't have the ability to get good financing\nThey were going out there and getting bad financial because they had bad credit or\nBad equity bad network so on and so forth so they got bad financing the wrong kind of financing they didn't understand the financing and the financing at all kinds of problems attached to it or in an example of that would be\nThe financing was too much you're overlap bridge the ... and it's just not enough there was not enough leverage the financing had a term limitation other words you had to get out of it very short of ballooned out that you couldn't figure out a way to get out of a turnaround\nFinance you get to higher interest rates\nAre the finance and get no way to get out of it there was no way to to exit strategy the property all these things were about stuff that these guys did know\nRight then you go on and you have bad promoter uh\nPeople that were illegally promoting deals you know these indications are actually controlled by or they're legally supposed to be watched by the FCC there are specific",
