she's you know she's like my life I can buy you know I could buy it\nWant to get it at our cars so I don't know if we take a train you to oh shallow wanting they're going to get a loan from the bank\nAnd the car right okay um\n[noise]\nWell I mean there's two there's two things at pool here want one is she's grown person and you know we don't tell her grown kids what to do we merely try to influence them but the other the other thing that's a pool is is what I Do something\nTo what I participated in an activity was one of my children that I thought was bringing them harm even if they're grown and the answer to that would be no\nAnd you are working to get out of bed your son is working to get out of that you guys are made the decision that being in debt on cars and these other things as a bad idea it's not good for your finances and to turn around put her in dead or participate in activity is not an act of love\nAnd so um I appreciate her\nSentiment that she's standing on her own and she can do whatever she wants she's right but as your mom if I'm Ninety and you're eighty five and you're and you're Seventy or whatever I I'm Still going to love you and I'm Still not going to participate in an activity that's bringing you harm\nMhm I Love you too much to do that and ah and if you don't understand that I you know you have the right to be mad or you have the right\nTo think that I'm outlined but I'm just cannot in good conscience participate in an activity that's not good for you I Love you\nKnow I wouldn't sell it to her okay\nIf I were in Haiti power in your shoes I'm just thinking through how I Would I've got grown kids and one of them came to me and said you know I Want to do this thing and you're going to participate in this thing that that did it I don't agree with and that I don't think is good without good for them that I'm not going to do it they should buy five thousand dollar car pay cash for it\nMhm\nNow how much debt do you have not counting your home\nI mean we have a hundred dollars and then what is your house while and ah one eighty\nOkay so how quickly are you going to have the hundred thousand paid do you think\nWe're looking at two years\nThat's\nAbout as long as there should take max within fifty a year making one eighties not exactly so deeply deeply sacrificing I'm now given all of those numbers four thousand dollars doesn't matter much you could just show or the car for four or five thousand\nOkay\nAnd not you know but no I won't sell it to you where you go into that I'm not going to participate in that activity okay\nBut if you want to sell it to our cheap and just help her um the ... thousand dollars doesn't move the needle much and out of a hundred you follow me or what moves the need a lot of a hundred is you're getting really emotional about deeply sacrificing and using the huge income you have declared this debt really really fast\nSo given those numbers I might give up you know some of my value in the car or you got to scrape together five hundred and you pay cash five thousand you can have the car I might do that but hunting I Am not going to participate you going into bad\nYou're going to have if you're gonna do that you're going to do it somewhere else 'cause I Love you too much to participate in something that brings harm to you\nAnd that's even if my kids are grown and\nThat's not me interfering in their life and that's not me being a control freak it's I'm not going to participate in anything that I don't think is good for you that brings you harm\nBecause I care about you and if they can't get that statement than they are options that little rebellious ...\nSeriously I mean that's just I mean if they can't hear love coming from you\nThat way then there's something wrong but I in your case what the numbers I might if you're on your show it to him cheap that's okay too but he didn't one's fine with me but no going into debt is not an option Amy is with us in Spokane, Washington Hi Amy how are you\nGood Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I've been listening to you for a couple of weeks and I'll bet that night third at filling out college applications that my daughter my son already in college and\nRight now I'm just like how did we get him into much debt already he's in two years\nThat he started at second year of school and my daughter was like I said in the fall but he already has\nUm like ten thousand dollars and a and school grounds and then we have fourteen thousand an apparent heart phone [noise] mhm [noise] and so I'm struggling and know how do I get through this thing now do I get them through college\nWhere is he in school ah Washington state university and kind of your motives the tuition\n[noise] ah about well the first year it twenty seven oh tuition is um [noise] around [noise] I Can't even\nThink twelve eight and ... twelve thousand okay top that probably pretty close among all off\nBut it should be about there in state tuition an average ... something like that the national averages about ten but I think Washington's a little bit harder okay and so um that's the tuition only and he's living away from home on campus\nNo he's not living on campus you're nothing in the house trade paying very minimal for rent\nOkay that's good news okay he's working\nHe worked for about twenty five hours per week right now but it does make about fourteen dollars an hour\nThat's decent okay good good [noise] okay and we got to get him on a really really tight budget than it used to be applying for scholarships left and right yeah you guys helping shut down and figure out what you can contribute\nTo the equation between his hard work between the scholarships and you can your contribution and the fact that he's in a reasonably inexpensive school\nUm we just sit down and really are and the wrinkles out of this and figure out how we can pull it all together and make it happen with no more debt and don't add any more debt\n[noise] okay so then my question is we had that ... we have a car loan where um\nWe have a car loan for Thirteen thousand five hundred dollars and then I got he's got the parent PLUS Loan now do I start hammering on the parent PLUS Loan or do a camera and the car loan Karl I'm a car loan and then the parent plus on yes\nOkay because I didn't know if that can ... you know when you go down your um [noise] yeah and I didn't know invest for kids with\nThis number five but we're not investing for ... hours trying to cash flow with them yeah help him get through with no more new debt you're you're not you're past the point of saving for college or trying to get through college now\nAnd then my daughter who's starting in the fall she is selling out scholarship she does have we do have some money you know not much but a little bit of money saved sure\nI'm good she has worked like an animal and it's only like ten scholarship applications a day\nAnd again she chooses an inexpensive school the least expensive option possible because you guys are broken you're trying to hold us together as a family and get these two kids through school it can be done but it's going to require a lot of work a lot of scholarships and choosing the inexpensive school out here\nAnd there is no shame in that game\nWill be will do it every day and other people go a hundred dollars\nThat puts us our that Iran's are showing the bugs and we didn't do it in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to be and that's the day with the prince of peace\nPrize changed and you'll see a producer in the center for the day for him he said this hour the show is over but you can find our podcast on ... where everywhere every year to surf yet [noise]\n\nAtlanta jingle bomb twenty ATM presented by capital what happens on December ...\nUh friends they knew about it we'll get into that second other friends that were in it knew about it it took two or three friends before they actually were willing to even come in and listen you know why format that you know they just heard about and heard about it or heard about it but they had a plan that was working in their own mind\nSo it wasn't the right thing to do\nWhile fast forward three years later they're invested in three thousand seven hundred twenty nine units\nYou're talking about forty six multiply family complex transactions they're still in thirty eight of them the rest of them they've already sold off they've had over a hundred percent returns on some of the deals just incredible phenomenal stuff\nIf you look at the resume their portfolio it will blow your mind\nHow many different apartment complexes thirty eight different apartment complexes folks I mean I Can't even begin to stress how impressive this resume looks as I look at it today and it comes from a family\nThat had to take a long journey\nFrom the old belief system to the current one I'm\nGregory Bethany welcome to the show proof huge coming on today and got a lot I Want you to share with the audience because you are like so many other successful educated highly compensated individuals out there that just truly believe that\nYou were taught the right thing and everything else why was or financial plan not the right one also who wants to pick it up and and and pick up with where you guys were\nUm as a family you know a little background do your job which he did have your planning your future your finances your retirement a little bit of the of the old you please\nGo for about an okay\nRegulate the veterinarian he founded on twenty two years and during that time I was ... let's\nSee if we can turn her up or better than you can you get closer to the ball and you're a little softer you to get close but a lawsuit engender can turn you up all of yeah that that thank you go ahead start over\n... um\nWell first thank you for allowing us how much how we're really at the map on by Greg who was the veterinarian and ... practice for twenty two years during that time I was just keep her and also keep her for another ...\nAnd we were big believers in Dave Ramsey and Scott Burns up people ... aren't but he was a ... and especially here in Dallas who talked about diversifying about within\nVery safe low cost fine and you'd be set for life\nThat we followed both at the very strongly saving as much as they had to every month\nSo that's where we were when Gregor realize that we weren't getting wherever we want it to ... that he could retire at a fairly young age\nSo Gregor what was it that boom there gums this idea I don't know where this isn't working the way I thought it was when and where did that happen put me as a fly on the wall listening to what you were thinking and what you had to say to Bethany about that\nOh we'd been saving quite a bit more you know more\nThan you know the average average American and uh sharing all the financial planner saying you could you know live on three to four percent of it without outliving it\nAnd you know I've made more\nIs a veterinarian per second you're out of um within five years out of that school I was making more money than that and our our cost of living was higher and I didn't want to retire and after you know skip and save and\nYou know not just a you know live live a good life style\nAh now that have retired um I Would say our lifestyles actually improved are uh you know making more money in real estate now than I was able to and in veterinary medicine and not having to worry about an alarm clock\nWhile that's great about the I'm going to go back to you now tell us again and I love the fly in the wall concept won't was Gregory saying to you when he first heard about lifestyles 'cause he wasn't that impressed a quarter of your resume here he just wasn't here in it\nWere what'd you yet how\nDid he finally change because I don't want him to tell the story because I Want to hear from the outside to see what you saw going on truly in his mind\nUm I was truly the skeptic about it more than a less failed on he actually heard about it for ... one of them is super involved and lifestyles and one of the ... is that ... ... when he has money doing that otherwise it's not very active\nBoth of them just talk to them and actually probably ten minutes you know hey you need to look into that you know the what's going on where you live at that Gregory was like great didn't follow it didn't get anything\nThen he went to buy our TV died and he found yeah with research has found the perfect TV he won it and it was like an hour away they get the car turned on the radio like at at her day morning\nAnd there is a radio show about lifestyle and he listens to it and then all of a sudden every time he's been in the car he's trying to find life pounds on the radio\nBut he is not really pushing it yet so he's not really trying to convince me to do anything just gathering information which of the big cracker your research figure out what he's doing\nOn that and we really had sat down with a financial planner who sat okay great I have to pay for money and you'll be fine and Congress like ah\nAn adult he pretty much tracked me almost kicking screaming that very seminar I Would\nWhat were your thoughts ... oh okay I get that we were a little skeptical what did you think when you came there because you come in I Know how it is being skeptical I'm the same way you come in with your shield up\nYou're looking for cracks in the armor the enemy you want to end okay where is the scam in all of this right what did you come away with a after that free workshop which is really not really an educational things more of an overview what did you come away from that free workshop\nWell I think that you went back I was in training the idea\nYes did not say okay we can get all day I mean I mean in a car I'm like are going to get it and we have it faster on\nAnd I was saying I'm going but I'm not even bringing our
