of the cash value whatever they're\nNo there's no difference at all all you do as you just call them and get caller eight hundred number or whatever the name of the company is and get customer care on the line customer service on the line and you know asked them if there's something they need you to sign or if there's anything we needed extra expedite this but we need you\nQuickly to get me my cash value what's the fastest way I can do that but no you really can't pass it up the only thing that can happen is they may try to slow walk or nor your request and you may have to push on them it's kind of like cancer on the credit card you got to argue with him to get it done\nBut no there's not a way you can mess it up you just need to be persistent is all and make sure that they follow through and change your your check and if you need to sign a piece of paper if we get them to do that that's not a big deal don't cancel any life insurance until you have your new life insurance in place always remember that\nDenise is with us in Washington DC Hi Denise how are you\nHi Dave I'm great how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise] so I've\nBeen on a wake up and down probably seven months ago on came on a really challenging time because we have a child in college that can you hear that will pay for and as well have Harry Carey expenditure and it took a candidate expenses that they can hide it and not in part Karen from\n... to try to figure out in the\nI'm sure that you have to be fair\n... parents on or taking out a scare 'em for that I get something to make sure that we're doing the right thing since I don't know when I'm going to be coming back to work and it was really great at a state of Washington but just fine\nI'm Sorry you did the end of the century you lost your job and that's scary I don't want to make it worse by going into that\nIf you're making your financial situation worse you know is what we got there so what a masters or you're in the middle of the storm we got a button down the hatches and so how much is the tuition\n[noise] I'm not going to total we're going to have to pay twenty eighth grade by coming out here I'd have to pay about eight thousand\nOkay and do you have eight thousand way there okay\nWell I mean if you don't really like you can spare the eight thousand in the kid needs to pull out of school or he needs to get a job and by his eight thousand but I'm not going to tell you to go into debt and make the situation worse\nOkay\nWe have the money the only question is you're making a decision do you want the safety net more than you want to pay tuition I'm guessing you're probably going to pay the tuition so how much did you use to make\nAbout nine to five and what does your are you married yes then what does your husband might be okay and what did you use to do\n'em in software support and how long have you been laid off a down side of not wow ... ... yeah definitely I literally looking\nOut on your on the ground something in that period of time in that field\nThat may still that's OK I'm working on working on it\nOkay 'cause I I Know in other words the good news is you're in a an active technology type position that ought to be some positions available maybe not Ninety five maybe a hundred and five maybe not a hundred and five maybe Seventy five I don't know but I don't think you're going to be unemployed indefinitely\nYou're not you're in an active market metro market and you're in an active space so I'm not going to panic\nAnd I'm sure not going to make it worse by borrowing money if you're going to panic till junior to come home for a semester or two and get a job and pays eight thousand\nOn that too but um you guys are paying your basic necessities of life out of your husband's income and that's what you push through but I'm with but you know this eight thousand is another thing and it depends on how much you have in savings to that you got to work with but no I'm not borrowing the money\nI don't teach people to borrow money to borrow money is an emergency don't borrow money when things are good and I'm greedy I don't borrow money when things are bad and I'm afraid and greed and fear are a good way to lose your butt with money for sure so don't let either one of those be you're driving driving force have for Christie is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Christie how are you\nKind day think we've heard taking my call sure ... my hand and and I are brand new ... in August fifteenth from northern California and in our new we\nI had a job in coming here as a para

you need to check with your tax preparer and if you're a tax preparer and found a regulation that aligns with the with what the company is saying that's fine but I don't think that's so my I don't\nHave anybody that help and I think it's called Lee called bad far on Cape people\nAround you need to Mandy call attacks professional not the company that he worked for because my understanding the regulation is four one K. loan if not paid within sixty days of leaving the job is considered an early withdrawal and you are\nTaxed and penalized and that's my understanding of the real okay so\nHere where I was under the impression that right now and when Lee lab that we weren't going to be able to pay it back up at that point we thought drawn based on what they told us that we were going to take that penalty and or the taxes on it wow I'm back when we ain't got\nSettled in Kansas a letter saying that they will say categorized and very tired I don't care because they don't get to

prosecutors play dash cam footage that appear to show McDonald walking away at the time\nYou know the history now he owns forty apartment complexes you know nine thousand units billion dollars with the real estate\nSo that deal all worked out well but the point was is it the reason I could bail him out was because I was more liquid than he was my money was sitting in a savings account and not in a money market account or not in a CD where they could freeze your money and\nWhat happened here what I Want you to get his I'm Talking with this lady explaining this to or we don't want your money and CDs we don't want your money money market account or just could be disastrous for you you can't be liquid enough to make a move\nAnd so she says well I've looked as savings accounts and she had found savings accounts it went up to 'em well mostly because right now by the way are paying about point six percent that six tenths of a percent and\nShe's said you know I talk to my some financial person that she knows somebody was and they said they could get her a point one a one point eight percent return as you said how does that compare that so that's pretty good but we got other

CDs you can earn up to three and a half percent on a CD a savings account ... gearing up to two percent of those savings ... out right now\nI'm In by the way when you go see deeper three and a half you're going out to like five years to get that shirt I'm tired of your money so you've got all these ways earned income but then when you look it's real estate our worst deals the ones that you know we consider our\nBread and butter you're just gonna get what you get type of deal is going to\nProve out to be somewhere between a casual basis between five ... Fifteen Percent\nAnd on good deals and\nThis could be anywhere from ten to twenty percent now in some rare occasions when you're buying single family houses\nYou can get even higher than twenty percent I've seen twenty four twenty five in the old days when you get thirty forty fifty percent but that's the old days it's not today's marketplace and you know remember these are the deals that are just the exceptional deals\nAre they still out there yes they are still find them yes we do but can I say that we can get you won every single day the answer is now these are the exceptions deals but you can go out there all day long and swing a golf club and come back with ... single family cash flow now ten percent\nFifteen Percent that's easy to do um apartment complexes you can earn\nYou know anywhere from seven to ten percent of the first year as your own then you get them in better shape you increase their income ... controller ... I've seen those casual school from seven to eight nine ten I've seen some or go to twelve Fifteen Percent um\nSome deals that are rehab deals I've seen them jump up into the twenties\nOr say mid twenties type of a deal so what does that really mean will it means if your money sitting in the same kind of like as I spoke with this latest was let's get your money into something say that you won't lose your money it's your FDIC insured will get it up to two percent one point nine one point nine five one point eight five\nUm that's something to do it say it's ... small amount of money it's something to do but just as soon as you can get that money back into it eight percent return think about what that is\nIf you're earning too right if you're earning too and you went ... for you would have under one hundred percent increase in the rate ... return if you're earning too and you could get the six that's two hundred percent\nReturn ... increase in red return and if you get ... eight ... three hundred percent increase and ready to return I think about that that's ... massive increase in ready to return\nThree hundred percent better not as you're seeing ...\nFive percent yes it's five percent higher return ... percentage returns increase is three hundred percent wouldn't you like to increase your profitability about three hundred percent\n... get into real estate get away from all these other investments ... you're in because real estate pays those kinds of ... now\nHave the time with this something that is really the six benefit but I Want to make it clear that this six benefits spread out and multiple different ways across each different benefits across the different games and that is actually wise\nIf you earn money from a CD or a money market account or a savings account or stocks that David is taxable ... ordinary income\nSo let's say you make\nTo pursue that savings account you lose thirty percent of that now you down ... one point see that'd be six ... one point four percent\nRight let's say you make four percent in stock dividends now you take thirty percent off of that and third Center for I mean it's going to take you down to two point one two point two percent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "05"}
