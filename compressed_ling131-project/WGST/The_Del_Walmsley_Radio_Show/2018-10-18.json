three and higher and I'm just wondering if I Would have to go through all the training to becoming a pilot\nBecause I feel like it they're calling for me but I'm not on the air and I'm just wondering if I said\nTap into that world or if I sit there and doing what I'm doing and saving and then retire I mean that pretty much where I'm at right now and I don't know I don't know what to do it had to duck\n... what would be wrong with becoming a pilot\nUm well I read that they heard about it in our\n... and what are you right now\nI'm I'm a retired\nPaws make a lot more than that show you that issue if you spent eighty and you made twice as much as you make now that'd be a good return on investment so that's not um ... what's the rest of the problem\nUm I get away from the family ha ha\nHa ha that's real as real but let's look at that do you have you done the research what is that going to based on the cost and you're going to do it cash so that's another issue you're going to do this cash so it's going to take a little bit wild eyed but are you willing to do what it takes to be in the air and fly\nI think I have to put my foot forward and at least attempt to try and work out that mean that that you get your pilot light Lauren grant that's right if I felt like it when I Would probably say yeah\nI think the answer is unequivocally yes I don't think it's probably yes I think your heart is so clear everybody on the air can here here's what I'm telling you you don't need to fill any guilt here's why\nYou've done the Dave Ramsey plan you're doing the play and you're going to continue to work in that job it's making you fifty five thousand you're going to castle as you go and because this is going to take maybe\nFive seven years I'm making that up whatever it is you're going to do it as you go and that means you're not going to sacrifice that much time away from the kids number one number two you're not going to starve because you're going to stay in that day job while you're pursuing the dream job\nAnd by the time you get ready to be gone from being a pilot the kids are going to be a lot older\nAnd the kids are going to see that mom set our mind to something and pursued it the right way and is happy and fulfilled what a tremendous life lesson and example you're going to be I don't see why you should have any guilt at all in fact I think you should be fired up about it and take one small step today\nWe might even guilt you if you didn't [laughter]\nExactly\n[laughter] you know I really appreciate it\nThanks for the call now reality is where you're going to be a corporate pilot today she might be gone a lot that's that's where I'm little kids' books and that might not be our lifestyle the fish but this is a process for it's not it's not a snapshot these are not instantaneous that's where I can just push a button and decide your pilot no this is going to take some milk on I turned it\nBut let's let's let's play this out real quick folks you heard this if it takes her day five to seven years to ... between the eighty thousand cash flow plus the the classes and all the training that requires to become a pilot\nShe could still stay in that day job begin to do things on the side maybe she fly some tours on the weekend again the kids are still maybe early teens but just five years removed from that they're out of the house and then she can go full time but she can actually fly part time\nI mean we have to look at the big picture and this lady wants to be in the skies and she can do it\nNow I got to tell you the problem with that thing is it's addicting from what I hear oh yeah all star 'cause I Know well what have I mean I'll give you a vast car so I Know you can't imagine how bad are get sucked into that that would be a bad idea ... you know I don't yeah I can tell some things I don't need to start because I don't have to finish them\nLook it's a bird no it's the random barrel out it's a pretty scary out there in so many ways\nBarbers on Instagram can she says I have over Twenty years of experience or should I have a two page resume with all my jobs listed instead of the suggested one page no which is why suggested one page but let me explain why [laughter] I\nLove those questions you know we fought this thing through here's why\nThe average hiring manager Davis spending somewhere between six and sixty seconds skinny interests me\nSo they won't see all two pages anyway so if you look at the Ken Coleman show resume template how to fix your resume to can call in show dot com it's absolutely free\nGive it to read because we actually show you what to do but we explain why you're doing it that way and it's based on research so for hiring managers looking at that for less than sixty seconds\nThey want to see what's most relevant to them to see if you\nCan help them win that's all they care about they don't want to be impressed with you they want to know\nCan this guy or gal helped me when and so irony managers not your mother but I don't care I don't care it all started over a hundred and Seventy hillside ... do you do oh God just exactly what you heard the phrase what have you done for me lately yeah think you ought to apply that your resume we don't care about what you did Twenty years ago unless Dave it's relevant to the current\nRoll your do almost never is [laughter]\nI think that's safe to say almost never so no I think you should do one page you know we've designed this resume tell that to be a brochure because folks that's what it is\nI graduated with a degree in computers in Nineteen Seventy four that is of no help today exactly you can't even spell computer now it's completely different it's completely different world show or what have you done lately that involved a computer now is it relevant it's everything about the Ken Coleman show dot com\nYou can download the resume template but resumes by themselves are worthless\nThey're completely worthless and I love that because it shocked people that they've you know this is true Ramsey solution it is you can give the data are the reality is folks that if someone's not walking your resume in to the person who's hiring for the job and said hey I Know this person through a friend of a friend or I Know them personally\nAnd I think they're solid individual to give them a look you're buried inside of a pile and it's like playing the lottery to get your resume noticed so that's what we mean when we say you got to do the work\nTo get a connection so the relationship is attached to your resume\nFifteen thousand applications here last year we are two hundred people case in point and there's no this is logistically impossible for us to look at every one of them with the ...\nAnd not to mention you motivate us each one of us to go find eagles to bring into this organization you want to keep crazy out so we're incentivized arranges let's just to bring in somebody that we know can fit the culture and can obviously fit the role that means\nCompetency character those types of things culture fit so that's why it's so important\nThat you have a relationship\nYou can download the resume template but don't use it by itself so that's what we're saying completely free at Ken Coleman show\nDot com if you have questions and you want to talk to Ken on insurance or some show or on his podcast which are the same thing will put out there on the phone number is eight four four seven four seven twenty five and Seventy seven gonna follow him on Facebook or his degree him\nAt Ken Coleman show a or at Ken Coleman on Twitter as well he's got a book out called one question life changing answers from today's leading voices\nAnd against the Irish one Twenty one and one eleven is where you'll pick up the show\nAnd I'm sure you're sick Sam ... stopping by always fun day say always good to have some help for folks out there trying to get their career aligned with their passions rounds you show in the books will be back with you before you know what's in the meantime\nBecause I needed to go where the opportunities or for my for my job and\nSince I've been involved and got gotten the concept of pounds of income I realize now that\nI shouldn't be beholden and and uh\nRelying upon a job a corporation the national economy or even the wall the on me for that matter because that all affects your retirement savings\nWhen you think about retirement most people think of that as being a nest egg that they can draw from when they no longer work as soon as you stopped trading your time for money then all of a sudden you need to\nRely on that ... that and that's where most people start to come into a living off of a fixed income they're trying to live as ... as possible so that they can make sure that that that they provide for them\nThroughout their lifetime and retirement and well you know a lot of people think maybe\nYou know while I'm going to have my how paid off and so I won't need as many expenses\nOr I won't have as many expenses than our won't need as much income but the thing as many people how on ... because you still need are coming in and finish stopped trading your time from old ... are open so retirement we'll we'll about a nest egg it's all about having an income\nAfter you bought putting in the work and left to walk the what I found through real estate investing\nAnd I'm always like do consider myself relatively young my husband\nStill in his forties and we really have no intention of retiring early on a new poll and productive with our on that through real estate investing both single family and multi family but that I've been investing in now than twenty ten till about eight years now\nWithin a thought the first four years\nWe will both able to replace what we were making out work with our\nOur rental income which is totally passive it comes in the mailbox so to me or that all that it comes in every month without having ... or ... or effort to it so the path of income is definitely the way to buy back of your time and has some financial freedom\nAnd the the thing that I always tell people when they come in there and this initial consultation with me is that I Want them to get to the point where if they continue to work ... become their grade level that's just all extra and and that's very powerful to be able to turn that around\nIt really is and it gives people an opportunity to open up their lives and think about the things I'd like to do you know many people\nWork for years and years and they're not able to travel there not able to uh just do the things with their families you know you think about just a a trip to Disneyland with your family nowadays is is style since of dollars if you've got a couple of kids\nAh and that's when he's out of reach for many Americans and other people would like to travel internationally and they'd like to start doing those things before they're officially retired or before they leave their jobs are so many people out there who loved the work that they do\nAnd for those that don't it allows them to save up and to look forward to the day where they can leave their employer and know that they will have the investments that they need right they can pour that all back into real estate to accelerate\nTheir retirement naturally would you teach people to do every day isn't it\nOh it definitely does that celebrate it you can that are ...\nYou know what will make money five ways and the path of income is is definitely the way to be because of that holy preaches must cash flow with any acquisition but ah the the the freedom that all that it allows you because you're making money and building wealth and so many other ways as well\nThat it just ... that's probably the exactly why the than\nThe ah lifestyle than limited as is named exactly what it is\nIt's about changing your lifestyle not only the freedom you don't have the pressure or the worry about being downsized or or and let go and\nAnd or or your company going out of business and finding yourself fifty eight years old trying to find another job that's going to pay the same amount as you were getting paid from something that you've been working out for twenty five or Thirty years\nSo it it it gives you that that that sense of security that freedom to know that you can walk away\nAnd they can actually pursued something of your heart desire I Know many people that are in a job that they don't necessarily like but they can't afford to take a pay cut to something that that that just has a a lower pay scale\nSo you know I I tell people especially when there was just considered that\nWere so many people going to college now and electing a a a major un I study discipline that\nWill bring them in a lot of money in their job\nIn their hearts desire maybe to be a teacher\nOr a social worker or a police officer which are put at typically not high paid ... and this way here you\nCan get past that they don't come through little estate boom you can go back and you can ... who was a career avenues that you want that we may have wanted and that's why I like to see young people do\nSo that they're not ... new collecting a job for the pay because they think that that's the only way that they're going to have have security in their future\nAnd that is so powerful you know we talk about how the effect of\nOf passive income cascades down through the generations and that was the biggest surprise to me is when when I first began investing in real estate using what do ... who was teaching me as my mentor and executing exactly the way he was telling me to execute so I Would get his same results\nI was I was focused on me I was focused on my retirement and then my kids started coming to me and asking me for information and it's changed your trajectory\nLives for exactly what you're saying now they're pursuing the things they love knowing they can always create wealth and

set you financially free and what we're focusing on today is passive income and the power of passive income to allow you to create a life\nThat you can do this thing she wanted to do you could be where you want to be with the people you want to be with waking up every morning choosing what you're going to do today\nIs a powerful way to live it's a wonderful way to live I Am so appreciative of my life and the fact that I was able to\nFigure out how to do this I found a team to help me I found a mentor still wants to help me\nAnd I did when I was told to do and I was able to create the same kind of results and that's that's really the power of mentoring and an education and mentoring program which is what do ... created and a lawyer you and I are both products at that per gram and now we have an opportunity to pass that now I can\nSay let's talk about we were we were talking about you know investing where you live you know just looking at things around you does it makes sense to invest in this market and if you could invest in the market right around you it's a market that you know well it's a market that you live and you have connections and you could put a team together\nAnd you can invest in that market\nBut it's it's a market like California or some of the east coast states or maybe it is a state where\nThey're passing unfavorable landlord laws where they've lost sight of the fact that landlords are are not all billionaires and um that we actually do you have to pay the bills have to pay the mortgage for that property we have to pay the insurance we have to pay the upkeep on that property in order to do so there are costs involved and\nAt the rent has to cover those costs and that's been forgotten in some states\nSo if we're in one of those states and we need to look elsewhere can you give us some some tips on how to get started a vest investing a far so that we can continue to live in places that we love or maybe even move you know if we're gonna\nRetire we might move and then want to invest in a variety of other places so how do we actually make\nThat happen well the first thing that you would want to do in any market is performing are due diligence of the area so not only are we doing due diligence of actual properties once we find them we want to look look at the area we'd like to want to look at crime statistics\nWe'd like to pull up the city a city website to see it there any non ... owner occupied laws or restriction or goals but we need to adhere to\nAnd so we find that area that look good and then we're going to start searching for property and you mentioned earlier that real estate investing really is a team effort\nSo many times I hear people say that they want to quit their job and become a real estate investor as their job and I tell them that's not what you do and then they go out there as a lone wolf and try to find properties and make the of some sort of an entrepreneurial a business\nI think he could get a job yet I'm ... or\nFollow the plan and establish a team that when you think about your team after you're doing you're due diligence we find an area that look good you're not afraid to drive to the area should you ever decide to go buy the property for instance I've been invested in Houston which is\nA four hour drive from the Dallas area where I live and I have invested in property they're spied on being but that's a large metropolitan area and so I'm not necessarily familiar with each\nPocket and each area that uh that I Would want to actually have tenants and and I know property when you have to do your due diligence on the city in the area of the city with the methods that I had just ah just mentioned that once you've decided on an area then you'll also want to\nEstablish a a a team of people who could actually funneling find properties or you know whether that be a team of a local real tours in the area it might even be a\nConnecting up with an on line with some of the real estate investing groups that are in the area and you want to be able to offer\nBut then you can run the numbers on each guilt that that TV if the if it makes sense but
