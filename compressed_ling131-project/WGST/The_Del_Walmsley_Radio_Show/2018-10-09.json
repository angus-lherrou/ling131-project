again text the word coaching to thirty three seven eighty nine Robert's with us in Atlanta Hi Robert welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nA day thanks for having me on\nSure what's up\nA one to ask you I'm retired and still work full time so I have a double dip you have a actually another small retirement sides by my retirement but I but come full Medicare I mean Social Security oh well next February\nAnd I was thinking at sixty six I Would take that and try to reinvest it ah and gross more\nA cushion for my wife who's younger than me [laughter] I think I've got enough money to live at home but I Want to help her out a little bit cause she gotta kinda bad early retirement contributions to marry a ...\nA ... only ... the end the maximum outlaw that we can into our retirement through our employment mhm so am I actually had a twenty four or five apiece starting this year mhm so I'm Wondering what you thought about taking Social Security is sixty six like that\nNo problem at all especially you know turn around and reinvest it\nWell we'll we'll have to pay some taxes on it since we don't qualify for all that well I think we still put some man or a regular our way but you know\nWhat you would qualify for a Roth if you continue to earn at least five thousand dollars a year\nA well I Am a misunderstanding there's an upper income limit on the\nOther is yeah yeah you can do not make over two hundred thousand dollar household income do you do okay All right then you can do what's called a back door Ross I'd do that every year I might considerably more than two hundred thousand and the back\nDoor Roth is a at over fifty I'm over fifty euro fifty we can put in sixty five hundred each six thousand five hundred each if we want to\nI'm into I put it into good gross stock mutual funds for me and for my wife saw Thirteen thousand dollars each January I Move into a what'd you do is you're moving into a\nA N after above for Tom sorry before tax IRA traditional i._r._a.\nBecause that way you haven't had taxes taken out on it you didn't take a tax deduction and then you roll it to a Roth instantaneously and all in the same trends are action it's called a back door Roth IRA I talk to your broker about it if you don't have one the one of our smart buster pros they can show you how to do that\nBut that that's the Roth IRA issue but you can invest your Social Security money\nWhat do you do a Roth or not you just put it in a mutual fund but if you're going to just take and spend it I mean you can do that too but\nYou don't need the money you got plenty of money so I mean yeah I Would go ahead and begin to draw it because I'm\nYou know the the faster you take it out when you turn around and reinvest it the more you're going to end up with a more than you would have in the difference in what it pays you by waiting\nUm so the only difference is if somebody's just consuming it and you're nowhere near that are then you might run the calculation differently but if you're a poet and invest it answers always pull it as soon as possible and start investing it as you're going to end up with more alive and more dead by doing that\nA Marlene ... is with us in Austin, Texas how can we help today\n[laughter] [laughter] hey what's up for taking my call I'm sure [laughter] I Need to ask you ask them straight finance at home and take advantage of that you know [noise]\nNot unless it's to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure are you in bankruptcy or foreclosure\nNow painted by pay tank and a half three cats and wondering if that's a good idea because our home and family admire them not only that\nBut the only thing you're not out of debt when you do that you just move the debt term you can get rid of it so what kind of data you got\nAbout thirty pounds and and credit card to get in\nThe mountains and they had a tiny infant and hard about Fifteen [laughter] [noise] okay\nAll right twenty on a car loan what's your household income\n[noise] came home I mean I did about forty and I have things in thirty thirty two\nCars off later expensive\n...\nMight consider selling that but for sure you guys need to get on a budget and on a plan and the two of you need to start paying attention to money and making it all but have you just kind of been existing and you're starting to feel like a rat and the wheel and you're looking for a way to get off the wheel and you just selected the wrong way to get off\n[noise] okay\nBorrowing your way out of that doesn't work so we need to change habits change processes get the money that we have under control push poll jerk some things around and get things moving um hold on I'll send you a copy of the book the total money make over I'll show you how to do this\nBut you gotta do something to do something you got to get really really serious\nAnd you're going to have to like you know cuts stuff out and get this debt cleaned up and the way you get it cleaned up pay it off and that may or may not mean you sell a car or but it for sure means you're not going on vacation for a while and you don't need to send us out of a restaurant unless you're working there\nYou'll need to really roll up your sleeves and get on beans and rice rice and beans are written plan and change some things around\nAmazingly fast Corinne are is with us in New York City like arena how are you\nHad anything to take my I'm sure how can I help\nMy fiance and I are getting married on Saturday and I'm particularly he actually\nLost his job this past friday whoa yeah so I kind of had to look like they have to question for you [laughter] I like it would be okay for us to go on our honeymoon still or if we should wait until things get a little bit more stable you know what do you spend on the honeymoon\nAnd we're going to spend about treat that and like he already had failed\nTo kill K cool rather money do you have saved\nThree now I'm On the case I have about seven eight out of the emerging find he's on baby step to talk to pay on his car mhm and then we had probably about two dozen other money saved that we can get a house up a little bit\nIn the three thousand on top of that yeah isn't it isn't all that anyway being a of a honeymoon fund on top of what you just told me [noise] okay um and what do you make\n'em I make about sex and making sixty four well did he do\nHe

after\nThe honeymoon I listen that's an easy job to get this incomes going to be replaced you guys got a little bit of pat\nI'm going on the honeymoon and go\nOh how fun yeah I'm fine thank you God Bless you thanks for calling in\nThis hour the day Ramsey show in the book and we will be back with you before you know it in the meantime remembers there's ultimately only one way to financial peace and that's the wall daily with the prince of these crises us\nAnd as you did that your thought process was to add additional income your family's income is that what it was\nCorrect right so I started reading a lot of books I I read a you know rich dad poured that I read books on\nUm creating multiple streams of income I read a you know lots of books that out the word millionaire and um although I'm becoming a millionaire wasn't I wasn't really all about the money but it was just about providing a for my family and possibly allowing me to retire earlier and so I I started to do a lot of research um\nStarted an online business that I had that was\nA selling a math resources to math teachers actually digital downloads so I started that back about Fifteen Years ago when uh the only things that were being downloaded that time tended to be a songs and things for MP three players\nAnd so I was actually selling\nUm mouth lessons in digital download forum where people would get a Pdf file from me\nAnd I thought that was pretty neat because I Would create a lesson and I would sell that same lesson you know maybe hundreds of times\nAnd it was just an automatic emails that went out that at all linked to a a file in it and I got sort of the mailbox money would come in and my inbox thing you just made a sale and it was all automated on the site\nAnd up from there I eventually started to turn my attention to real estate a little bit I'm One of the first things that I did was I bought a course by somebody I've heard you mentioned before Carlton sheets and uh it was probably a couple of hundred dollars probably saw it on a an infomercial one night and thought you know\nI'm going to go ahead and buy this course and it was one of those no money down courses and I don't think I ever used any of the techniques that he really was talking about in the program but it really\nWas sort of a primer for me to help me to get started and just to understand some of the basics of real estate investing and um so that's sort of where I began\nSo ah what age was is and where did you finally take action why what made it possible for you to go out to buy your purse property\n[noise] uh I was probably I'm guessing in my late twenties early thirties when I started to do some of this real estate investing research and at the time when we were doing this my mom was actually a realtor she passed away in two thousand nine\nI bet she was a realtor hadn't been involved in any rental properties herself and we saw\nAn opportunity to get into the market by purchasing a four Plex and so we went out and um it was a deal where my mom was the three quarter owner and I was the one quarter owner\nUm we put down I think Fifteen Percent back at the time on a five hundred and fifty thousand dollar property and uh we\nEach put down some money we took about thirty thousand dollars of the down payment on the line of credit and so with that partnership we we purchased the four Plex which I still own today um which is appreciate it quite a bit and value and that sort of how I have\nBeen successful in real estate at the beginning was really just managing some properties and and holding them for Fifteen Years in Southern California which of course with the appreciation that didn't really show that I was a great real estate investor but just that I was able to manage some property and and hold onto it for a period of time\nDid you have any cash flow at that time or\nA when we first bought the property it was it was before unit and we pretty much had to have all four units or rent it at the time in order to make sure we're paying the bills and paying the mortgage and the cash flow is very small the cash on that building now because we've had quite a while\nUm is is pretty good um although\nYou know when you look at Southern California real estate we have a couple of single family homes I'm One of them we just fold all last week it just closed and if you look at the value of the home and the cash flow that it's putting off it was it was not very strong and so that's one of the things that I took away from\nA lifestyles unlimited teaching was to get that equity out and start putting it to work in a place that was going to give a much better return and so that's one of the reasons we've told one of our single families is to be able to read a ploy that money and get\nIt back into a multi family investments and investments that are going to have a much better return\nYou know that's such a true fact in California is like you said to me that that's a capital gains value goes up who called just appreciation California as you appreciation goes up the value goes up\nThat's more and more jak when you when you look at the return on equity in the deal the returns get low very very low very quickly so you need to be able to pull that money and go do something else with which is what you're doing a very successfully let's take a look at um\nThe the concept that you and your wife got married and you had a house and she had a house is just so typical of how people that were really on purpose to get into real estate investing and up in real estate investing by just shuffling houses between family members at so bored\nTell us how that happened with you in the white you guys had all these houses back and forth between the two of you\nSo uh we had just bought that for unit apartment complex I'm\nProbably the year before we got married and then I met my wife Julie\nAnd when I met her we were both just about closing on our first personal rather than fat owned a a condo and I was trading up out of that into a single family home and she was\nPurchasing a town home her town homeless in Irvine um my single family homes in Costa Mesa and so we ended up getting married and we decided well we're going to only be able to live in one of these so we decided to live over in Irvine and her town home\nAnd uh we rent it out the place in Costa Mesa which we still have\nAnd we lived there for about two years and then uh we got pregnant and we're going to have our first child and the house and close to me is I had a much bigger backyard and it was just a little more conducive for raising children and so we went ahead and\nYou know moved out of the vine place but instead of selling that and you know using the money on trips and fancy cars and boats and whatever we said no we're going to keep that house and we're going to transition over into the coast to the south or so we did that so I've really only the four Plex that we purchased\nMy mom and I purchased together is really the only investment property that I'd ever bought on my own the other two homes that we have um we currently live in Huntington Beach and\nSo already we're gonna take a break ... this was a perfect place to take a break we'll come back and talk about how you got introduced elapsed will be right back with more totally had the del ... radio

buddies impact\nGlobal as the founder of interface incorporated and the world's greenest CEO race spent the last Seventeen years of his life showing others what a better future looks like for generations to come his legacy lives on a visit racy Anderson foundation\nUh what about all that bad as a math teacher did that not just blow your mind\nIs that style Juliet or at least subtly out or intuitive\nYes it is and in fact it's it's funny because the properties that we held I never actually took the time to do the math on on them I didn't really look at it that way I said well I have this property and makes me X amount per month and that sort of the end of it and I didn't really look at well there's that much on the property and this is a percent return on getting\nA which I probably you know whether that I can do the math but I probably didn't know the correct way to approach a spike in about that\nBut yeah one of the things that my other off a moment on the two days seminars is the idea that you just mentioned of getting an infinite return and so when I heard about deals where people would invest in an apartment complex and you know they would\nMaybe have a value player a hybrid play and two three four years down the line\nWould be able to refinance and pull their initial capital out and uh sometimes up to a hundred percent or more and so basically you have no more money in that deal and yet you're still going to receive you know you're eight or nine percent sometimes return on that\nDeal with no money left in there and now you can take the money you got back and you can go and back then in another property I'm really blew me away\nAnd and I think that's very nice or read anything I think that's a great place to take a break we'll be right back with Mark Kelly and the doe wants to radio\nShow I I\nUsually do their job now will be more flexible said yesterday I [noise]\nFrom Georgia Avon Long gone before you do news Saturday I'm Mark ... towards

days more totally mark is the best route of er California and mark is also a Southern California ambassador to Israel will get it out later right now when I Want to cobra coverage here is that we're more came here or the expo\nAnd the bus tour you got to be\nActual investors don't want to see real estate investors but that's real investors but that's too close to real estate in the actual investors\nThat had done multiples of deals and that gave him some insight into it's interesting um markers I talk about this to me as a reader of character is really what I Do more than anything else in life is that you a mathematician\nLook more personal touch is\nTo make decisions and in your life and those personal touches made a difference that you just said you can change your path and get into this uh multifamily stuff in this past and stuff so you made a decision how did you\nUm decide which lead investors you wouldn't have this or by the way markets and now we're southern passable part Will Ferrell the carpet deals and uh he's been doing this a shit what two thousand ... the beginning of two thousand eight teams when you started by multiple family more\nWell that'd be raised when I came to the two day in a Palm Springs and I'm a preferred member for about seven months and you've already doing seven deals right\nThat's outstanding as you get into this tell us as an investor which it I asked this question where everybody just as common question which is more important to you the lead investor or the deal itself\nOr the ... the horse I ever\nIs that question before um I definitely I'm going to go with uh the lead investors more important to me because ah as I've heard people say before you know as a top lead investor that really understands what they're doing\nCan take a property that uh maybe somebody else couldn't do that much with and they can do a tremendous things with it um whereas somebody that's not as accomplished as elite um\nMight not be able to do as well so I'm definitely I'm writing with delete investor and I have to tell you sort of a funny story when I first came to the expo um I had asked that the two day seminar I think I even asked you at the meat ... said you know I don't mind putting down the money for this a preferred program because I think it's well worth it but am I going to be able to get in any deal\nAnd that was my fear is I'm going to put down this money and I'm not going to be able to get in the deal and so um\nYou know I came to the expo and are on the Thursday night right before the bus tour a I got an email from Robert Martinez who is one of the leads that\nI really wanted to get in with and and I had heard him on this radio show I had heard him on the podcast and so I had heard him talk about how out of all these apartment complexes that he has he has returned over a hundred percent too I think ten or eleven different groups of investors and I thought I Need to invest with him and so\nI actually got an email from him on that Thursday night when I went back up to my hotel room saying we've got a new deal coming up if you're interested please or respond to this and let us know and so I I put in my information\nAnd it asked how much I wanted to invest and I said well I Want to invest somewhere between fifty in a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd when he when I saw him the next day on the bus tour he came on the bus tour and he told us what his minimum investment was and and it was a hundred thousand on that kind of a deal and I said oh I just said fifty two hundred this isn't gonna be right and if I went up and talk to him\nAnd he said now it's no problem you know send me an email back and fix that up and the long and short of the story is I ended up two weeks later are getting into my first deal\nA maple trail with Robert Martinez and um you know I think he carved out a spot for me as a new investor which I really appreciate it and I told him as much and so that was the first deal I got into\nAnd and the second deal I also made a contact through the expo and was able to um get into my next feel that way as well\nIt's interesting that um I think a lot of people believe the same thing a mark ... going to be difficult to get into these deals I Know that when I decided to go passive or just earlier this couple of months ago\nA bit out of nowhere\nHard like eight or ten deals right on my plate just boom boom boom boom boom is they're they're out there they're all over the place is just a matter of getting involved with it um\nSince you started I Know there's no most of these deals don't pay off in the first couple of months so we won't go into returns let's talk about your plan into the future what do you see and how do you see your plan
