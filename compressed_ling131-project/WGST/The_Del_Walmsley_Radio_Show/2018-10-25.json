{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "[laughter] I can or a good thought to 'em right now I'm stuck on a job and I'm not happy with my wake up every Monday and I'm just going to work and um I Know you're\nYou're you're sort of get used to be you know make your Monday is great again and that's really what I Want to hear and I want to work on my federal amount I just don't know how to make the jump from well even my current job on not excited about it all to go into the mall or their career that is completely different field that has nothing to do with what I'm currently doing\nGotcha okay well let's talk about where you want to end up you want to eventually on your own business so let's let's identify that dream what is that\nI'm currently it's kind of [laughter]\nI Know I got to focus on one thing but I'm On a have a degree of ... and I have a passion for development what the guy on\nA crate Web sites on the news and and just doing maintenance for companies [noise]\nUm but I also have a passion of a grand these teachers and I've done the financial coach master courting now with like the practice is you know maybe financial coaching on the side and I'm just it's completely different I'm not going to focus on one thing I just don't have\nMore exactly I should be focusing on right now and and and I work for somebody to give me that answer\nNo I think you have the answer I think you have any answer I'm gonna\nPut you on the spot okay\nI Know that you're passionate about Dave Ramsey needs help change your life and so you'd love to help others get some of that change that's what's really drawn to that but I I I and I think that's fine if he could have multiple passions link passions could be on different levels and I think you could maybe do some coaching on the side for extra money\nBut I heard you groom clearly and definitively say that you always love designed and Web design and I think that that's the work that brings you great joy if I could snap my fingers and give you a job doing that right now how would you feel\nAll go right now go\nFantastic of course I'm so but here's the deal\nSo there is a pathway to getting there what are you doing right now what is your job and how much you're making\nA right now I Do a commercial laundry equipment retire on her toes and a laundromat and ...\n... what do you think I'm a about sixty five thousand a year but I Do a lot of I ... in and out of town and that's really kind of what can they burned all are now you got to overcome All right do you have that out of town of them are what\nAre you completely out of debt what's your situation there\nAre always doing better just about to we started with about Seventy thousand among right now we're down to it though are Eighteen thousand now he started ... years ago\nThat's awesome where you've had two babies a cash for a lot of medical expensive come out that we've been working for ... ...\nJobs aren't given up on the plane you know who lives in a good\nThat's incredible you're doing great what's your pay off day you've got an idea in mind if if life doesn't keep throwing some ... and everything stays the same when do you think you pay off that Eighteen thousand\nA bomb march march early next year where that's where we're headed ... oh\nOkay so here's what I Want you to see first things first your current job I Know you're busting it you're working hard but it's making a huge difference and in less than a year from now you're going to be debt free\nAnd then after that you're going to put an emergency fun together and get through baby steps three how long do you think that's going to take\nA look when they are probably a month or six to eight months for ... murders in front of like a ...\nI agree with that Josh that's not that much time for you to bite your lip and be the study he wrote that you're being right now and get yourself set up to make this step not asleep but steps so my other question is let's focus on the future so how much experience do you have a Web design\nWell out of it was from the past but I remember with technology everything advanced or the right word that\nI'm kind of out of it went on that as far as the the code and stuff but but one good thing I have in my corner if I'm a very quick corner and knocking on a film motivator started right well they're wearing the stock market peaked must show\nA butter for Bill knowledge I mean I've I've got a lot of knowledge\nAnd that's how I feel just a Josh here's the deal so you got some experience which is great so you're you know that you've got the skill set this isn't a skill issue this is a train issue so you're the number one homework assignment\nToday is to go find out what qualifications you're going to need for the marketplace to say I hired Josh to do Web design that's that's number one homework assignment what additional qualifications\nSlash training education do you need and I don't mean college he's I just mean getting more equipped and getting up to date to make yourself marketable\nFind out what that is\nThat when you find out what that is the next question is how much is this going to cost me\nFinancially\nThen the next question is based on my budget based on getting out of debt and everything that's going on in my life if it's going to cost me this much much financially how long will it take for me to complete that qualification which will then make me qualified and marketable to do the role I wanted to\nJosh that's all you got to do because once you get the answers to those questions that's your plan\n\nYou understand you just plug and play at this point alright continue this much I'm going to say this much money I take this class this course and then you begin to practice proximity and talk to people who are in the Web design space in Winston Salem North Carolina who's hiring Web designers\nOr this could be companies that hire internal people or maybe it's a marketing group Asia you begin to identify targets now this is all happening\nJosh while you're paying off debt in this current sixty five thousand dollar over time gig is not going to burn you out any more 'cause you're going to change your attitude towards gratitude which is this job is a setting me up to step easily\nAnd triumphantly into the role that I ultimately won a field do you see where that is you see that about a year from now or and maybe sooner if you get the qualifications sooner and you can get a Web design job that's going to pay you sixty five thousand or sixty thousand after you've paid off the debt\nIt's a game changer all of a sudden Josh you're waking up on Monday morning fired up and feeling so white you're not even sure if you're sitting in the car\n[laughter] where they found her but I mean you can see that can't you\nAre trying to him as this how are you saying that it makes me mad at to try and go right to and I'm I'm Glad I called you know I'm Glad you got to get a clarity that leader or\nWell listen I'm Glad you called because I think there are millions of people that just heard your story and they see themselves in your story\nBecause you you've got it figured out and and it's\nJust coming up with a basic plant Dave Ramsey has been giving people a plan for twenty five plus years\nA folks there's five stages the ... and the dream one discovery who am I what do I want to do what I Want to do next research you just heard me walk Josh through research what I Need to learn to be able to do what I Want to do\nThen after I figure out the research what I Need to know who I Need to know uh when I Need to learn who I Need to know then we're going to move into\nActually embarking stepping out and making something happened practice that proximity prince will get around people they're doing what you want to do get in places where what you want to do is happening that's the embarking you're gonna start knocking offices mini milestones in those goals\nYou're going to begin to achieve and as you achieve\n... going to step into that dream roll the role that you were created to fill the world needs you to perform\nThat's the final stage of ... and the dream that's\nMeaning waking up like Josh wants to wake up each stretch Monday morning how many of you dread Monday morning there'll be a shame that Seventy percent of Americans no longer [laughter]\nThrilled to sit in for Dave Ramsey will affect day for allowing me to do this career ... like our producer James trials at our associate producer Kelly Daniel but mostly you find them or thank you so much for listening to this is so they ran for sure\nWell my parents really tried to stay debt free\nAnd their philosophy they grew up in a area that\nI think it's called the greatest generation where\nYou know you just didn't have that you pay cash for everything and so that's how I was right\nAnd so I really had to change my paradigm spanking I've just had to realize that you know that can be good debt can help you build equity it can help generate income for you if it's used correctly\nAnd it it's not a bad thing it's a good thing to leverage other people's money to create well so that was the big question for me I I just had to get over the way that I was raised and brought up on on the Sunday at\nYou know that's what I was thinking about you know as I've heard your your stories through the years I was thinking that to me your your story is a bit of an example of how to distinguish those timeless life's lessons that help us exceed that we get from our families\nFrom the ideas we need to transform in order to make her dreams and desires of reality and will unfold that here with your story today [noise] Leo we don't want to forget about you and your parents were commercial real estate investor so what was that like because you were growing up\nWorld and um it all started out originally when my father and my uncle or in the ... commercial construction business and um they ended up shutting down their business after um gosh for a new like\nForty years of business and I had a cousin that I'm starting a national brokerage company and\nWhat happened is a he would come across these particular deals and my father in law or is looking for for\nA no investments they bar you know cows and and that didn't work out too good and the best and some other stock and that wouldn't work out too good but it was my uh cousin ended up he was paid and then from the crop route to them and I was watching and\nI saw where they were making money and\nBoth my father my uncles for cash would've known those men would have gone in commercial real estate ownership business before you know there's some benefits to it\nSo I mean it was before I went to college I got out of college and you know and I said what do you think you'd want to do and I said well I Know what I said I walked in the in the commercial real estate business nor thought what better way\nTo get started and maybe you know try to\nTry to make some transactions and so I got my real estate license and are for sale hooked up with a group here in Dallas and\nFor a number of years it worked out pretty good or for like five years I made quite a few years are made some retail leases\nAnd that worked out real good and then the mean time I was always trying to make them transaction I mean you know apartment complex for dropping summer same walk I was always\nA lead towards that direction and after about five years there was Tom before I had money and sometimes for I didn't have money and I'm On what\nThe scarlet brought them back a mom of being in the commercial real estate broker and businesses I had a really large apartment complex for sale and I had a bar with\nA was going to um by the person you know I worked on this thing I'll probably for nine months and um and the guy got up and it was just the less you know\nMonths before is over and the guy walked out and I thought you know what I Can't do this any more I thought I'm going to get out of this and so\nI ended up going and I ended up finding you know I've gone around and I really didn't want to get into management too much and I did watch sales and so what I did vote but you know maybe it would be wise to go over\nThere and get into something that's more of a consumable product and be steady your income and wind sales or might have planned that worked at a um\nDistribution company in a anyways I ended up um you know ... down the ins and outs that business and got in with the with the big distributor and did that for a number of years and and that was good and I liked it and it was enjoyable especially in the beginning but as time went on I realized that\nAmong them end up my my income was always limited not really didn't want to go into management um bucket help but 'cause I\nI just didn't like necessarily managing people in particular um\nSo what I did is um because I was going along\nOur number one day I thought you know wash still need to go back and and uh I never let\nReal estate out in the back of my mind but um\nYou know the real estate with my father my mother and my uncle both of us and so it's Tom on on I ended up um I remember once all down on a franchise show I'm just looking around them I saw was a it was called the pad printing 'em machine and I've seen some of these women and\nSome more houses I Walk through and I saw them injection motors were important in on\nOdd shaped items like or your keyboard on your computer um it could be football's something that's not screen printing is where you're putting on something that's flat and I thought you know this isn't this is a pretty um a unique type of a businessman who'd there was demand for it and\nSo I did that and um I was doing that as a hobby actually is I sold one and\nI ended up doing that and I came across a few jobs that really put me on the ... I had one company that wanted me to imprint on a\nOn a coup or a hundred thousand coolers and they paid me quite a bit of money for it and so I was I ended up getting into a warehouse and and I'm actually had the ... which are more than two in favor of but I got ahead and say it was I did that for a number of years and\nInto quite a lucrative business and doing it in the defense industry I'm a printed on certain things or how it for a while and so that was and that led me and I ended up you know I did that for quite a few years\nWow that's quite a quite a journey Leo I mean you you you went through so it it feels like searching right and when we come back in a few minutes we're going to continue this story with Peggy and Leo and\nAnd Leo's journey in search for where he really fit in
