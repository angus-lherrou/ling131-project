Ninety six people were approved so I mean that's that's those are the odds you want you know\nI Want I Want to wait ten years only to find out that the government's scam me basically\nSo I'm not I

um then you can get on with the rest of your life and you've got you got to go again a\nGreat career track so you're going to be in really good shape [noise] thank you Josh what you're doing saint Jude good stuff All right Tim is uh weather's in Binghamton New York Hi Jim how are you\nDave how're you doing better than I deserve how can I help\n[noise] oh oh I have a quick question I'm about three hundred dollars in debt among or twenty five and my car is about to go I'm trying to office faith and pay off the debt as quick as possible so the question is is right now I'm putting seven percent of my paycheck\nIn my four one K. shed doing all that down to about one to two percent and just start throwing money at this loan right now and go about a hundred dollars a week at it mhm just to get it knocked out as fast as possible but why is your opinion sure counsel thank you for so much I you know you've\nGot to videos and lifting your show you've helped me avoid a lot of bad decisions like buying\nA crack the house and going into like a twenty thousand dollar car loan shower I really appreciate that\nCool good so well thank you um what do you make what your income\n[noise] I Do about twenty three thousand dollars after taxes but that's not including the overtime I guess you know what are you there\nI'm a welder okay so you get a lotta overtime\nOr for the most part can you get more Oh absolutely no one\nSaw a temporary basis you could really load up your overtime and clean up the ... very very quickly and then save up and get you know 'cause your car save every emergency funding and save up and move up and car and cash\nThat would be my learning to do now that would be my first three goals with what I heard them then and only then what are restart\nMy four oh one K. so what I'm saying is temporarily not forever but maybe for a year or maybe even to completely stop your four O. one K. to become completely debt free builds your emergency fund those three to six months of expenses and then\nOnce you've done that to save up and pay cash for a car and that's maybe step three in the rebate and then you moved to babysit for and restart their four O. one K. and then you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement but at that point you don't have any payments and you're driving a paid for decent car\nAnd these are all a really good place for you to be\nAnd that that's the direction I Would tell you to move towards show yeah while we have people working these baby steps to him unless your own baby step forward telling you to temporarily\nTemporarily temporarily stop your four O. one K. investing Andrew is with us in Dallas texas Hi Andrew how are you\nI'm doing well how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nOh not a whole lot I recently took a new job we're making a good amount of money and I'm very a church by ... stadium more or less to get more mhm\nOkay um ... are you out of debt\nAnd the idea is or current paid off the whole nine yards shut\nDo you have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nAre about twenty grand she currently\nAnytime so ... would you be saving for them\nAnd that's the whole thing I knew John ... wrote about five days a week so buying a house kind of out of the question right now mhm so I get the next question what should be said in force it couldn't be more in the Roth IRA right by our age or something and he looked for towards future would you recommend [laughter]\nWell you're at what we call baby step for she'd be starting to put Fifteen Percent of your income away for retirement or beyond that if you wanted to start piling some money into an investment to buy a home later that wouldn't be a bad thing but today it doesn't sound like you're on the market for home that\nYou know so it sounds like him to get your retirement savings started and a Fifteen Percent of your income going into that take your gross income before taxes point one five as Fifteen Percent and then get that started in your four one K. do it in a raw if you can match or if you can if you can't uh than let's do\nLook at Iraq on your own to a Roth IRA on your own and let's make sure you're getting that money set aside if you'll say Fifteen Percent of your income throughout your whole life into good mutual funds in a retirement plan you'll be a millionaire and usually a multi millionaire actually\nAnd um so we we can just at least get that started and then beyond that if you want to save\nTowards the house or even invest some money in a side mutual fund that's not a retirement account to use for house later you could do that well let's get Fifteen Percent of started now and things that you're going to chat it in the right direction so\nTake good question man and they give for joining us we appreciate your hanging out that puts this hour of the day Ramsey show in the books we will be back with you before you know what in the meantime remember there is ultimately only one way to financial peace\nAnd that's the ... daily with the prince of peace prize Jesus [noise]\nKilling in many times a day ran down ...\nMillion dollars is\nWhen things are more in the rain [noise]\nUh [noise]\nNBC News radio I'm some Robert Wall street continues to tumble for a second straight day after losing more than eight hundred points yesterday the Dow has been down by more than six hundred points at times today\nEarlier and so I I started to do a lot of research um\nStarted an online business that I had that was\nA selling a math resources to math teachers actually digital download so I started that back about Fifteen Years ago when\nUh the only things that were being downloaded that time tended to be a songs and things for MP three players\nAnd so I was actually selling\nUm math lessons in digital download forum where people would get a Pdf file from me\nAnd I thought that was pretty neat because I Would create a lesson and I would sell that same lesson you know maybe hundreds of times and it was just an automatic emails that went out that at all linked to a a file in it and I got third of the mailbox money would come in and my inbox thing you just made a sale and it was all automated on the site\nAnd are from there I eventually started to you know turned my attention to real estate a little bit I'm One of the first things that I did was I bought a course by somebody I've heard you mentioned before Carlton sheet and uh\nIt was probably a couple of hundred dollars probably saw it on a an infomercial one night and thought you know I'm going to go ahead and buy this course and it was one of those no money down ... horses and\nGuy ever used any of the techniques that he really was talking about in the program but it really was sort of a primer for me to help me to get started and just to understand some of the basics of real estate investing and um so that's sort of where I began\nSo at what age was is and where did you finally take action why what made it possible for you to go out to buy your purse property\n[noise] uh I was probably I'm guessing in my late twenties early thirties when I started to do some of this real estate investing research and at the time when we were doing this my mom was actually a realtor she passed away in two thousand nine\nI bet she was a realtor hadn't been involved in any rental properties herself and we saw an opportunity to get into the market by\nPurchasing a for plaques and so we went out and um it was a deal where my mom was the three quarter owner and I was one quarter owner um we put down I think Fifteen Percent back at the time on a five hundred and fifty thousand dollar\nProperty and uh we each put down somebody we took about thirty thousand dollars of the down payment on a line of credit\nAnd so with that partnership we we purchased this four Plex which I still own today um which has appreciated quite a bit and value and that sort of how I have\nBeen successful in real estate at the beginning was really just managing some properties and and holding them for Fifteen Years in Southern California which of course with the appreciation that didn't really show that I was a great real estate investor but just that I was able to manage some property and and hold onto it for a period of time\nDid you have any cash flow at that time or\nA when we first bought the property it was it was for unit and we pretty much had to have all four units or rent it at the time in order to make sure we're paying the bills and paying the mortgage and the cash flow is very small the cash on that building now because we've had quite a while\nUm is is pretty good um although\nYou know when you look at Southern California real estate we have a couple of single family homes I'm One of them we just sold\nOut last week it just closed and if you look at the value of the home and the cash flow that it's putting off it was\nIt was not very strong and so that's one of the things that I took away from a lifestyles unlimited teaching was to get that equity out and start putting it to work in a place that was going to give a much better return and so that's one of the reasons we've told one of our single families\nIs to be able to read a ploy that money and get it back into a multi family investments and investments that are going to have a much better return\nYou know that's such a true fact in California is like the epitome of that as the capital gains value goes up a book called just appreciation California as you appreciation goes up the value goes up\nThat's more and more data equity when you look at the return on equity in the deal the returns get low very very low very quickly so you need to be able to pull that money and go do something else with which is what you've been doing a very successfully let's take a look at um\nThe the concept that you and your wife got married and you had a house and she had a house there's just so typical of how people that were really on purpose to get into real estate investing\nEnds up in real estate investing by just shuffling houses between family members and so forth tell us how that happened with you in the white but you guys had all these houses back and forth between the two of you\nSo uh we had just bought that for unit apartment complex I'm\nProbably the year before we got married and then I met my wife Julie\nAnd when I met her we were both just about closing on our first personal rather than fat owned a a condo and I was trading up out of that into a single family home and she was purchasing a town home her town elements in Irvine um my single family homes in Costa Mesa\nAnd so we ended up getting married and we decided well we're going to only be able to live in one of these so we decided to live over in Irvine and her town home and uh we rent it out the place in Costa Mesa which we still have\nAnd we lived there for about two years and then uh we got pregnant and we're going to have our first child and the house and close to me is I had a much bigger backyard and it was just a little more conducive for raising children and so we went ahead and\nYou know moved out of the vine place but instead of selling that and you know using the money on trips and fancy cars and boats and whatever we said no we're going to keep that house and we're going to transition over into the coast of south uh so we did that so I've really only the Fort blacks but we purchased\nMy mom and I purchased the other is really the only investment property that I'd ever bought on my own the other two homes that we have um we currently live in Huntington Beach and so already act we're going to\nTake a break broke this was a perfect place to take a break we'll come back and talk about how you got introduced elapsed will be right back with more totally had the ... radio show\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the radio you know we'll be back with more like

so more conventional wisdom or send you a man on a mission to retire one version and bumps and we'll go\nBack to do a show with me days Martelly mark is a investor out of a California and mark is also a Southern California bass or to get it out later right now what I Want to cobra coverage here is that we're more came here for the expo\nAnd the bus tour she got to be\nActual investors I Want to see real estate industries but that's real investors but that's too close to real estate goes so actual investors\nThat had done multiples of deals and that gave him some insight into it's interesting the markers I talk about this to me as a reader of character is really what I Do more than anything else in life is that you met the titian\nLook more too personal\nTouches to big big decisions in your life and those personal touches made a difference that you just said you can change your path and get into this or multifamily stuff in his past and stuff so\nAs you made that decision how did you\nUm decide which lead investors you wouldn't be ... by the way mark is now in seven passable part multifamily apartment deals and uh he's been doing this a shit what two thousand the beginning of two thousand eight teams when you started by multifamily Mart\nWell February is what I came to the two day in a Palm Springs so I've been um a preferred member for about seven months and you've already done seven deals right\nThat's outstanding as you get into this tell us as an investor which and I asked this question of everybody this is common question which is more important to you the lead investor or the deal itself\nHow they got on your though the horse\nI've heard you asked that question before um I definitely I'm going to go with uh the lead investors more important to me because uh of I've heard people say before you know at a top lead investor that really understands what they're doing [noise]\nCan take a property that uh maybe somebody else couldn't do that much with and they can do a tremendous things with it um whereas somebody that's not as complex as elite um\nMight not be able to do as well but I'm definitely I'm writing whip delete investor and I have to tell you sort of a funny story when I first came to the expo um I had asked that the two days seminar I think I even asked you at the ... that you know I don't mind putting down the money for this uh prefer program because I think it's well worth it but am I going to be able to get in any deal\nAnd that was my fear is I'm going to put down the money and I'm not going to be able to get in the deal and so um\nYou know I came to the expo and are on the Thursday night right before the bus tour a I got an email from Robert Martinez who is one of the leads that I really wanted to get in with and and I had heard him on this radio show I had heard him on the podcast\nAnd so I had heard him talk about how out of all these apartment complexes that he has he has returned over a hundred percent too I think ten or eleven different groups of investors and I thought I Need to invest with him and so\nI actually got an email from him on that Thursday night when I went back up to my hotel room saying we've got a new deal coming up if you're interested please or respond to this and let us know and so I I put in my information\nAnd it asked how much I wanted to invest and I said well I Want to invest somewhere between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd when he when I saw him the next day on the bus tour he came on the bus tour and he told us what his minimum investment was and [noise]\nAnd it was a hundred thousand on that kind of a deal and I thought oh I just said fifty to a hundred this isn't going to be right if I went up and talk to him\nAnd he said now it's no problem you know fend many in all back in and fix that up and belonging shorter the story is I ended up two weeks later are getting into my first deal\nA maple trail with Robert Martinez and um you know I think he carved out a spot for me as a new investor which I really appreciate it and I I told him as much and so that was the first deal I got into\nAnd and the second deal I also made a contact through the expo and was able to um get into my next feel that way as well\nIt's interesting that um I think a lot of people will do the same thing a mark ... got to be difficult to get into these deals and I know that when I decided to go passive or just earlier this couple of months ago\nUm that out of nowhere\nHired like eight or ten deals right on my plate just boom boom boom boom boom is they're they're out there they're all over the place is just a matter of getting involved with it um\nSince you started I Know there's no most of these deals don't pay off in the first couple of months so we won't go into returns let's talk about your plan into the future what do you see and how do you see your plan developing here", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city":
