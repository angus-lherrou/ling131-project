it just ... team can help you with that and getting rid of those and then the cars how much do you owe on your cars\n[noise] um we had a track right now that's forty five Taliban and their mom and your household until much work [noise] um where at tech rock about one thirty year you know\nYou know get rid of both them and just get you to be years from now while you get this mess cleaned up it's not a forever car it it's just a short period of time but if you can\n... the huge amount of money you got going out the door on cars and the huge amount of last year taking every day and appreciation of how fast you're going down in value is just destroying you guys so I I Would just moved down to like to five thousand dollar cars\nAnd [laughter] you know even if you have little doubt on those and you got a little bit on where you were upside down finance it over its credit union or something and cover their mouth that you're in the hole is still a lot less debt than you've got now and you stop the bleeding\nAnd so I guess I'm not exactly sure how to go about doing that either going to make a little better\nWhile here and we walk you through it okay let's take the uh thirty two thousand dollar car that's the dead on my car correct\nYeah let's pretend that when you look that car up on the Kelley Blue book that you can private cell that car for um like twenty eight thousand\nWhich will be like four thousand in the whole point now where do we get to four thousand while you obviously don't have any money you're broke right so you're going to either borrow that from your local credit union or your bank\nAnd you'll be four thousand dollars in debt instead of twenty eight instead of thirty two thousand dollars and that so that's huge progress right there okay and the and then a let's say that I come up to buy the car I hear your check for twenty eight thousand you put the four thousand you borrowed from the credit union with it and pay the car off that get you the title to give to me the buyer\nMy okay and that's how you do it now who are your lungs with on the cars\n[noise] um one is a credit union and want to throw ally\nOkay the allied deal will will work just like I talked about just now the credit union you may be able to sit down with them and convince them by sitting in person in the manager's office only so it's not a telephone conversation\nBut you may try to say hey look this is how far we are upside down this car which means that you have a partially secured loan\nYou have a loan that secured by this much the value of the car the rest of this one was an an secured loan right\nYou understand what I'm saying yeah OK then the uh\nAnd so Mr manager all we're asking you to do is to admit that it's an secured by giving us in ... alone for the amount that you're there were in the whole I Want to sell the car and get out of this\nDebt okay and then you got a\nFive thousand dollar loan and credit union whenever the differences are you know at the credit union instead of a forty five thousand dollars or whatever the word whatever the numbers work out to be but I Would dump both of these cars get into some very very cheap cars for a period of time while you clean this mess up and it's going to take you a couple of years clean this mess up\nOh yeah but five years from now you'll be driving anything you want to drive and you pay cash for it\n[noise] and it's not like help and\nIs it was not open I mean you you can do it mathematically if you just take the steps and sacrifice to get there but you've got to amputate I you know these\nCars I mean you have thousand dollars a month car payments are more probably twelve hundred\nAnd um you know it's just it's choking you to death\nHere to feel so much more free when you get rid of those stupid vehicles and then later on and get your whatever you want your drive like no one else or later you can drive like no one else you live like no one else or later you can live and give like no one else ... was with us in San Antonio Hi Betty Lou how are you\nCan you hear me now yes ma'am how can I help\nDon't I was telling your comrade that I felt like on the poster child it takes me to her having a bad financial decisions and not by a semi retirement\nAnd the reason I'm calling because I I Am working full time on sixty two and I want to find out how to leverage my situation\nMy income by saving fatter I have found that to ensure at least a reasonably comfortable retirement which I plan [laughter] about eight years\nShould I earned it got too much do you make I make a sixty six thousand a year good America how much debt do you have\nI have twenty thousand in their early on that and I am twenty eight hundred do online vehicle which our pay off by\nMhm okay so twenty two or three thousand dollars in debt making sixty six such good All right and how much money do you have saved not counting retirement\nOkay so I had the government's version of a borrowing K which is a good thing and I'm sure you're familiar with it and I have about eleven thousand and and I was\nYou have any money other than that saved I had a thousand dollar fine okay good All right cool while we stop adding the ts pay temporarily\nYes I I I well I took it down to one percent\nStop temporarily and completely concentrate on his twenty three dollars worth of that with the airline then you've got squeeze every dollar out because when you don't have any payments then you have control of your most powerful wealth building too\nWhich is your income right now it's all going on student loans carpet image so we get rid of the car payment you're a student loan by we build an emergency fund raising the thousand dollar up to a three to six months of expenses emergency fund baby step three and then maybe step for is saving Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nAnd um you know where will that leave you is the next question so we'd like sixty six thousand dollars\nLet's just pretend for a second and Fifteen Percent of that is Ninety nine hundred ... says eight hundred bucks a month\nGive or take nine hundred bucks a month something like that going into retirement um and we start with eleven thousand ... known and putting this and the calculators were mumbling\nAlright on on the calculator and we're going to do this for say I'm\nI'll just put ten years in there for the phone number just to see what it does she would kind of money we end up with here that would be about a quarter million dollars\nThat you would have at retirement and you would be Seventy two\nAt that point um and that's not counting any kind of match from the government a lot of most of us but you don't have a match 'em and that's not counting any raises you get during the next ten years while you're working\nBut if your debt free and buy their own your house would be paid off too by the way um and so if your debt free one hundred percent and you have two to three hundred thousand dollar sitting there\nThey don't make it I'd like to have you have a lot more but it's not as a whole bunch of for peace from social in security is your only way to retire\nUm and you certainly don't have to buy the cookbook Seventy two ways to prepare a bow and love it you'll be able to eat so you put the income for three hundred grand along with um the income from Social Security in your early seventies and everything is paid for 'em I think you'll be okay\nUh we're we're past panic mode anyway because we now have a plan I'm going to send you a copy of Chris Hogan book retire
