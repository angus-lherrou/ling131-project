trying to make an offer on the property it doesn't look like a good deal and you have to go through through quite a few property and you don't get every day of it but by the time you actually purchased some heat than maybe a hundred evaluations\nAnd if you're paying by the evaluation that very\nUm and in fact the one of the data that we view is called written range like our like every rental paid a provider in the country the nationwide data and by far and away they were the uh they had the best and it was amazing how accurate the rental day there was\nA problem as or was that when you go to their website and want to purchase nobody listens to the dollar one just to evaluate one property\nUm but we were able to work out a deal with them so that when people try to lifestyle February they actually have unlimited access to many ran range evaluation that they need to have so we've been able to eliminate that issue\n[noise] nope we had no but I don't think this would work because it's just too expensive to go out there that price now the other thing that I've seen other software programs are required to sign up for long periods of time six months to a year or whatever or we're not doing that are we\nCorrect so we're just doing a month to month of ... when you hit it off your subscription ended up with it and and that that work really well for people so that they're

to quit and\nYeah ... where you have to really look at that but I Do find that a lot of people just keep their churches because they said people will be like you know maybe there will not do something and then all of a sudden they just get that that drives up fire into this\nAnd so they you know when I look at the usage pattern by the February\nA it's a lot of people do not if they may want to hop

call awesome and\nI Know you're so you're gonna wish that you\nKnow the man on a mission to rely on the\nLooking back you're do on the radio show um today I'd like to discuss with you I'm this concept of saving for retirement or saving for retirement and how much the average family has said\nNow I read this article is really good article had a lot of data I'm not going to try to go through all the data but I can tell you some basic concepts the younger people are the less they say that's a simple one you know the older you get more people have said because they had a longer period of time to say\nUm [noise] but there seems to be a differentiation here in Studio and I'm going to have to see if I can go through this with you it says\nRetirement accounts savings are inadequate on equal retirement accounts savings of families age thirty to sixty one\nRight I'm from age thirty two to sixty one are different than what the other agents are so that that piece of material right there to really nothing for ... years the the real interesting part they're talking about\nThe means savings of all families so if you take me what is the main the main says if you add up everything\nAnd divide by the number of people in the uh survey Seattle everybody's retirement can divide by the number of people survey that the mood is Ninety five thousand seven hundred and Seventy six dollars\nNow they go on and this long article to explain that that's almost in ill relevant number because the people on the bottom have almost nothing and the people on the top ... massive amounts of money saved up so they talk next about the median savings\nWith families that have retirement savings so you look at the media is if you were to take a number if you'd late all the numbers out in a row\nAnd you found the very center of all the numbers from the lowest to the highest amount saved and you found the center the center is sixty thousand dollars so the average person from the fifty percent del bracket down as last sixty thousand dollars\nBut actually if you only take people that have retirement savings\nIf you do the same thing with people that do not have retirement savings and you take the media and again the media and drops to\nFive thousand dollars so think about if you took every American out there with Andrea retirement age\nAnd your line them up on a roll on the wall street maybe I ten freeway from one side of the country the other and you went to the halfway point\nTo the halfway point half of all Americans and below have only five thousand bucks that's pretty scary when you think about if you take out the people that have zero city and you do the same line up\nHalfway down the line half of all people that if you tried to save only sixty thousand dollars now that is on believable just unbelievable\nThat anybody out there are sort of the country has five thousand or less the people actually believe in savings who have saved ... percent of the country really at sixty thousand how could you retire at sixty thousand dollars\nNo idea how they even think that that's going to work it blows my mind now [noise] when you're at age too that\nIt really skews the numbers because literally people have way more savings in younger kids et cetera et cetera et cetera so should go with your age groups which are here by age group\nAnd what you'll see is that there are different age groups believe differently in said so if you get to the age group the working age group of thirty two to sixty one\nDo you find that the media and we talked about Ninety five thousand dollars but if you look at the people from fifty six to sixty one in other words not the whole group of working class people right now but only people for fifty sixty sixty one the last five years quote unquote\nTheir average or they're mean there's a hundred and twenty four thousand dollars\nOr a hundred and sixty three thousand dollar like that or if you go from fifty to fifty five hundred and twenty four thousand um and it goes down precipitously from that point on as you get younger and younger and younger um but these are people that are said these are not everybody does your
