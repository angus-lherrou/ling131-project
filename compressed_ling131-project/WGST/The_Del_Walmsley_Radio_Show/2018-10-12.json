wanted to go and how do I want to pay back no I go to the pilot and I found it on Monday good at going back to the fact that it premium up but it doesn't cost me anything and I'm going to have to pay you know\nI'm ... and it has a cash value in it right\nDown to three thousand dollars\nOkay and you understand premium offset is they're using the three thousand dollar cash value to pay the premiums correct now that's not offset you're using your savings account instead of your checking account to buy your premium\nI saw it was also they're ... they're getting their dad gummed money you can count on that\nThey're taking out of my pay that debt and\nYou know ... my point he made it sound like it's free\nRight which can kill the candidate you know policy that rates are low and\nI Know and when you die you know what happens to the rebels in dollars they're going to keep it going to keep it so how is this good idea there's no way this is a good idea so true you do whatever you want to hunting but those causes your crap and I wouldn't keep a thirty seconds\nAnd it wouldn't have the big discussion was stupid whole life insurance agent about it either match on the line and Los Angeles\nHey Matt how're you\nDoing fabulous they thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nSo um my question a revolver the twenty five percent rule that you use for the mortgage my wife my bottom all about a year ago\nAnd I'm I'm One of those people were all I did not include property taxes the homeowner's association and be insurance as part of it came in to the bank I Do all of that separate way mhm\nSo my question is is are you supposed to include the H o lay the property taxes and the insurance as part of your twenty five percent role in the way that you teach\nI generally just say principal interest taxes insurance away no but most people as you know we're paying that has one payment and the whole point is not whether it's twenty five percent or twenty seven percent or twenty three percent there is no magic number there the point is is trying to keep people from being house you pour\nOkay where they got such a dead gum payment they can't breeze and then they wonder why they're broke right\nYeah well we just started here class about six months ago we actually purchased the house about a year ago and and the numbers wise we ... we actually did a thirty year low but at\nThe council twenty percent of our income so um we have about forty thousand less than a day off and then we are looking actually refinanced into it in a while but the\nAir you can ... if you've got a good interest rates you can just pay that loan like it's a Fifteen minute will pay off in Fifteen\nThat's true we have the option to do that as well\nEither either one is fine I don't know if I go to refinance cost if you have a competitive interest rates but it sounds like you're fine I mean 'cause you're you're twenty percent as you're in great shape right now you got to clean up this other bad but I mean the thing I don't want to have somebody with a you know six thousand\nDollar income take home pay and in a in a four thousand dollar house payment wondering why they're broke you know\nThe whole the whole point is big numbers here not the ... and not splitting hairs on it the er and I'm not saying you're splitting hairs you're being wise to ask for details there's nothing wrong with that but but I I'm saying my formula of twenty five percent is not so perfect\nThat if you're at twenty five point five percent oh God you're going to you've messed up everything no no no the point is just to not be house for that's all it is it's kind of a big number philosophy in other words big chunky numbers not fine tune numbers other things I Do I Do find two numbers on but that's a good clarification thanks for calling in\nJackie's in Oklahoma City Hi Jackie how are you\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOkay I'll just start off really quick I Am twenty seven years old I had a um a total of twenty five hundred that I or twenty five thousand a day or that including my mortgage and on\nAccess that and my question is would it be worth it to save an add on to my house or to save up and buy 'em though at least\nSave up for the down or if it would be more ideal pet save that\nContinued until you can tell you say on sweets complete every single stat and then by our dream house later on\nOkay I'm a little bit confused you you you yeah I Know ... it's okay you're wanting to add on to this house or move up in house you\nKnow add on to the town I live in a gray area I work from home is why I Need a physical need a base to them what to what the house that you're living in worse um\nRight now it's probably worth about seven eight thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy now um what what size edition what'd you do how much money would you spend on the addition\nI Would want to spend about twenty grand just enough to add on an expert brown says I work with children and I may that's\nGood and so the homes in your neighborhood on your street and then the next street over cell for what price range\nThey sell for about a between seven eight ten Ninety on the Upper East side of my neighbor had just because it's a really small street has pretty nice houses I mean they're they're they're pretty darn nice and then my ... my part is I'm\nGoing as somebody looking for a house that's worth Ninety thousand dollars it wouldn't be unusual for them to be on your street\nRight but you wouldn't want you wouldn't come on your street to look for a hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nRight okay so don't put more than twenty into it to Seventy plus twenty is Ninety and in order to be able to get your money back out you don't want to over build the neighborhood okay right so yeah and yes we are going to pay cash for the addition and what's your household income\nUh it's about five thousand and my mortgage is uh about four hundred dollars\nYou know and your mortgage and all your debt is only twenty five thousand right right yeah and where you are not much of that his mortgage and how much of that other debt\nAh there is only three thousand in day and then there's twenty two and a mortgage\nAnd you're making like Seventy thousand dollars a year right household income All right well and so how quickly could you come up with forty five thousand dollars to be dead free and have the twenty to do the ...\nWell I I I Can't do math myself but um I Know that we plan on eliminating the access that within the next line yeah and then we're going to kick off and start paying about falling out plus I'm an extra fall now between the lowest in life\nI mean if it takes two years from today for you to be debt free and you have the ... edition done and you've paid cash for the addition is that okay\nUm well I mean that's where I'm kind of ... I just I Want to do with that\nThat ... I'm just trying to set up ... and if it takes two years from today and you are dead for it's not a trick question is it okay with you if we if you have the addition completed and paid cash for and you're a hundred percent debt free and it's two years from today is that an okay plan\nI think so because I I honestly lover I live\nGood parenting you can do that because that's too that's twenty two thousand dollars a year out of Seventy thousand [laughter] and you paid off\nEverything house and everything and you pay cash for your addition you ought to be able to do all of that within two years so I think you've got a great plan I Would become free and then I Would save up an add on to my house so more than twenty thousand they sure you get contractor beards and I'd everything down to you know what you're getting into\nThat puts this hour that I've Ramsey show in the books we will be back with you before you know it and the ...\nA rare I realized that you know teachers are typically paid on a salary schedule and I I wanted to be able to provide more for my family and so I started looking probably at that time outside of teaching for what are some other entrepreneurial things that I could get involved in\nAnd as you did that your thought process was to add additional income your family's income is that what it was\nCorrect right so I started reading a lot of books I read a you know rich that poured that I read books on\nUm creating multiple streams of income I read a lot the books that out the word millionaire in them although I'm becoming a millionaire wasn't I wasn't really all about the money but it was just about providing a for my family and possibly allowing me to retire\nEarlier and so I I started to do a lot of research um\nStarted an online business that I had that was\nA selling a math resources to math teachers actually digital downloads so I started that back about Fifteen Years ago when uh the only things that were being downloaded that time tended to be a songs and things for MP three players\nAnd so I was actually selling\nUm math lessons and digital download forum where people would get a Pdf file from me\nAnd I thought that was pretty neat because I Would create a lesson and I would sell that same lesson you know maybe\nHundreds of times and it was just an automatic emails that went out that at all linked to a a file in it and I got sort of the mailbox money would come in and my inbox thing you just made a sale and it was all automated on the site\nAnd up from there I eventually started to turn my attention to real estate a little bit I'm One of the first things that I did was I bought a course by somebody I've heard you mentioned before Carlton sheet and uh it was probably a couple of hundred dollars probably saw it on a an infomercial one night and thought you know\nI'm going to go ahead and buy this course and it was one of those no money down courses and I don't think I ever used any of the techniques that he really was talking about in the program but it really\nWas sort of a primer for me to help me to get started and just to understand some of the basics of real estate investing and um so that's sort of where I began\nSo at what age was is and where did you finally take action why what made it possible for you to go out to buy your first property\nOr I was probably I'm guessing in my late twenties early thirties when I started to do some of the real estate investing research and at the time when we were doing this my mom was actually a realtor she passed away in two thousand nine\nI bet she was a realtor hadn't been involved in any rental properties herself and we saw an opportunity to get into the market by purchasing a four Plex and so we went out and um\nIt was a deal where my mom was the three quarter owner and I was a one quarter owner\nUm we put down I think Fifteen Percent back at the time on a five hundred and fifty thousand dollar property and uh we each put down the money we took about thirty thousand dollars of the down payment on the line of credit\nAnd so with that partnership we we purchased the four Plex which I still own today um which is appreciate it quite a bit and value and that sort of how I have\nBeen successful in real estate at the beginning was really just managing some properties and and holding them for Fifteen Years in Southern California which of course with the appreciation that didn't really show that I was a great real estate investor but just that I was able to\nManage some property and and hold onto it for a period of time\nDid you have any cash flow at that time or\nA when we first bought the property it was it was before unit and we pretty much had to have all four units or rent it at the time in order to make sure we're paying the bills and paying the mortgage and the cash flow is very small the cash on that building now because we've had quite a while\nUm is is pretty good um although\nYou know when you look at Southern California real estate we have a couple of single family homes I'm One of them we just fold last week it just closed and if you look at the value of the home and the cash flow that it's putting off it was it was not very strong and so that's one of the things that I took away from\nA lifestyles unlimited teaching was to get that equity out and start putting it to work in a place that was going to give a much better return and so that's one of the reasons we fold one of our single families is to be able to read a ploy that money and get\nIt back into a multi family investments and investments that are going to have a much better return\nYou know that's such a true fact in California is like the epitome of that as the capital gains value goes up call just appreciation California as you appreciate she goes up the value goes up\nThat's more and more data equity when you look at the return on equity in the deal the returns get low very very low very quickly so you need to be able to pull that money and go do something else with it which is what you're doing a very successfully let's take a look at um\nThe the concept that you and your wife got married and you had a house and she had a house is just so typical of how people that were really on purpose to get into real estate investing ends up in real estate investing by just shuffling houses between family members and so forth\nTell us how that happened with you in the white you guys had all these houses back and forth between the two of you\nSo uh we had just bought that for unit apartment complex I'm\nProbably the year before we got married and then I met my wife Julie\nAnd when I met her we were both just about closing on our first personal rather than fat owned a condo and I was trading up out of that into a single family home and she was\nPurchasing a town home her town elements in Irvine um my single family home was in Costa Mesa and so we ended up getting married and we decided well we're going to only be able to live in one of these so we decided to live over in Irvine and her town home\nAnd uh we rent it out the place in Costa Mesa which we still have\nAnd we lived there for about two years and then uh we got pregnant and we're going to have our first child and the house in Costa Mesa had a much bigger backyard and it was just a little more conducive for raising children and so we went ahead and\nYou know moved out of the vine place but instead of selling that and you know using the money on trips and fancy cars and boats and whatever we said no we're going to keep that house and we're going to transition over into the Costa Mesa south uh so we did that so I've really only the four Plex but we purchased\nMy mom and I purchased together is really the only investment property that I'd ever bought on my own the other two homes that we have um we currently live in Huntington Beach and so I already have we're going to\nTake a break broke this was a perfect place to take a break we'll

going back and now you're so far you can measure the waste is that you read the man on a mission to retire remember one man I Want I Want them\nBack to do on the show with me days Martelly mark is the investor out of a California and mark is also a Southern California bass or to get it out later right now what I Want to cover a cover here is that when mark came here or the expo\nAnd the bus tour she got to be\nActual investors I Want to say real estate industry but that's real investors but that's too close to real estate though so actual investors\nThat had done multiples of deals and that gave me some insight into it's interesting um markets I talk about this to me as a reader of character is really what I Do more than anything else in life is that you a mathematician\nLook more too personal touch is\nTo make big decisions in your life and those personal touches made a difference that you just said you can change your path and get into this or multifamily stuff in this past and stuff so as you made that decision how did you\nUm decide which lead investors you wouldn't have veteran by the way mark is now which seven passive apart multifamily apartment deals and uh he's been doing this a shit what two thousand the beginning of two thousand eight teams when you started by multifamily Mart\nWell that'd be raised when I came to the today in Palm Springs dot and I'm a preferred member for about seven months\nAnd you've already done seven deals\nRight\nThat's outstanding as you get into this tell us as an investor which it I asked this question of everybody this is a common question which is more important to you the lead investor or the deal itself\nOr the ... the horse I've\nHeard you asked that question before um I definitely I mean to go with uh the lead investor is more important to me because uh I've heard people say before you know at the top leaders of after that really understands what they're doing\nAnd take a property that or maybe somebody else couldn't do that much with and they can be a tremendous things with it um whereas somebody that's not as accomplished as elite um might not be able to do as well so I'm definitely I'm riding with the lead investor and I have to tell you sort of a funny story when I first came to the expo\nUm I had asked at the two days I mean I think I even ask you I mean L I said you know I don't mind putting down the money for this a preferred program because I think it's well worth it but am I going to be able to get any deal\nAnd that was my fear is I'm going to put down this money and I'm not going to be able to get in the deal and so um\nYou know I came to the expo and are on the Thursday night or the bus tour or I got an email from Robert Martinez who is one of the leads that\nI really wanted to get in with and and I had heard him on this radio show I had heard him on the podcast and so I had heard him talk about how out of all these are complex is that he has he has returned over a hundred percent too I think ten or eleven different groups of investors and I thought I Need to invest with him and so\nI actually got an email from him on that Thursday night when I went back up to my hotel room saying we've got a new deal coming out if you're interested please\nOr respond to this and let us know and so I I put in my information [noise]\nAnd it asked how much I wanted to invest and I said well I Want to invest somewhere between ... and a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd when he when I saw in the next day on the bus tour he came on the bus tour and he told us what is the minimum that I was and [noise] and it was a hundred thousand on that kind of a deal and I just said fifty to honor this isn't going to be right if I went up and talk to him\nAnd he said now it's no problem you know I mean all back in and fix that up and along and sort of the story is I ended up two weeks later are getting into my first deal\nA maple trail with Robert Martinez and um you know I think he carved out a spot for me as a new investor which I really appreciate it and I told him as much and so that was the first deal I got into and and the second deal I also made a contact through the expo and was able to um get into my next feel that way as well\nIt's interesting that um I think a lot of people believe the same thing um are they going to be difficult to get in these deals I Know that when I decided to go passive or just earlier this couple of months ago\nUm but I don't know where\nI'd like eight or ten deals right on my plate just boom boom boom boom boom they're just they're they're out there they're all over the place is just a matter of getting involved with it um\nSince you first started I Know there's no mostly steals don't pay off in the first couple of months so we will go into returns let's talk about your plan into the future what do you see and how do you see your plan developing here\nWell I'm I guess I like it", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show",
