school to be a nurse practitioner\nGotcha okay and how long will that two are going to be about three years then once it cost\nA forty five thousand\nAnd then you sell the condo and your rent and you use the money from the condo to live on while you go to school and pay for school\nI was I was actually thinking about saving up um some money and the next year to put down on a house on a Fifteen year alone and um so you know by buying a mortgage\nHow you're going to pay for a house if you're not working\nOh well that was hoping I could have a some saving flash some of the funds from the condo go toward\nUm living expenses paying for school a cutter yeah you're not qualified for a mortgage if you don't have an income [noise] outdoor out they'll be working part time out that we make it about forty five thousand a year oh okay your wife work outside the home she the kind of a politician and she makes what I'm about twenty five\nOkay and she argues ... are you going to be in the same city doing all of this\nOr\nI'm not concerned about homeownership until three years from now if you want to if you want to do this and just keep all the cash available and make sure you hit your goal\nThat's fine let's make the turn with no debt\nAnd when we get out of the get out of school inland the you know nurse practitioners job and uh your income probably going to go up in that situation pretty substantially um then and you've done all of this for a hundred percent that free then you think about buying because whenever you buy in the next two years is not going to be a house you\nKeep two years later okay because you're going to move up an income your incomes going to go ... when you come out of school agreed [noise] yeah yeah and so\nIt's a different house world than all of a sudden for you I don't mind if you rent\nSomething and just keep all your cash available to ensure that this dream occurs debt free because when I Dream of cars and its financial debt it often turns into a nightmare and we don't want to go that route but I Love the whole plan the idea and the will you know your willingness to sacrifice to get it done\nAnd reset your life in your thirties that's that's pretty cool man\nA pretty gutsy and I like it a lot\nUm and obviously you've investigated in er nurse practitioner and what they do every day and that is what you want to do with your life\nAnd I'm sure it'll be heavily invested after this you're not going to be six months into that and go oh why or something you don't want to get to that that's you're paying too big a price to get there but if you're going to play this through for the next couple of decades this could be a very very cool move for your family and for you or a satisfying move\nThe question thank you for joining

mentioned it might be a good idea to freeze my one year olds credit do you think that's necessary\nI don't know that it's necessary but probably wouldn't do it\nI'm\nA I froze my kids when they were minors as soon as the law came out allowing you to freeze in law just shifted the other day and and like they used in late September allowing you to freeze a credit bureau without any fees now like you were allowed to charge you a feed a phrase that or an freezing\nUp until a late September is the twenty first the law shifted so um yeah I Would freeze it and and the only reason is if someone were to steal his identity give his Social Security number somewhere and try to open an account of his name\nIs ... the company's trying out there are trying to open the account with checks his credit they'll find a frozen and they would it would prevent that type of identity theft and out fraud\nUm now if they don't check it it won't prevent anything and only about three out of ten the credit card application so they actually run the credit on the auto issue the other seven\nSo that's how they issue credit cards on dead people in dogs\nBecause they don't even bother to check and if they check that will discover you know a free you're a one year old with a frozen credit counseling ... this was fraud and they're not going to issue the car\nSo it'll help feel at all and I probably would do it and probably and probably I Would go to Sandra insurance when I get identity theft protection on your whole family including your children and they have a family plan that does that and\nThat first

I'm trying to pay down the house and tried to stay out of debt you know I'm trying to keep up my job get a little better do a little more get paid a little more of a job all these things is is your player but the plan is working\nAnd my problem with my home was it every year we would have a freeze the only one or two days maybe for the most were the temperatures drop below twenty degrees and for every hour that you're below twenty degrees temperature\nOne quarter of your plants tropical plants die so by the time that stays under twenty degrees for four to eight hours a whole night their debt they all die\nSo every years replacing all these players along with all the angels are that had to be replaced every year because we planning the gardens these ...\nUh they're they come in and stay through the heat in the suburbs and those guys who die off we had to put in other words you can handle the heat but when he got to be whether they would die off so this is the annual thing so what is inside of was is that we're going to change the plan for my whole\nLife changed the plan to go away from tropical go to an English garden where I can fill it with plants\nThat will survive the winter here\nAnswer by the heat of summer and so I drew up a whole new plan of what I wanted to put in the yard Melissa that I worked on it for hours and hours and hours and gave up the conclusion what we wanted and then we paid a landscaping company to come in and put the plants and so forth and get it to where we want it to be\n[noise] now as we did that\nWe ran out of energy and money before all the particular gardens and this house has like ten different law owns a few of the house you got a front yard a backyard and are both probably not that big this is ten dry law ends and then it has hundreds of beds\nFlower beds planning beds stuff just blows my mind\nUh there's probably a at least a million dollars with the landscape materials planted in the short right now and I go through ten twenty thirty thousand every year to try to change that get it back down to some realistic you know um so I changed the way I was going to do the player you're going to have to change your plan\nIf you want to get financial you become financially free you're going to need to change your plan now in the apartment complex of looking at or that we have purchased\nWe're to play and going in the lead invested in this doing the deal had a player and he can see what the other guys players how the other guys player was wrong and now he has a plan that he's going to put in place but even as he puts that plan in place there's tremendous number of obstacles\nAnd so as he's going through this thing this first week the obstacles are becoming clear to him things some of which that we're clear before we purchase the property others that were hidden very well until after closing fighting about and again it's all due process of getting through the obstacles and\nI kind of wanted to work through this with you today because as a working through this yard thing as sort of figured out\nThe ... the process here and hopefully you can learn to take something from this process and put it into your process to make things better so the first thing I did was I was I looked this up oh there's a secondary problem the landscaping company that I had put in my stuff the plants they did such a poor job uh and\nThey tripled\nThe charge of my landscaping weekly monthly landscaping fees\nAnd so I had to let him go so I had no landscaper for about two months and just had somebody mowing the yard and so all my bed all my plants were destroyed there was nobody watching my yard and all of a sudden I woke up and it looked out there to go Man March destroyed looks terrible\nIt so it had to take on the project or would've had to do that I had to put it into perspective something I could deal with it so what I did was divided up into areas\nAnd like I said there's like ten different environments ten different areas in my yard each of these ten different areas has different plant types\nIt has different son ratios from the day or night or from you know all day long what part of it's all of a sudden full sun parts sun part shade and shade\nAll those are different everyone so everyone has to be dealt with completely on its own\nYou can't just go in there to I'm going to theoretically get in your fix everything 'cause you can't so I took on the very front part of the law and first because it was almost completely dead\nAnd the beds we had just put in we're looking weak\nUm\nI had a flooded out area there were some sprinkler heads were broken never flooding the yard\nAnd so I had one part of this zone was all\nDead because they had no water the other part of his own was flooded because it had too much water now trying to figure that without because you can't fix it by turning the zone this bleaker sprinkler heads on fixing it because if it was all dry you would use water more if it was all wet you would water less\nBut during the same so\nI just wanted to go out there to investigate head by head by head on the sprinkler system you know what was wrong and what I found was two of the sprinkler heads were completely broken and that's why that all these two areas were completely debt because the sprinkler heads were broken\nFound on the other one the sprinkler heads were leaking\nAnd I also found by research\nThat some of the ... way too large for the small amount of area that they're in because when we did the yard\nWe had to reduce some of the sprinkler head to head combinations problem so we come back we'll talk about how we start hacking through this stuff and how it relates to your self financial situation would be right back with the deal was

waste what is being waste or in your life and uh I find myself you know looking\nOut my wife and my process to mark ... by business has the same way I look at what is the way dead weight in my life takes up my life\nSo I was given a thought process earlier on the block from my dad as though it's not what it costs by Celtics when it costs to maintain that if you look at your situation you or your rent financially in your life right now is it worth it for you to have the big ... or\n... really the right thing to be doing at this point you know maybe the kids are all going you know ... why should get rid of some of the expense that may as well\nThe energy and money in maintenance of that big home you got two or three or four cars do you really need two or three or four cars I'm\nIt's ridiculous I've I've had as many as six cars I'm Down to four and I'm thinking about getting rid of one of them I've ever drive it or the other three a completely different vehicles that I actually

started that never finished a project to finish the stuff left over a all that stuff she's kitchen your way just slows you down\nAnd you have to take care of it you have to maintain it you have to moving cleaned around and clean ...\nUm\nWhen I was going through the irrigation situation what I thought was\nIs it I was actually wasting water I was an era gaining above and beyond I figured you know the old thermostat problem\nYou know you sit there and said to the temperature you wonder well an irrigation system you don't really know what that about is and so you either seen your places to dry and turn it up where you see the places too low you turn it down\nI'm Sorry you you're too much water and you turn it down\nThe problem is you don't know how 'bout you turn it either direction the wise thing to do is to start out\nAnd start moving slowly but surely not crank it all the way up and get now you generally crank it all the way up to if you got to really dry why'd you want to make sure you get enough water to try to come back but you can't leave it there you got to crank it back down again because once you've got it growing and saturated now you're going to get it\nA U turn its keep it so whether you're going to get mould and so on and so forth so it's a it's a balancing act guys you got to stay on top of it but we are talking about this just one zone in my house so I
