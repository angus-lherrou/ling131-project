{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Mourn and wonderful blessing who who is leaving out who you\nAre actually my great grandfather started off as a penny pincher and you know is building generational well so\nI'm very lucky and it's amazing your great grandfather wow you know I'm\n... and ... are you single\nI and I've got a girlfriend but we'll see how that pans out right\nOkay and um what do you make a year\nOr about sixty right now good for you and how much debt do you have I have not look at you or your great grandfather's kid that's excellent [laughter] he's proud of that I'm sure I'm\nAll right um how old are you\nI'm twenty three okay good good okay\nTypically what will occur in the next five years statistically speaking it's not a requirement is certainly not a law it's just an observation of the way life unfolds or you'll get married and buy a house\nTypically okay you might not you don't have to like I said it's not required I'm not saying that but the point of that being those are two major events and uh both of them will require money\nAnd so we need to keep that in mind what we're doing this we would always tell you to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses so I Want you to have brown Fifteen thousand bucks or so set aside for that um\nIf you want to buy a home and pay cash for it at this stage and inexpensive home a that's not a bad thing uh I I I Would expect that when you get married you probably wouldn't move again and that's not unusual it's not bad it's just you kind of expect that so I'm\nJust generally after you get married you find out you bought their own home\n[noise] [laughter]\nYeah I I'm anxious to buy a home my older brother is buying a home at this point but I just don't think it's right for me with you know with how accessible moving is for me and my field I Am a nurse I'm terrible at moving anywhere\nOkay on your own house you don't you don't have to then that's cool you enter is not my point is there's no rush\nAnd I I'm personally with you I think it'd be cool if you wait three years to buy your place in kind of quote settling on or whatever number of years and so once you've got your emergency fund in place and your debt free then there's really nothing left to do with this money except three things which is what you should always do with money\nYou should enjoy some of it\nI'm a small portion of it not much you make enough with no debt to enjoy your salary or you should give some of any money that you have\nAnd you should um invest some of it and so the majority of this money and if I'm In your shoes is going to be invested\nAnd uh the ... the portion that you know you're going to leave alone you're pretty comfortable that you're gonna leave alone at least five years I'm just going to buy some good mutual funds that I invested in four types of mutual funds in my\nRetirement and in my long term investing which is five years or longer and growth growth in income aggressive growth and international\nI probably would set\nA hundred hundred and fifty of this\nIn something or a little more conservative than that that is growing some but I'm probably going to pull that money out in the next five years and buy a house with it\nAnd um you know something along those lines again it's not a requirement and I would make sure I was settled in you liked the um\nUh the flexibility that you've got now and I think that's a bad I mean I think that's a good thing uh I think you're on hold on to that flexibility for a while I don't want to look up and find your thirty five years old and still having not bought a home\nOr in especially in your situation 'cause you're in such a great situation\nSo I Would give some I Would enjoy swimming I Would invest the majority of it ah some of it towards a home in the future maybe just a simple index fund and ask them ... five hundred no load and there's no commission just let it grow um it is going to go it's going to follow the market whatever the market does\nAnd then the rest of it I Would invest longer term than that just to build wealth with\nIf you start at your age say with 'em\nAround two hundred thousand of this and you invest it you know and it just sits there for forty years in grows a stock market rates of return which has been eleven point eight percent since it started a ... of wealth is going to be unbelievable\nAnd it's it's a wonderful way to\nUm honor your great grandfather's legacy sound sit down with a smart rush for pro is what I Would tell you to do with ... dot com it'll drop down a list of the smart Mr pros and your area when you fill in your stuff you pick out one you like or two or three and interview them I don't care\nAnd go from there and sit down with someone and start to learn about mutual funds how they work what they are how to invest\nAnd I think it's good to have two buckets of investing here one with a five year mindset for buying a home and one where the forty or mindset for just becoming on believe oblique wonderfully wealthy\nA art Ashton is with us from Charlotte North Carolina I asked him how are you\nI'm doing great how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nWell I'm I just recently about three months ago started that every dollar at love it I mean with a smart pro investor this week from a personal finances and operate but my question isn't on the individual ... [laughter]\nIt is on the church or a non profit out of things I was curious if and your opinion or protected [noise] are there are ways for churches and nonprofits to and for them financially\nWell some people call that being in Dowd a we're a university\nIs typically a situation where you would see that happen [noise] um and that's where there's I\nOur genetic sum of money that the investment return off of that account\nSo you out of ten million dollar endowment that had built up and that money is invested in the investing their returns off at ten million dollars will operate the thing then perpetuation and so then the nest egg\nCauses of the nonprofit to live in perpetuation of folks that are you most often see that in a um\nA a formal large a\nNonprofit or in where you really see a lot as a university\nOr were there and going or even a professorship there's enough money in this one account that the income is providing is paying the salary of a professor in whatever field okay if someone just felt like they wanted to make sure that university was able to\nUh pay that professor in perpetuation going forward and that kind of a thing\nIn the local church I almost never see that\nA lot of pressure the evangelical world okay the ... local church now our solar system has a lot of assets\nAre the Vatican is a very wealthy and show that's a different a different mindset on it but in evangelicalism the vast majority of the time those of us sitting on that church border that elder board which I've done many times would say the investment is not to be made in um\nIn earthly investments but instead and then the people\nAnd causing people to make Christ and grow and crushed and that that that's the investment so we want to show the only actual wealth is retained is paid for properties that the thing operates fan for\nThe awesome retained earnings that are sitting there are some savings just to make sure that there's an operational buffer but\n\nWell my parents really tried to stay debt free\nAnd their philosophy they grew up in a air the\nI think it's called the greatest generation where\nYou know you just didn't have that you pay cash for everything and so that's how I was right\nAnd so I really had to change my paradigm banking I've just had to realize that you know that can be good debt can help you build equity it can help generate income for you\nIf it's used correctly and it it's not a bad thing it's a good thing to leverage other people's money to create well so that was the big question for me I I just had to get over the way that I was raised and brought up\nOn on views on that\nYou know that's what I was thinking about you know as I've heard your your stories through the years I was thinking that to me your your story is a bit of an example of how to distinguish those timeless life lessons that help us succeed that we get from our families\nFrom the ideas we need to transform in order to make our dreams and desires of reality and will unfold that here with your story today [noise] Leo we don't want to forget about you and your parents were commercial real estate investor so what was that like because you were growing up\n... and um it all started out originally when my father and my uncle or in the ... commercial construction business and um they ended up ah shutting down their business after um gosh for a new like\nForty years of business and I had a cousin that I'm starting a National Book words company and\nWhat happened is a he would come across these particular deals my father in law or is looking for\nOr a no investment the bar you know cows and and that didn't work out too good and the best and some other stock and that wouldn't work out too good but it was my uh cousin ended up he was paid and then from the ... route to them and I was watching them\nI saw where they were making money in both mom Bob ... gosh would've known the men were gone and\nCommercial real estate ownership business before and you know there's some benefits to it so it was before I went through college I uh out of college and you know what I said well you'll be thinking why do I said well I Know what I'll say I'll walk and then the commercial real estate business you know thought what better way\nTo get started and maybe you know try to try to make some transactions and so I got my real estate license and are for sale hooked up with a group here in Dallas and\nFor a number of years it worked out pretty good or for like five years I made quite a few years are made some retail leases\nAnd that worked out real good and then the main Tom ... trying to make them transaction apartment complex for dropping summer say Marco is always a lead towards that direction and after about five years there was time for had money in some ... didn't have money and I'm\nOn the ... vote them back a mom of being in the commercial real estate broker and ... really are large apartment complex for sale and I had a bar with\nA was going to um by the person and I worked on this thing probably for nine months and um and the guy got up and it was just the less you know months before though when the guy walked out and I thought you know I Can't do this I mean more I thought\nI'm going to get out of this and so I ended up going and I ended up finding you know I've gone around and I really didn't want to get into management too much and I did watch sales and so\nDoes a ... you know maybe it would be wise to go over there and get into something that's more of a consumable product and be steady your income and wind sales law might have worked at a a\nDistribution company in ah anyways I ended up um you know found them in and out that there's this and that and with the with the big ... river and did that for a number of years and and that was good and I liked it and it was enjoyable especially in the beginning but as time went on I realized that\nAmong them into my my income level are limited not really didn't want to go into management um bucket help but I just didn't necessarily managing people in particular um\nSo what I did is um there's always going along our number one day I thought you know wash them and go back and and I are never let\n... real estate out in the back of my mind but um you know the real estate with my father my mother and my uncle both of us and\nSo it's Tom on I ended up um ... down on a branch our show I'm just looking around them I saw was a it was a coma pad printing 'em machine and I've seen some of these women and\nSome more houses I Walk through a solemn injection motors were important in on\nOdd shapes items like your keyboard on your computer or it could be put into something that's not screen printing is where you're putting on something that's why it and I thought you know this is this is a pretty um a unique type of uh the last minute there was the man for it and\nSo I did that and um I was doing that as a hobby actually evolved soul won\nOn the Internet and my came across a few jobs that really put me on the ... or I had one company that ... to ... and ...\nOr ... thousand cruel but I didn't mean quite a bit of money for it and where I ended up getting into a world from and I'm actually headed to a ... or ... or ... to ... go ahead I'm Sorry I did that for a number of years and\nThat turned into a quarter lucrative both from the ... I'm a Clinton on certain things are wow and so that was that it led me and I ended up you know I did that for quite a few years\nWow that's quite a quite a journey Leo I mean you you you went through so it it feels like searching right and when we come back in a few minutes we're going to continue this story with Peggy and Leo and\nAnd Leo's journey in search for where he really fit in this world and what he was going to do to create the wealth and passive income he needed to live the life he desires you're listening to the dump the radio show this is Lynn ... we'll be right back\nTo the job but what we're supposed to\nSlap you on TALK radio six forty WG as the\nNorth bound lanes I've been opened on highway just past ... your current us cell phone remain shut down with the major apartment fire earlier this afternoon and brought game and also we got wind down at Georgia State near Georgia's actually just altogether spell a stream Piedmont Avenue\nOr what does it goes right into this and all this chance\nTransformational story of you know working through the traditional model coming from entrepreneurial Homs\nThen getting thrown into more traditional model that most of us experience with work and then realizing the need for change this is Len Morrow with Peggy in Leo on the ... radio show in the in a moment we'll be back with more of this story as we talk about change and discovering where we really fit in life if you have a question for pat you're on the phone call age\nSeven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven eighty seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven we'll be right back um\n[noise] I\nMean you know when I was just really I guess [noise]\nFrom the Georgia is one one call before you do you ... ... torture news networks the whites are steadily coming back on across south and southwest Georgia after hurricane Michael Georgia Power says it has Ninety nine percent of its customers backup and plans to finish up tonight\nThe Georgia AMC's we're still dealing with about twenty seven thousand outages this afternoon\nThe Georgia department of natural resources are still working to clear away debris from and restore power that some of their state parks following Michael began our spokesmen west Robin until we're the most extensive damage water\nParks particularly pretty hard call ... state park and seminal state park which is right there kind of the Alabama Florida Georgia border\nHe says the storm also destroyed quite a bit of the habitat of the endangered red complicated woodpecker uses it could be weeks before they have a ... dollar estimate on damage or Georgia police officers been put on administrative leave following a G beyond search of his home in Rockville yourself\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nTraffic on TALK radio six forty bill you see as the [noise]\n\n\n\nIn the morning and then you just got bigger on on reading ...

in Atlanta forties in the suburbs and then Thursday highest Seventy one with lots of sunshine so fall it's finally here and it will be cooler today and for the rest of the work we came into the weekend\nIt's just been CBS forty six meteorologist Jennifer Valdez yeah I've seen I\nLove your kids oh you're so more conventional wisdom was that you read the man on a mission to review I remember I mean Obama sees\nWelcome back on the radio show with Lynn morale Peggy and Leo are sharing their stories we've heard about their childhood and entrepreneurial families and their experiences in corporate America that led them to see the need for massive change Peggy retired\nAnd Leo soldiers business yeah those were bold moves how did you\nDecide what to do next you know sitting there thinking about it you know you've you've worked where you work your way up in corporate America to the point that they said hey don't expect any more money over here right we're done\nOr the system is that you're going to make and then ... you know you built a business and tells the point that you're going you know I I don't want to expand that's on one hand on please\nAnd I do this somebody offered you a great price and and you said okay and you sold your business and and you found yourself now I'm looking out at in uncharted uncharted voyage why don't you do next\nWell when we figured it I'm selling stock options so we'd buy the stock and we'd spell the options and Leo had had been listening for years on the radio and to this from that was advertising their program and so we got in there and and we\nDid quite well it the first because really you buy the stock he's still the option immediately on your computer you're given credit and to your town and that was great and\nThat we were asked to buy stock the stock every month for ten months until we were called down at the stop well and that was fine and good we were cost averaging you know on our stock and um\nIt was good until the recession hit because then the stock prices on some of our holdings started going down and I went down so loud that we got to wear on some of them we couldn't sell the options anymore\nSo actually our equity was going down\nAnd we were losing our principal and then our income on our stock option income was going down so we knew that we we had to make a change you know we were just looking for something more where um our equity would increase in value and that we'd have a steady income so we decided that we needed to make a change\nAnd how was that from your perspective\n[noise] well I just thought you know we've got we've gotten ourselves with Apollo ... from past year\nAnd I thought you know what I kept I did it a couple of times for I Would try to get hold of real estate brokers and try to buy something that's called cripple ... at least and and maybe on a small office warehouse\nEvery time I Do that I ended up getting um somebody would bought out from war can you get to it and I was really first read it and that shows\nAnd um so anyway I kept her in the program on the ah radio about this you know stock option than it was good like Peggy mentioned and uh for a while and then uh it got to war I just realized that you know we're supposed to hold on for some of these stocks from him now tariffs on um\nA move China and I thought jeeze you know this that there are some flaws on this program and um I told I guess and you know what I keep hearing about lifestyle them limited on the radio and I said you know we gotta go check this program around you see what it's all about it's been on for a number of years and\nSo that's what I'm I thought you know uh that's when it comes to lead let us over to a\nLifestyle or you know two and a ... you know I go on to it a couple of times and um it was and then you know than it was a whole nother process where are you getting hurt you know to join and uh 'cause we both need to do it together 'cause we're team\nAnd um she's smarter than I Am and\nUm she makes better decisions ... about a ... percent of the time and um it was so all you can you know but it was I knew that lifestyles where we need to be a ... today and because they talk about everything and really in a way\nI guess my background on the path wasn't wasted um\nBecause what happened is it all came back to me with the laws from the family from ... from um\nUh just you know going to school and learning about real estate but I had you know uh but there are certain things about the oil they all family you know when uncles and all and cousins\nAll this kind of disenchanted because of after the past you know my parents and the market at all you know people they're what they're needed to be a plan and great to be control on things and it's always kind of disenchanted with that end of the real estate um aspect", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "17"}
