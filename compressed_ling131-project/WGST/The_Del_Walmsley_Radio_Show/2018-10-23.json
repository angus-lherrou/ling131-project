{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Mhm okay what ... what is it\nThis is the Nineteen Ninety two accurate and at ... ... at it from ... new twenty five years ago\nOkay you bought a brand new okay brand new before her well before her into a and um yeah and so what does the car worth I probably thirty five forty thousand dollars now wow it's done well okay well I paid for it but that twenty five years\nAgo yeah I'm Still I'm shocked at a known them more than that um [noise] the ah\nOkay and so what is your household income probably two fifty year All right and uh what is your net worth\nI'm pushing close to three million okay\nUm\nWell I don't know why you would sell like ... you know you should keep a car\nThat car they listen to it let me tell you how many let me let me say outright that decision okay here is that you make the decision the color is she's exactly right it's completely impractical it's a toy yeah okay it's emotional but this is like asking her to sell her wedding ring and she doesn't realize that\nI Would never do that right\nAnd it's a car you've had for twenty five years ... it's called actually means something to your number one number two it is a ultra small percentage of your net worth if you would call me up and said I make sixty thousand dollars a year were broken in debt and I love my car I would've said when little boys show your car\nWhich are not broken into your worth three freaking million dollars you could drive this car off a cliff and it you wouldn't even notice it doesn't change your net worth one iota okay it's such a small percentage of your world it doesn't matter it's like most people buying a biscuit\n[noise] okay and so it doesn't matter it just sits there now in\nMy mind and keep [laughter] if I die I got my like copilot here yeah I can tell [laughter] you understand so I I Am afraid that this would be one of those cars that if you sell it ten years from now you'll see it on TV I you know I don't even at the ...\nI don't even care about I don't I don't even care about that ah the point is it's a toy you like it yes\nAnd it's so freaking smaller percentage of your world it does not matter\nYes if it's if it if it becomes worse a dollar tomorrow it doesn't matter it doesn't change your life that's right\nYou know it's a very ... that's how you justify toy you do it on ratios you know and I like this friend of mine just bought a jet he just bought a ten million dollar jet\nHuh okay that's a nice ... very but he's worth two billion\nTen years as a percentage of two billion\nUh-huh that's like this car for you or like most people ... it doesn't affect his world ten million in my ... my I grew up many are Tennessee ten million dollars is what we call a lot of money\nYou know a forty thousand dollar car sitting in your garage is what we call a lot of money you know I grew up that way but it's a small percentage of your world and that's how you can tell if you're out of whack or not with this it's just a toy\nIt's just a toy it's just an expensive toy and so she wants to renovate the dining room and spend forty thousand dollars a it's a you can afford it shut up yeah yeah and if you want to go on vacation and spend ten thousand dollars on a cruise you can afford it\nI make two hundred fifty thousand freaking dollars a year and your debt free and you're worth three million dollars you've done it man you work like no one else can you enjoy some of it I Want you to be outrageously generous on the other hand I don't want you to be wise and continue investing\nAnd I don't want you to go buy something that costs a million dollars is a toy that would be a line in your world Yes sir but this is a small percentage of your world and so that's why you win the argument she is correct that it is a useless impractical thing but it's not\n[laughter] man\nSays it's snow she wins that part of the argument I get that she doesn't get it I don't blame her for that part [laughter] she's actually using common sense but it's a small it's a limp on the lips brush you know [laughter]\nAnd that's the way you look at it and so you know I've had to learn to work with that working with wealthy people because I couldn't emotionally grass and I caught myself saying stupid stuff like ... much for a dot dot guy and all that is is poor men thinking\nThat's all that is that's loser talk ... she'd ever have a house that they know and she'd ever had two houses no one should ever have a ten million dollar jet no one should ever have the forty thousand or ... stupid stuff like that and I had to quit doing that because it when I look up and I realized for some people ratio wise\nIt's lint on a limb brush and that's if that's what it is then you can afford to do it if you can you know burn it in the backyard as only in next week's bonfire and it doesn't change your life then you can afford to quote waste the money unquote\nFor enjoyment purposes and that's fine that's why you work but also be generous be giving be helping others with this wonderful networks in this wonderful income have that as part of the mix I'm sure you are you told me you're sending your employees through a financial piece here doing other stuff I'm sure church or whatever that kind of stuff's all great\nBut it just doesn't matter and it's just like me I can look at my buddies ten million dollar jet ... dead credible\nSo sweet right I'll just tell you man but it's a small percentage of his two billion dollar world\nA billion you don't think about that way that's up ... million\n...\nHe's got two thousand million\nAnd out of two thousand million he spent ten of them you see what I mean as a ratio that's not much it's like having two hundred thousand dollars\nIn spending ten thousand bucks\nI think about\nIt didn't change your life right you'd be All right but you when you know you don't even feel it hardly\nIt doesn't it doesn't move the needle and that's not being wasteful at that stage of the game so hold on to any of that is a wonderful question made my day to get to answer it\nAnd I'm Glad the co pilot was there as a fund discussions hang on I'm going to send you a copy of the book the legacy journey you you to read that you will enjoy it it's where we discuss wealth all my other books about money\nLegacy journeys about wealth wealth is different than money\nCreates wealth but wealth is different than money so different subjects are different subject biblical if you're if for those of us that are Christians those of us are there people will say the Bible that Russia's wealth differently than aggressors money money as transactional money's the thing we used to buy food for kids and that calling wealth is different\nWolf has more problems with it but more opportunities whether\nThey're one of the things is that you are encouraged scripture early to enjoy the fruits of your labor\nNot to be a he'd missed\nAnd not to be ... but you don't enjoy it and I've got some nice cars I've got a classic car a robot shattered drove a Sunday out in the sun my wife and I stopped down bro gotta Nineteen sixty Corvette about the other day it's a sweetie looks like I'm Marilyn Monroe Cartwright\nChurn out driving around I'm sure it's got a little hat on I'm not driving miss daisy [noise] you know it was a lot of fun to all people running around this cool car it was an eight\nAnd a but hey it's a small percentage of my world from a small percentage of my world of very small percentage of our own so I think for lifting that puts this hour the rams are showing the bucks we'll be back with you before you know it in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial these\nI think it's called the greatest generation where\nYou know you just didn't have that you pay cash for everything and so that's how I was re and so I really had to change my paradigm of banking I just had to realize that you know that can be good debt can help you build asked would they it can help generate income for you if it's used correctly\nAnd it it's not a bad thing it's a good thing to leverage other people's money to create well so that was the big lesson for me I just had to get over the way that I was raised and brought up on on views on debt\nYou know that's what I was thinking about you know as I've heard your your stories through the years I was thinking that to me your your story is a bit of an example of how to distinguish those timeless life lessons that help us exceed that we get from our families\nFrom the ideas we need to transform in order to make our dreams and desires of reality and will unfold that here with your story today [noise] Leo we don't want to forget about you and your parents were commercial real estate investor so what was that like because you were growing up\nWorld and um it all started out originally when my father and my uncle was in the ... commercial construction business and um they ended up ah shutting down or business after um gosh for a new like\nForty years in business and I had a cousin that I'm starting a National Book words company and\nWhat happened is a he would come across these particular deals and my father in law or is looking for\nFor a no investments they'd buy you know cows and and that didn't work out too good and that invest in some other stock and that wouldn't work out too good but it was my cousin ended up news feed and then some of these properties to him and I was watching and\nI saw where they were making money and both my\nIn law also dash would've known those maybe we've gotten in commercial real estate ownership business before 'cause you know there are some benefits to it\nSo I was I went through college I I'm Out of college and you know what I said well you'll be thinking why do I said well you know what I say I walked in the in the commercial real estate business and I thought what better way\nTo get started and maybe you know try to\nTry to make some transactions and so I got my real estate license and are for sale and hooked up with a group here in Dallas and\nFor a number of years it worked out pretty good or for like five years I made quite a few are made some retail leases and that worked out real good and then the mean time I was always trying to make a transaction apartment complex for ...\nUm let towards that direction and after about five years there was time for had money and sometimes for I didn't have money and I'm On\nThe straw that broke the back the lawn of being in the commercial real estate broker and businesses I had a really large apartment complex for sale and I had a bar with\nUh what was going to um by this person you know I worked on this thing probably for nine months and um and the guy got up and it was just the less you know months before is over and the guy walked out and I thought you know I Can't do this any more I thought I'm going to get out of this and so\nI ended up going and I ended up finding you know I've gone around I really didn't want to get into management too much and I did like sales and so what does a ... you know maybe it would be wise to go over there and get into something that's more of a consumable product and it'd be steady your income\nAnd wind sales law might have a friend that worked at a a\nDistribution company in a anyways I ended up um you know ... them in and out of that business and got in with the with a big distributor and did that for a number of years and and that was good and I liked it and it was enjoyable especially in the beginning but it was Tom and I realize that\nI'm not going to end up my my income level are limited not really didn't want to go into management um so I could help it because\nI just didn't like necessarily managing people in particular um so what I did is um [noise] there's always going along our number one day I thought you know wash them and go back and and uh I never let\nWe'll stay out of the back of my mind but um you know the real estate with my father my mother and my uncles both of us and\nSo as time went on I ended up um I remember once I was down at a branch our show and I'm just looking around and I saw was a it was called the pad printing 'em machine and I've seen some of these women and\nSome more houses I Walk through and I saw them injection motors were imprinted on odd shaped items like or your keyboard on your computer\nUm it could be football something that's not screen printing is where you're printing on something that's flat and I thought you know this is this is a pretty um a unique type of the business know knew that there was demand for it and\nSo I did that and um I was doing that as a hobby actually is I sold one and\nOn the Internet and I came across a few jobs that really put me on the ... I had one company that wanted me to put her imprint on a\nOn a coup or a hundred thousand cooler but it'd be quite a bit of money for it and so I was I ended up getting into a warehouse and and I'm actually headed to a couple in poor areas which are more than two in favor of but I got ahead and say it was I did that for a number of years and\nThat turned into a quieter lucrative business and then in the defense industry I'm a printed on certain things\nAre wow this is a ball and so that was\nAnd that led me and I ended up you know I did that for quite a few years\nFor quite a quite a journey Leo I mean you you've you went through so it it feels like searching right and when we come back and a few minutes we're going to continue this story with Peggy and Leo and\nAnd Leo's journey in search for where he really fit in this world and and what he was going to do to create the wealth and passive income you needed to live the life he desires you're listening to the dog on the radio show this is Lynn ... we'll be right back\n\nTo the job once we were supposed to go\nOn TALK radio six forty build Eugene as he got some leftover police activity on the downtown getting a cell phone at the twenty exit ramps traffic flow but moving and also for an activity ... drive by her just passed\nThe intersection with treasure bridge over on the ... freeway towards Weinberg parkway and in Germany Johnny records do chlorine on highway Ninety to ...\nThem they're like talk radio six forty all did you see\nAre you in the market for new cars maybe an SUV or a pickup truck October is a great money to buy dealers are\nRamping up the sales on current models to make room for next year's and right now\nDon't say community credit union can help you save even more on your dream car don't community is offering well qualified borrowers was excellent credit as low as two point five\nEight annual percentage rate on both new and used cars through October thirty first to take advantage of our beautiful fall weather in Georgia and do some car shopping whether you were in the market for a new or used car don't the community can help you get that dream car\nOr what does it does right it's there's no chance\nStory as you know working through the traditional model coming from entrepreneurial Homs\nThen getting thrown into more the traditional model that most of us experience with work and then realizing the need for a change in the lame around with Peggy in le out on the ... radio show in in a moment we'll be like more of this story as we talk about change and discovering where we really fit in line if you have a question for you and the al ... age\nSeven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven eighty seven seven seven eleven fifty two inland then you let me right now I'm\nI\nReally do the job you know I mean we really supposed to remove the [noise]\nFrom the Georgia a one one call before you do news center I'm more closely with the Georgia news networks it's debate night the candidates for governor will square off on Georgia Public broadcasting beginning about seven\nDemocrats Stacey Abrams Republican Brian cap and libertarian to mess with all have the runners Abrams spent part of her last day before the debate Monday morning early and telling supporters about our game\nPlaying the reason I'm running in New York has an opportunity to move forward that we've done some good things can get too many people are less down the vine\nGeo ...

experiences in corporate America\nThat led them to see the need for a massive change ... retired and Leo soldiers business yeah those were moves how did you\nDecide what to do next you know sitting there thinking about it you know you've you've worked where you work your way in corporate America to the point that they said hey don't expect any more money over here right we're done\nAt the system is that you're going to make and then ... you know you built a business and tells the point that you're going you know I I don't want to expand if I Want to add on please I don't want to do this somebody offered you a crate pricing and you said OK you sold your business and and you found yourself now\nI'm looking out at in uncharted charted voyage\nWhen I'm selling should wait and wait style the shame and lay out his name for years on the radio and they were advertising their program\nAnd so we got in there and and we did quite well in the first because really you buy the stock you spell the option immediately on your computer you're given credit and to your town\nAnd that was great\nThat we were asked to buy stock stock every month for ten months until we were called down at the stock well and that was fine and good we were cost averaging you know on our stock and um\nIt was good until the recession hit because then the stock prices on some of our holding started going down and they went down so loud that we got to wear on some of them we couldn't sell the options anymore so actually our equity was going down\nAnd we were losing our principal and then our income on our stock option income was going down so we knew that we we had to make a change you know we were just looking for something more where um our equity would increase in value and that we'd have a steady income so we decided that we needed to make a change\nIn how is that from your perspective\n[noise] well I just thought you know we've got we've gotten ourselves a point or gun accumulation from cashier\nAnd I thought you know what I kept I did it a couple of problems for I Would try to get hold of real estate brokers and try to buy something that's called crippled ... at least and and maybe on a small office were house\nEvery time I Do that I ended up getting um somebody would bought out and walk and you get to it and I was really frustrated that shows\nAnd um so anyway I kept her in the program on the uh radio about this you know stock option than at ... good like Peggy mentioned and uh for a while and then uh it got to war I just realized that you know we're supposed to hold on for some of the stocks from him now tariffs on um\nA move China and I thought jeeze you know this that there are some flaws on this program and um I told I guess and you know what I keep hearing about lifestyle them limited on the radio and I said you know we've got to go check this program around and just see what it's all about it's been on for a number of years and so that's what\nI'm I thought you know what that is when it comes to lead let us over to a lifestyle or you know two and a ... you know I'd go on to it a couple of times and um it was and then you know than it was a whole nother process will tell you getting hurt\nYou know to to join and because we both need to do it together 'cause we're team\nAnd um she's smarter than I Am and\nUm she makes some better decisions ... about every one of the time and um it was so all you can you know but it was I knew that lifestyles where we need to be a ... today and because they talk about everything and really in a way\nI guess my background in the past wasn't wasted um\nBecause what happened is it all came back to me with the laws from the family from ... from um\nAh just going to school and learning about real estate but I had you know uh but there are certain things about the oil they all family you know when ... and all and cousins all this kind of disenchanted because of after the past you know my parents and
