{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Well I mean you're first goal is pay just to go no more debt so you have to pay cash for everything that's first gal and if by paying down on the student loans\nYou turn around and borrow more student loans because you don't have the courage to go to school you didn't gain any ground you're just swap dollars\n\nThat makes sense yeah\nSo I mean first thing we gotta do is make sure you have enough to pay cash is that what you're talking about that you're going to have an up and pay some down the student loans or what\n\nThat what I was trying to figure out how something between Fifteen and twenty grand between now and then the next fall when I go back to school and I've got ... you're not alone so I didn't know stay there\nBut I asked him are saying is what is the first thing the first call is complete school be a hundred percent sure have way more than enough to complete school with no new debt now when do you finish school at the end of next year\nWill take about a year and a half\nAnd then your degree will be and what\nA good businessman and created\nOkay and I'm\nWill that move you up in income immediately or are you working now what's your story\nYeah I've been I've been in and out of school I've got a management job now but I don't really see it being able to advance means like higher leadership all all that kind of my reasoning going to go back to school to finish\nMilk or which it's not a bad thing to finish up what you're doing I think that's a good plan but yeah the the first goal is to finish with no new debt and make plenty sure you got plenty more than enough to do that but let's say that you add it up and you're saying I Need twenty thousand dollars to finish all of my school and then you save up thirty thousand\nAnd then you save up\nAnother ten thousand I wouldn't I mean Thirty's if twenties all you need thirties plenty that gives you a pad than everything above that you start paying off the dad if you got really really end of the money you see what I'm saying but I mean I wouldn't be I wouldn't have two dollars extra I'd want a little extra to make sure you get through school with no new debt\nThat your first big goal now when you get out of school then we're going to attack this debt with a vengeance and that's going to be the process but um\nThat that that's just what we tell people don't don't go further in is your first call Jeffrey is in Atlanta Georgia Hi Jeffrey\nHow are you how you doing better than I deserve what's up [noise] I made a\nI work for a company that had the we football where I Would be paying if I get into a program I Will be paying one twenty I pay period to lead a program but\nThey were in my car manufacturer here where you work or what do you work for a BMW\nOkay that is not a normal leasing program this was an Employee Benefit\nOkay and it is excellent\nBecause they furnish the car at a cost that there's there's no way you could have hardly any car for no more than your by I mean ... ... you said two hundred and forty dollars right as three thousand dollars a year okay if you bought that car it will go down three thousand dollars and twenty minutes\nIn value ... author you see what I'm saying so that is a bargain and are they not make furnished like a ... oil and stuff to ... ... is the gas even\nFurnished in that they are can't remember no no no [laughter] it was one on one of the car manufacturers emerged but it's it's ... it's ... it's all the maintenance and the tires though right\nEverything is the insurance and that to ... see that's a deal of deal I mean you can't buy the tires and the insurance for three thousand dollars a year\nBut that's not a leash that's not like a standard okay they call it a lease but it's more of an employee benefits\nIn other words BMW is losing money\nOn this transaction with you to your benefit because you're an employee it's an employee benefits either and they want\nTheir employees driving one of their fine automobiles and you guys do make a fine automobile so it gives her yeah and if I remember ... you have bought a selection that for that is that the price of a certain car or is that the price of a car up to a certain amount\nAnd the wife of a car no car the one that you liked or whatever the okay All right\nWell do it's a deal I mean seriously you know ... you can't hardly buy insurance for that got much less the Tarzan maintenance much less for the loss and value but that's different than Joe walking off the street and leasing that car which he did it probably seven hundred dollars a month okay you know and that would\nNot be a good deal he should maybe by a BMW if he's got a lot of money and pay cash for it 'cause it's a good car but you're you're getting an Employee Benefit and it's a sweet deal for you I Would definitely do that if I worked for ...\nIt's a bargain it's a great deal and there are several of the car manufacturers that have really good deals for their employees but you just kind of have to think about it if if I was driving\nYou know if you're out of ten thousand dollar car man you can't do that for three thousand dollars a year\nWith what we're talking about here and you're certainly not driving up ten thousand dollar car what we're describing here probably driving a forty thousand dollar car\nSo a good question my thank you for calling in and um again it was a great deal appreciate your joining us Amy as on Twitter at Dave Ramsey is there an item or items that you refuse to pay for or by\nEven though you could afford it now\nYeah sure I can\nAfford most anything I Want to do now that it's not anything but most anything and some things just feel weird to me I feel I just don't want to have that invested in that um\nI've got a friend that's worth um\nTens of millions of dollars and he's a watch guy and he bought a um a hundred and fifty thousand dollar watch\nSounds just nuts but I mean he's got like ... million dollars that's just like most people buying a biscuit okay I can afford to do that it just\nI just I don't know it's not me number one and I I'm not much been on a boat [laughter]\nBut not on a watch so I mean you know it is just being authentic with you you know but uh\nUh so\nThe boats bigger than watch just account [laughter] so it just it's something that hits me funny but it's not really a value Judgement to say that my point is is that I'm not mad at him for spending that on a ... she's got two hundred million dollars\nAnd if you spend a hundred and fifty grand I Will watch it's nothing okay that guy's got plenty of money it's like most people bought a biscuit he gives away his his generosity her shortage huge he helps lots and lots of hurting people and that's a very very small percentage of his world but emotionally I have trouble\nEven though intellectually I can get there and I'm not judging him emotionally ... I ... I Would struggle doing that um but that doesn't mean it's wrong to do it just 'cause I Can't grasp it\nUh emotionally if it would be wrong to do it if it's a high percentage of his world and that's why we tell people like on your cars and stuff don't get into a high percentage of your\nYou know your your financial world where you've got you know you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year and you've got eighty thousand dollars worth of cars will that just stupid\nThat I can make a value Judgement on that does not emotions is just mathematically dumb but when something is a small percentage of your world there are still some things that emotionally you just\nDon't feel right about but it doesn't mean that it's a more immoral for someone else to do it is my point and so\nI'm really a lot of you could learn that lesson because some people judge other people because they can't emotionally crash that [laughter] and just because you can't emotionally grass or something doesn't mean it's more like rough for different chair show anyway good question I talk about a lot of that kind of stuff in the legacy journey book only book I've ever written about welfare\nWell my parents really tried to stay debt free\nAnd their philosophy they grow up in a air the\nI think it's called the greatest generation where\nYou know you just didn't have that you pay cash for everything and so that's how I was re and so I really had to change my paradigm of banking I've just had to realize that you know that can be good that can help you build equity it can help generate income for you\nIf it's used correctly and it it's not a bad thing it's a good thing to leverage other people's money to create well so that was the big question for me I I just had to get over the way that I was raised and brought up\nOn on the Sunday at\nYou know that's what I was thinking about you know as I've heard your your stories through the years I was thinking that to me your your story is a bit of an example of how to distinguish those timeless life lessons that help us succeed that we get from our families\nFrom the ideas we need to transform in order to make our dreams and desires of reality and will unfold that here with your story today [noise] Leo we don't want to forget about you and your parents were commercial real estate investor so what was that like because you were growing up\n... and um it all started out originally when my father my uncle ... commercial construction business and um they ended up shutting down or business after um gosh for a new art\nForty years above us and I had a cousin that I'm starting a National Book words company and\nWhat happened is a he would come across the trick or deals and my father in law or look on full\nOr a no investments that bar you know cows and and that didn't work out too good and the best and some other stock that wouldn't work out too good but it was my cousin and ended up ... speed and then from the ... route to him and I was watching uh\nI saw where they were making money in both month\nBob ... gosh would've known the men with guns and commercial real estate ownership business before and you know there's some benefits to it\nFor and it was before I went through college are a lot of college and you know what are you all we thinking why do I said well I Know what I say a lot and then the commercial real estate there's no thought what better way\nTo get started and very you know try to\nTry to make some transactions and found out my real estate license and uh for ... hooked up with a group here in Dallas and\nFor number of years it worked out pretty good or for like five years I made quite a few are made some retail leases and that worked out real good and then the main calm ... pond and make them transaction apartment complex for ...\nUm let towards that direction and after about five years there was time for had money in some problem before it didn't have money and um [noise]\nUm for the call them back a mom of being in the commercial real estate broker and ... really are large apartment complex for sale and I had a bar with\nUh what was going to a bar the person and I worked on this thing probably for nine months and um and the guy got up and it was just the less you know\nMonths before though when the guy walked out and I thought you know I Can't do this I mean more all thought I'm going to get out of this and so\nI ended up going and I ended up ... and I've gone around I really didn't want to get into management too much and I did watch sales and so what does a ... you know maybe it would be wise to go over\nThere and get into something that's more of a consumable product on the study or income and won fills a might have worked at a a\nDistribution company in oh yours are ended up um you know ... thousand ends and out that there's this data and with the with the ... river and did that for a number of years and and that was good and I liked it and it was an ... person in the beginning but as Tom ...\nAmong them into my my income or limits\nDid not really didn't want to go into management um bucket help it just didn't like throwing managing people in particular um\nSo what I did is um because I was going along our number one day I thought you know a storm and go back and and I are nevertheless\nWheels but out in the back of my mind but um yeah but we will stay with my father my mother and my uncle both of us and\nSo on I ended up um ... show I'm just looking around them I suppose so there was a cold I had put in a machine and I've seen some of these women and\nMore houses I Walk through a solver injection motors were important in on\nA shape items like your keyboard on your computer or it could be put into something that's not screen printing this where you're putting on something that's why it and I thought you know this is this is a pretty um a unique type of uh the minute there was the man for it and\nSo I did that and um I was doing that as a hobby actually avoid so on and\nOn the Internet and I came across a few jobs that really put me on the ... or I had one company that ... to ... and ...\nOr ... thousand cruel but I didn't mean quite a bit of money for it and it was added up getting into a world from and the bachelor had the ... or ... ... to ... go ahead I'm Sorry I did that for a number of\nYou and that turned into a quarter lucrative or the ... the ... I'm a Clinton on certain things are wow and so that was that it led me and I ended up you know I did that for quite a few years\nWow that's quite a quite a journey Leo I mean you you've you went through so it it feels like searching right and when we come back and a few minutes we're going to continue this story with Peggy and Leo and\nAnd Leo's journey in search for where he really fit in this world and and what he was going to do to create the wealth of passive income he needed to live the life he desires you're listening to the Dell wants the radio show this is Lynn ... we'll be right back\nTo the point where she pulls\nTraffic on TALK radio six forty WG as the\nGood afternoon Joe anybody's bounds gonna slow like they're near the more honored jumps and you're going to pick up ... service stay with you over towards ... somebody wrote why my trash to record the right lane and it's still picking up that late ... thirty when you were\nGetting drunk and we're going to pick up ... north I'm trying to cut it off ... boulevard division of the other why watch when he was gay\nMen down there on TALK radio six forty as the\nModel your insurance rolls on and ...\nAnd it's just just got bigger on our ... we're going to be an American dollars on Ronald Reagan it was Harvey ... five hundred dollars for you to be on every issue now she's nine thousand dollars on\nThe end of the year means the SARS useless Yvonne again\nBecause these are these are moving here millionaire where were these costs are weighing highway Ninety to come on if you're really talking\nI'm more games are really gorgeous views enough where voters are flocking to the polls for early voting in Georgia we advance warning but again on Monday and so far just a little over sixty nine thousand people voted in November sexual elections\nThat compares to Twenty one thousand in the same midterm vote for years ago in Fulton County on Tuesday first time voter an Eighteen year old Tom Haskell was ready to go on casting ballots it was standing in line for\nGranted and just get it done uh makes you look into college applications one way or the regular ... really early action that\nFrom CBS forty six a fresh look at hurricane Michael damage the Georgia DOT Georgia emergency management and state National Guard officials due to fly over all the Michael problems this morning department of transportation spokeswoman Natalie du ... first\nThing that you know and when you're ... unity in southwest Georgia on is is the amount of time covering a deaf people his land and or in the community deals says the deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] wrap on TALK radio six forty bill do you see as the [noise]\n\n\n\nAt least on December ... and ... story short I mean when you\nTo get your heart of the land the jingle twenty eighty freezes Capitol line [noise]\nWeather on TALK radio six forty GST\nShowers possibly the CDC tomorrow which is on the way\nSome of them when I'm studious when you're on the spot [noise] and then when you're when say most of the comics I was twenty percent chance of showers loosen up and you see mostly sunny skies explosive blue temperatures most of these would hide your seventies then on friday mostly cloudy skies\nWho was high temperatures only human loaded with sixties I'm we're all just pause in the\nMorning on the moon one one\nWelcome back this is the Dell wants the radio show with Len Morrow today Peggy and Leo are sharing their stories we've heard about their childhood and entrepreneurial families and their experiences in corporate America\nThat led them both to see the need for massive change Peggy retired and Leo sold his business you know those were bold moves how did you\nDecide what to do next I you know sitting there thinking about that as you know you've you've worked where Peggy Burke the way up in corporate America to the point that they said hey don't expect any more money over here right we're done\nOr the system is that you're going to make and then Leo you know you'd built that business until the point that you're going you know I I don't want to expand this I don't want to have employees I don't want to do this somebody offered you a great price and and you said okay and you sold your business and and you found yourself now\nI'm looking out at in uncharted uncharted voyage why don't you do next\n\n... I'm selling stock options so we'd buy the stock and we'd spell the options and Leo had had been listening for years on the radio and to this from that was advertising their program and so we got in there and and we\nDid quite well it the first because really you buy the stock he's still the option immediately on your computer you're given credit and to your town\nAnd that was great\nAnd but we were asked to buy stock ... stock every month for ten months until we were called down at the stock well and that was fine and good we were cost averaging you know on our stock and um\nIt was good until the recession hit because then the stock prices on some of our holding started going down and I went down so loud that we got to wear on some of them we couldn't sell the options anymore so actually our equity was going down\nAnd we were losing our principal and then our income on our stock option income was going down so we knew that we we had to make a change you know we were just looking for something more where\nUm our equity would increase in value and that we'd have a steady income so we decided that we needed to make a change\nAnd how is that from your perspective\n[noise] well I I just thought you know we've got we've gotten ourselves with Apollo ... from past year\nAnd I thought you know what I kept I did it a couple of times for our taught to get hold of real estate brokers and try to buy something that's called cripple ... at least and and maybe on a small office warehouse\nEvery time I Do that I ended up getting um somebody would bought out and walk and you get to it and I was really frustrated that shows\nAnd um so anyway I kept her in the program on the ah radio about this you know stock option than at ... good like Peggy mentioned and for a while and then uh it got to war I just realized that you know we're supposed to hold on for some of the stocks from him now tariffs on them\nA move China and I thought jeeze you know [laughter] is that there are some flaws on this program\nAnd um I told her I said you know what I keep hearing about lifestyle them limited on the radio and I said you know we gotta go check this program around you see what it's all about it's been on for a number of years and so that's what\nI'm I thought you know what that is when it comes to lead let us over to a\nLifestyle or you know two and a ... you know I go on to it a couple of times and um it was and then you know that it was a whole nother process for getting hurt or you know to join and because we both need to do it together 'cause we're team\nAnd um she's smarter than I Am and\nUm she makes better decisions Audrey about every side of the time and um I was so all you can you know that that was I knew that lifestyles where we need to be a good\nToday and because they talk about everything and really in a way I guess my background on the path wasn't wasted um\nBecause what happened is it all came back to me with the laws from the family from ... from um\nAh just now going to school and learning about real estate but I had you know uh but there are certain things about the oil they all family you know with uncles and all and cousins all this kind of disenchanted because of after the past you know my parents and the\nMarket at all you know people there wasn't there needed to be a plan and gravy and be control on things and to all kinds of disenchanted with that and those are the real estate um aspect", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "16"}
