gets nothing not a zip sell the car\nNow I'm Down to just a few medical bills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going this very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what ... what is twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he has a pension I knew it in for security\nOkay um then when I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here or there after taking care of mom\nHas ended up getting paid fifty on that last month on each one\nYeah it's okay if you won't pay twenty five or something or if if you can work out some kind of lump sum and you know five hundred bucks settles a whole dead or something like that clears up that's fine but here's the thing if they were to sue her do you know what they're going to get\nNothing because you know what she has nothing all of the income that she has they cannot attach you can attach pension income you can attach Social Security income and you can't attaching annuity\nAnd so that she's what we called

he ... through ... through quite a few property and you don't get every day of it I can offer on by the time you actually purchased on a than maybe a hundred evaluation\nAnd if you're paying by the

they were the ... they had the best that it was amazing how accurate the rental day there was\nA problem or or was that when you go to their website and want to purchase valuation or eight dollars for

to have so we've been able to eliminate that issue\n[noise] well if we had no but I don't think this thing would work because it's just too expensive to go out there that price now the other thing

six forty WG as the\nCome back and now you're seeing more conventional wisdom is that you read the man on a mission to rely on that as a\nLooking back you're do on the radio show 'em like discuss with you I'm this concept of saving for retirement or saving for retirement and how much the average family has said\nNow I read this article is really good article a lot of data I'm not going to try to go through all the data but I can tell you some basic concept the younger people are the less they say that just simple and you know the older you get the more people have said because they had a longer period of time to say\nUm but there seems to be a differentiation here in Studio and I'm going to have to see if I can go through this with you it says retirement accounts savings are inadequate unequal retirement accounts savings of family aged thirty to sixty one\nRight I'm from eight thirty to to sixty one are different than what the other ages are so that that piece mature writer to really nothing for ... years to the real interesting parts are talking about\nThe means savings of all families so if you take me what is the ...\nThe means says if you add up everything\nAnd divide by the number of people in the uh survey you add up everybody's retirement and divide by the number of people the survey that the media is Ninety five thousand seven hundred and Seventy six dollars\nNow they go on in this long article to explain that that's almost in ill relevant number because the people on the bottom have almost nothing and the people on the top massive amounts of money saved up so they talk next about the median savings\nWith families or retirement savings so you look at the media is if you were to take a number if you'd late all the numbers out in a row and you found the very center of all the numbers from the lowest\nTo the highest amount saved and you found the center the center is sixty thousand dollars so the average person from the fifty percent del bracket down as less than sixty thousand dollars but actually if you only take people that have retirement savings\nIf you do the same thing with people that do not have retirement savings\nAnd you take the media and again the media and drops to\nFive thousand dollars so think about if you took every American out there that we're entering retirement age\nAnd your line them up on a roll on the wall street maybe I ten freeway from one side of the country the other and you went to the halfway point\nTo the halfway point half of all Americans and below have only five thousand bucks that's pretty scary when you think about if you take out the people that have zero city and you do the same line up\nHalfway down the line half of all people that if you tried to save me up sixty thousand dollars now that is on believable just unbelievable\nThat anybody out there are so low country has five thousand or less the people actually believe in savings who have saved ... percent of the country only at sixty thousand how could you retire on sixty thousand dollars\nI have no idea how they even think that that's going to work it blows my mind now when you're at age too that\nIt really skews the numbers because literally people have way more savings in younger kids et cetera et cetera et cetera so as you\nGo through age groups which are your age group\nAnd what you'll see is that there are different age groups believe differently in said so if you get to the age group the working age group of thirty two to sixty one\nDo you find that the the media that we talk about a Ninety five thousand dollars\nIf you look at the people from fifty six to sixty one in other words not the whole group of working class people right now but only people for fifty sixty sixty one the last five years quote unquote\nTheir average or their means there's a hundred and twenty four thousand dollars\nI'm Sorry a hundred and sixty three thousand dollars my bad or if you go from fifty to fifty five a hundred and twenty four thousand um and it goes down precipitously from that point on as you get younger and younger and younger", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "year": "2018",
