millionaires by Chris Hogan how ordinary people built extraordinary wealth and how you can to the book is based on the largest study of millionaires ever conducted we have studied here Ramsey solutions over ten thousand millionaires Chris Hogan and our team\nWe put together an ironclad research model and process and that there's no questioning the results there there I mean they're more

twenty dollar\nOr you get the audio book the everyday millionaires audio book it'll come out January as well to everyday millionaires e book that'll come out in January as well immediately will send you a video lesson from\nChris Hogan called how to retire inspired and one for me called it's okay to be wealthy\nAnd we'll show you the process\nRichard is worth one point to me and he says being intentional with money through budgeting saving and investing anyone can be a millionaire today that was not your brother in law that said that that was a guy worth one point to making\nHis opinion matters to Loni is with us in Hawaii are I'm Sorry I walked to Hawaii I'll get all these out a Hi Connie how are you\nVery\nVery thank you very much for taking my call\nSure how can I help\nI'm Wondering what like you'd have to make it in a place where the cost of housing so astronomical\nYou have to make an astronomical income right because you don't get a pass on math\nIf you live in Hawaii California or Manhattan math is still math and so if you buy something you can't afford it'll still bankrupt you write\nWrite shower you know ... or so the\nWrong on the problem is dramatic a for a guy like you who probably is I I'm a native Hawaiian and probably your grandfather and grandmother were and uh it's all you've ever known and yet the housing prices on the islands have made it where a regular working men can hardly afford to live there\nWith this like Silicon Valley right I mean you can't afford to let you can afford to work in Silicon valley but you can't afford to live there\nYou have to live the forty five miles away an hour and a half commute to be able to afford a house their problem is you can't move that far out 'cause you have this thing called an ocean [laughter]\nCan't move far out of town and it gets wet yeah but I I don't know I mean are there areas I Know a Wahoo and Maui and of course the big islands got its own issues right now but a little volcano action but the uh I Know a lot who in Maui are outrageous\nOr the other islands\nI think I think so I mean I think I Would probably have a lot of places that you know somebody could um afford a but the problem is typically like you said it's like an\nHour now could be even though we're on an island and you got to drive Fifteen or twenty miles with the worst tropic of the nation\nIt's up to two lane road it's a beautiful view but you get to enjoy the view yeah right\nOr the neighborhood or not you know you might not necessarily want to raise your kids there are\nRight right okay so there is some options along those lines um then I you know there's not a magic answer to it what I don't want you to do and that's why I started the answer the way I started to what I don't want them to do is just give yourself permission to do something that's harmful to you\nJust because it just because it's expensive and you throw up your hands go well it's just the way it is and they rooms or just doesn't understand was not me it's math math still a problem when your house payment is sixty percent of your take home pay because real estate's expensive\nYou're going to go bankrupt I mean you're not going to make it your kids aren't going to college are going to struggle financially you're gonna struggle you can't keep that from happening and so you've got to uh you gotta you gotta bite the bullet into a neighborhood you don't love\nA commute you don't love or make some other arrangements um or honestly truthfully what happens is uh are you Silicon Valley is an example 'cause it was just reading an article about the other day the number of people that have left\nIs absolutely amazing 'cause they just yeah and then they're having the bus they're bussing service workers in\nBecause I Can't afford to live there all bustle man and you know some of the ski resorts face the same thing they build housing for the workers because it's the only way they can get somebody to stay there because you can't afford to live in Aspen\nAnd work in Aspen as a as a ... you know as a ski patrol guide right you can't afford to expand great and so it's the same kind of an economic issue on these micro ... economic situations but no you cannot it's almost impossible to live on the island of Manhattan and make less than a hundred grand\nYou're right it just meant Iraq medically very tough and so you end up cross in one of the bridges I'm ... and living out in one of the other boroughs um and in order to get your costs down enough to actually survive and live your dream of being there\nSo I'm hopefully you can find a way to you know mix in the neighborhood idea and the commute idea\nEnough to get a value that works for you do for a living\nAnd I am a firefighter okay well as a part time I'm excited\nOkay cool and are you married yes what's your wife do\nRight now she pretty much stayed at home with a\nKid how many kids um\nTwo ... two under two all fun and what's your household income\nYeah [noise] I'm about five thousand a month\nA home on average ... fluctuates on my part time job kind of fluctuate depending on how much are yeah worker\nAs soon as low for a firefighter have you got a lot of stuff coming out of your check\n'em ... not really it's a well I think my deductions about thirty percent below\n... I mean do you have other junk like insurance or something coming out of your check\n[noise] um no I don't know I think well why there was a major city and so I'm just as this you're not exactly in a rural environment here so I was just guessing I didn't know right uh I I rented a firefighter of make a hundred all over the place so I'm\nNot at all in Hawaii via a captain ... which is a promotion away from me to be yeah\nA a an older you are you in are you doing three days on for all for that kind of a routine\nYeah three days every other day and then\nOr yeah or you know I might instead of being a flight attendant I might look at a part time a business on the side you might make more than that than on a flight attendant stuff\nA\nLot of firefighter guys I Know how great side hustles so they make almost as much as they do with fire hall\nAnd they're really fabulous I get in the in construction business the painting business or something like that and they make really seriously good money\nBut hey man I'll I'll Try to help you cannot put you guys into financial piece university the one year memberships that includes the nine lessons in class and hold on I'll have Kelly pick up all of sudden that tell you it's great to talk to you I Wish I had a magic wand to make\nFor you but it's a tough man sort of what it is thanks for calling in and that puts this\nRamsey show in the bugs will be back with you before you know what in the meantime there's ultimately only one way to financial peace and that's the ... with the friends of these crises us guys is like from the production off\nAnd no way to be able to get back at them not at them because I Want to hurt them but at their lives and miss representations she they just make up facts as they go\nThey they believe just like many politicians believe if you tell a lie\nIt long enough and loud enough people will believe it what does it do ended up putting\nA good Seventy five percent of Americans in the position will never be able to retire you know you look at the facts of what the the median savings is it's unbelievable the low you know it's unbelievable the median savings in this country fifty percent of the people in this country and below\nFive thousand bucks in the bank fifty percent and below have five thousand bucks a lesson to back now when you go to the average average in the rich people with the moderate and poor people\nThe average is about Ninety five thousand but even Ninety five thousand dollars is not enough to survive the rest of your earlier\nYour life in retirement so I'm going to take on the financial planners today and I've got two or three articles where I'm just going to rip into them like I have been a long time and I hope you enjoy it uh if you got any questions you can call ins eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven I may not take a call immediately because I might be in the middle of a rant\nBut if I can get you and I'd be happy to get you in the first article that was sent to me\nIs just outrageous it's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever heard my entire life\nSays that it's a known fact that stocks are better than real estate as investments it's a known fact\nFirst of all it's not a fact real estate is ten thousand times more profitable than stocks are in every way shape and form you make money in real estate five different ways and the stock market only by appreciation real estate income tax free when done correctly which means even if we did half of it\nWe'd be equal to them but we do five times as much income as they do and yet it's tax free which makes it really ten times more profitable now I'm just throwing numbers out there those are not specific back I'm just\nRight now big thing the fact that these idiots don't know what they're talking about it's so common when they had the new tax laws in place an idiot got on the radio on TV and started venting one of these reporters that now you could get all this income tax free because he changed the tax laws\nNo we've been able to get an income tax free for Thirty years but these idiots don't even know it\nAnd so what do they do they come on TV and they were ... Tate how stupid and an educated about the topic they are\nHow you get to be in Fox News or C. M. B. A. C. or an NBC or any of these stations CNN and become a fact reporter when you don't even know the fact\nThat what you're going to be I'm going to cover the facts are today but what irritates me is that these guys get on T. V.\nSpewing the lies and then his representations so that the electorate ends up with a median\nSavings account of five thousand dollars and an average savings account of Ninety five thousand dollars this is just ridiculous but started out this article says there's seven reasons why stocks are better than real estate let's just take them\nOne at a time by the way the idiot the wrote this articles name is Shawn L'Engle years and this is from market watch the articles out of marketwatch Sean if you're out\nThere listening please please come on the radio with me let me take your head off and show you how embarrassed you'd be to talk about stuff you know nothing about I Will bring facts figures people's deals financial whatever you need if you think you could stand up to even one tenth of the proof of what you're saying\nI don't think you just end up to any myself so let's talk about liquidity\nHe using the number one reason the stocks are better than real estate stocks are liquid if you want to get out you can get out All right let's explain to you\nThis misrepresentation\nThe reason you can get out of stocks is two reasons one there's a liquid market for it there\nThat's granted but to you have to get out at the price they're willing to let you out at in other words if the stock market you bought a stock or a hundred dollars a share and it went down to Seventy five dollars a share yes you can get out immediately at Seventy five dollars a share\nBut that's not what you're saying what you're seeing a real estate as I bought this piece of real estate for a hundred thousand dollars now it's worth four hundred thousand and it took me thirty days he said forty five days to sell it of course it took forty five ... we're looking for a greater fool they don't pay four hundred thousand for something you paid a hundred thousand for\nYou're going to wait until that person comes around but what if the offer that piece of real estate that appraised for four hundred thousand for three hundred thousand\nThat piece of real estate would sell overnight instantly I you can cash it out in second I'd do it all the time and a seminar I say if you could buy this apartment this way cash flowing there's much who would buy it to de\n... percent of the people in the room raised their hands they would buy today that's how quickly I can sell a piece of real estate when you're not trying to rip off the person you're trying to sell it to if\nYou had a fixed market where whatever the appraisal was the property itself or you could sell real estate just as quickly as you could sell stocks but that's not what's happening people are trying to make massive capital gains on real estate on the stock market you're happy to take whatever it is\nThey're willing to give you the day you want to sell it is that liquidity\nIs that really liquidity\nWow let's say that you lose half of everything you're worth but man you did it was such a liquidity\n[noise] that's so important isn't it I think you'd be thinking about what I'm saying you realize that they're not comparing apples to apples oranges Georgia's they're comparing somebody that's letting their stocks go for a non premium price\nAnd that's why they sell so quickly real estate if it were sold for a non premium price would sell instantly also I proved it many many times it happens that some apartments don't even make your mark don't even make the market for even a day or two in fact and how has the same thing\nIf you can read houses we can ... houses for even less than a week that's hell liquid real estate is compared to stocks it's as liquid if not more liquid\nBecause number one when you buy stocks yo nothing but a piece of paper and hoping to prayer they're going to go up but when you buy real estate\nYou were getting cash flow the second you buy it so just like you want to bond or a CD for one percent or two percent right now exciting see these two percent you buy a piece\nOf real estate deterrence ten right out of the box is way more exciting especially when you realize that we're just short break we'll be right back ... radio show\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to the

tells me he can't be rich there's no way\nI mean he's talking about things that such and you can ... you could do is make money you save money make money save money 'cause he's not make any money invested in the way he's this thing up like the next ... and he says number six reason\nIs because real estate or stocks are safe for the real estate when the market starts to go down and you can get out of stocks easier that's absolutely ally or as a way I Want you to see what's your decision this I Want you to vision that you're standing there\nGoing stocks and the guy's got a gun to your head

real estate\nLet's say somebody says okay interest rates are starting to go up\nThat means there's going to be some point where the cost of real estate with the interest rates involved is going to not allow the price of real estate to go up anymore\nUm if they start tightening up the lending requirements are they let the lender requirements get too loose and people start to fall into loans over a long period of time you can see that there's going to be a loosening of the market to where it becomes um safer is a bubble people pay way too much real estate I Want you to think about that as being
