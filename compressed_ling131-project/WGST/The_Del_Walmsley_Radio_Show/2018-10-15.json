I don't want anybody to be unsafe and I don't want to have equipment\nBut I've got probably a million and a half dollars and equipment sitting here within a Fifteen feet of me right now while we're doing the show I Can't have that equipment going down the show would go down that would cost me a lot of money just like that but but we also don't buy equipment we don't need\nAnd then we make a decision whether we're going to buy new and we certainly pay cash for it\nOr whether it's cameras are computer systems and in your case it's actually heavy equipment we don't own any heavy equipment um couple pickup trucks to do delivery and stuff around here and one bus that keeps running us between buildings but other than\nThat we don't have any big stuff like that but still I Can't have that bus breaking down all the time but on the bus used\nDonald Harris drives our bus everyday runs us back and forth between our little shuttled between our things and it's it was a huge shuttle and paid attempt for what a new one the cost\nAnd it's run I mean it's broken down a couple of times when we rented a shuttle for that day when it broke down kept kept moving we'll put it in a shopping fixed it but I mean for that little bit of inconvenience it's safe and it's been reliable enough to get the job done and not shut us down\nAnd so that's a minor example but it's filling in the same metaphor and so yeah you can you can make this work\nBy use to pay cash for your equipment otherwise all you do is work for nothing\nAll you do is end up with no money for all your work because and and the you know the heavy equipment dealer gets all your money and that just doesn't work for me I don't want to live that way Josh is in Savannah hey Josh welcome to Dave Ramsey ...\nHey Dave how are you doing better than I deserve how can I help\nMy wife and I just moved from Alabama or Georgia almost a year ago and we have our tags for our cars are are coming up to be viewed and in Alabama you pay for your cart packed packed yearly and George eat it at all in one walk down the beginning and I'm One of our car you're\nCompletely paid for so we're going to keep it there's nothing there's no way you can be made there\nBut we have um [noise] another car that we are about eleven thousand on that we've been comic letting sailing anyway um we we recently started ... and I'm a big ... found any way and we were uh our tags we're bringing our tax at the end of October which would be\nA lot more money than it would it be an athlete there and an Alabama how\nHow much how much it costs to run or your tax\n[noise] about four hundred\nFor that and what what's your household income\nJust under a thousand\nAnd what other death she'll be got not counting your house\nWhen you don't mind for me and my wife um wind for twenty nine thousand and one or twenty okay and that's it\nThey're okay you like this car\n[noise] uh it's fine if not what we if it's um we got as a family car we were we recently had a baby and it it it's not as much rain whenever we test drove it it's not my dream as we thought it would be what three strollers you\nKnow if you want to move to a different car that's fine I don't think you have to do this financially and you certainly have to do it over four hundred dollars worth of tax um that's not the way you make the decision here but I'm basically you got a pilot that you're trying to get through can you get through that in two years and keep\nThe scars yes I'm In his car the total of you're far less than half your on your income yes and those are the guidelines we use on whether to keep a car so this car is very capable [noise] if you want to keep it if you want a salad and you can sell it at your car is not a problem [noise] [noise] nice for the call\nThat I've Ramsey showing the bumps our thanks to James Charles art producer Daniel our associate producer and the phone screeners I Am a branch of your host and we'll be back before you know in in the meantime remember\nThere's ultimately only one way to financial peace and that's what the prince of peace and Christ Jesus [noise]\nMaybe I was child abuse or of the game show\nIt as you did that your thought process was to add additional income to your family's income is that what it was\nCorrect right so I started reading a book I read a you know rich that poured that I read books on\nUm creating multiple streams of income I read a lot of books that out the word millionaire and um although I'm becoming a millionaire wasn't I wasn't really all about the money but it was just about providing a for my family and possibly allowing me to retire\nEarlier and so I I started to do a lot of research um\nStarted an online business that I had that was a selling um\nStaff resources to math teachers actually digital downloads so I started that back about Fifteen Years ago when uh the only things that were being downloaded that time tended to be a songs and things for MP three players and so I was actually selling\nUm mouth lessons in digital download forum where people would get a Pdf file from me\nAnd I thought that was pretty neat because I Would create a lesson and I would sell that same lesson you know maybe hundreds of times\nAnd it was just an automatic emails that went out that at all linked to a a file in it and I got to the mailbox money would come in and my inbox thing you just made a sale and it was all automated on the fight\nAnd up from there I eventually started to turn my attention to real estate a little bit I'm One of the first things that I did was I bought a course by somebody I've heard you mentioned before Carlton sheet and uh it was probably a couple of hundred dollars probably saw it on a an infomercial one night and thought you know\nI'm going to go ahead and buy this course and it was one of those no money down courses and I don't think I ever used any of the techniques that he really was talking about in the program but it really\nWas sort of a primer for me to help me to get started and just to understand some of the basics of real estate investing and um so that's sort of where I began\nSo at what age was is and where did you finally take action why what made it possible for you to go out to buy your first property\n[noise] uh I was probably I'm guessing in my late twenties early thirties when I started to do some of this real estate investing research and at the time when we were doing this my mom was actually a realtor she passed away in two thousand nine\nI bet she was a realtor hadn't been involved in any rental properties herself and we saw an opportunity to get into the market by purchasing a four Plex and so we went out and um\nIt was a deal where my mom was the three quarter owner and I was the one quarter owner um we put down I think Fifteen Percent back at the time on a five hundred and fifty thousand dollar\nProperty and uh we each put down the money we took about thirty thousand dollars of the down payment on the line of credit\nAnd so with that partnership we we purchased the four Plex which I still own today um which has appreciated quite a bit and value and that sort of how I have\nBeen successful in real estate at the beginning was really just managing some properties and and holding them for Fifteen Years in Southern California which of course with the appreciation that didn't really show that I was a great real estate investor but just that I was able to\nManage some property and and hold onto it for a period of time\nDid you have any cash flow at that time or\nA when we first bought the property it with the four unit and we pretty much had to have all four units or rent it at the time in order to make sure we're paying the bills and paying the mortgage and the cash flow is very small the cash on that building now because we've had quite a while\nUm is is pretty good um although\nYou know when you look at Southern California real estate we have a couple of single family homes I'm One of them we just fold or last week it just closed and if you look at the value of the home and the cash flow that it's putting off it was it was not very strong and so that's one of the things that I took away from\nA lifestyles unlimited teaching was to get that equity out and start putting it to work in a place that was going to give a much better return and so that's one of the reasons we fold one of our single families is to be able to redeploy that money and get it back into\nOr multifamily investments and investments that are going to have a much better return\nYou know that's such a true fact in California is like the epitome of that as the capital gains value goes up call just appreciation California as you appreciate it goes up the value goes up\nThat's more and more jak when you when you look at the return on equity in the deal the returns get low very very low very quickly so you need to be able to pull that money and go do something else with which is what you're doing a very successfully let's take a look at um\nThe the concept that you and your wife got married and you had a house and she had a house there's just so typical of how people that were really on purpose to get into real estate investing ends up in real estate investing by just shuffling houses between family members at so bored\nTell us how that happened with you and the wife and you guys had all these houses back and forth between the two of you\nSo uh we had just bought that for unit apartment complex I'm\nProbably the year before we got married and then I met my wife Julie\nAnd when I met her we were both just about closing on our first personal rather than fat owned a a condo and I was trading up out of that into a single family home and she was\nPurchasing a town home her town homeless in Irvine um my single family homes in Costa Mesa and so we ended up getting married and we decided well we're going to only be able to live in one of these so we decided to live over in Irvine and her town home\nAnd uh we rent it out the place in Costa Mesa which we still have\nAnd we lived there for about two years and then uh we got pregnant and we're going to have our first child and the house in Costa Mesa had a much bigger backyard and it was just a little more conducive for raising children and so we went ahead and\nYou know moved out of the vine place but instead of selling that and you know using the money on trips and fancy cars and boats and whatever we said no we're going to keep that house and we're going to transition over into the Costa Mesa south of so we did that so I've really only the four Plex that we\nPurchased my mom and I purchased the other is really the only investment property that I'd ever bought on my own the other two homes that we have um we currently live in Huntington Beach and\nSo already how we're going to take a break broke this was a perfect place to take a break we'll come back and talk about how you got introduced elapsed will be right back with more totally had the ... radio show\n[noise] you're listening to the Joe mostly reading you know we'll be back with more like suppose just as
