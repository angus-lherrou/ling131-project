joined Cheryl came and sparks Kenyan on an Josh Moffat of silver ten mortgage as they discuss real estate in Atlanta\nUm creating multiple streams of income I read a lot the books that have the word millionaire and um although I'm becoming a millionaire wasn't I wasn't really all about the money but it was just about providing a for my family and possibly allowing me to retire\nEarlier and so I I started to do a lot of research um\nStarted an online business that I had that was\nA selling a math resources to math teachers actually digital downloads so I started that back about Fifteen Years ago when uh the only things that are being downloaded that time tended to be a songs and things for MP three players\nAnd so I was actually selling\nI'm not for essence digital download form where people would get a Pdf file from me and I thought that was pretty neat because I Would create a lesson and I would sell that same lesson you know maybe hundreds of times\nAnd it was just an automatic emails that went out that at all linked to a a file in it and I got sort of the mailbox money would come in and my inbox thing you just made a sale and it was all automated on the site\nAnd are from there I eventually started to turn my attention to real estate a little bit I'm One of the first things that I did was I bought a course by somebody I've heard you mentioned before Carlton sheets and uh\nIt was probably a couple of hundred dollars probably saw it on a an infomercial one night and thought you know I'm going to go ahead and buy this course and it was one of those no money down courses and I don't think I ever used any of the\nTechniques that he really was talking about in the program but it really was sort of a primer for me to help me to get started and just to understand some of the basics of real estate investing and um so that's sort of where I began\nSo at what age was is and where did you finally take action why what made it possible for you to go out to buy your purse property\n[noise]\nUh I was probably I'm guessing in my late twenties early thirties when I started to do some of this real estate investing research\nAnd at the time when we were doing this my mom was actually a realtor she passed away in two thousand nine I bet she was a realtor it hadn't been involved in any rental properties herself and we saw an opportunity to get into the market by\nA four Plex and so we went out and um it was a deal where my mom was the three quarter owner and I was a one quarter owner um we put down I think Fifteen Percent back at the time on a five hundred and fifty thousand dollar\nProperty and uh we each put down somebody we took about thirty thousand dollars of the down payment on the line of credit\nAnd so with that partnership we we purchased this four Plex which I still own today which is appreciate it quite a bit and value and that sort of how I have\nBeen successful in real estate at the beginning was really just managing some properties and holding them for Fifteen Years in Southern California which of course with the appreciation that didn't really show that I was a great real estate investor but just that I was able to manage some property and and hold onto it for a period of time\nDid you have any cash flow at that time more\nUh when we first bought the property it was it was a four unit and we pretty much had to have all four units um rent it at the time in order to make sure we're paying the bills and paying the\nMortgage and the cash flow is very small the cash on that building now because we've had quite a while um is is pretty good um although\nYou know when you look at Southern California real estate we have a couple of single family homes I'm One of them we just sold\nOut last week it just closed and if you look at the value of the home and the cash flow that it's putting off it was\nIt was not very strong and so that's one of the things that I took away from a lifestyles unlimited teaching was to get that equity out and start putting it to work in a place that was going to give a much better return and so that's one of the reasons we've told one of our single families\nIs to be able to read a ploy that money and get it back into a multi family investments and investments that are going to have a much better return\nYou know that's such a true fact in California is like the epitome of that as the capital gains of value goes up a book called just appreciation California as you appreciation goes up the value goes up\nThat's more and more data equity and when you look at the return on equity in the deal the returns get low very very low very quickly so you need to be able to pull that money I'd go do something else with it which is what you've been doing a very successfully let's take a look at um\nThe the concept that you and your wife got married and you had a house and she had a house is just so typical of how people that were really on purpose to get into real estate investing\nAnd up in real estate investing by just shuffling houses between family members at so bored tell us how that happened with you and the wife and you guys had all these houses back and forth between the two of you\nSo uh we had just bought that for unit apartment complex I'm\nProbably the year before we got married and then I met my wife Julie\nAnd when I met her we were both just about closing on our first personal rather than fiat owns a a condo and I was trading up out of that into a single family home and she was birch thing a town home her town homeless in Irvine\nUm my single family homes in Costa Mesa and so we ended up getting married and we decided well we're going to only be able to live in one of these so we decided to live over in Irvine and her town home and uh we rent it out the place in Costa Mesa which we still have\nAnd we lived there for about two years and then how we got pregnant and we're going to have our first child and the house in Costa Mesa at a much bigger backyard and it was just a little more conducive for raising children and so we went ahead and\nYou know moved out of the vine place but instead of selling that and you know using the money on trips and fancy cars and boats and whatever we said no we're going to keep that house and we're going to transition over into the coast of south of so we did that so I've really only the Ford Flex but we\nPurchased my mom and I purchased the other is really the only investment property that I'd ever bought on my own the other two homes that we have um we currently live in Huntington Beach and so already act we're going to\nTake a break broke this was a perfect place to take a break we'll come back and talk about how you got introduced elapsed will be right back with more totally and the ... radio show [noise]\nFrom

I was on\nAnd it was a hundred thousand on that kind of a deal and I thought oh I just said fifty to honor this was going to be right if I went up and talk to him\nAnd he said now it's no problem you know any and all back in and fix that up and the long and short of the story is I ended up two weeks later are getting into my first deal\nA maple trail with Robert Martinez and um you know I think he carved out a spot for me as a new investor which I really appreciate it and I I told him this much and so that was the first deal I got into and and the second deal I also made a contact through the expo and was\nAble to um get into my next feel that way as well\nIt's interesting that um I think a lot of people believe the same thing um are they going to be difficult to get into these deals I Know that when I decided to go passive or just earlier this couple of months ago\nUm that I don't know where I'd like eight or ten deals right on my plate just boom boom boom boom boom they're just they're they're out there they're all over the place is just a matter of getting involved with it um\nSince you've started I Know there's no most of these deals don't pay off in the first couple of months so we won't go into returns let's talk about your plan into the future what do you see and how do you see your plan developing here", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "10"}
