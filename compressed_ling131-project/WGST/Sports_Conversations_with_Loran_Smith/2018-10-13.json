recapping here they're eight actually nine steps to creating beer first is your ingredients\nBy the way all these are at ... dot com the second is managing of the grain Steven greens in hot water for an hour between a hundred and forty due to a hundred and fifty nine degrees ... racing the sugar out of the grains creating the ward boiling for about an hour\nNumber five is adding the hops is where we left off and counter you just gave me and Jeff you just gave me a half a glass here of cops and these are what ... ... this popular ...\nVery okay especially among the idea is that what that was one that sold out because everyone wanted it last year\nI'm getting notes ... pining this fruiting is floral little ... very credible now these kind of like little pellets is that how they're grown or they created in ... there there are grown in\nThese little cones but pellets are easier to transport because an ounce of of a holy hops can actually go out a lot quicker and they they it's about you know a lot larger so this they they just pulverized them and put them through an expert or that that puts him in the ... gotcha so this is an assistant and even in about them all to\nThis is what gives the beer a lot of flavor a lot of the various tasting notes whether it's real happy those bitterness units or the other case that you would get on the power right now we go to showing showed the beer is boiled for just about an hour you're adding hops throughout your adding the hops okay then you go to showing\nNow as I say about earlier or with the hops the when you add them changes whether you to getting it bitterness from it around the from it or a flavor from it so if it takes you an hour or two hours to chill down all those Roma hops you put in\nHave been in hot water for long enough where they were comparing hops so the quicker you can chill it\nThe more you can retain the flavors that you want also the less chance for infection you have\n... and below eighty degrees ... what's the rough temperature each or that I usually go for about Seventy five Seventy five ... ... if it's too high you're going to kill the use of it's too cold is going to keep these to sleep you got to your friends you you will you want to make the environment for them really uh I'm\nHappy well it comes to beer obese does your does your friend not however All right so the next thing is pitching they use this is where you give life here this is where it becomes clear ... well yeah that a living thing I mean east is is is a beautiful thing and you can make alcohol you can make CEO to show me it's just\nThis is where the the life comes to come and there are different types of used there are there's different\nStrain yes range from different regions and they have different quality you know qualities each each one might produce same with water water water in the east or or um you know related to the regions that come from [noise] okay\nSo then you pitch to used and how long is the only time after you've cool down sanitation is a very key okay you don't want to infections of other bacteria is a wild nice it's where you can get really bad off flavors\nSo once you've chilled that you've sanitize everything that's going to touch your beer at this point is still considered ward until east is added but\nSanitation is absolutely key okay so you've pitched used then what happens stepping you close it in ... in the winter and you add an air lock or a year yeah you you should have been drinking the whole [laughter]\nOkay you make it so that nothing can get into it so there's blow off to basically or an air lock which just bless the CEO to the east is creating\nCome out but nothing coming\nOkay so fermentation how long about a month among so basically you you when you pitch the ... you then are you're putting the east into a new container into the ferment ended up from mentor gotcha so you take the work world works\nThat has the hops you showed them and you put it into the for mentor along with the used for thirty days now difference between a lawyer and a nail involves the feel\nBacked temperature temperature temperature um loggers east typically ferment around fifty five degrees in alleys typically ferment between sixty two to Seventy two degrees\nAnd one of the top fermenting and the other's bottom preventing the most probably for the most part okay gotcha so thirty days is now gone by now I'm looking here you've got beer ales sixty two to Seventy two degrees two to three weeks log or fifty five to sixty degrees two to three weeks\nNow determined logger actually log during is aging and cold temperature ... a logger you'd ferment at fifty five fifty fifty seven for two or three weeks and then you would log or it for up to three months and that's actually the process of law governing is about\nThirty five degrees and you maintain that for for two or three months national clears the flavor it clears the beer out for clarity\nSo loggers are longer ales about thirty to absolutely ...\nRequire a lot more patience to\nCorrect so thirty days have gone by with your ... your ... now what do you do comes out of the perimeter\nSo you put it into another container that's also sterilized a un a set amount of sugar and then you can read what now a set amount of sugar a landing on how much carbon ... so this is this part of the east so alive okay so you put it in another bucket you add sugar\nAnd then you put it into each bottle and Cabot okay and what that sugar to the east will eat that sugar inside the bottle and creating a C. O. two okay and it will naturally Cartwright carbonate inside of the bottom\nAll right and then you wait about two weeks there's even a week and a half\nAnd putting your fridge and you enjoy your next tasty beverage\nFantastic and as we discussed in our number one during our life ... ceremony we actually sampled some of your beers which were absolutely\nFantastic now somebody wants to buy a whole ruined get we've learned all eight nine steps science are bringing home brewing I'm looking here and we'll take a picture of this will actually we did take a virtual but the ... dot com that's an entire kit that you need everything\nHow much on two hundred two hundred dollars and you can become a home and you also have classes here at eBird route company in downtown St Pete twenty five bucks each tip\nFantastic website\nEvan fruit dot com and also on Facebook a avid Bruce [noise] perfect Jeff Keller counter Myra ...

Thirteen\nOr in the stadium now we're not on the field but we're in the stadium and we prepare very much like the teams themselves it's a it's a full week process and I always start with the game ending on Saturday Night\nAnd uh you know most us trying to get to the nearest big city airports wouldn't get home on Sunday a Sunday nights of big preparation like for me I usually review the previous game I start a compiling notes and information about the upcoming game a Monday Tuesday and Wednesday\nWorse than in our time in New York uh with my production group putting together elements are playbook and we have a playbook a but are elements to help tell the stories\nOf Thursday we travel I meet up with the announcers we go to the home team practice gifts chance to not just a A R ballplayers and numbers and all that but just you know see see what's going on behind the scenes\nFriday we meet with the home team in person or depending on where the visiting team as is\nStaying where you will meet with them either in person or by phone or to get some insight so when when the games happening we're not just randomly guessing you know we don't know exactly what's going on but we know when they're the red zone Georgia like flip the tight end or Alabama likes to do\nWhatever and then I gained day we uh we get there about five hours at a time and uh we do our ... and our our communications check and we can down the kick off just like the team then there's that same excitement and nervous energy that I'm sure the teams have and uh you know just like them you like to get up to a good clean start\nAh but the key things for all of us as a group\nAnd I go back to where the third team in the state and we also have a play book just like the coaches and I'm really the coach of the team or it's too too hopefully use the right element or call the right play at the right time and uh you know to to make sure that just because we work really hard on stuff\nOr not forcing it to the game if the game's not go in the direction that we thought it might and I think what makes our crew\nA really good is we have a good feel for what's happening in front of us and staying with that story as opposed to the story we thought was going to happen\n[noise] I guess crave silver the code they produced sort of college for both CBS um what did you think when you were\nTold that a mayor network that you're going to be the network for the Southeastern Conference that was a bold move on the part of the network well\nIn hindsight a you know it seems like a gigantic decision but you know back almost a creeping it on Twenty years ago we were covering SEC game but also we're recovering biggie skiing and you know the football landscape hadn't morphed into what it is now the FCC has morphed into the\nPowerhouse it is now and I truly believe that this the stars aligned uh with uh the FCC the BCS CBS Vern long quest becoming the voice of the FCC\nUh and and all those things would happen at the same time to you know vault the FCC into the stratosphere\nAre hiring a high profile coaches you know it makes a male issue that ultimate Alabama urban Meyer a handful of others\nAnd I think ultimately what turned the SEC into a National Conference my opinion doesn't mean I'm right or two things the imperfection of the BCS because now are a great FCC game between Georgia an Auburn had national implications not just implications and the deep south\nAnd I think the national platform on CBS also help raise the profile and these things all combined to to elevate the FCC to where it is and I've been lucky enough to be alone for the ride\n[laughter] but you still get home to New York on Saturday Night if you make it work\nWell homeless home and I'm I'm very fortunate I have two
