{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "A I mentioned it earlier I really think that the single most significant change in college football in last year's was the creation of the BCS and it was the imperfections of the BCS at turned it into a national sport because now some people in Columbus or LA\nOr you know elsewhere they care about what's going on in the FCC\nBecause now Ohio State of Michigan or Wisconsin you know they're not just going to play you know what was then the ... the rose bowl they might play Alabama or Georgia or whomever [noise]\nSo I think the the imperfections of the BCS has pushed us to a national sport uh\nI as I mentioned earlier I think the playoff will expand at some point\nThree to five years or which will allow a little deeper pool of teams [noise] um but again the beauty of college football is even if you're not going to win your division a\nStill can have a winning season and go to a bowl you haven't rivalry games and there's a lot of different ways to a\nA revel in success and with no disrespect to some of the professional sports there's only one team that walks away at the end of the season truly happy and that's the team that won the championship but\nIn college football you may not when you're division may not win the conference but you'd be your your your archrival you had your best season and who knows how many years you went to a New Year's day bowl game\nA there's a lot of pride and a lot of ways to rebel than success in college football they don't think exists and other sports\nI guess Craig Silverman CBS um heroes for him to blacks he's just a week ago said whatever we do we should make sure we keep a bowl system and then as he said that uh says but having said that we have too many ...\nA handful of using the bows out to the function of college football\nWell I agree with ... a hundred percent we definitely need to keep the bowl system we have too many bowls look at it cuts both ways on the TV producer\nAnd many of these ... that seem insignificant to the outside person may still be significant to their communities and they also provide TV programming you know for a very specific ten date at two week window or during the December holidays\nAnd you know probably none of us really think about it but we for sports fans would come home on a Wednesday night somewhere between Christmas and New Year's and\nOr doing whatever up there's a football game on\nYou may not necessarily care about it but it's action\nYou know it's football action but there are too many bowls you know I'm I'm a bit of a purist and a traditional\nAs I don't think teens teams that are five hundred should be going to ball games but uh no there's got to be a better way and there's definitely a reason\nWe keep wanting to not only six on TALK radio six forty below you gee I'd see\nThis is sports conversations with Laurence Smith on CNN now use more\nOf them back I guess a fake silver a CBS coordinating producer college football uh we've been talking football and uh that's uh something that we appreciate a\nBread and butter you might even say but uh you do other things are the masters for example that the other guys say every year and uh it's had some exciting history and CBS has been there for all very ... and the only network that my right there but there are a masters or\nSo as you tell us what's great about the masses include you are a tribute to Billie pay less are for you to do by the way [laughter]\nI Love the mass is\nThe most unique sporting event in America you know there are there are a couple of aunts and I happened to tend to all of them that are Americana and if the Indy five hundred in the Kentucky Derby\nAnd the masters and I think a big part of it is that they're held in the same location every year you know if you're a golfer Augusta National is the ultimate cathedral\nAnd if you're just a casual fan you're attracted to the beauty of the nature and the colors et cetera and um then it's just had some of the most iconic moments in sports created by\nI the greatest players Arnie Palmer Jack Nicklaus uh obviously tiger savvy just the most unique sporting event and it's surrounded by the southern charm\nYou know they've had many great leaders there and Billy Payne and retired chairman a couple of years ago uh you know she really emphasized the patron experience\nAnd he wanted to make sure that people got the best possible experience in Orson joined a masters in person\nAnd on television he did an incredible job\nTo work with him uh he said he had any advantage and running the greatest tournaments but only in the world today but in history having had a mess for letting background having played football\nBelieves a brilliant businessman these proved it many many times over including a a organizing the the the committee that brought the Olympics to Atlanta which was a gigantic success against all odds people said it could never happen and\nYou know I think you know what I've seen from the outside looking in so many successful people in life it started with their background in sports and particularly football which is the ultimate team sport\nI'll never vote for a Democrat if you are a good Democrat you need a change party\nThere it is because you're a leadership is despicable\nWilling to destroy people to get in return to retain power\nWilling to smear willing to make up stories willing to promote stories willing to lie willing to cheat\nI Will never for school board for dog catcher for city council for any level vote for another Democrat because those people end up going to Congress and helping the poor sees\nThe Schumer's\nThe Feinstein's up their retain power and do what they do\nI Know you're thinking well Tom took you a long time I get it I understand I just didn't want to go there and and if you are a good if you're a politician if you're a political appointee or whatever\nAnd you're a Democrat and you're embarrassed by what they did you certainly should be\nChanged parties easy just do it\nNow the good news is we are up Brett Kavanaugh\nSupposedly that's a five four majority are not so fast Charlie Brown and it's a four four plus question mark Warner yes\nThere is a very good possibility that chief justice Roberts will slide over and take the role of Kennedy asked the swing vote don't count your votes your decisions before they come in\n[noise] however I Know a lot of us have already gotten ahead of ourselves on this\nWhy do you what if we can hold the Senate and the terms and what if Donald Trump gets an opportunity to nominate another Supreme Court justice\nThen we really are set up fascinating fantastic so what's going to mean for gun rights while we talk about that in a ... a there are a number of cases headed to the Supreme Court or something that they've turned down because it basically turning down cases gun cases\nIt takes four votes to accept the case but just thinking as we don't know for sure what happens inside the Supreme Court thinking is they've turned down some of these gun cases even though they probably had the four votes to accept it because they knew they didn't have the five votes that would take\nTo win and rather than say well that's reinforced a Supreme Court precedent that your gun rights should be diminished we're just not going to take those cases until we know we can decide correctly\nAnd so the Heller decision from ten years ago his sat\nAnd sat in fat\nAnd if they do it because the Supreme Court won't uphold the lower court jerk ... good ruining the exact opposite from Heller we'll see what happens now when we come back I have something to share with you and I'm going to do something that\nYou're just not supposed to do on TALK

Olivier from the national Shooting Sports foundation hey mark welcome\nTom thanks for having me appreciate your getting us some time to talk about how these lectures Arctic gun owners\nAbsolutely 'cause you know and I talked to people said yeah you know I really need to do that but I'm not sure where to vote or I'm not sure where my candidate is on this to a friend that shooter and that's kind of what the whole gun vote things about isn't it\nIs so and that's the south or several years ago ... vote a program so they go to ... vote or\nThey will take you to a Web page where you could type in you know where you live and they will tell you your candidates are and where they stand on the gun issues and and just like it was a two years ago in the presidential election\nMiss mid term elections going to be crucial as to as to what stands for rice you know who's going to be protecting our ... and what we can expect out of the next couple of years when it comes to fires policy in America\nIt's interesting he said because it's finest policy in ... I'm not sure people say well you I Know yeah we want to win and I want to stop and say well let me explain to you what this means because white and now the Republicans control the house and the Senate and the White House\nWhen the Democrats get control of the house for instance they can control what bills are introduced that can control what bills are voted on if the Democrats who control the Senate of course they get control of the confirmation process on Supreme Court justices as we've just seen that battle there\nAnd of course the Democrats also announced that if you control the house they're going to try to impeach a President Trump and also they're going to try to impeach our Brett Kavanaugh she justice now most Supreme Court\nThey can only do those things if they are in the majority of each else am I right\nYou're absolutely right and that's how I Am so when we have control of both the house and Senate for\nThose of us were those politicians from our elected leaders who are listening to their gun owners who are voting for them then they're going to make sure that these these ... these pointless hearings\nOn our body down to Congress in getting important a policy issues pushed forward and pushing back the ones that are truly going to be detrimental to us on our ability to exercise our second that rights\nYou know and uh [noise]\nJust so people understand what we're talking about we're talking about the everybody says well we need a national reciprocity\nYou're not going to get that with Democrats in control of the house or Senate you know we will want a the hearing Protection Act you're not going to get that with the Democratic party in charge of the house and Senate it's not going to have to physically\nLogically impossible to get those but what you are going to get a lot of efforts at more restrictive gun control laws which means stripping away or infringing on your rights\nYou're you're absolutely right I'm a I'm a so I looked at the national character that's positive ads have been introduced in the last Congress but\nStill pending out there the hearing Protection Act as as a builder still pending out there\nUh and and the joy so overwhelming support but because of the difficult in the ... because it only takes one senator to filibuster hold those bills up we haven't been able to those two issues for which we know are crucial issues to fire back they want to see these things pass they want to see them for it to the altar exercise their rights\nWithout any kind of impediment so even when we're talking about having control these houses are still or that we have a majority to be able to do this we need ... senators to do a bus or groups seldom moves his career in right now we have a razor thin margin and\nSo we really need to make sure that they are voters out there are educated as to where the Kennedys stamp they bellwether issues are and they can go find that at a at gun poked out of work\nYou know market occurs to me also one of the things or incest F works on a lot of things that people don't know about their Portland but they're kind of\nHidden not secret exactly but they're just not on the radar things like and this would be important or in the upcoming election things like the efforts to use the EPA to try to be an entire classifications of ammunition because that contain lead\nShore yeah it it's not just at the federal level wishing that the state level as well so\nOur folks that are working wash it share it with their legislators every day and age with both the house and the Senate they're\nBoth eating with Republican or Democrat then they're they're trying to make sure they understand what the what the unintended consequences of these bills could be so they start to ban led mission traditionally ... and they say you can't use that for hunting it\nHope he just drop you still looking at buying a coat combat unit radio guy and he says once my opinion even though he didn't make it on the show here um cell phones are wonderful aren't they [noise]\nLet's see anything wrong with that guns I don't have one I did get a chance to shoot one uh with mark a rental and had a ball she truly well by the way I mentioned earlier there are some new guns going to be coming out ah [noise] the gun companies\nBig change from oh some years ago when the gun companies all made their announcements in the fall for which could be coming out actually in the spring for ... for a shot you\nNow they just keep cranking out you around they're going to be some [noise]\nCareful here\nUm interesting caliber options they're going to be some\nUpgrades and guns that you already know in like\nAnd they're going to be even better I'm I'm trying to be careful here because of the spill the beans we we get a chance to play with a lot of these these guys have the time I'm One of them I really got huge\nWe had a ball where they can shot some video I think you're just going to enjoy the heck out of the question is Hi this is kind of a question\nDo you need a new gun do any of us do any of us really need a new gun thank goodness need is really not a factor for us um yeah I've got nine to not have forty five and I have four days\nIt can be said what are you what do you need to understand me out of four I'll fortunately I don't think I absolutely\nNeed one but if you're really into it it's not difficult at all to find a gap an opening however infant\nTestimony ... small it might be oh well that would fit right between this and that\nAnd I don't have anything that fits this gap that I have just create [laughter] yeah I Know and look we we have to\nSelf enable whenever we can't find a buddy a friend who will help us in April All right so that's something we after that I Am

just call Tom talk guy that just gives you a obviously a lot of things going on in the news\nWould come back on that later on the show I Want to talk to a bit more about judge Kavanaugh and some specific several cases that are very likely to work their way to the Supreme Court and where we are with that what was she he could mean\nThe wild card and this of course is that we don't know what chief justice Roberts is going to do he has been considered\nHome the conservative\nSide but there are some who say maybe he could end up being the swing vote he may be well he may want that role of being the decider we'll see we'll find out about that line to mix with us out of Texas hey Mick you're on TALK what's up\nYes I was shot to question I Wonder Dr Martin Linden tree thirty six got to be here thirty six\nPortrait deer hunt ride with Santa hang on to check critter [noise] gun and then also the uh now I'm Wondering if there is just too cold cold ... that they're they just came out with it they're going to make a hike on\nUm I don't think there's even thought of doing the python\nThey throw away the the drawings they threw away the gym bags they throw away the machinery for making the python you know Thirty years ago and every once in a while they'll make noises about maybe we could do that again\nOr if they do it will be the same guy and it'll be something different or look like ... what were the same but I don't think so uh so now let me ask you you mentioned a a more than three thirty six thirty or six\nYeah I think that it might be a trio wait what I'm looking at is the one at Walmart and\n... are are you sure it's not cheaper for the thirty thirty\nOr thirty third year right after I thought that you are totally correct\nYeah 'cause I was going to say if that came out in the story of six I missed that one\n[laughter] sorry about that you're totally correct\nOkay All right so what's the question about that\nIs that a good that you're not just for deer hunting with my boy or a ... a but also to hang on to for critters any other you [noise]\nOkay uh this is where it gets a little trick you're more give you a quick history okay a Marlins I always made really good guns or they were purchase the company was purchased some decade ago by Remington remove the company and there are a lot of people who say the guns were never as good after that\nUh I don't know if that's true but I have a lot of reports\nOf that if it were me right now I and I like old ... sort of thing I Would be I Would consider looking for an older Marlon as opposed to a new one\nAnd I don't know how you feel about buying a used growing older gun versus the brand new but for me I'd be looking for an older one just 'cause I like him so much\nWhat would you do that\n[noise] um well obviously the gun stores around the cell use guns you could poke around you could actually just color hearing that Dr Carender areas do you have any ah older Marlin liberal action thirty thirties\nNow there's also a couple or three Web sites that are very well known and very well respected are probably the biggest of them is called gun broker\nGun broker dot com\nAnd you can find guns there and you can buy them and what they do is they ship them to your local gun store and then you do the background check their and usually have like a three day approval period if you don't like it you can return it but you check that out with people there or who you're buying from but you could check gun broker dot com\nOr however if you go in the store you like to look to the new Marlon there's nothing wrong with that just by it you know I think it's going to be fine I Love them I Would offer if you are not aware there's one or the company at least one of the country making really nice lover actually just repeating arms\nThey make very nice liver actually you know a major us you might check him repeating oranges will compare all\nOf those and make your calls you're not going to

we didn't really know what the titans managed to do last weekend for Arkansas so this is not going to be easy their defense of front is good though\nI I Do think you know true is going to be able to do some good work against the rest of the defense but uh\nYou can pick a group like this I mean drew lock you are going to see him in the national football league\nA next year and he is going to be a very very high first round draft choice the quarterback today from a zoo I mean he is that good we're just not saying that he is truly ... he'll be in the early first round draft pick so uh uh this
