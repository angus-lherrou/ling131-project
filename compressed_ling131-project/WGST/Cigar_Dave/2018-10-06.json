pest control and the ... system the unbeatable combination preterm protection earlier this afternoon of course you had them a looming Arkansas sixty five thirty one\nUm apparently some other games and action right now you've got delayed Missouri in South Carolina and Missouri getting ready to take a ... but with all the rain they've had this afternoon's delayed games ... leads\nMissouri thirty four thirty two\nUh currently and actually at LSU and Florida tied up at seven a piece about eleven minutes and the first half of that match up right there but some tonight some big games scheduled to play you get Kentucky at Texas A M vanity at Georgia\nAll burnt at Mississippi State and also one of the game and progress run out old miss leading university of uh Louise in Monroe fourteen to nothing about four minutes and the first half of that game right they're\nBack on the academy sports networks hotline we had to help much to talk with Dorothy Dorothy how you doing this afternoon\nRight a question one [noise]\nBut they haven't spread the day I thought like that but and are are they going to have a ... to give them more of a game anytime soon they\nWhat was your second question Dorothy\n... is coming up they\nTheir in their uh you know if you got to do all the way that might get more of a game I'm Wondering if they got to say I do not\nThink your door to appreciate the phone call their spread or as what I've been told they did not come just read today but um as far as uh the the schedule is concerned big games coming out maybe you can't take any game lightly and even coach saving Tyler talked about this game this afternoon with Arkansas being a trap game\nUm obviously Arkansas and having the best disease in the last five straight games in a row\nAfter winning their first one but you can't take any team lightly especially in the SEC\nKnown you got to be thinking that some of these teams that are even more potent than Arkansas is on the ... side is going to look at this film and say if Arkansas can put up thirty one\nWe might be able to put a forty or fifty and if you're able to put a forty or fifty against us Alabama football team you got an opportunity to make this a fourth quarter game\nSo I think that even Missouri next week with the ability that they have the spread the ball around and put it multiple points they scored thirty two points today over in South Carolina in there's about five inches of standing water on that field\nDifficult track conditions and they're still able to spread it around and go up and down the field so there's some tough games on the schedule you just worry about the next one that's all you can do and just try to get better and whatever happens happens\nWhen you're still going to go to Tennessee to el issue a Mississippi State at all bringing up as well so that's not an easy recipe scheduled for bam obviously so the FCC is expected hey it's always tough to play in the SEC back on the academy sports networks hotline they talk to their accusing Daphne Derek how you doing this afternoon\nI'm fine how are those doing fantastic who'd come in or hang up and there's I think I heard a couple of callers bring up the point that you know that the starter and\nTwo and play it into the fourth quarter but I'm\nThinking about it a good thing because when you're up for it and I have a there is no reason for them to go back out there and take a chance of getting hurt or ... the man said well the linebacker on the other thing I I think is pretty good thing\nThey're totally agree when you when you're able to pull some of your starters out\nEarly in the game is great that you can rotate some of these younger players and also television is it just keeps them healthier\nIt does and this that was thrown out several years ago I think back in two thousand and Fifteen they calculated by the end of the two thousand Fifteen season the Alabama deep and has played an entire game more as far as snatched go than they had the previous two years so that does take a toll on your body\nBoth physically as well as mentally and so to go ahead and get those guys off the field as early as possible when the leaders comfortable and continue to build that up will do nothing but help you but it's like we talked about you got to make sure that you're staying in shape and you always have that concern in the back of your mind of what is you get in a tight game during the fourth quarter of the gals going to know how to respond [noise]\nExactly ... phone call back on the academy sports and that was hotline we have to ... to talk with Keith Keith how you doing this afternoon [noise]\nAll right guys how you doing today doing great real time\nRole less than I Am just\nHelp first dial up watching the news I

points which I'm applying it about one thirty something on it is ridiculous to complain about not treat me going\nI Wish we could put up station here Seventy every game and let the other thing that the young guys playing we give up twenty five or ... it was a young\nGuy then that's fine but I don't know if I had you gotta quit complaining about their stars not play in a second language go on to me that's the whole jak about the gang bang and I really enjoy this guy I wrote that\nRoad where that is that is straight from the mouth of someone from ... because that community down there knows how to put points up at the hospital level there used to beating people Seventy to six\nA point well taken though that is absolutely appropriate and accurate this coaching staff would be very pleased if they can score fifty or sixty points and the chances of winning every single game would be pretty high if they were able to do that [noise]\nBan has scored forty five plus points in all six games this season the best program history this was something that\nWe haven't seen in and if it happened a long time this is something very unusual because this has been a team with saving has been mainly a defense based so to say but it's it's so fun to watch and I don't think we've seen all the potential yet of what this ... is April a capable of doing\nI think that's something that you tend to forget that the difference is still playing well now down we we don't need to\nOr cells and things that they're not is is just you've ratcheted up your last couple of years without officer production the game has changed you have to be able to do that\nBecause they've been recognized that several years ago that he couldn't just landed up too tied in to run the ball and then play feel position he was going to have to get some games where you had to score thirty forty fifty points in order to be able to win now you're able to do that so you feel much better about your chances depending on who has
