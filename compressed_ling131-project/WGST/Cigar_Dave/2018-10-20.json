{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Know puts us about what we do how we execute how we play we play together as a team and how we play each clay one play at a time for sixty minutes in the game and that's how our players look at it and I think that's that's the best way for them to look at it\nAnd how does bam a look at quarterback Jared guarantee panel obviously again I had a great game he is vastly improved one year to the next what did you see when you watched him on film\nI think first of all they ever really good officer system that they're using I think you can see that you know he's flourishing in that system I think they have really good wide receivers uh and they\nThey're taking a lot of shots in the game and I think they hit six explosive plays on fifty fifty balls last week um which is what you know they're trying to do to feature the players I have and he's a guy that's a very good athlete just playing with a lot of confidence right now\nRunning backs a names of the fans know Chandler in London and so on their averaging a hundred and sixty RG game on the ground or what did they do best with the heart running bunch of a a a Scott back kind of bunch what do we see\nI I think they they complement each other very very well um they got guys that have some seizing power and then they've got some guys that are very quick to the outside so they're running back core sort of really compliments one another and and they feature him and use them accordingly and I think that's why they've all been affective\nVisiting with coach Nick Saban here in Knoxville the tide on the Tennessee Volunteers I was sorry to see that the von ... Smith did make the trip so you were pretty I think convinced when you talk to us on Thursday that he hadn't done any work yet a you hate to see a guy Mr game\nWell he sure do and he's been a really good player for us and really good job on our team a hard worker a great competitive character and um you know hopefully we'll get him back I'm here in the near future\n... will often said alignment of a week for the Southeastern Conference and may be one of the guys that are fans know little about to share with us what he's all about and how nice it was for him to get league wide recognition\nWe always like to say is your players get you know positive self gratification for good performance and her job search played really well for us all your uh really settle down a right tackle one is on a nice job and I think our entire office of line\nHas work well together and become a pretty cohesive unit so um you know but ... really for a guy that played some last year as a freshman and played well when he played by develop very nicely in this plan with a lot of conflicts and consistency right now\nAbout the until you brown another guy that to the fans of hurt us talk a good bit about here of late or tell us a little bit more about him\nWell there's a lot of competition with her inside players because the the volunteers developed in the real power guy gets moving inside what you like to see you know guys get and\nLast year was a little bit banged up last week and so that competition does continues on a will need all those guys to be able to play well for us to be successful\nI noticed is more than just a statistical ballgame not just today but any game but you still look at numbers ... number two in America and third down conversions I guess you're never satisfied if you're not a hundred percent but still number two in the country that darned good\nI think there's some parts of the games that are really important and you know how how do you do on third down to keep drives alive is very very critical to ban successful um how you doing the red zone a is also something that's very critical the van successful so\nAre we want to continue to improve and all those areas so that we have the best opportunity to score points from when we get those opportunities\nAnd of course you always take pride not only in the whole scene but in the defense right now number two in the country and bringing out defensively show again another one of those hidden numbers up the fans might not know about\nWell but I think the number one thing you know and playing good defense was you got to be hard to score on so they don't want to give a big place um\nSo you've got to be good on third down and get off the pills or the other team does it makes them drowsy knew how to play well in the red zone so that if you get some turnover sprinkled on there and some negative plays that kind of contributes to all that so it's really the consistency that we're looking for so that we are hard to score on\nCoaches always have a great afternoon thanks for your time I think your coach Nick Saban joining us here in Knoxville I visit with the coach brought to you by Corp power recovered better with court power the official protein drink of Alabama athletics you're listening to the Crimson Tide sports network on earlier field\nAtlanta ... twenty Eighteen presented by capital what happened on December ... dying killing Mendez we can\nFind marshmallows\nOn sale to everyone get yours and be a part of the Atlantic ... twenty eight presented capital ally\nNow is the time and wherever you are is the place the citadel makes it easier to\nEarn your degree by offering master's degrees graduate certificates and undergraduate degree completion programs that are entirely online these programs are convenient for working professionals and those serving in the U.S military continuing\nThe citadel legacy of academic excellence classes are held to the same high standard consistently named ... than the house [noise] [noise]\nEvery one across it great state of Alabama in the southeastern United States the latest scores than the SCC\nAnd around the nation are presented today by Alabama Power Alabama Power is proud to support the Crimson Tide roll tide my friends great to have you with us third Saturday in October whether it should be perfect meal in stadium in Knoxville so much history in this series number one Alabama\nTaking on Tennessee the time they want to eleven straight in the series twenty two straight wins over FCC east opponents dating all the way back\nTo two thousand and ten Nick Saban time coming into the game seven and over for no in the S.

ball games and they got to have that again\nThey're still got them guys her will go over that but those turnovers or or what Alabama has been able to avoid all nonsense and they're gonna have to do it again today\nThe guys who are hurt includes their number tends heckler Mica Abernathy who is the signal color the quarterback of the defense if you will these out again with ankle injury and\nPuts more pressure on the junior Nigel warrior and then I Do worry is a good kid plays well but he has no Mike\nAbernathy is definitely not um\nHis dad who was a first round draft pick for time pro bowlers
