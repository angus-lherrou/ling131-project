I don't know if you've noticed that like Rob has this horror special on AMC\nAnd are they just did it in the whole thing about possession which I thought was interesting that um and then the timing is a perfect because they were talking about\nAh the exercises or move on the road you were talking about to get out which is kind of a a possession film and we're talking about The Exorcist and everybody was influenced by The Exorcist and Stephen King said\nThat\nHe felt that The Exorcist was a film about social change basically a finely honed\nFocusing point for that entire youth explosion that took place in the late sixties early seventies he said it was a movie for all those parents who felt in a kind of agony and terror but they were losing their children and could not understand why or how it was happening and today we could all agree\nThat perhaps were not only losing our children to the devil but we may also you know we might also be losing ourselves to the devil it's also been argued that the movie The Exorcist addresses anxieties about changes in the structure of the family and how evil and trauma\nCan be on a down from generation to generation only to be eventually manifest for all the seeing some explosive demonstration of mental and physical breakdown\nNow I got a lot of people don't realize maybe some people do realize that the movie and Peter ... novel is based on a true story\nIt's based on a month long ... Ninety day actresses and by Jesuit priest and a fourteen year old boy who preach assigned a pseudonym rolling do the extra system happened in Nineteen forty nine a role and do his boyhood home lives in Prince George's County Maryland\nWhere this report in possession began and uh it went for Ninety Days three months uh it started in the winter\nAnd then in the spring of Nineteen forty nine ah ruins parents relocated from Maryland to a relative showman St Louis wherever the course of two weeks there in St Louis there was there were nine judge would breach the perfect participated in the boys' actresses I'm One of them was father rabid bishop\nOr he kept a diary of being encounters there were a number of others who were involved that uh uh certainly are you\nGiving up and they need some of them have passed away I think and of course uh we were approached by a a number of people to discuss ah this case because apparently one\nOf the nurses that uh was there\nAre witnessing the situation was actually told they took a six year\nVow of silence that we're going to talk about the case and now those who were survivors are are now talking about the case and one man in particular a Mark Perry\nIs an RN with forty two years in the medical field including over Thirty years and I use in the yards he's a U.S army veteran and a medic during the Nineteen seventies he was a Catholic brother of or or monk or with the election brothers for four years working on a working with the sisters of a\nCrime to him and he sat down\nWith John Grinder who was one of the nurses that was there during the night of the exercises him and he uh recorded a a a video that we have a and this is interesting we have exclusive rights as video and it's basically John Grinder giving up a sixty about sounds about what happened that night\nOr in Nineteen forty nine with ruin do a mark welcome to ground zero\nAll oh welcome to the show it's good to have you here\nBut um yeah I like college a few months back or talk about I'm a ... lord man day and I think you saw you know the family a little video that I talk with John I'm\nYou see what I was talking about where you know that that stuff just scares the heck out of the [laughter]\nThe oil [laughter] I'll eat he was a I I was ...

happening\nThere was actually a there was a priest who was supposed to go on the show tonight or his name was father long ago and he had confirmed being a part of the show and then he said that he decided to back out because he was worried about these strange things you're talking you're speaking of\nWell I yeah I uh that brother he was a monkey in the market is brother war long ago um and he has basically\nUm he's the keeper of all of the books and everything when they were carrying down to the hospital and um and they're already Nineteen seventies um they they found the\nUm the so a lot of the papers that they were put in the archives up for the election brothers which is different our ties and then what they had for the Jesuits at the time and a brother or long ago with the keeper of that and um\nYeah I called in today to see if he if he would come on and he said he just\nHe doesn't want he didn't want to get involved with that at all\n... and I am and I'm sure you know and and like with the interview you did with brother Grider\nAre you noticing him and his mannerisms he was talking about it at first you could see him shaking a it appeared that he was terrified that he had to ... you know he's reiterated his story I think you handled it quite well in the interview actually because\nYou know for some reason you have this uncanny knack forget him you actually when I get from it is that when when I was watching the interview while he was you know drifting off into other stories you kept him on task\nOf of talking and I and I basically highlighted\nA ... in the exercise taken out for the show tonight I basically have highlighted some of the things that he kept reiterating some of the things that you saw somebody things and he uh obviously was so blown away
