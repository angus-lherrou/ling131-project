I think I don't know be with the ... if this was the picture they were looking at what you're saying but it should be stark clusters\nLook like aliens spaceships\n... and healing armada that's heading toward the earth\nAnd as we mentioned it but\nYou know off of ... I don't know if anybody remembers we're not sure but I remembered it okay somebody else or there would be saying is now I went back I went back to somebody shows to try and find it I couldn't find it where he said it\n\nI I did see I I Swear I said and then um I asked my friend Sarah said that I said this is she listened to the show and I think she called me and she said uh how how does this what what what about this\nSorry monitor thing and I and so I remember her calling me she remembers calling me because I asked her about it and so I tend to take some of these strange stories I just I bookmark them and they put them in my in a file right\nAnd so I came in this morning after I had lunch or actually it was afternoon after I had lunch with my friend John and I went to look for that story because I wanted to you know I wanted to find\nThe the the guy who emailed me tweeted me are sent me a message saying I'd found the story this is all I got\nBut I looked all over the Web today I ... I just search tying little all over the Web\nTyping in key words armada space armada stark clusters Russian scientists these dark clusters the big the alien armada during the early information or some

feed on our on more than happy\nTo uh you know big Mitt that maybe it is there but I cannot find that story\nCan't find that story\nSo it was like one of those off the cuff comments I didn't do any research on I'm thinking well I Want to do research on this I Want to find out more can't find a damn thing\nSo last night\nI don't know if I'm any of you know this but there was a full world wide shutdown of YouTube last night\n\nAnd I got an email from a guy named Scott Reed emails me all the time and he kept mentioning this story about uh have you seen this video this video going around the Internet this video of a guy he's in a uniform even military and you say that something is about to hit the moon\nSome large object is about to hit the moon well apparently\nThis is the this is a conspiracy theory this is a conspiracy theory cause I cannot confirm it so it's a conspiracy theory meaning that since I Can't confirm it\nBut it's weird that I think I'm having some sort of a mental breakdown or something I don't know what's going on here but um there are rumors flying around as to why the this this this this outage occurred last night and the cheap rumor is that viral video\n\nThe viral video of a guy something on YouTube relief that purported to show a man in uniform announcing that\nSomething large he didn't asteroid a rock a UFO I dunno something large was about to crash into the moon\n\nIs this guy that was notified by email and Scott if you're listening please send that email again I Want I Want to know if you said that email too because I read your email sometimes they don't reply to them but I read your emails and Scott you know who you are I'm Talking right to you\nI Want to know where that video is about men or that that footage of something hitting the moon\n\nBecause from what I understand is that they shut down you two last night they shut down YouTube last night because of that video\nThey didn't want that video to go viral so they had to shut down the system see they won't tell anybody way the system shut down it just shut down because they wanted to weed out any and all of these videos going around that would show something hitting the moon\n\nNow if I Can't find proof of this and I can't find a video or I Can't find the story about the armada and the stark clusters and the Russians and the art the story you know it sounds like some science fiction misinformation\n\nMaybe got leaked out it wasn't supposed to be heard of ... or or thought about right so\nScience fiction disinformation maybe maybe somebody straight to play a joke on people\nBut\nI mean\nIs it really or was it really science fiction this information really because of the circumstances it just seems a little odd\nRushing say they see the star clustered say but they don't want to start clusters they look like do you remember the famous than you might remember me saying that's on the air so it was talking about the neutrinos coming out of Antarctica right and I said oh and now they're saying that Russia said there's ... there's a looked like our motto UFOs blah blah blah blah blah you remember I said something about that haven't been able to find that\nQuote [noise] but I have a friend who said you did say it okay I did say it\n\nI said it and then the shutdown of YouTube and a mysterious email not really mysterious as a guy who sends me emails all the time saying that he saw video in fact I Want to check my email the series on this year to see if he wrote me back I Want to find out to be listening to me if he's riding me

S. according to a statement that was released by NASA\nThe so use that as ten spacecraft launched from about can or cause of drumming Kazakhstan to the international space station for forty ... am eastern daylight time Thursday October eleven or carrying American ass right near Kagan Russian cause not alec C O inching shortly after\nLaunch there was an anomaly with the booster and the launch ascent was aborted resulting in a ballistic lending of the spacecraft\n\nLaunched appeared to be going smoothly but about Ninety seconds later NASA on his live stream reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation\nThe space agency tweeted that ballistic descending involve the sharper angle of landing compared to normal the castle containing the abstract successfully separated from the rocket booster and parachute into the ground with the rescue teams were there to pick them up it's also interesting to know the two of NASA's important space telescopes when did the safe mode\nShutting down about sending information back\nBut they're shawndra X ray observatory went into safe mode and halted all the science operations a few days after Hubble the Hubble Space telescope shut down due to a gyroscope failure according to the agency ... a transition at the same boat was possibly triggered by an issue that also had something to do with this gyroscope\nComponent in charge of pointing and stabilizing the telescope however there are some investigators and those are into deep space conspiracy theory\nThey're saying that something is happening in space that NASA\nDoes not want us to see\n... and and just out of coincidence NASA's curiosity Mars rover it's temporarily halted science operations to there's been a glitch with that so that we can't see anything from Mars\n\nCan't see anything from Mars here's an overnight bulletin\nHasn't made national headlines yet but here we go NASA's planetary defense coordination arms or offices two year old a two year old the organization that NASA's it's NASA's planetary defense coordination office two years old it started with a budget\nIt started with a small budget and now it's gone to\nOvernight and they they spiked it to a hundred and fifty million dollar budget for this a planetary defense coordination office\n\nFirst of all there was Ninety million dollars I wouldn't know sixty million dollars it went from sixty million dollars to one hundred and fifty million dollars overnight\nAnd says you're amid growing concerns of humanity is utterly unprepared for the unlikely but still an ... an asteroid strike of climate it's proportions\nWhite House has also recently issued a new national near earth object prepared to strategy an action plan intended to energize a host of agencies who could contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster\nSo Ninety million more dollars I mean we have not been a concern about why is it the shot up to a hundred and fifty dollars a hundred and fifty million dollars\nSecondly why issue a brand new plan that it's intended to energize a host of agencies who can contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster if there is no debt disaster looming for the foreseeable future something isn't right about all this something is definitely wrong here\nI mean it feels like a really scary B horror science fiction film it sounds like a war of the world scenario that sounds\nToo weird to be real but it is real it's happening\n\nI mean these these shutdowns I mean remember the sunspot observatory was shut down on September Six twenty eighth team\nAnd then all this stuff is good chicken shutting I remember all the other space observatory to shut down after the September ... shut down in New Mexico\n\nI mean these shutdowns remind me of what happens before an alien invasion ... from a science fiction perspective I mean and I don't I don't want I don't want it to be about this but I guess it all depends how you look\nAt what is going on around you and everything around us is is is is it just it sparking a lot of anxiety I was feeling really bizarre all day to day\nA lot of tension in my neck a lot of ah I couldn't concentrate\n\nI couldn't concentrate something was up and then when I'm reading all of these posts saying did you see the video of the man in you\nThe forum stadium to the moon is about to be hit by something I said no it went all over the Internet\nQuite as would shut down on YouTube and I thought oh my God where the ...

this is this is sending is like you say this is like a repeat or\nSending something that was certainly a is bizarre especially in the coincidental sons were going on in the past three days\nBut I liked it off the single going into that coming out the same and the strengths\nAnybody anybody can take the signal and they could speed it up or slow it down to see if there's anything inside the

band voices going on so or the you know wherever they said that could be I get really even slowed down side band or a sped upside banned it could be a lot of things at the moment though they're saying this is what they're getting these are seismic waves\nOr they could be the wind and they're not sure they're saying it could be under the cross or it could be something blowing over the crust decreed
