D. C. reported that a child died from this disorder instance officials have been able to they haven't been able to determine how the disease spreads\nThey're starting to count suspected cases as well as confirmed Jupiter anticipate increases over the coming months so uh I can tell you know it's too early\nTo know whether the total of twenty people surpass those are previous years but the data is showing us substantially large number the previous month this year so and and the bad thing is there's no treatment for it\nLong term outcomes or a crap shoot\nWhat happens is whenever they see is you know and we were talking about things like equal\nAnd simple lightest we're talking about all these other disorders that are certainly affect the brain in the nervous system disaffected nervous system especially the specifically the spinal cord\nNeurological conditions like you'd have a variety of causes such as viruses environmental toxins or genetic disorders among the case is under investigation\n\nAre basically there are five reported to the Maryland health officials in recent weeks that helps department spokesman said the Maryland's first case was reported September twenty first known cases have been reported Virginia or the district this year but there were three confirmed cases of Virginian twenty sixteen and that's what health department officials upset\nNow we know that medical science is continually making rapid advances we've got new medications treatments all these things are developed\nAnd they're introducing a rapid pace our water supply and demand I often come to play the possibility\n\nThat pharmaceutical companies can cut corners and they get very sloppy\n\nNow we're always assured that it might be a BA or buy health organizations that our system for screening\nUh is superior than most are are drug screening as superior than most are vaccine screenings are superior than most but now could be argued that I after Jay consequences they're not necessarily the fault of the doctor but it may just be the the benefactor of these medications\nOr whatever it is re introduced into the system we're looking at a toxic environment of drugs are toxic environment vaccines kids are reacting to him in various ways I don't think\nThe CDC or the FBI or anyone would come forward and say that perhaps a vaccine caused this\nOr some other drug I mean we know\nOur biological systems are constantly evolving\n\nAnd if we go by scientific hypothesis we also surmise that disease causing organisms are evolving too\n\nAnd so this raises a lot of questions and a lot of eyebrows about whether or not treatments in pills big kill the ills are killing the patient or in this case\nCourting and Tara viruses that cannot be all\n\nI mean like I you know we look at biological systems all biological systems ... disease causing organisms in\nAnd of course the victims of people they all they they evolve and they adapt sometimes they have all the dapper certain diseases don't bother them anymore they run its course it's kind of like a virus that runs its course it doesn't it go dormant for a while and then comes back with a vengeance but right now we need to start understanding the evolution of what is happening and how can make a big difference\nIn how we treat disease I mean the evolution of disease causing organisms out peace or ability to invent new treatments and it may even out peace or ability to ease pain and suffering\n\nAnd I can tell you that it it appears\n\nThe failures of the passive giving way to the most unexpected successes and some of those unexpected rises or rate raising a disease and biologically altered diseases as well\n\nNew problems of course in ... and this new paralyzing disease is harming our children and we know the accidents related to Karen medication in particular multiplied\nAnd we begin to worry about health care and health care professional we we hear about drug induced I after Jenike artifacts\nWe hear about adverse effects or even adverse drug events we hear about adverse effects from vaccines and the minute you bring this up somebody says I didn't know you were to anti actually start ridiculing you\n\nBut just think about all the accidents that all the mistakes that have been made\nWhen the pharmaceutical companies don't evolved with people and do devolved with the ... would be a diseases that are coming on board now either we can say that this is all being plan\n\nWe can say that it's all being done for the call the aspects and for the for the eliminating the flock but\n\nYou're not helpless to fight it you're not helpless to stop it you're not helpless to uh do do things to make yourself better\n\nAnd and so we have available many things that they can\nPut us uh in in a situation where we can\nOur immune systems we can build build all sorts of things that we just know the right things to eat the right things to do the right supplements to take the right drugs\nI mean I I worry now because uh I heard before\nWe were hearing about the the biological weapons we're hearing about the biological attacks we were hearing about\nMosquitoes actually infecting people and giving them you know equine except for white is or giving them some sort of ah eastern equine suffer widest or some other a disease that affects the\nSpinal cord with a brain or hemorrhaging or what have you and I don't think anybody is is pushing the pandemic button yet\n\nAlthough we are right now\nAt the doorstep of the new flu season and I would hate to think that the virus would attack a child\nAnd give them an insurer virus a polio and non polio internal virus to paralyze them\n\nAnd so a word of warning that it just seems to me the diseases are evolving\nNow whether we're giving them the point where whether or not we're giving them the push is another story whether or not environment is giving them to push is another story whether or not drugs or after genetic artifacts or

zero that it was called and I believe six seven three three seven hundred pharmaceutical companies are not keeping up with the evolution of diseases\nAnd they're not keeping up with pain and how pain

have created these new superbug superbug super diseases evolve into something else we have a respiratory viruses down turning into an ... virus\nWe have a flu virus that turns into a pneumonia that kills people\nOkay\nAnd so everyone working in the pharmaceutical industry cannot help but notice that it's undergoing a vigorous evolution we're going to an evolutionary period that only for help but for the pharmaceutical companies\nAnd much has been written about how you do pharmaceutical companies will need to change and how they are offering the public or ineffective drugs ineffective vaccines in effect the ineffective I\nAfter Jenike artifacts basically where the cure kills you know CBO affects instead of placebo which do see boats no benefit at all and show which is why I I think it's important we should talk about this\n\nWe should bring this up because I I think that a word of warning should go out\n\nAnd if you have you ever have you have a compromised immune system I Would say use your judgment and and and perhaps use your better judgment maybe get a flu vaccine I I'm not sure I don't think of flu vaccine is for everyone but after when I read about what happened last year and how people who've gotten the flu vaccine eventually\nHad floated evolved into something else\nI'd be really really really suspicious of this because you can't sue the pharmaceutical\nCompany Brock

we can also surmise that disease causing organisms are evolving too and this poses the question about whether or not treatments in pill to kill the ills originally are now killing you\nSlowly but surely he was like all biological systems so disease causing organisms admitted victims evolved it happens that's how it is and we noticed is with the uh the change in the flue\nLast year or the flu mutated into something you know like a pneumonia some ...\n\nAh\nWe look back at some of the medications that have been used by the public good lead to\nA lot of bad effects that Philip am I a situation a Nineteen sixties I Believe was one of the perfect examples of a sedative ... it was anti knowledge of medication medication pregnant women were taking in pregnant women who use the drug costs serious congenital Mao formations and their babies\nNow today they're still drugs that are on the shelves right now but when misused or when they're taken responsibly can cause accidents and you can get anything from the justice and tolerance to dying and that's why they call it I after ... artifacts\nAnd physical dependence can happen with the chronic use of any drug including many prescription drugs you would have taken his instructed physical dependence of itself is not constitute addiction but often accompanies addiction\nAnd it stinks in many people cannot or discern the distinction it's difficult to discern particularly prescribe pain medication switch the need for increasing do just dosages actually represents tolerance or worst being underlying problem as opposed to the beginning of abuse or addiction and I've always learned\nAs a general rule but if you're taking a pill to kill the pain you're dependent if you're taking a pill after pain is gone you're addicted\nBut if you're taking your bills was directed in the paper says your body has gotten used to them overtime or the worst case scenario would be that the drug companies are doing the equivalent of watering down the alcohol and I've always talked about that as well be advocacy\nOf of a pain medications I Believe the yo yo wing of the doping mean is what is causing the opioid crisis and so what we're getting is adverse effects for getting opposite expectations outcomes it becomes a no CBO effect\nSo called pandemic of opiate overuse may be seen as a as a no see ... ... know see what effect itself tonight and I'm going to be a spoiler 'cause I don't really give a damn about the TV show it's called ah the Connors\nAre used to be Roseanne on ABC Roseanne he said that in the show they were going to kill her off they were killing off the program a with an opioid overdose they did it they actually killed her off\nAn opioid overdose everybody said how does how do they know how do they know they're trying to cover up the fact that she's spoiled at for everybody weeks ago and I basically had said well if you're following the Roseanne program she was actually are in need of a knee surgery and the show\nOh has it she'd been taking pain pills from friends and others and having a stash around the house so it was a given\nThat they would kill her off by giving her an opioid overdose\nAnd see this is the thing that bothers me about the opioid the opioid problem in the opioid overdose in and out of the opioid overdose scares that they're giving everybody and that is if you are addicted or if you overdose on pain medications it's a moral failing\nPeople will have you believe it's a moral failing of propaganda will have you believe that you're ... you're an addict\nWhen you're not\nAnd so the killing off of Roseanne with an opioid overdose in my opinion is exactly what they were expecting is exactly what was going to happen\nAnd uh and that's why it was done so tonight I wanted to bring on a friend of mine who live out on the show we haven't had him on a long time\nBeen Fuchs and he's a registered pharmacist is really fishes and cosmetic chemist and has been\nCompounding custom medication formulating nutritional in skin care products from consulting with doctors and patients who graduated from UC University of Colorado School of pharmacy in Nineteen eighty six distributions recognizes nationally for his work on their promises nutritious hosted the bright side radio program been through talking to ground zero\nHey try to talk to you again love that doing this show because you are so darn television Clive thank you [laughter] I ...\nI really appreciate it and so so bad and I mean what is it with a propaganda but when the world today making people who are using pills for paying give it give making them a treating them like moral a pariah I that's what they did when Roseanne denied they actually killed her off the TV show\nOr said she had opioid addiction and she died of an opioid overdose ... why are they\nDoing lots of hers twenty six for you to answer a fool according to his father you know people are so silly ... it's just ridiculous how we have this idea\nThat uh we're okay to judge people or whatever their behaviors are OK to cap dispersion on others or whatever their behavior is back to\nThe human body is hardwired to be addicted\nTo substances as hard wired specially can be addictive substances that are already inherent in it and that's what opiates are they are analogs of bio chemicals that are already in your brain so when you take an oath to say that you have you have a pain problem and you take opiates an opiate tell\nWhat all immediately happen is your ... your brain will down regulate\nThe production of its own in dodging this opiates and you'll in Athens become decision by taking artificial opiates you'll end up being deficient which we'll put you in an deficits state and if there's a there's a pill that Iraq right here and be almost impossible to reason\nNow I Know that I Know that we have a a sort of a a psycho social context surrounding the patient Dr relationship the patient farmers ... pharmacist relationship\nBut yeah I I think people tend to ignore the fact that you know right now if you're using opiates you you become pretty much a ... you become a dark and NPR why we're what's that\nYou're award you're awarded the state yeah you belong to say you belong to the medical model and that and they love that yeah well now what are you gonna do you're hooked on August ... you have to go to the doctor you have to go to the pharmacist even if it even if it means Dr Varmus the shopping\nYou ... you're compelled to become a to be a part of the model of the paradigm once you get on and said that once you get on the drug ... shut illegal drugs then by the way that people get that's how dealers and and a drug drug dealers gets you hooked on heroin\nWell and that's the truth out you know one of the thing I did a show one time about crocodile\nAnd it was interesting because uh I was talking about he was cheap heroin and that many people that look very attracted to use this cheap heroin and uh I was saying you know be aware of crooked deal because your kids may be using it and blah blah blah blah blah and boy did I have an education\nI had people calling me all over the country in their sixties and seventies saying to me that they\nWere addicted to heroin and that they are they're the ones that ... that the main worry about that the that uh they said you should be worried about grandma and grandpa\nOr have gotten their pain pills taken away from them\nAnd they have to resort to using heroin or they have to get heroin and they get like a really low dose of heroin but if they can make cheap crooked deal in their kitchen it'd be more than happy to do that get rid of their pain and the stories I heard were heartbreaking stories of like a guy called me and said I was in a motorcycle crash\nAnd I was in a lot of pain and the doctors gave me my medication and one day they just decided we weren't gonna give it to me anymore\nAnd so I had to use heroin\nAnd I'm going wow you know and and I I never thought because I always thought you know be where the kids taking drugs but no be where grandma and grandpa who aren't getting their pain medications but you but doctors don't know how to treat the pain\nIt's a terrible situation after a terrible situation they as you our talking before a lot of it is based on the fact that we've created a society and we've created a culture that is conducive not not the physical damage the psychic pain to to ... pain and guess what opiates work on that too\nYou know you just work on physical pain they work on a spiritual pain on Hanks\nAnd now I ... I Believe as a pharmacist that this is a really big part of our our our addiction addiction problem is we are in pain we are such as somehow not created a culture that Roy Moore is its citizens for being alive or just citizens are participating in society we live in a sick\nAnd dysfunctional culture and our our emissions or just a symptom of it\nSo it it is is that there's something missing but doesn't that doesn't give us a I I like to use this raid the doping means squirt if you will\nI caught reward Delaney square is what when you hit it tells me your brain does yes he like you won the lottery it activates the reward center in the brain and we are inherently designed by a chemically by our maker she had this this yet the feeling whatever we want to attack\nWe get this ... feeling when we reach for the door knob and open the door or you get a little hit a don't I mean so we we have lots of things that we're supposed to be a ... a lot of ways and we're supposed to be able to access the doping means square as you say but we've created a culture\nThat that drives it's a it's a habit in members the members of the society to live in the early yeah let her [noise] so they have ...\nBeds trauma they they they induced the right amount of trauma for the right amount of time and people need to find\nThat holds missing in their heart and their souls or like you say we were talking earlier about X. essential pain [noise] this is something very real and something that I think everybody should be listening to tonight just to let you know the Connors airs tonight on ABC have used to be the Roseanne show and is Roseanne and predicted that killed her off for using an opioid overdose\nNews radio I'm Brian shook the top us diplomat believes the Saudi king and crown

Spanish civil war maybe after the stash American War\nOf ... up but there are a lot of Mexican starting to come over here at the in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana detain identified with Mexican immigrants and this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and uh\nUh the government got his great idea to uh to uh to prohibit marijuana wall with alcohol nobody really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made a name\nTo create in the campaign around reefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny at the time called re from Madison talks about all the stuff\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana tax act which I don't know if you heard of that a marijuana tax act or ... you put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana\nAnd they put a tax on marijuana and they didn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually are completely ... or ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana illegal and it's been illegal ever said but the fact of the matter is is that\nPeople have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our ... our jail are still\nWith people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we've created as police that a police state around the around people are just surround people who simply want to get high whether it's through\nA marijuana or ... or even with opiate why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol but we know that marijuana ... I'll tell\nYou this is the thing that uh you know and and for me I guess it sets be apart from a lot of talk show hosts are mostly on conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where\nOf course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd uh when I did and it was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi couple of times they never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I don't think it's good for my body to do this\nThen I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer it became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with the law did every day the feeling of a a foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you try something and I looked as though no no no I Can't do this\nAnd he says what's wrong he says I said I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to and he said no give it a try a says I'm a uses and and and he was a guy that it was just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try Canada's and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know some idiot ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about\nUh things like a candidate is that they ah let them use CBD Oil Somalia does it as an ointment on their joints and ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given it to end brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a ... a a a a an an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs to this country as such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world they they treat or this type of a crisis not with jail time and and punishment\nThey they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest or\nThey put them in the hospital and they have to be treated\nAnd and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and ah and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not feeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help and\nThey are in need of a ... they are in need of medical care\nAnd I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments and I think that the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack\nOr uh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people\nPut them in facilities and have him is not going as criminals and be trained has got to be put into the position of criminals there actually put into hospitals were they were under a medical arrest that would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people who have gone through this because\nThe problem is bad and you can agree with me I Know that doctors do not know how to actually get rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said at the beginning\nIt evolves over time and you even brought up existential paying you brought up deep pain inside the body that is not pain but it's felt physically but it's pain that it's spelled on a on a I guess you could call it on a conscious level or or your consciousness is in pain or wracked with pain\nExplained al ... does work on that kind of hey they do yes absolutely that's why people do it I mean I I don't I Can't speak from personal experience but I Know that people I've spoken to many people who say that they like\nThings like ... and uh I don't know if you've heard of that is a similar to opiate similar to an opiate or or biking down or Percocet\nBecause it makes them they say it makes them feel good\nAnd what they really mean is it ... it makes them it takes them out of their painter the pain of existence you know we we live our lives as as thorough set and most people live their life was quite a sense of quiet desperation ... and like we get beaten down over time\nAnd that creates this sense of I don't want to be alive basically ... you know what I mean one of the scariest\nThings one of the scariest things about opiates and I'll tell you this this was a scary for me I remember when I had my first cancer surgery and uh I was given a pain mad I don't remember what it was I was in the hospital and all of a sudden I felt balance I felt no pain and I felt great because you know after you're dealing with the initial pain and you're feeling was stitches and you're\nAnd this is my got here and it's been caught you know you can't move because it you know you your core has been cut and you can't move and it was really weird it was a weird experience to have something that takes the pain completely away and you feel balanced and that's exactly how I felt when I needed the pain medication or to get rid of my pain\nAnd see that's the thing is it's the idea of the balance said times feeling that balance when the pain will not go away and you have that balance of\nOf calm when you have that moment where the ... the the warmth Russia's over you and the pan is gone but like I said before there's dependence where you take that pain away because you're dependent on appeal to take the pain away and then when the pain is gone and you still take the pill that's when you realize maybe I'm addicted or maybe I have an addiction to the smell\nDoes your bike down regulate that some natural production\nSo all of a sudden you're just ... you're out like you say you're out of balance what's really interesting to me why and how much of the stuff that we talk about sex or central pain for example could be related to things like in information inside the body from too much sugar Yeah Yup\nOr or at least some of the nation say maybe we're not getting enough I think we know you take out of the diet completely one of the things that happened to get anxious to get depressed so maybe there's people are suffering from\nFrom the conditions they never teaches the stuff they they they gave us the food pyramid but they never say hey you know what if you're living in sugar from your diet side of information is going to go away just like that you lose weight you're going to feel better about yourself and that's how it's going to happen\nBut we live in an empire to cry when the empire depends on on eating sugar and eating grains and eating fast food and eating and eating and eating
