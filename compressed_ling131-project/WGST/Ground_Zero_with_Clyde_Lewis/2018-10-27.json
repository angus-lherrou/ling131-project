possible and throughout time\nMany people have claimed to speak to those who have shaken this mortal coil I experienced CSI BP I'd I'd been in you know goes and goes on it but I've been on goes done subjects Thursday BP I felt what\nI'd do it to me\nSeems like it attack bite into the um so uh I was on a year when it happened and um it was terrifying and I I always tell a story that when I was there and it was all going down\nUm\nI'd go a little sick to my stomach because it was like I don't know if something was somebody's surrounding me and I could not break away from it and I started crying\nI was on the air when it happened\nBut I always tell people the reason why I was crying was not because of the fact I was scared I mean I knew that something was going on and it was like who was uncomfortable with the thought of not being able to say goodbye to your wife\nIs that was in California and I was on the air and uh just the thought of not being able to see my wife\nAnd if it was going to be the end of me I I just thought it would be so devastating that um\nYou don't get a chance to say goodbye to both my mother and my father\n\nMy mother and her own little way had a chance to say goodbye to me before she passed away and my father said goodbye to me twenty minutes before he passed away\nOn the phone\nHe was in good spirits that just that he was told that he'd have to have\nUm is to remove it into two was going to be removed he died and he didn't want to be resuscitated\nAnd so he passed away and uh you know a lot of people have had those moments where\nAfter a loved one has passed away they have contacts somehow in a dream or they seem in a crowd or\nSome even have claimed to you know gotten a phone call and a lot of people of course you know\nThey say hey you know this happens but I never got maybe it's because I got the good buys from my my parents before they passed that some people aren't that lucky they don't have the goodbyes and so sometimes I'm sure\nAnd they say sixty percent of the time this happens is that most people you know come in contact with a dead loved one within days after they pass away they come to him in a dream or they appear to them in a room where you see them in a crowd or you know something indicates that there with you that their presence was there\nAnd\nYou know a lot of people say well there are new such things as goes well I I Would I Would beg to differ there's something about\nThe other side there's something about the spirit realm it's it's fascinating I mean go shores spirit and demonic communication they show up often in classic literature including mythology there in the Bible um I remember Shakespeare utilize go a lot in his place\nAnd you all it back to a going back to a Victorian England and it was fashionable then in many circles to conduct stances\n'em and they had ... boards back then I mean you go all the way back then they had something similar to ... three legged tables candles\nA table tapping all those things\nThey were used to try and contact the dead Edison actually Thomas Edison created a um he's tried to create and make it as we could use ... contact the dad and what happened was instead of contacting the daddy he created somebody can record the debt\n\nAnd what I mean by that is that we listen to a Jim Morrison album we know he's dead but we can still hear his voice Patsy Cline like a ghost us into her on a record and she's singing crazy\nIt's like you're listening to a ghost mean prince Michael Jackson are both gone but yeah we're hearing them on records it like goes\nGoes on phonograph dose\nRecorded for posterity somebody with Edison had done rather than communicating with that we are able to keep the dead in a bottle we can play them listen to them or talk to them in that way\n\nAnd then of course there are those who say that they preserved a lot of what the dead thing because a lot of what the dead possessed by writing pages and pages\nOf what could be called automatic writing I mean the psych exchange allegedly guide that goes to the can babies link be handwritten messages and sit since that time since the time of all the\nYou know the communications you know go seem to have lost their will or ability to writer even communicate effectively now so we have to use electronic voice for not we have ... electronic voices and so the spirits can be channeled through mediums or they can be channeled through electronic means that can come through your computer or your phone and it was had this experience because we've done these shows about this before\n\nBut see a lot of the time when you're dealing with the spirit will you get this big nebulous information and always leads to\nInterpret it moment where the so called experience or the medium or whatever is given a word or a science which is knocking or tapping that indicate that something from\nThe serial round\nIs to make some sort of contact now horror films

few occasions you visited as he was never allowed to be alone with me Bob contended to certain family members\nHe was a serial killer who traveled the country in a station wagon satisfying his blood blood in random lovers lane murders he claimed he did this for almost Thirty years boarding justice by checking himself into various mental institutions for time he was allegedly a suspect in the series of murders in Texarkana, Texas and later in the Pacific northwest in suburban Philadelphia\nBend according to family history has said in your field brain injury and they had on traffic illusion

and the future maybe six seven says it the more I think about it it was more times but he was he had a very um scary quality and then [noise]\nI guess the thing that really he would he was a a always

I'm just an average person\nBut I had some celebrities talking and they wanted the board and one lady who who son committed suicide had the board and she 'cause rigidity the board was just\nThe same image but I put it on would ... with ... you know what I made a color copy ... [noise] and\nSo I Would in a lot of people in Los Angeles you stick and one very famous actress and his son had killed himself and she reached out to us meaning me and my friend\nAnd I sent the board and she said she had spoken to him repeatedly and thanked me and she's a very famous ... now a convention or if you if\nYou don't you go ahead and it was [noise] was she was from the tick Van Dyke show Mary Tyler Moore and she was very sweet very kind Rosemarie no she was Mary Tyler Moore\nOh Mary Tyler Moore was on the Dick Van Dyke\nShattered shows that are on shows weren't time and more\nNow but she was very she was searching for ways to communicate\nAnd just understand so it it's it's so in other words what I'm saying is this ... not just evil if you can deport all is it you know to channel what you want I think\nBob [noise] was naive and he put he put this together to talk to victims and then you realize\nThey're gonna come they come back\nAnd haunted him and he kept on driving around at one point in my grandfather he was it was in one day and then a month later there was another town another town and then it caught up ten minutes [laughter] um I think that's why he just and he killed himself he drowned himself\nAnd his body was never found\nNo but he turned my he sent my grandfather a note I saw the note and it was type because he never would write and free hand\nBob number ... down and he would type it or you ... what did he say where we go out towards the letter\nHe said that he can't take it anymore because of the the the stress disease being haunted he says he made a mistake but making the board\nAnd people were haunted him that he has hurt and then he he went into a New Jersey beach town and walked into the water he said he was going to do it anyway and the letter and no one ever saw him again so my\nGrandfather who was a much healthier a man like a stable man and he loved he loved Bob froze fault and he said that\nAnd sent it to 'em they'll set of copy that letter to the to the Boston Globe so it was published on but also the president sent a letter back and he wrote back and basically thank them for the which board and he said it was you know really made it was it was made out of great ingenuity\nBut he says that he will hardly think I shall meet the test is power disclosed the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of do the talking board into this into the community of the spiritual Smith meant and also it's in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the we used to board that we know today got its start in Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point\nSo there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada Watson writes from us the United states to sell their own version of the leader board and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two and the rest is history and so bored such as Bob sports which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the wage what makes it a prominent splash into the market I mean everybody was buying them and use them at the heyday I mean this this has been a spiritual smoother it's going\nTo take time and I was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of their own type a board and of course we as a trademark tens of the name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a a suspect in serial killer or making aboard a basically a feeling it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he\nWould feel right about himself or what have you have a special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique\nStories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do make their own and start customized and selling them um but the degree of this type of story no I've never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one\nOr they see an opportunity to make money there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case I'm In it I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if you did you'd be checked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know\nThat's that's the that's the thing it'd be avoided a any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution I mean and and since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any in any of this information to the authorities and if so do they take it seriously\n[noise] well it's just kind of awkward 'cause I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on just putting the color a Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy\nUsed to work for ... which is an old TV show or on the which has only channel five or something right in the east and um he was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked I hate to like show he could like producing I think ...\nUh current affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guy that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level like the same image to same exact\nYou know but then they took it and they just put her on more quality thing with boxes and everything\nYou know in the in the background to write the background history\nYes and they told them everything you know and they put it down but they made it more like a sophisticated I guess but I'm the same story and it's a very good I tell people you know\nAbout to die made them put on the heavy under Eighteen years old because this is real this is really happened this really works\nAnd it's very scary and if if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody it we call go to the same place at the end but some bad people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to some of them back\nSo I always say that a shot a joke\n... no I don't want to ask here and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use aboard a long time let's be honest I used to board a gosh I Can't count back\nBut I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they used it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use them but you know boards rudimentary like that even even when you see the TV show stranger things you've kind of a a mix should board and Christmas tree lights\nSo that her little boy you could go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really don't need boards do we care and I mean even the boards of bear a you couldn't channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves support just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard into being able to to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own\nSix cents ... he started developing really started really being fined tune and taken aboard a way I can still do this work and pay a lot of people use and the old days they used typewriters [laughter] word processors now that you've computer keyboards and they've channel that way it's what I find that the board with people if the tactile
