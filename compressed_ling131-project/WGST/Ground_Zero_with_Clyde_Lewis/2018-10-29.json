[noise]\nAtlanta jingle long twenty eighth presented by capital what happened on December fourteen and a former rehash dying John\nOn right now [laughter] get yours and be more to the Atlantic single on twenty eight presented by Capitol line [noise]\nPlease remember that America is the most uh\nPro Israel less ah anti Semitic country on the face of the earth Jews have done magnificently here because of family and faith in academics and hard work the\nIsraeli ambassador to America said that this afternoon on CNN is the best place for you to be in anywhere in the world and so what happened to them yesterday morning cuts the soul of every Jewish American my boss is a Jewish carpenter an amount of what happens in political discourse in America that brings violence\nAnd the American media depressed CNN and their allies always lecture Trump Republicans and conservatives about our anger our rhetoric in our violence but when progressive explode\nWhich happens on a regular basis\nLike stabbing Republicans setting a trucks on fire that say I support Trump\nSending a share is sending a rice and in the mail to numerous Republicans including Senator Susan Collins or the children to the president whenever that goes on at no point or progressive ever lectured\nBy the press somehow it's twisted in turned into Trump Republicans conservatism\nEven when the president is the only one in American history to have Jewish grandchildren and even though the murder in Pittsburgh had postings saying how much he hated Trump\nBecause Trump aide Jewish grandchildren and Trump supported Israel somehow CNN is still twisted this thing and if something's wrong with Trump\nNever mentioned in the hatred the radicalism of the left which\nExceeds what happens on the right the whole first in Baltimore all of the race writes the shooting a cops in Dallas in Baton Rouge all came from black lives matter from the left never any connections river may between the cop killers in Dallas during a rally\nA black lives matter and then meeting in the White House with those same leadership of black lives matter saying what a great job they're doing and civil rights by the president Brock Hussein Obama\nAnd the media never said well wait a minute Mr Mr President how do you meet with the leaders of a group advocating the killing of cops what are we went dead cops when you want them now pegs in a blanket from like bacon there's never a connection made it doesn't exist\nBut Republicans and Trump are lectured constantly whenever violence takes place it's always Trump's fault Trump's rhetoric Trump's tweets the Republican Party conservatism one where Republicans speak up have you heard about the guy from Utah\nWho sent rice in to the president to kill him\n... have you heard about the white powder the rice and attack\nOn the home of Senator Susan Collins by a left this after she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh nor all the attacks on Trump's children\nHow big of a story would it have been if Republicans had attacked the children up or Iraq Hussein Obama oh my oh my lord ... the world would end as we know it\nThe puck receives too much for me to take\nLet's continue thousands on old millions millions are listening let's go to chat and the great state of Indiana chat and Indiana welcome to the bill cutting it\nShow Chad go ahead and all of it under the shooting and yes I Know they're winning five to one in the eighth\nGood good for the state I don't ... make America great again every day\nWhat are the broad you're going to win and beat Donnelly in Indiana\nI don't know\nRight now the polling as as the Republican up by about three points if Joe Donnelly can one in Indiana that were remind me in twenty away when you and Indiana voted for Brock Hussein Obama\nI didn't vote for him it's unbelievable yeah I can you tell me one thing I didn't vote for him give me an accomplishment and objective accomplishment abroad Hussein Obama give me one mate what is it Obamacare which has gone\nAttack on Israel the fact that old up next door on the fact that they allowed ISIS to proliferate the fact that North Korea sent missiles over Japan I mean give me something Obama did that has stuck anything\nOut by the about about a ban on the Trump ban on there like they do\nWell and and I got him running around but Louis Farrakhan who said ...\nThat is that the Trump\nWhite House not possible how yeah I'm looking at a\nTweeter sent out by Sarah Sanders the scent this evening quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post will not exploit to attack President Trump the evil lack of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is such an unapologetic defender\nOf the Jewish community and the state of Israel and so you're a Washington Post ... there's a headline on Saturday that said bombs suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo you get your Trump inspiring bombings and Trump been directly involved in killing Jews and the water and bow supposedly is object of\nAll it's unbelievable yeah\nAre we going to run thanks for your call us continuing and if you're in Indiana oh I Know in Ohio many other states Nevada especially ... were important but when it comes to the mid term elections we've got to do what's right\nConstantly refers to the president has a Nazi or or or or Hitler that's why the guy in Utah sent rice and to try to kill him because I have the media to pick some\nGot the\nWhy isn't that why is not a bad thing I mean to me that's awful and when you have white powder scent to Trump's children and the Senator Susan Collins then mobs chase out US Senators restaurants and chase them in elevators and chase them down airports\nAnd CNN will not allow the N. word the mob or being used and CNN had a reporter with the caravan the mobs coming up from from uh from Honduras and they polled all that because it was so good for the Republicans even though factually it's going on they did not want reporting on that\nAll day on TALK about that now\nNo because it's good for Trump there in the business of electing isn't that sad when major news organizations or in the business of electing Democrats\nYeah they are well my dad died about ... years ago it said Democrats are liars and cheater that's all they are\nWell you know you know Danny I I Want an objective media that calls balls and strikes right down the middle let's continue now with Andy in Idaho not too many calls I get from Idaho which has got to be God's contrast said to my wife before I die I Want to fly to Denver rented camper and go to Montana\nIdaho north and South Dakota Andy in Idaho welcome to the bill Cunningham show Andy how are you\nInto the good question [noise] counters clean and for those who\nDo claiming a seafood and get them to do the the three are mandated [laughter]\n... yeah ... character inciting hatred and try to do this course number of other things are true oh\nWell you know any of the FCC doesn't control cable news because it's not broadcast over the air but the FCC does control CBS NBC ABC or talk radio et cetera\nBut Andy ultimately we get the government we deserve and if more you know fewer and fewer people are watching CNN all the time you cannot watch Chris Cuomo or Don Lemon on a regular basis without suffering some sort of project vomiting or explosive diarrhea\nEspecially Don Lemon it's impossible to watch it\nAnd the ratings if you take on any particular night Fox News has more than twice the rating of CNN and MSNBC put together\nAnd there's a reason because we're voting more or less with our eyes to watch and we want to watch\nBut you can't watch it all it would drive me crazy I Won objectivity have you heard the word I just recently I mean tonight sixty minutes did a story and which ISIS has been killed by a the Trump military Trump said to the military go get him\nAnd ice has used to be a big deal under Obama how big a deal is it now and ...\nYou know doesn't exist but I\nThink that uh [noise] something should be true it is to see or some other regulatory\nSomething more you know any ultimately it's going to be up to us we get the government we deserve\nAnd if we don't act to the next uh nine days you're going to have a Maxine Waters and Jerry Nadler and Nancy Pelosi in standing ... and others in charge of half of the Congress and they're not going to legislate\nThey're going to litigate and they're going to investigate and we're not going to recognize what happens to the last two years the Trump presidency in fact a couple of months ago\nOr Jonathan Turley who's a pretty good guy law professor from George Washington said the first two years of the Trump Administration will be the peaceful two years\nAgo they said the last two years are going to be a disaster\nLet's continue now with ah Joel enough for junior\nVirginia Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joel how are ya\nI can even bill currently for taking my call myself a halfway you'll have some friends that called me earlier today from before and they talk about this to kill them who's running as the Democratic candidate\nFor governor you know that what they're telling me is that tape and\nI don't know a lot of commercials and the state of Florida and which to have and also they've been having rallies and which both Al Sharpton who you spoke of earlier\nAs well as Iraq or I'm a Maxine Waters and others have been in the state of Florida campaigning and they have been coming up in reference to an indictment\nEmbalming this to kill him and everything that comes up he keeps coming up with the race card I'm Wondering what your thoughts are in reference to the Florida writes\nAndrew Gillum as a socialist his background is similar to the Democratic candidate in Arizona Andrew Gillum believes in the most left wing radical viewpoint of the police department\nAndrew Gillum is set in the past the guy who would be the governor of Florida that the police departments are like occupying forces that began as slaves catchers it's the most radical governor Florida whatever have now they're saying this is not the most uh\nIs that the most exciting character I Know but at least he's not Andrew Gillum and at least she wouldn't go to the same route of the Bernie Sanders Maxine Waters type and he would take over Florida government\nIn cash straight the police departments you've numerous police departments and Florida that have said they cannot support this guy because of his beliefs about the police you can't support him if he Andrew Gillum wins in Florida I I Would be shocked\nBy the people that are called me up his ticket when I was waiting for the people that were written up and move out of their fate because from what they're telling me parents couldn't come back\nAround ... are they going to come back at all or wherever it may be probably be doubled the corny at fame and apparently that's also come out in literature so it looks like he got her name is ... ... or\nYou know Joel I'm a great supporter of police and whenever a cop has killed I always mention their names there are many cop killers are who have not been identified yet and the cops are dead when you have\nThe chief executive officer of the great state of Florida who is made numerous remarks about cops being similar to slave catchers that cops are occupying forces\nYou can't have someone like that in charge of police departments he's the chief executive officer\nOf the greatest great state of Florida and honesty you can't have it so

T. [noise]\n\nOnly counting of us continue with the tragedy the tragedies is weak and the one that happen\nOn Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas rescue and former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about the situation is rather attempted mass murder\nOr whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this uh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy\nThe uh NBC News this morning head on a neighbor lived next door to him a heavy set a woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that the same Thomas rescue and former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas raskin welcome again in the bill Cunningham shown Thomas our you\nHey oh goody very tough situation awful um well when I watch\nSome of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd I hid menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties he had posted online for quite a while and I submitted ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president\nBecause he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish and ah he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless\nUh the media is pointing out some how Trump's responsible the Washington Post\nAh yesterday afternoon and today did ugly reporting\nSaying that ah that in fact Sarah Sanders put out something a few hours ago just said is there any tragedy the Washington Post were not exploit\nTo attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such an on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective some have said or the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying to Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather ratio anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like every day who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI have seen\nIs you know there's always twenty twenty especially in the law enforcement or the investigative world what I Can't believe [laughter] no one else was honoring his tweets social media is other things he was hosting couldn't have alerted only\nWent one way you know when you say is a few things\nSee something [laughter] you know someone had this scene right\nI could've alerted the police on the police when you find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about ... hours and do something or in a while to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him [laughter] and we can criticize the police but until that time\nPolice and law enforcement agencies in the intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth\nTo be able to travel every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting and Broward County there was a woman or call FBI numerous people and call it about the Eighteen year old a punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school and even no call in or the FBI people called in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection\nThere's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nNo production on horse you're only as good as yesterday and was on course very easy to do after seeing a law enforcement is fun so [laughter] I Know from my experience with the white TV\nWe always look back we always get a review of what happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with this case the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back and figure out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a barrel said a postage just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media\nSomebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating and I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there are several thousand individual sadly in the country like ours\nWaiting for a trigger moment that social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate\nBefore social media ten twelve years ago\nYou sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\n... other like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against uh against Jews and against African Americans there were several hundreds of did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media done well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd
