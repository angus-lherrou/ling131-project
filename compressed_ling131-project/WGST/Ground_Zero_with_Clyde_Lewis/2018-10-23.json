floating chicken with his head chopped off\nOkay it's strange it was it was his pinky shred\nIt was an entity with a body like a slump brushed it into ... chicken ... and they called the Hitler's chicken monster this is true it would be my I got the science clippings they I mean scientists that ... if it's all you know\nTrue science because you have to look into true scientists ... so I saw this thing I'm thinking there's gotta be CGI it's gotta be crazy right but you know [laughter]\nI spent\nI spent the whole afternoon literally\nReading about the head ... chicken monster\nYou're probably laughing but it's true headless chicken and you know ... chicken those who have listened to my show\nKnow about the famous ... if I can find it I'll play it they know about the famous chicken rent okay aides say well known story it's a legendary ground zero story about how I went to a Halloween party\nAnd I came back just to be tipsy went on the air it's first time I've ever done that but I don't go on the air and\nDrunk or you know high or anything but I went on the air this is when I was local and I was feeling a little pits you went to a great party in the afternoon or good afternoon parties thought I'd be okay\nCame on the air and I just started you know talking shooting from the hip shooting from the hip I started getting to how terrified I was of chickens okay and the reason why I'm terrified of chickens is because when I was a kid\nI once tried to sneak in my backyard from a field okay and there was the barbed wire fences next door to this this family we because we lived out in this rural area called mid veiled Utah\nAnd next door to us was this a Mexican family I mean they were they spoke Spanish they just beginning which kept the kids spoke English but uh just barely and uh I used to have this could mean junior but he was really Jose and he spoke English ... broken English but I decided\nTo sneak home from school go through the field crawl through the barbed wire\nBarb wire fence to keep the roosters and the chickens from getting I crawled into the barbed wire fence got attacked by the head rooster just poking my face if you've been talking me and it was a bleeding I'm getting attacked as like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's the birds right but it's chickens\nChickens most or just attacking me right and just talking at my face\nIran to my mom I ran to my dad and bleeding\nAnd so my dad goes over\nThe course the old man's over there man he's drunk ... drunk and my dad says you're rooster my son in law is new and so I guess Miguel who is one of the older\nKids\nSodomy bleeding and he said that's it so he went and he got himself a rake and he went any chased after the rooster what the raking finally hit it and there'd been goes\nAnd it just stops so he grabs a knife and he grabs the Nick of the chicken and he goes ... head off the chicken right and then began\nBrewster comes after me [laughter] you know you're a little kid right things coming out you where do we do with it [laughter]\nChopped off any bad enough Jose thought it was funny he went he grabbed the chicken ... the chickens foot and he found the nerve on the end of the chickens to pull on it and the chickens\nChickens handle it would do it class you know it cost ... terrifying as a kid right terrified\nBy one had experience with ... we went to a place called we were farm would go visit my folks at Christmas Time I told them it was a Thanksgiving when you go totally up and say we can get a ... a a nice uh uh you know pumpkin pie good wheeler farm hang out go see the animals there were courses or anything and so they weren't chickens\nAnd certainly I'm just like what four or five years old six years old at the time any big oh chicken or the rooster chase after it but he's scared of the ... and I said you know what\nYou like me you're just like me man we have problems with chicken so we're we're going to do is we're going to go to KFC [laughter] and get some chicken even told me he has his great idea for a horror film with chickens so he and I both bad we we've had our experience with chickens but seeing this\nHorrible\nBreasted compensated chicken swimming through the ... I spent the whole afternoon just looking\nFor information on this creature because how terrified I Am of chickens and I was thinking of this creature was from my nightmares materialize in the real world and after a whole afternoon of obsession I found out the creature how to name it was a real thing it wasn't some you know optical illusion CGI it's called\n... ... ...\nAnd ... states things

contributions to marine sciences so they're really fascinated by the sea cucumber gave me the creeps we're always we're really weird\nIs that uh it got me thinking about second genesis and what second genesis is is well scientists have shed some have suggested\nThat there is there was a a there is a world where was the second genesis that took place in the beginning in the beginning God created having the year it got also created and heaven and have been and heaven and heaven and earth and earth and earth an earth meaning there were several genesis\nOr beginnings several different ones ah where\nThere's a fifty percent chance of other life forms which opposed the norm and they do exist and sometimes they show up and when they show up we don't know what you call the window to do with him and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster I'm not going to any of those things I'm Talking about things that you know you look at them and you get a second look\nLike this chicken that swim so it's a chicken feed this set chicken monster\nType creature that I added my uh uh I have in my article today a\nBut when you look at the multiplicity of creation and you're looking at\nHow the diversity of multi versus unseen in the multiplicity being chips would call that the underworld creatures from the underworld they'll come up from nowhere like the Demi Moore gun from you know stranger things or you know I don't know anything that extreme but still I mean stranger things called the upside down we called the best\nUh the timeline of\nCreation and the ... we here too are the ones that have been handed down through millennia and each one is unique it's interpretation or the concepts pretty much\nAre the same wherever you look so scientists are speculating signs are speculating that strange organisms that might be alien in nature exist on the planet\nAnd ... there isn't\nA very far jumped to suggest that stranger life exist on the planet that well you've never seen before\nAnd that\nYou were to blow up in the shadow biosphere who lurks every month strained by opening that no one even wants to see or or take on or have contact with there was another creature that I saw they somebody was kind enough to actually send me a picture of this thing it's called the penguin\nI don't know if you've ever seen a pang Gulen but uh I saw\nA pang Gulen today for the first time I've never heard of a penguin in my life it looks like a mini Godzilla with armor looked like something from a Japanese horror film tiny thing it looks like a cross between ... and eat or an armadillo\nAnd uh so it's as well bring up the ... will apply to push the ... isn't terrifying but I I think the penguin it's cute but it's also scary looking because I have this armor all over its body and it kind of like conscious over like God village looks like a good pick out a\nA you know it it was big enough you could take out Tokyo and that's how weird it's CBGB's ... we're creatures that nobody had seen before or they've seen them or they\nCan identify but didn't know what they are and this is what I mean by second genesis these are things that you know you've heard of unicorns yeah right well you know this is a lot different than my I think it's different in that okay you\nKnow and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster this is beyond my band is beyond the plot would monster these are things that you see it\nYou know like going what the hell is this and it's something that's never been seen on in search of someone's never been talked about on coast to coast am not saying that uh you know I've talked about really ... and I know about that I've seen and you know that ... this reminds me of the myths\nGave the movie the Mets remember the ...\nIt was a it was a ... veil and it was also a a movie okay and the idea that\nYou know there are some quantum joke\nScience can beat us with dimensional theories that point to the possibility\nThat there are areas of planet wear the veil is thinner or\nThere's some extra dimensional vortex where a second genesis occurred parallel to our own and their locations throughout the planet which suggested to be the most powerful due to their position to be the appropriate ritual perform there by the writer fish it could actually be a cleansing moment for the planet\nIt could open the best new creatures could come out and take off I mean we're being warned\nThat there are wormholes reporter was that could be open through ritual or through the auspices of super collider is like CERN and those real into these can pass through and hot mankind and change the direction of the future\nAnd as I said you know the mist they had a project they're like ... it was called arrowhead arrowhead project and the whole catalyst for the story was a dimensional breach\nProject arrowhead actually creates this myth and rain and enveloped the small town and during the night large insect like creatures are seen and Tara doctor like creatures attack livestock and small pets eventually these creatures attack humans as well\nThose horrifying creatures from the film we're known as the great with ours\nAnd they can only be described as deadly spider like predators each about the size of a small dog\nIn these creatures produce corrosive Web strands which burn through materials like coughing flesh and both the book in the film great widower is simply killed their prey would they're acidic Web strands put it in the film\nThey also have the ability to capture and like hundreds of eggs in a living human host\nThe eggs say goodbye the data hatch and they multiplied quickly now the looks of these creatures were terrifying and there were even some\nThat were the size of a human being Ruben ... remember the there was a show called mimic I didn't know that they'll Toro did the show mimic is one of my favorite scary movies because of the fact that this is Roach or whatever it is\nGets to be the size of the human and you get to see it looks like a man in black standing there in the subway but it's not it's a big mop like creature scary looking creature seat when you're looking at these creatures in the midst are you looking in in in\nThe movie like mimic these creatures or turn up by the end and and you know if they're the size of a human being even worse than it was explained by the producers okay other movie\nAnd then they said we based many of the creatures\nOn supposed second genesis creatures that were proposed by side\nThey were based on real animals but from an alien ecology admittedly dangerous wild animals promote more brutal ecosystem that we are not familiar with but still basically just animals made of flesh and blood nothing supernatural about them okay but they are from\nA second genesis ecosystem\nThe brutal ecosystem is the same ecosystem that the scientists at CERN and when the guy by the majority rows\nHave talked about\nWith regard to opening dimensions and allowing these vile creatures in for study journey rose is a co founder and chief technology officer of the wave\nWhich is a Canadian company sewing machines that he claims exploit quantum mechanical effects to solve certain problems hundreds of millions of times faster than traditional computers\nAnd rose is also the c._e._o. of kindred systems or kindred AI which is to sell the start up you've gotta with others that was back in twenty fourteen and he dedicated\nWhole company to delivering advanced tell operated autonomous robots but\nHis goal is within the way of quantum computers he wants to summon a tsunami of demons or aliens or whatever they are the equivalent he says to the old ones spoken of\nBy horror Arthur H. P. love craft show the concept of opening the dimensions for some love crafty and like creatures become through\nSounds very much like he wants to open the realms of where the second genesis to place and and\nI mean I played the the the Ted talked before we talks about this I don't know if it's for air because I think he swears in it\nBut he says something to eat like he says well when I'm going to tell you is is that we have the power that we're going to bring things over but they're not going to be like us\nHe says alien you know or you know different the the things that we're building are not going to be people they might be really smart they might be really good at all sorts of things but they're not going to be like us they're gonna be aliens they're gonna be I'm Sorry to say way smarter\nThan every single person in this room in ways that we can't even comprehend so this of course triggers a lot of a worm with people right I mean\nYou must says you know if you're playing with AI you're opening up these dimensions you're unleashing the demon the little guy with a ... you're going to have to throw your holy water on it you're going to have to wave at it and say by God it's
