twenty twenty that's a lot\nThat's a that's a lot of sensors to putting by by who we think two years or even less than two years\nSo how do they how do they fix that problem evil intelligent dust that's the way they do it it's easier to drop trillions\nOf nano particles the size of a grain of sand or a grain of salt and they can do it in that less amount of time I'm\nSure there'll be putting

grid and smart city police force all working for the green economy right\nAnd the smart city sounds like a a digital utopia and of course they're pitching into Generation Z best cities from Generation Z\nBut the as far as city is a place where data eliminates first world hassles dangers and injustices that's where they're claiming but there are problems\nAnd see smart cities are are based primarily on data all day to if you want data unique sensors it's not like roads buildings in street lights are just going to wake up magically and started chatting about the weather no\nWe need sensors to see here smell and taste and feel on behalf of these machines we need\nSensors didn't tell us when the bridge needs to be repaired we need sensors that tell us if a damaged gonna break we need sensors to remind us or to tell us that maybe a floods about to happen or an earthquakes about to happen anything\nThey can be thrown in his data any data information they can get they'll have to do it by using sensors\n\nSensors measure temperature traffic patterns foot traffic air quality\nInfrastructure integrity just go down the list of things that these data sensors are supposed to give us well Lux research and innovation researching advisory firm filed a report that suggested the world will have to deploy one trillion sensors by twenty twenty in order to fit\nThe criteria for the UN's edict on smart cities and smart city network shows redesign smart cities around the data we want instead of the wiring we have\nThis is where it gets more complex because\nMass data aggregation will establish a lot of truth about our cities are being run it's going to lead us to a social credit score for you or me and everyone else and a social credit score\nOn the quality of life metrics that each city will have so let's say you want to make a choice on where you want to move your family you could look at a smart city or the smart city metrics guide\nBased on a number based on social credit based on what kind of people lived there for the social credit scores are extremely low in a part of a different part of the country people don't want to associate with people with a little credit scores\n\nAnd so we're going to create you know where to move everybody in the city and then we're gonna have to figure out which cities are the best in the most desirable by behavioral Bye bye bye have your data data by a way of life data or the quality of life data okay so we're going to sign these smart cities to be perfect and then the aggregation\nWill be reviewed and we'll be adhered to and it's going to lead us to score cities is related to score people or you know it'd be like one big ... fast have you ever been to Yelp you\nKnow you can destroy your business by giving a business a bad review on Yelp if you get enough people to rally around the the basically a you know a right some bad stuff up out of business you do that on Yelp yeah kills business right there and there are businesses that have sued\nTo get yelled to remove certain things because people look at that and they go oh well imagine that being you twenty four hours a day I imagine that being\nYour city twenty four hours a day but how are we going to drop one trillion sensors by twenty twenty\nOkay that means we have to drop a trillion it once we we can't do it we can't drop you know one sense or a year or even a million sense as a year or once a year you you can't do that right and so it can be difficult to meet that by twenty twenty\nSo how do we do is how do we how do they get the problem with the smart city taking care of\nWell we do it with dust\nWe'd do as smart as we do it would do particles we get I mean look I was discussing this to the ground zero and I said this is the future misses the
