know when you're in conspiracy circles there's those thoughts that you need to connect and when you do you start digging deeper and you know Halloween covers a lot of things\nBut digging deep all the time see for me every day's April Fool's day and every night is Halloween so as I'm connecting the dots\nAnd I get into the great\n... spiritual ... the conspiratorial orders the dark orders that have all their secrets it's about who's in charge of the planet and\nWho are the magicians that run the synergy or the center you know there are theories about dark Brotherhood's received their information

can cause great upheavals that can affect us for years\nOr even lifetimes\nYou've heard the old saying in magic as above so below something we should be remembered but even if our world has been is decided to adhere to\nAll kinds of crazy stop there's a lot of crazy stuff signs and wonders in the sky and they continue to be here to the average Joe and there's always a number of secrets that are being revealed by religious orders and others that are being put on the back burner and of course\nAll we hear about is how there is a world order and that world order is going to be led by anointed elders\nAnointed magicians and anointed or some sort of looked at Sherman right I mean this is what a monarchy is true the monarchies are run by kings and queens\nIn kings and queens or annoyed ones they think that their bloodline goes all the way back to Jesus Christ or do you all the way back to God and we all know that blasphemy right but yet we still give honor to kings and queens\nThe cause I think if you go to the queen of England and you'll get all the families that the bloodlines the bloodlines mean\nAnd it's just so strange that we are so fascinated with blood and blood line makes

overtime to the word I mean big change which it was replaced by short shrift in hopes that it would affect the authority\nOf the commandment into some it's not changed and the meeting\nAt all is just some it just partly why witchcraft I think it's become a sitting in the eyes of most Christians however today we're seeing a mix of both religion and witchcraft being practiced openly by women and men and a few hints that perhaps some of the old pagan imagery\nHave not left some of the major churches\nAnd so tonight I thought it'd be interesting to explore\nA some of these themes and and the reason why is because well I mean last night I think kind of a tip a hat to it when we were discussing the ... the and how means in vigils means something in how they're being used to it kind of a ... a form of I guess rich ... kind of form of witchcraft or new form\nOf witchcraft which I think a is most certainly a prevalent today so\nA new book that I have in my possession a fantastic book called

things called openings bizarre and I think it's really a pleasure in our ... ... it's an awesome opportunity for us to kick off this season to talk with Tom it's about his new book and some of the things that are changing\nWithin the scope of spirituality mainly leaning towards the cold spirituality Thomas shared them is an author artist and filmmaker from Dublin a dumb and Ireland he came to international a recognition twenty eleven with the book\nPuzzling people the labyrinth of a psychopath years since he's written several more books that has made films on topics such as social engineering political in corporate pathology\nAnd on the called ... surrounding the emerging years of the third Reich in recent times his work\nInto ancient mysteries and sacred or locations has been featured in some of the world's largest media outlets and he's a highly sought after public speaker around the world we have him tonight Thomas shared in welcome to ground zero\n\nHigh tide delighted to be here again\nIt's good to have you and like I said ah it it's it's just amazing to\nBe able to have you in such a time I mean as I was explaining there seems to be like this shift in attitudes towards I guess you could call it conjuring attitudes towards what would be considered darker magic or some of the darker arts why do you think that this is starting up now why do you think there's a newfound interest in this\nI think people will be brought these ideas for all kinds\nOf reasons I think you'll have people who will be drawn to choose things like social fears there's a sense of that there's an insecurity\nWithin society you see that happening in Brooklyn tomorrow at these these wages are going to bind cabinet is other people will look at things like you know\nQuantum physics and these ideas that reality is malleable to a certain extent and that\nThey will they let you want to test these ideas and they want to say well you know is it you know is the five cents reality is it malleable is it\nKind of change it cannot ultra towards my will and still the only effective mechanism out there to do this as things like magic and so people are drawn to him for that reason as well I think also\nThere's a there's a kind of the maturing going on at the mall and its oil is living in the age where\nYou know people have looked the especially in recent years we've seen like the behavior of the major religions and the crimes of the Catholic Church and other organizations have been exposed quite readily and people to set themselves at these guys are appalling things and here they are telling us that you know which ... evil so\nIt'd evil really considering the source it's coming from and then I I think that's got a lot to do it I think a lot of people have a kind of a hunger now to see if they can test the boundaries of reality using their will\nAnd it's becoming more apparent that they can uh I was just talking last night with cruise geo injury geo we were talking about this new medium that is on the Internet right now but uh certainly is causing the the left wing of the United states to be disturbed because they say it's humanizing it it's certainly\nA it's called the NBC or the the downplaying character meaning they did the symbol of those who sound like they are repetitive Lee speaking from a script and it's very effective and I was saying to ah Chris last night I said is an interesting that this character\nKinda resembles the among the lives of alchemy and it it seems to be very powerful is just a simple silk like looking character grand color very simple way drawn but it's supposed to be there is some sort of a a I guess you could call it a top a or some sort of me that if it is spreading and certainly going viral and this is a form of magic\n\nI'd been taken a great interest in this as soon as they came to fruition on the electromagnetic spectrum last weekend I knew this was going to be something special\nThe like I I've been watching this whole thing around for ... the the way these people have been using the ... for a few years now and we are in a different world there's a basically\nA a generation of\nInstinctual chaos magicians who are using things like mediums two actually mold reality in terms of the political structure medicine or to send the seemingly as bad as quite fascinating and not so much in its was putting out there but the reaction to it\nIt's it's it's tapped into something very visceral and frightening and deep within the people it's been it's been aimed act it's almost like the you know that that the judgment is the mirror and the mirror has been held up that these are these kind of like a\nCultural relaxes repeaters or whether you want to call them and ... they're not happy they're not happy because they wanted to believe they were special and certainly they're realizing that the only thing special about them is that they're probably just like um drives\nYeah and that's the thing is that they're saying oh the humanizing it hurts us but you're right it's like putting a mirror up to them and say look at what you're saying what you're doing look at what you're acting upon\nAnd it just reminded me when I saw that as\nA you know a several characters that have just been ... characters that have been effective in the past like the ... that was discovered a that was actually

A. G. S. T.\n[noise]\nThomas shared it with the ... to ... to have him on these little source review of when you get that book because it has\nHis own philosophical inside as a showman giving you a an introduction into magic in vehicles and how it all is applying to\nThe time today I mean a lot of what you hear about is all like this ... this is some stuff that's applicable today and what we're talking about it's also possible you know I learned a term the other day a a a Thomas it was called security theater\n[noise] and what that term means is that really you know we have to put trust in one another because the reality is is that our lives are fragile that we have fragile lived with Jodie of lived majority of the system collapsing all these things are are a possible their ...\nAnd the truth is is that everybody or gives us a sense of security and they create the security theater by you know having child proof tops TSA the airports that sort of thing\nI think the church or especially the Catholic Church now I think they provide this provide us with a little spiritual security theater thinking that everything is in control\nBut then we have a pope who steps into the sitting odd holding is staying trying to tell people about uh how he's going to eliminate the pedophilia eliminate the robbing a virtue it's almost as if\nThe vampires bow are not afraid of the sunlight nor the afraid of the crop they'll just walk right into the church walk away with a child and Robert ... virtue what do you say about that what is that what kind of a sex magic is bad that it's going to destroy what we have here on this on this planet\nI think yeah I think the Catholic Church I looked at the fly on the wall\nRight now there's that\nYou have this Pope Francis making a lot of strange statements about though you know global is kind of ideas things that that sure traditionally were against and he is still promoting them\nIt's almost like desperation tactics not quite recently here the the ... visited Ireland and it was a disaster and ... he was basically going around in his pope will be able to in the streets\nAnd that's because of all the clerical sex abuse is in some horrific things of that whole delight\nIn our and a bit very much if they're not they're not black magic that pretty much close to it conducted by members of the Catholic Church and offer I'm just wondering if this with this whole thing with the dying if it's some kind of like ... it\nJust it it is symbolic of a nervous breakdown within the Vatican but they're they're losing control you know I have to do that or a hundred years or whatever\nAnd I I don't I think that that the Vatican has you know they're a very strange place right now they're they're kind of\nYou know they're loo they've lost a lot of the countries where they used to be powerful other desperately trying to make a round and it's a it's almost like a really bad and tacky PR thing and every every so many things seem to be going wrong for the late ... do you almost wonder if they're losing it\nDisappears I mean why would they even come forward with something so obviously pagan\nSo obviously witchy and uh and preventing it\nAt a ... ... talking about this very thing\nTalking about the abuse of the children virtue in that sort of thing it's almost like\n... feet or a ... protection parts of child sort of saying we're fully aware of what's going on we're fully aware of the darkness but then again there are other factors with the church that are planning on doing a counter fight against the which is

ecological apocalyptic ideas that certain people were burden on resources and the environment and some argue that many people believe that in order to bring balance to nature we had to eliminate certain people we had to\nKill off some of the population so people were rounded up and killed\nMeans centuries prior we had European columnist who took the land for the natives because they were believed to be a strain on the resources their beliefs or different than the puritan beliefs and so\nThey hunted them down and kill them see there's always this\nAffect the process for creating an agreed upon way of hunting down and killing other human beings in order to boost to some sort of agenda in order to make you feel better about your belief system because these are believes that you don't necessarily agree with and so when you have like for example the times I'm assuming which\nTrials there are governors who are complicit in carrying out a lot of the atrocities and the public trust is always exploited in situations like bees\nAnd it would be opinion of the political elite that the day but these changes the b._b._c. is that we're seeing we're actually happening because there was this work going on this working\nOn the devil\nIs like today that there was a polarization of the people on on one side we have the devil and the other side we are God and in between there was something else and there was black magic being used in other ways of trying to\nI guess take care of the governors take care of the leaders go against the bankers it's just a never ending process
