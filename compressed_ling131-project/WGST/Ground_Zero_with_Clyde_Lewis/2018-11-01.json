in The Exorcist kind of a creepy a landmark they want to have and George to I think it should be a landmark it's kind of an interesting in fact while I was in Washington DC I plum forgot\nAbout seeing the steps so I was in Washington DC I mean now we're we didn't have enough time I mean we were walking most of Washington DC is walking that's the ... part like um you know I Would say and you could drive to the White House you drive to Washington money we parked at the Washington Monument we walked all the way over\nAn English to the south side of the White House\nAnd we were there when the angle of Merkel just happened to be in town and so ah we were kind of are dealing with security at the time\nAnd so it slowed down our process than is getting around and do things to say I didn't get a chance to see those steps but um they certainly are creepy and they want to make him a landmark so certainly um you know we were on it [laughter] I mean how do we do we try and give you the best we can I mean it's time of ... it's basically the time of year\nWhere we find another excuse to party although I got on my party and out on the twenty seven\nKids done costumes of course ah\nI was really excited when Janine sent me a picture of Liam he is a he addressed as tomato head from Fort Night he's got the mask and everything he's got a pizza suit it it's just really cool I saw his picture and uh yeah tomato head from Port night and um\nFor those of you that um have ... and company door for candy that's another thing that a Halloween is all about it's certainly a tradition that has a\nI don't know Halloween\nIs sending some mixed messages this year and what I mean by that is is I don't know if you've heard of this petition\nBut parents want to petition that Halloween be the the last Saturday of every October instead of the thirty first asked me last Saturday in October and what's interesting about that is is that I I think people that do that people are saying that you know don't know that Halloween has traditions\nThat are well Steve better you know the data all the way back to you know the sixteen hundreds\nAnd Halloween the course of the day before all saints day or the deal is one of those a day of the saints day of the dead and so it's kind of like a tradition that the night before uh we pay respects to the dead the dead walked the earth and we pay attention to\nNot only the spirit world but also some of the darker Dennis ... of the spirit world we we um we make Jack o' lanterns torn off evil spirits but of evil spirits\nYou know they pass over our houses if we were supposed to that is what trick or treaters are supposed to be it's supposed to be the evil spirits if you don't give them treats they do tricks and that's why it's called trick or treating\nThis year I just think that there were a lot of mixed messages being sent it seem to you know\nWe're living in times where where there's this devil does your hiding in every discussion dealing with politics and religion\nI mean this year in particular I I've had well I really late heavy on the devilish aspects of the holiday because from a social studies perspective I think we've reached their time in history where we are definitely in the shadow what can we label be gotten anti Christ\nMeaning that you know even though people may not be able to identify the anti Christ a\nBitch that will bear humans in heat right now let's just put it this way I mean I I don't mean to mince words but it just seems to me the dog that birth the anti Christ the certainly in heat right now and and people are just waiting for this to having\nA legend of the darkest one at all which is the anti Christ that came out of a desire\nTo better understand the last judgment and the science specifically those that Harold the arrival of this tyrannical figure this this anti ... we were told that to be vigilant we watching the science we're told in the Bible watched the signs\nAnd they may warned of a coming of the end days watch the science they may be the warning the coming of the anti Christ to come and go to the ... of the apostrophe or many men fall to the to the ills of evil and scripture and ... cool commentary and never fully addresses a exactly who\nWho is figure is who who would proceed the coming of Jesus I mean it's really an anomaly and everyone who has a particular celebrity or politician they hate will often used them to be the anti Christ especially the Arabs have there\nBecause they've been rolling the dice and say my bets on this guy by bets on this guy bets on Trump my bets on you know and you just go down the list I remember when bronco bottom was president many people thought that he was the anti Christ\nBut\nI I Would say that this study or revelation of a modern anti Christ is a truly hard sell for most people mainly because in a secular world and we're we are in in you know them the anti Christ is simply a marketing term it's a it's a buzz word for for Christians who\nSee that they are being persecuted in their faith is being destroyed by any number of groups and therefore we can save the devil is in them the devil's in them any Mimi mighty mow the devils anew the devil is this group the devil is that drove the devil is the right the devils the lab the devils everywhere\nDon't you know there's the devil is everywhere and this leads to\nNot conspiracy theory but the idea that a conspiracy exist a darker conspiracy exist that is here to bring down mankind\n\nAnd so when you look and conspiracy history you have to take into account biblical history has well this is something I mean I I think this gets confused sometimes when people say well when you're thinking of America you got to think of the Christian values that America stands on well what it is as you need to look at the Christian conspiracy\nOr the conspiracy against Christianity because here we have this this you know this all out battle\nAgainst people in America we're fighting against the I mean and when you're looking conspiracy history it all has its roots in biblical overtures ancient ritual this world events are not simply circumstantial\nBut they are the ...\nSoldiers with organized campaign by an elite group of unseen in widely unknown world leaders\nAnd of course we pointed out that they have beliefs and agents symbolism secret societal of\nCultures ... magic and that affects us and he it's not about what I Believe it's about what they believe they're the ones in power and so if you say to me will you talk about this all the time you must believe it it's not about how how I Believe it or what I Believe\nI just don't which there and I know that\nCausal engineering and ritual magic effects everyone regardless of religious believes regardless of what you practice or what you say you're ... that'd be these groups\nI mean these groups they um [noise]\nThey ah they answered other philosophy secretly and [noise]\nOutwardly they're using you know new wage used biblical symbolism and they use it to exercise absolute they tore up control [noise] over the world and they're trying to establish this new world order [noise]\nAnd they play on your

minutes ago about how that's the number one [noise]\nHorror film and the reason why it's the number one horror films because what he does is it\nExploits what it's called the invisible indefinable enemy it's\nAn enemy that comes from a place that we wouldn't expect it and it winds up attaching itself to the innocent oh it comes from either hell or comes from a dimension that we're not aware of it arrives because of temple shifts or disturbances and we started seeing that there is a war\nWhether we psychological or a true spiritual war where he would worry is is is between mankind and possibly lead you to demons that are hell bent on his albums you call the followers were being fed movies that appeared to impart\nThis as fact rather than fantasy\nAnd so now we start seeing that non fiction\nOr the or the fiction becomes non fiction and you know this is where I become a born again dispensation with this is where I become a you know a man who focuses on his guitar allergy because it's thrown into literature movies so much\nI mean many believe these movies have been a a a detriment to the fate because well much of what he's shown a written in these books or are these movies putting these movies are not based on any scripture canonized doctrine and that you know that that that the scene and and\nUh it's actually absorb\nSo much of the stuff that was as been written about the end of the world a bunch of stuff has been written about the anti Christ performed or shown\nCan be considered heresy\nMean many movies and many uh stories around Halloween take liberties\nWith passages of scripture within ... apocalyptic themes I mean you can take a look at those two dollars for example know Saddam has just been bastard die so much who knows what you\nKnow does too damaged his teacher gets any more I remember back in the seventies they can you remember people would always say look what ... to say look what no and I don't I barely hear a beep or about Nostradamus now people are now back to the book of Daniel people are now back to the book of the apocalypse the revelation\nPeople want to read apocryphal books but to try to determine what the future hold some guy called me last night said that he started reading a Antonio ... said kind of books his Bible ... and that's what I mean look what ever the future is\nThe ... image thunder is rumbling now into the president it's on me it's it's an ominous future and it's causing this it it just causing us to think that the entire country we're approaching into some you know we hear those trumpet in this guys you know the the ones that make the trumping noises\nAnd we hear those were wondering ... I Wonder if that's something we should be paying attention to are those the trumpet they're blowing\nBy the angels and we just kind of ride them off or something else science tries to explain them but in reality the are the trumpets being blown\n[noise] I mean\nWhen you're looking at the beginning of the events in our reality and the exploitation of science and religion and everything else it's always making us wonder if we're really now in the midst of in times reality or in a sense of hyper aware just because of how we been desensitized her baby and brainwashed with Hollywood\nAnd then maybe you know people speaking of his stuff I mean when you're reading about how the Vatican has a\nYou know they may focus their attention on extraterrestrial research and then they hired a group of a whole squad or a whole army of exercise is you know and when they're telescope looking at the sky is called new supper you hear all of these you know the these references to\nUse it for the devil in the anti Christ you tend to wander just who's in charge you tend to wonder if you are not paying attention you should pay attention to what's happening [noise] who's Halloween Night we focus on the future we focus on what we're feeling\nWitchcraft and ... there's some that said it was social media and the lack of the faithful to keep the trust of the youth the devil\nLooks like you're inviting dark father\nAnd speaking of the devil tonight we have the albums rex with us he um this is probably is a I don't know maybe his third or fourth Halloween with us sometimes we bring them in on Halloween the atlas directs work on the ground zero who they strive for having me on now I used to introduce you as be\nRecalled the magistrate or a bad just drove the church or Satan I was a magic during the church so you're a manager at Churchill said now you created the carrier amid the chaos superior\nYeah I have my own my own order now you know what kind of order is it is it a three to six eight and a shorter use it a witch order wizard order what kind of magic quarter isn't\nThe case and Perry miss the most advanced black magical order in the world and essentially we see the prince of darkness as a a ... and being at a doesn't exist inside of physical space time just outside of that is not involved\nUm and just don't center around the idea of worship but that to this being can actually be contacted through\nA actions involving um the highest forms of black magic and ah we see this being something that we can learn from directly because we can become like it it's the our position has to become God like beings\nAre in a\n... of his first foreign principle which is responsible for all ... life in the cosmos\nSo we're talking about a dark figure but you have this contract with whether it's on it's dark has its message sent you eating right in San ...\nPainting and in of itself is a\nIs a a a kind of a dumbed down I'm a\nIdea of this super consciousness inside of physical space time it's a and this guy stiff 'em rebellion and\nA a decadence and um he ... them but ah the ultimate elevated form of this is a stoic Lucia furry and for which is where we are\nAre actively involved in so I'm for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction so as you see manifestations of um forms going to a a higher spiritual form or as\nA decision to to forcefully moved the intellect and the psych sushi physical space toward a higher uh form you're going to the replica ripples\nIn in its back wash that are going to manifest themselves as decadence in degenerate but we're also living inside of the cyclic nature of the Kelly yoga which is a ... and understanding of cyclic time in this position that's happening right now is the degenerate\nI'm a sales oriented\nUm cosmological construct within their they human physical ... uh action and form that is at its lowest uh um continue on Mitch it's the worst possible position we can actually live in so you're going to see this like all across the board politics\nPhilosophy art music\nUm you know a cultures et cetera [noise]\nIs this something that ah the chaos and cats are very him or do they relish this or were they like to see a higher form of been lightened ... there would be more refined satanism runny actually ... absolutely\nNo interest in what happens to the rest of the world no interest at all no we we're we're we're we're appalled bearers of western civilization were just watching it happened the rest of us are just moving toward something that's a continually outside of that\nSo you're waiting for all of us to destroy each other than you guys moving the base and we'd be be and why no\nWe're not even interested in in in the earth's we're interested in transcending beyond even that position so during Sandy one day even really unhappy about is the fact that there were so much\nA destruction of the beauty of this planet and a lot of that it's manifested in things such as an animal abused child abuse this type of thing we take this kind of thing is really a [noise] a really horrific actually animal abuse even worse as far as working or because of the true\nI'm a ... a\nHolders of the of the planet you know they were here before we were and we've come along with like eradicated a their land um\nAh their position in the world you know they're there\nSit there simple rights to live so well actually I don't really buy complaints to live well it I guess is that the you know we we ... we overrun all of that and I just think that there should be some kind of vengeful action against that type of thing but it will actually get federal abusing child oh yeah absolutely\nUm you know it's interesting because I said that statement earlier I said satanism now it's harder to find black magically well yeah are you looking for more you are you talking about ... magic but I'm Talking about how now the ... the definition of what satanism is it's not easy I remember when I first met you and I talked over\nA back when you were part of the C O s I uh I I was trying to put a handle on what's Satan is believe it or at least the way and famous believed\nAnd uh before it wasn't easy to find satanism it's getting even more difficult to divide said that the actually say that I Would say is there is any more because we go for like a like I said we go for the most ridiculous definitions to the more psychotic definitions of what it is\nAnd I was just curious is this why you left the church are safe\nYou know a ... satanism which is a fairly universally and philosophically recognized as the first manifestation of a true a church devoted to satanism to 'em and acknowledgement at the devil I'm as a a as a symbol for I'm\nI'm a form of personal internal evolution and that each and every man and woman is their own satanic deity moving to try and become something greater than what they are\nUm there's\nWithin the like the last Twenty years there has been literature that has flooded the literal a cottage industry of books that have come out claiming to have been some type of a\nFormer age old undiscovered um clandestine form of a of the satanic worship\nThat um that you can tap into you and that's just not true\nI'm a scholar of black magic in satanism and I've researched it and it's it's either a um [noise] highly embellished\nIdeas around a satanic Didi or be blatantly meal a manifestation created by people who are who are betting that you don't know anything more about it than they do well\nMost people that I remember when I first was interviewing you there are a lot of people identified with what you say they were saying well we identify with what\nRex who say we we we been and are either of them and say well I find uncomfortable is I find it uncover all that I agree with what he said because of your position in the church has said now you have your own group of black magic magicians and\nI mean your message really hasn't changed all that much only that you seem to be more or less like you said Paul bearers to the fall of western civilization meaning you're standing there watching it all took a collapse around you and then you'll be cleaning up and basically we won't be\nCleaning up are escaping it altogether I mean what are the polar bears I'm just saying that you know I I Am I'm\nLooking at what's happening and I'm I'm recording it but I'm not part of it um the the chaos and pyramids a transcendent order when we say transcend that we're talking about the ultimate most uh virile form of spiritual I'm a bad at destiny and\nA descent so I'm the only way that is going to actually happen is to be able to remove oneself from the human equation altogether right so um because we see that this this ultimate deity form which actually cannot in any way\nBe defined because she doesn't exist inside of physical space I surfing and talking about what we're trying to use language you weren't trying to use formula mathematics whatever transcribed can't really do that was difficult\nAh [noise] control operative points in you know in cyberspace with like one Jeff and the same thing is [noise] you have very
