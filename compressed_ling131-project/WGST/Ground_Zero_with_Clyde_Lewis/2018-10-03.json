the eclipse you know last year I said hey there's going to be it's clips and then we better be prepared for something happening because you\nKnow um\nWe see the or was she the repercussions of everything happening you know September through through October\nAnd then we have the shooting and uh of course ah when I was talking with Alex about nine eleven\nUm I said I said to him I said you know you look at what they you know the project for new American Century look what they wrote about in the new Pearl Harbor ideas they produce the demand you are the signatories on the on the document\nI said you look at the uh you you look at what they've written about new Pearl Harbor and then they then they said that there was going to be or there can be a even a biological attack or some sort of biological attack\nThat could happen and uh it would certainly uh make differences in political movements that would change the way politics would run and of course some in nine eleven you know during the nine eleven attacks after nine eleven attacks in fact uh believe it was a\nJust a few weeks or a week afterwards and then everything you know started happening and it wasn't until about like October fourth I Believe of ah of two thousand one where we started to see that many people were dying from exposure to anthrax\nAnd so I'm Jones said to me you know when I was on the air with him I said what do you think the final bull events going to be and I says I said to him I said well I you know I kind of hesitated bit\nBecause I was afraid to commit to something because you know you commit to something like if you if you're a born again preaching to the world's going to and\nLike if it's going to end at the end of the ... you know damn good well it's not going on right because just saying it makes it not happen um so I told him I said I'll tell you it's a biological attack in the United states\nAnd ah I said\nYou know things are just kind of bizarre right now I talked about the plate X exercise and it talked about the the er the pandemic and they told them about how they're all being but they're all preparing we have all these uh\nYou know tabletop exercise about biological pandemic advanced biological attacks\nAnd um you know the idea of a biological attack or some sort of biological chemical weapon being use I you know we speculated on many different ways of this would happen would be carried out whether it would be through an arrow slides attack or you know maybe ... it'd be released I I was very surprised though\nUm\nIt was very surprised and I and I and I wasn't I guess because I I wondered when it was going to happen I didn't think would happen today but I read today that the Pentagon reporter that envelopes containing the biological poisoned rice in the right to the Pentagon I'm the opposite the president's Senator Ted Cruz is off\nSo I'm a\nBiological attack a habit today um biological\nPoison rights than uh taken from caster beans I remember when you know back in the day with made you drink castor oil in order to you know purge crap in your body will there's a reason why is because Castro beans can be made into poison\nAnd um it's a it's it's rice and\nAnd it was reported in the two packages containing rights than\nWere intercepted on the way the Pentagon and he was confirmed by the department of defense officials that the parcels were there they indicated that the um the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged mail delivery building\nWhich is located next door to the defense department's massive headquarters in Washington DC\nAnd you know um\nThe the FBI now is involved with this and they they're actually been called in to\nLead the investigation into the packages were to address the secretary of defense James Mattis Angie of naval operations admiral John Richardson and of course there was a letter sent to the president\nUm here's the FBI statement they said uh this is the FBI or the statement they they issued on Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents to possession of too suspicious on the lips\nThat had been screened at the Pentagon mail facility those on the lips are currently undergoing further testing is this is ongoing we will have no further comment\nSo as the Washington DC area of work to determine the origin of the rights that attack\nNews also broke out the two individuals have been hospitalized after being exposed to a powdery substance in the mail center the Texas is set to Texas it was a\nActually a ... it wasn't in Texas it was um ... I maybe I'm trying to figure out it was his office Ted Cruz's office where it happened yes there was in Houston, Texas Houston, Texas they sent a Senator Ted Cruz is off as a a rice doing as well\nOr two people were hospitalized or we don't know um how they're doing a cruise office said they received a piece of mail\nAddress is Senator Cruz\nThis morning when the male is open to contain the white powdery substance the ninth floor of the Phoenix tower\nWas evacuated after the packages found the Pentagon also reported that rice and was attacked that in the mail and of course the rights of since President Trump so um\nYou know so as we predicted um this has happened much like what happened I mean if you remember half a dozen leather letters um\nContaining anthrax spores were mailed to journalism politicians beginning one week after the nine eleven attacks for leaders were spores and threaten messages events that were recovered all were smart from Trenton New Jersey which meant that they had been process at the post and distribution center in uh actually near Hamilton\nTo others or post marks September Eighteenth one address the Tom Brokaw NBC TV\nAnd another was sent to the editor of the New York post the other two letters for stamp October ninth address the senators Thomas natural and Patrick Leahy so as people became infected in September October and November local\nResponses revealed gaps in preparedness for biological attack for example the first confirmation of anthrax case was on October fourth\n\nIn more than two weeks after the initial letters were mailed so I mean we look at the retrospective assessments of all this and um\nWe we learned that nine people\nThey were exposed to um the rice in ... about the rising sorry the anthrax that already contract\nIs the fear of their own this previously had been missed identified because faulty diagnosis erroneous laboratory tests\nBut in the end the final result at the end or in the end twenty two people to become infected\nFive of them died meanwhile they were buildings that were\nBelatedly found to be contaminated with anthrax spores and they'd leave from the letters or at least thirty thousand people who are deemed at risk required prophylactic antibiotics like skip rope and millions more fearful and many of them anxious about opening their own mail after that\nNow\nA lot of this information then I'm telling you right now about the anthrax attacks I'm sure many people have forgotten\nAnd there's a lot of stuff that after doing research I found out that I did not know about I I did not know there were plenty of other buildings that were leaking some of his uh some of his uh you know biological a powder and uh the anthrax spores I had no idea\nAnd so\nThe seriousness of the rice attack I Believe I'm you know warrants a lot of questions one is is this would this be considered the first assassination attempt on the president [noise]\nThe first known assassination attempt on the president [noise]\nAnd um [noise] when you look at all who are being attacked was this done [noise] in order to slow down [noise] or the FBI a report on the cabin off for ... [noise]\nOr delayed the vote and uh that wouldn't be out of the question either so are there are a lot of things going on right now that I'm sure raises a lot of eyebrows question\nAs to what happened with the rights of the facts once I get more about that coming out ...

then you keep pressing the beans pressing they'd be then you have castor oil\nMany of us remember castor oil rights and stuff they used to make it poop Castro it's it's all accident well basically what you do\nIs the reason why this core even work so well is because one of the gums up the protein building machinery and yourself goes right to your DNA that is if you ingest it okay and\nIf it harms cells that are dividing quickly and then it takes it goes to bleeding swelling your blood pressure goes down your organ failure happens and it's pretty pretty nasty\nBut the the ... the specific

[laughter] I don't know you do that but anyway he asked me what I thought was going to be a the final blow that\nAnd I ate it wouldn't get put on the spot like this because you know I'll say something and immediately reasons why I said there's\nAt least so full of crap you know I I you know sure you know you can make prognostications in prophecies and you can predict stuff and the weatherman does

and I see what the atmosphere is I'm Wondering what's going on and\nAnd ah so I made my determination so Jones he pays me and he said hey so tell me what this final blows give me what do you think it is that I said it's going to be a biological attack on the United states\nMeals I agree I agree he's has um and uh I think I'm going on his show again soon probably this will be a good follow up for that you know when you're talking about this\nAh but yeah I told him that I felt it would be a biological attack on the United states and speculate on many different occasions that this will be carried out because I started off talking about ... acts in may I talked about the the tabletop exercise of a pandemic\nSo there there are preparing for some biological attack some\nContamination some toxic release um I talked to her again and function exercise is something that most people don't know about it and bring it to the forefront of talked about how sometimes in order to do a test run they they take a lesson virulent form of something and they released into the public\nIs test to see you know how people react to it sometimes they provide them with the antidote sometimes they see how many people checking the hospital how many people stay home how many people bring it to work that you know it's just the way for\nA the CDC and others to to to monitor the moving and diseases and some people don't support this and a lot of people say it's not good to do this but they do it anyway\nUm\nApparently this new t._v. show about doctors called New Amsterdam\nA barely that was a ... that's a show that's on TV Now and somebody had said that it deals with a guy who gets a bowler Andy brings it to the United states on a plane\nAnd of course we talked about the arrow play we talked about you know the situation that happened ah with the uh Emirates planes for other planes where uh you know there was a different diseases monkey pox and uh gosh all kinds of things\nAre happening and uh it's all happening at once and they said this is a is a gain of these again a force exercise\nAnd uh I said you know something is going to happen where are the real thing is going to go down and when it does you know we all know that this the beginning is the beginning of the final blow them\nAnd so I actually well and it could have been ... through the camp trails that could be you know given through mosquitoes and so today I read that the Pentagon reporter the envelopes containing biological poison rice and arrived at the Pentagon\nOr the office of the president and centered Sen Ted Cruz's campaign office\nSo two packages containing rice and\nIs intercepted by on the way to the Pentagon and the existence of the suspected packages was had been confirmed by the department of defense officials who indicated the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the\nPackages were flagged in the mail delivery building on Monday but in announcer they were here until Tuesday that was located next door to the defense department and right there it's at its headquarters the FBI has been called in now\nTo lead the investigation ended up packages which we're addressing the secretary of defense James ... there there was an address to James mad as chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson and the president Ted Cruz's office the FBI released this statement\nThis is a statement from the FBI on Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents took possession of too suspicious and below ups that had been screened at the Pentagon mail facility\nIs envelopes are currently undergoing further testing if this is ongoing will have no further comment\nOn this show\nAs Washington DC has been working to figure out of this you know this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz's office said they received a piece of mail it was addressed the Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is open again Jane White powder\nAnd so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated after packages found Pentagon also reports that rice and was detected and that uh and and so we're having a full on biological attack biological a poison rice and\nAnd just reminded me if you remember when I was talking about the project for the new American Century I said something to the fact that ah one of the other ways that they can change\nThe direction of anything politically is to use biological warfare and even biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark\nA you know biological markers that would that would actually activate this stuff and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested or if it's injected\nIf you inhale it and so you can survive a inhaling a rice and it's just that you can die if you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now and so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four\nThe Russian each call here in Oregon tried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote\nOr in Dallas, Oregon and ah I think here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way\nTo a distract us from it\nOr there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time that that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night on the ground zero lounge they probably will have this investigation wrapped up by Wednesday they'll\nHand down their decision in the American people probably won't hear what the decision it and they don't have to be happy I doesn't have to reveal anything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and Kevin I'm going to be confirmed and I think it would trigger a lot of anger with a lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually becomes chief justice\nAnd so tomorrow it to Eighteen eastern time they're gonna be doing that test and emergency test on your telephone so as I said timing is everything just as peculiar\nAnd uh I think we should have a discussion about this because I think that uh you know as we were predicting it I predict it on our showing the show I talked about it at great length on this program for a good long time and people who is this program know\nLived on this people who let's this program know that if I'm On to something and I see the patterns these things go down and when they go down it's not necessarily to the exact\nYou know 'cause I remember when we talked about the pope stepping down when Ratzinger stepped down\nAnd we said oh you know he would probably leave retired die within three months he left the ... he left the papacy the one of my friends has really blown away by this but it was because we can see you know the talk we heard the we heard the Marines and rumors coming up from Rome\nAnd there are several other times in instances where we have a pretty much reported ... be prepared for this and it's happened or not always ripe or damn close believe it or not or damn close and so we're obviously seeing the beginnings of what would be the final blow if this gets out of hand\nThey'd be prepared because if the work goes down tomorrow that cabin uh [noise] some people aren't pleased we can see some more civil unrest in some of the major cities across the country [noise] so we have to prepare for that not that it will happen [noise] ...\nIf it does happen\nTo really fishermen three thirty seven under the triple a fix every three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis [noise] you're listening to ground zero and we'll

what the decision will\nBe and the people freak out those who are all you know invested in this those who are like harassing people like Mitch McConnell and others those are invested in this we need to be careful because you know anything can happen at this point\nIn with rice and being a delivered to you know the Pentagon some address to the president I don't understand why\nThis is not being investigated and and people aren't wondering if this was an attempt to assassinate the president\nOr in a in a more broader sense that'd be competition exercise because if they could send do all of the uh the people involved with the cabinet for case you know packages of rice and if they could have killed at every single one of them are made them sick enough or too sick to vote as I said before\nA this is something that the Russian each called did back in Nineteen eighty four and this would be considered probably the second\nA biological attack a that would be a a domestic terrorist

like how you a ... you always see these patterns\nAnd it is interesting we're right before that that called them or that that takes tomorrow [noise]\nUm the the thing I keep thinking is is a couple of things is you know is it possible that it's that anything's possible but is it possible that\nThis could also be a distraction or I use that word by word but\nCould it be that actually\nThe right side the right way so to speak yeah could be putting this on as a distraction or whatever I'm too you know get some sympathy or whatever and then the other thing would be is um it's kind of interesting that they're targeting a course Donald Trump you know he's the head of the right\nAnd then you have Ted Cruz which if you cruise Facebook\nYou know everybody seems to have Ted Cruz even though he's not really in the U.S while it anymore and the other interesting thing is is that Ted Cruz at one point wasn't he kind of\nA a guy that would have been considered to be a good a Supreme Court nominee so\nWell I don't know if we're getting to bench a secretary of defense James Mattis was targeting also chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson was it was also targeted\n[noise] sure yeah I I don't know where their political affiliations ... but\nBut see that's the thing is that if this was I mean obviously this is politically motivated\nOr we don't know do that for what reason it was politically motivated I Would say it was just worked the investigation and the vote the confirmation vote I think that it would give them a reason to we're going to stop this right now and we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI's already made the decision\nAnd and I know they've already made the decision because um you know uh actually we were to ground zero allows discussing this and somebody said to me they said well\nThey're gonna wrap this up by Wednesday they don't have to wait till friday they said well a week's

him from going anywhere near the White House so they were sent I'm sure there were said yesterday or the official announcement income today because they were wanting to inspect\nAll the mail to find out of rice and was involved and made the announcement the rice and was in the package is one of the of course\nSend to the president United States but what I find interesting is no reporting of this on other major networks none in fact that they're focusing again on the uh there was again a cabin on board in fact right now they're talking about the protesters I just talked about we're confronting\nOf course a Mitch McConnell in others of course giving into faces I mean like they do to flake without getting into phases of the senators\nAnd basically blaming them and saying that the Republican Party is the party of rapists and and this is this is amazingly out of line in my opinion\nIt totally out of line\nSo I mean who knows who knows who's responsible for this rice it and who knows what the motive is but it just all sounds like it like like they said the Nineteen eighty four tempted to warning a boat\nOr changes fish it on a boat by the Russian each cold in Oregon in Nineteen eighty four it's the same ammo it's the same purpose to somehow stall or otherwise uh for the efforts of either be FBI investigation or the voting for senator cabinet\nYeah\nSo you have the timing of everything and I like I said there would be a biological attack there has been now we have this cat's do we have to deal with with the phones tomorrow to Eighteen eastern time I'd be

fill up your own ground zero\nClad high up I think it had a memory\nOut the story that they're still going on in the summer of two thousand one right before nine eleven and a matter of fact that morning at nine eleven before the plane tower\nHad hundred reporters standing outside a Democrat Senator name that guy ... ... and and the investigation on the ... sugar levy\nRemember that yeah I remember that it it after the planes hit the towers and\nThere was also getting a function of the art but after the towers that story was that was gone like you didn't hear about it\nSo do you say oh I Love you I mean but she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right and uh yeah I mean that was a the hot news item into the the towers went down and then that everyone was like a after that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nWell I'm thinking this is comparable with Kevin for\nWell I I yeah I I but Gary wasn't planning on a or B being a chief justice [laughter] which I mean once again we have an extramarital affair story we have a dead woman Shawn Levy\nA we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's a ... that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad diamond back but uh I Would say that you know they're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people\nLost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case would Gary Cohn did that is if they were able to look through the ... the nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I just wanted to put that out there and all that she gets another good\nVery good point though very good comparison history you get your brownie points for being a story about I think it ... and I loved it and you got to love you too man skilled at TJ in Rhode Island I pay either I'd\nProbably be quick as much as I can be bought you obviously ... what does two plus one plus eight add up to\nTwo plus one plus eight yep eleven\nThat's right and what does two plus there are a plus one plus eight at up to\nUm London\nA trial and when was nine what was what was that date back in September\nAnd then I ... when I was\nOne plus one add up to\nNine plus one plus one yep twelve\nNine oh want a loving sorry that's\nRight although nine eleven had the total eleven twenty Eighteen eleven you have this thing going on at two Eighteen as you said right\nWhich is an eleven eleven yeah and we just had a job or who was murdered in DC not too long ago\nRight ... to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an air quality to it and\n... and you want if you want to get technical when was the ground broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what day was that September eleventh All right yeah I'm saying\nJust one thing but I was calling up about the rice said and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because if you recall back in terms of predicting programming\nWhat happened to the general in Venezuela where they accused him of staging his little assassination attempt with that drone ... might have tip their hand right they're letting you know in advance what was coming well\nI mean you can see that there was something going on with these ah when I called these gain and function exercise I Believe the Emirates plane was part of that\nI Believe that when you have a group of people on the on the plane and they all complain of flu like symptoms all at once that's not a flu that something else and it does smack of a rice from poisoning\nAnd I'll just to be cleared Nineteen forty one nine eleven September eleven Nineteen forty one was in the Pentagon round was broken for the Pentagon them so I Know nine eleven to be a talked about two\nMen then remember overseas there's a lot of provocative behavior taking place upon the part of the United states where there were already threatening to strike a Russian missile or install installation because of start\nTreaty violations and they're moving a ships to the ass off to see a off of the Ukrainian coastline over there in Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the world\nRight and so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting them both how are they affect you invest though\nThe vote I Will tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down that's going to be a dramatic decision that will be the battle cry\nWill be confirmed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow you feel though if the FBI did not release the information about Kavanaugh in his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I Would be ripping but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're gonna already be finished by\n... now you have the ... not ... I'm Sorry to tell you it's not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when as far as news that I heard\nIt already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just to value wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell and they wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but now Mitch McConnell has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nAs a matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and that's what I really don't\nCause you when you when you start playing with the very last word because it's not right because that's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's the last word not because it's right but because it is the last word once you start making something from politicized political\nThat nobody's going to have faith and or in in the integrity of that institution anymore\nWell I think we've lost faith Eighteen years ago you do really I Do I did and I think that's why I'm not political\nWell see that's why I don't understand your problem with people again being harassed you say by it I don't call that harassed and I think\nThat is around look if I if I get on an escalator and a woman says to me oh you turn your back on women as I treat women I look back at her and say no I'm On the escalator I'm getting away from you jumping all over me and yelling at me for something I have no control over\nBut they wouldn't be doing it to you because you're not a person who takes on the position of publicity and demanding attention\nAt it and then even then I had an\nAgreement because I still consider it better than a presidential candidate who says to people beat the cream cheese out of somebody and I'll pay for\nYour legal you know any excuses Trump I don't excuse Trump for what he says\nIn fact he causes own problems on his own but when you have people that ... basically a sumo things about you in public and yell at him out all over the place I get very angry about in fact I get mad when people assume things about me being run through and the reason why don't they\nStand on anything and you have I mean I I don't know what you don't have\nA matter of the matter than I Do have power I have I have three hundred stations across the country to give me power\nBut in terms of being able to directly affect change or not a politician you don't
