prayer on it\nWe have the holy of holy and Solomon's Temple the perfect cube we have the ... is a black cube located centrally within all ... all around the sacred site of Muslims at mecca\nAnd then we have the cube in a modern day Azerbaijan which is a fire cult I'm an area where there was a fire called\nA and historical days and that Cuba's representation of those fire deities so you see this throughout a religion you see this throughout history but when you start to break the cube down it takes you into more magical and\nMore a cult studies and one of those studies is the study of what is called the magic square so you have each of the seven classical planet that has its own magical square which is derived from the number of that planetary intelligence and it said that each of these intelligence is has a\nForm of consciousness that is free from the body free from flash it immortal ended assists and all things that are\nThat are of God if you will and so physical son is typically broken down for example into the spiritual Sunday intellectual son in the material sun and in the Hebrew uh Bala ... you have a mix of Muslim and Jewish believes there\nThe intelligence of the sun is called ... which is a name and the ... equivalent to one one one the spiritual son is known as so Ross\nAnd that's new at that numerical value is six six six and both of those numbers both of those spiritual essence is are derived from the magic square of the sun which is a square with six columns in six rows\nEach line all of the numbers in every direction add up to one one one and every grow every line one one one time the six columns in rows equals six six six so that is a number of the sun than they are of course there's the magic square of Saturn which\nIs a square with three columns and three rows each line adds to the number Fifteen and numerically the number Fifteen if you look at that numerically and apply it to numerology when you count to ten and just start over again one two three four five six thirty nine\nTen is one again and so on and so forth the number Fifteen become sick so Fifteen Fifteen Fifteen for each of those three lines equals six six six and that's where we get\nThe magic square of Saturn ... six six six Saturn is the father I heard you and Alex Jones earlier today and you mentioned Jupiter and it's interesting because Jupiter is Jew Peter and Peter is popped her father as in the dark father or the dark lord the lord of the rings center and the black cube is a representation Clyde\nOf the material world and it is on the hero card both\nA magician

one of the seasons Liam play sport night\nI was noticing that there was a a black cube that showed up from out of nowhere that was in a uh the area they're there to Liam was trying to figure out how to conquer it and uh I don't know exactly what happened but apparently the Cuban transformed itself into a floating land mass over the area\nAnd I was fascinated by this because the cube itself\nHad what looked like a Jewish riding on it it had a number of things that looked like gold Hebrew writings and I I was curious as to why that would show up at a game it had to it at a very a called\nA ...

think the ... the minds of the men are given hope and working for a positive future we can we can make major changes in what's happening right now in the world and it's not like we're\nNot we're just one person or whatever\nWe can work together on this and we can make big changes of the skull or you know when you some people see it they say they don't think of it as something positive because they have these thoughts in their mind about a skulls but when you see that especially in the Mitchell head just go and you see the workman ship and the love that went into it\nAnd it uh it just there's this special energy that you you can you can feel the energy and it's a\nIt's a really really neat so that's what we do\nYeah and every time I mean this is an amazing ... this is the one that ah I've always admired for its workman ship how beautiful it is and the power it certainly possesses incense through and uh with the power in the room we have tonight and what we're feeling\nIt's certainly a is inspiring a and and I guess for people who know nothing\nAbout the schools why is this crystal skull so important and why is this president so important in the room tonight well\nIt's a considered one of the ancient skulls and\nLike you say the skull stores knowledge for everything it's seen been around for all the years and so uh it's believed to be a rich ... of mind and it is reciprocal mind has been programmed by the ancient masters with the knowledge of the universe so\nUh it's it's here and it's it comes through it's very\nVery a shuttle but very powerful\nYeah certainly I'm sure it has a lot of things to tell us I'm sure it has a lot of the tonight we have a of course we have a lot of things a lot of uh I'd say uh\nYou know people who want to join in the program tonight we're Carol\nDavis coming up tonight to we've had on the program before she's a medium or and also uh I guess a psychic in a way she's she's she is a person who communicates the skull\nAnd she'll be on the program tonight we have Stephanie Phelps who was should come on the program tonight and of course we have with is also a we have a\nA ... von ... eat and eat interesting that's an adult and what is what is ... what is your about asking if he's written books about the crystal skull heavy not\nA he's is one of the more experts on the crystal skulls he he works for them for a number of years you've written books he's a doctor and a a he has a lot to say about him I that's what I Would I think it'd be interesting to hear what he has to say\nThat let's go let's go to job right now job you there I mean yeah\nIt's good to have you on the program thank you for being on the program with us we're here with a bill and of course the crystal skull or tell us about your interest and how your interest began in this in this\nSubject well it\nBegan ... experience all and in Nineteen Nineteen Ninety four I met ... but at least I didn't know what it was but it turns out to be a crystal it's called at somebody put in my hands\nAnd up this close eyes\nAre asked me to feel and I started to cry like a little baby\nAnd that was for many reasons to stop all my journey because why would a grown up guys are crying is something he doesn't know what it is and it turns out to be a crystal skull and what's interesting because if there was a contemporary crystal skull there was not a lot of that ancient walls is a lot of information and\nYou may understand that I couldn't let go anymore\nThat is how I started to search to wheat and it was interesting in that time is up many pistol calls route and so on the Internet which was the first of all that it appears\nThat Michel ... is the oil and had this fascination that one day I Would need an angel and just and I have a two thousand seven bill and bill came\nFor the ... that's the that I co organized and that is on I saw this call but in the meantime I've been studying calls I'm trying to understand and it was interesting what you were saying about the ... the black box um but I ... ... that's the name of that\nLike ... like you know\nYeah uh\nIt goes the key words I think as soon as you start working Lewis crystal skull is\nConsciousness yes we're mentioning and that's absolutely true you also work with material that calls for a mother earth so it links and to the earth but also links into the fact that the ancient people\nOr putting information in a system is while the best systems or you are without tech knowledge or you can put information and that is quite right or they use these ancient courts as a storage of information that'd be now try\nTo access you know and a lot of the interesting things and that is if we have not being very successful\nYes there are channels and that it is and that are that are far more information and officials call [noise] so people are searching for how can you access even this information he got them in jail and you still\nContains Charlotte's inflation I remember a story of a I don't think which which a company was working with these results courts and they were putting in ... ... ... a piece of artificial and crystal\nShow if you can access it out to work with them and that he had all this whole ... set out to train us to make it easier to easier to access all of this out the information that stuff\n[noise] so actually you can say that it's working which crystals called is a journey off expanding potential and expanding\nConsciousness and awareness is that gift and it it didn't look back ... that they make it the shape off a call ... ... if you put information in any\nParticular uh courts yeah we would even know that that is where the information is study ancient that while the the need to make sure that people in the future\nOf the show to realize wow that is for the ... so that is why they ... as people feel when they call an all access crystal skull\nWill always remember Renisha always remember what if it ... it was the courts in crystal provided\nA the means by which we could communicate now with one another using crystal radios crystal radio that were the first radio is that where we could broadcast information\nTo and from each other long distances there were ... you know people like Tesla Marconi there were very much aware of using crystal in order to create that sort of a communication not only that but to get records\nSuch as what we had with the idea of the photograph worthy or the or the digital recorders these are all the technologies that came from the original preschool from the original\nPorts and so it's important to understand and some of the ancient technology like what we find in the crystal skull is not being utilized in our technology today a doctor about it and I appreciate\nYou coming on this program thank you for your thoughts on this matter I really did enjoy our time together [noise]\nSo did I thank you so much a had a we will talk with these to pick your\nOkay like Tripoli fix it with three thirty

court some crystals and\nHere's the crystal skull go home and how you feel in so far about what we're talking about that I mean there are many people coming to students like putting their hands up against this go and feeling the power\nI mean these are experiences that I remember one time I had my hands there crystal skull and it came towards me and it and when I walked away from him move towards me\nSo for some reason I had this magnetic attraction to the school is that it does that signify anything in your opinion at your magnetic personality I [laughter] I [laughter]\nI don't know eight certainly a happy a completely\nMesmerized and baffled I had never\nHad an experience like that with any inanimate objects so to have a skull move towards me after I put my hands near it um it it certainly had healing power and or\nA you know I remember when we first had a the Shawna Roscoe in the studio I was not convinced that this would be anything you know worthy cause you to the school itself\nIs a visual thing okay and we will be doing a a ... will be doing a a a a will be doing a Facebook\nLive so you can see this but it it is a visual thing\nOr you have to see it to believe but first of all then to be near it is to feel it and that is the second part and many of you are not going to be able to feel it and then comes the idea of communication and experience in that comes with both internal tell a path that feeling and spirit\nWhich of course you get from this and of course tonight we're going to also bring about the new technology with the old black cube so we're going to

she thought well what a more of an idea and then afterwards you begin to see the beauty and the wonder of the schools and now she speaks for the schools welcome back\nHere all day was to the program ground zero thank you grow up around the shows and I\nThink ...\nNo go ahead and ah you know the last ... last hour they they they we went early and it was it was getting interested in the conversation you were finally introduced to the skull\nYes and uh your reaction was what\nOh test oh\n[laughter] okay I get it I Would have been\nIn the meantime my ego would shut up to a hundred gay and I thought\nOh my goodness this is going to be you know the the answer to all my questions and um because they had told me that it was Saturday mysterious and it was magical and and I walked into the room and looked at it and it was just\nOh I mean it was a beautiful but uh I expected to grow little legs and jump up and down and\nSay she didn't do [laughter] rather\nDeflated and a very quickly they um I got to be friends with semi when she found out I was English will actually Welsh so that when does it with his secretary and\nI'm right before actually going through a doorway that day they it's tend to me the people that took me and said oh by the way don't say anything psychic 'cause em em is Michel ... is just like psychics he's had some bad experiences\nAnd I wanted to get back in the car I thought why am I here anyway I\nWent in I said hello and she stole you know English come in come in I said I scan Welsh and secretary said oh so am I coming from and so from that moment on we with some friends but um\nMy first reaction to ... oh okay\nVery beautiful but anyway she put it he said well\nDo you want to see this call I said that's okay she said well\nI'll bring it over and she set it on the table and the the people I was with with the kind that see things and everything and they were saying you see that the alien oh you see that ship the is the this and I'm going uh-huh\n[laughter] you know we really well and I don't agree [laughter] property brought up and I I always say bless your heart [laughter] ha ha ha ha ha ha I\nSat with my I'm On the the rest of her chest assailed and put my head in my hand and I thought I close my eyes they'll think I'm doing something profound and\nThey leave me alone because I don't see anything in this thing and I but\nYou know just so the next thing I knew I so so I sleep 'cause I had this noise snoring oh have you know how do I get out of this so slowly opened my eyes and they were saying that was wonderful that was terrific and I guess it was [noise]\nAnd they did you hear it a hit wash [laughter] and they\nStill on a tape recorder and I said where did that come from\nThinking I was definitely asleep\nAnd they said that she said no that's not me it's not even my voice and they said no it's definitely you and what has happened as I thought I had fallen asleep I'm\nSo much of this information to pull it out through a couple of tapes without stopping and um I was totally freaked out actually\nWas you were channeling your channeling a message to the school\nTo or that kind of situation I'm used to being sort of in control of the well semi in control are giving like commission and allowing a ... none of that has happened it was just boom\nAnd um that that was my first introduction and a semi seemed to be happy because it started to give its history and I was not happy\nAnd thought okay it's goodbye and we won't do that again\nWhat rights that again you know what I I remember I was had been fired once when I went through a channeling session and it scared me so much to like throw away the tapes of the recording I look back and I regret that now because I remember it was so amazing you know some of the things that are my voice to the my body did they have on tape and ah just terrified me to the point where I didn't want\nWant anybody to see it nor do I want to experience that again but now looking back I'm thinking as I matured\nUnderstand what this is an hour an hour to operate I I ... back to the time when that happened to me and I would wish that I Would have kept a recording of maybe somewhere out there somebody's got a recording of been recorded some of my old shows\nBut it was something definitely the traveling aspects are are are really amazing what can be done through the human body for the human voice\nYes absolutely so that that was my first initial\nI'm meeting with the style and um then they asked me to go back like two months age I said no no no no\nNo one foot and then sent me had started calling me which struck up a friendship and and she was saying if I wanted to see you Dale and to to come up and then when Sammy cold you jumped [laughter] I did go back a second time\nAnd I said okay I Know what you hear about so I didn't look at it I I kept my eyes off it and everything and [noise] and Sammy said well let's see what this has to say today\nPuts it in front of me and I'm not looking I don't get involved and um the people that have come what kind of expecting something and I said I'm Sorry but I Can't I don't know how to you know\nIt won't be anything channeling on command and starting to do well even though I may ask you to do it later so be ready\nTo accept that I put my hand on the scholar at the last thing I Would have been [laughter] like [laughter] like [laughter]\nAnd so I said\nNeed it'd be um [noise]\nDo not tent and energy into the U.S rather than a calming peaceful vibration around the this\nExperiment was done [noise] many many years ago and face a positive effect on your small planet\nOf the youth that it would be something you can do to be a more steady and the atmosphere\nWill gotta we were going to take a break

listening to ground zero than it was called them I Believe six seven three thirty seven hundred that's triple a victim and three thirty seven hundred Carol big but it's\nJust kind of\nA message from the crystal skull around zero and what message it was that we are\nStill reeling from it [noise] and uh begin to myself but\nTo just for a moment and then we'll look what'd you get back to what you were doing um could you kind of uh expound upon what we were travelling or was it just something that came through you and were you able to ascertain some definite things that the school was trying to tell if\nYou'd have to repeat give me what what ...\n[laughter] that's what I was thinking that's all I have a\nBoy I have to get something out of the way because otherwise I I had a message for you and I realized in public and I'm trying to\nPut this ...\nTrying to change that would because they just\nDo they have a message strictly for me\nFor you personally yes\nWell go ahead and tell me what the school well when\nYou were um ages so difficult to to me anyway but it's something when you are about seven or eight\nYou experience something that you really have talked about everybody convinced you that it didn't happen and and it basically is that with you for these many years you have to I think\nBoth can about it and I and to tell you this was not this or whatever happens\nWhatever you saw was real and it was\nGiven to you too weak and not the ... of your mind which already is gets opened a greatly and that fear that\nYou experienced is only to do with your ego emotions that are egos and you should push ahead with your need to bring the truth\nI think I understand what the score is trying to tell me I Do and um yeah my wife tells me the same thing Janine of course my wife is very intuitive and sometimes she tells me I'm clouded than I Do it on purpose when she wonders why do this maybe it's\nBecause I'm afraid of expressing all of what I feel and what I Know\nIf you express it sometimes that leaves you up for scrutiny and ridicule wouldn't do and it's not always easy you know when you're trying to\nDo a talk show and you're trying to keep some credibility and tried to because you know people would believe that people don't believe that the experiences of even even with a stranger once on some of the most edit buying one\nAnd a and so yes it's it's certainly a challenge to you know be ...\nAbout a lot of things about me when I was younger and uh yeah it certainly means something to be so careful I think you're like OK I'm going to\nTake a few phone calls and then we'll let you go go to Gordon in Texas I Gordon your own job it was growing up\nOverwhelming this is while this is your Clyde I Love the man I urge young Alex today and ah your
