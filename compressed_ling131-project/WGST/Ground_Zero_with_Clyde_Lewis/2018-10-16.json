Bush when he was in power it's obviously did that and a bronco bottom of the same they were able to ... him as well they did a mall\nOr the only difference between them and Donald Trump is Donald Trump's stubborn\nDonald Trump stubborn and he doesn't know how to play the game of ah you know the deep state politics which is a dangerous thing for him and he doesn't care\nBut what I worry about it as if he doesn't care how does that fair with the American people in the deep state do to try and change all this while we see what they do they they mail rice and out to a out to people to scare them\nThey uh they they go in and they they do these are classic hits you know of a of a noted officials may kill people involved with a certain insight into ideology they that's how it works sixteen states in control so whenever you say about politics however I lean left writer or upside down I don't care\nI Know that there is something above it all there is a sin are above it all but certainly as controlling this country and it's trying to control the world so all we're arguing various ah you know or arguing a over various ideologies that we don't like or that we're thinking we're leaning towards\nYou know the conspiracy is\nThere\nMetal in the affairs of nations all over the world that are struggling to keep their sovereignty\nAnd this is why there are few oligarchs who are willing to buy up in support chaos in the world and this is why we're now seeing in our major cities gang violence mob takeover and radicalized factions within separate strongholds and we're also seeing is on the Internet as well where people can't help them\nCells but to try and be mean to one another because somebody has a different ideologies naidoo\nInstead of being a little bit more open a little bit more willing to talk things out see the wording of a major collapse the United states is not being heated and it's going on right now because there's so many of the radicalized factions and they're quick to blame each other for the problems in the country I'm not the bad actors on the world stage\nThey wish to see American cities burn and that's where they want to do they want to see American cities burn the truth is there are many Americans that have been touched by the secret hyper power who wants to further the coaching covered a seizing of world controls against the wishes of the majority\nThe psychological damage has been done to this country\nWill take a generation or more to change and that if you're a people will stop and realize they've all been victims of massive notes

I brought up those ... says story\nOr when I did my show the other night uh when I was talking about uh what was happening in Portland\nOr we had over the weekend we had a the the rival ah groups get together and fight in downtown Portland and so uh it was a certainly you know unnerving to things that I had to stay out again and do work\nOr because of the fact that uh they needed someone to go wall to wall and I'm not complaining because I I Want to be in on the ah I Want to be in on the secrets I Want to know about the big things are being planned I Want to know\n'em I Want to know who's involved and why and so I brought up this book called possess the devil's in the book was written by a ...\nAnd off it was pre revolutionary a it where it needed details that the middle class society would be destroyed through a crackdown on dissent\nThan islands expected a revolt in a way to the time where the people would rise to the occasion and give the power structure a reason to pounce on

to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain basically giving this power structure heartening to resolve the power structure to literally come in and clean house\n\nYou know began and does the U.S he's book it began with the silencing of the people the silencing of those people who are putting forth to the fired state power\nThat happen you know they went and they shut down they shut down the you know the printing presses they shut down or you know journalists silencing people\nTheir free speech the freedom of the press everything taken from them and little by little information became scarce and the result was a ferocious anger that erupted in several fires destroyed the main city then came the flashpoint a will to power that ended in destruction and violence and it ended up in a huge roar\nOr young people are sacrifice in order to empower the leaders with a blood bond or the blood bond or a blood cement they would hold their grip on a frightened world the American people\nHave actually managed to solidly adapt to intolerant ideologies to dissent all these forms a\nOf of a you know groups that are are supposed to represent neo Nazis and fascists and and then we have the anti fascist and the left wing on ... communism and and all these factions fighting yeah they're thinking there's one side or the other side wouldn't reality that there is no one side of the other side there are several factions within both sides\nAnd everybody's trying to identify them is one thing but you can't anymore\nI mean what are your conscious of it or not\nYou can say that doing this dividing and fighting is anti liberty it really turns out to be very difficult for the media to understand her except that's why they say well we have these guys over here that are out right and we have these counterprotesters the outright they never say who they are\nI'd never I mean maybe I can find someplace by every time I have never heard anti far being spoken up\nBy the media and you know the only ones I hear about are Proud Boys in antifa but there's also others and you know\nWe have to learn and we have to remember that there are two main dangers to liberty right now one that comes from the left and when that comes from the right and that is this bond receive from the Warren groups of the city's literally\nAdapting this blood Samantha back in time in Germany and Hitler was blue kites they call the book the kite balloons kite demeaning blood Senate meaning that the leaders would commit acts of accent of murder and violence and the others would follow suit\nAnd that's what's happening now we have a little blue kite going on in in the deep state certainly is breathing this boots kite\nAnd we are\nHaving a little something called fascism and and ah\nAnd fighting a this is this is how we do terrorism American style is is that we do civil and civility or\nInstability he was released in civility uh American style\nI mean\nYou know the jak boots of course are coming from our own people now be enforced has their own people police show up I mean this guy stand there and wait kind of a referee between the factions fighting\nBut here we are following in the footsteps of or well we're following the footsteps of do CFC we're following in the footsteps of all these guys you forewarned us it's\nThe way I mean given all we know about what's going on and given all we know about the new world order and what it's going to do and what the new I mean this is this is the example of new world order it trade citizens like faceless statistics\nAnd economic units to be bought sold a barter traded in tracked\nIt lies the system why is it cheap to steal the spies it kills\nBreaks laws over reaches authority abuses its power almost

think this is going to suffer on day for world be state players indeed to anyone who's been paying attention to the goings on in the world it's increasingly obvious that\nWere already under a new world order and it's being brought to you by the global industrial deep state which is a powerful ... ball made up of international government agencies and corporations and I don't know how you defined I find that it's worldwide fascism\nAnd it's something that uh I think we need to we need to be aware of as a country together agreeing to the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this order that wants to take over to go to Jack in California hijacked or on ground zero\n[noise] ... yeah this is a interesting story but there's a couple of things that just didn't ring true to me about how do you pronounce his name ...\n... like I had known to show ... junkie show ... ... you know\nSo you had the Turks came out ...\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise] well if they knew that these guys were there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stop them so I think you have\nA the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is have you ever heard of a of any nation states sending Fifteen people to do it yet I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill him and the more people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong\nSo the story from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump is a between a rock and a hard spot now because you're coming up on the mid term elections\nAnd they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you could see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly\nAnd the price of gasoline would skyrocket would have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame them for a bad economy\nAnd the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot this hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of worldwide deep state manipulation it is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump is about everyone else is going to be affected admits domino occurrence\nWould this is this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go bust\nWell\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy wish it were to look\nAt another indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to moral can be a very bad day in the stock market if if this thing somehow starts to escalate\nNow how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ...\nIs a Saudi citizens and he was actually in a Saudi embassy which makes him on Saudi territory we have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states is of no consequence the president and states has really no authority\nTo retaliate against Saudi Arabia but yeah I watch him get pressured to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to lead the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey and said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and they flew his remains I Can't remember where they put him too but uh they flew him out of the country\nFlight if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it will\nProbably do the same reason ah you said that he was in ah he was a in Saudi Arabia territory they can get in there and embassy and do anything about it\nWell but you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey held the argument the CIA was facilitating operation deep laid off are you the argument that he said operatives the IRA for facilitators to the murder of this uh uh of of cars Yogi\nAnd of course Saudi Arabian a or B said operators were involved here as well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too but what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more can be gives the Trump is pressure to do anything\nIt's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring up a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that could happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you wouldn't want an incident is an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia\nThat's the thing that I have a feeling do need to do that while I have a feeling though that's what they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you've got ... and who certainly was a signatory\nIt's not okay listen the makers of super beta

I mean this could do it\nLooking at I think we have to look at turkey airborne the and the and the shaky footing or the wall is on with his accounting me\nDropping you know like a raw right [noise]

think though that would happen in fact probably not as much of effect is maybe you know\nTen dollars at the pump by I mean but I always get into this fear that some somebody would wake up to ten dollars a month because it's something we've done or something is happening\nAnd I don't know the the the the world down anything is possible anything we speculate about the past is coming true it it's just weird how you know and and it can you imagine how much division would happen if we found ourselves in a in a moment of scarcity\nWhat am I talking about ... weeks ago with what the Henry

they need to make their dense in ... they need traumatize enough to be ready because they're ... they're due date is twenty thirty that's\nWhere they've been saying that due date is twenty thirty and then from there who knows but the the beginnings of what they want to establish and what they want to put forward a and that is a a conspiracy to destabilize the United states\nOf America to George and Kentucky Hi George you're on ground zero\nHey I have my foot here scenario world that I think you're right about the eight states but what about the situation with with Trump we've never seen a

acknowledge the fact that there are other presidents have had the ability to do with Trump does\nAnd what he's doing now if we destabilize the country when these elections come up and I don't think this election is going to be a major but I think the next one coming up is it ... all of a sudden with these stabilized\nWith this tape stay involved in all this Trump is going to be put himself in a situation where he's going to say we're going to hold off on elections and we'll just carrying the turtle until we stabilize the country\nDo you have the war so this is what they thought Obama was going to do this where they thought George Bush was going to do they didn't do it so you would think that Trump would be stupid enough to suspend election so that I\nKnow it's not stupid if you think
