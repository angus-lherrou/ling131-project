made this point with her about two weeks ago then I'm\nOf course a man and you may be a woman but if you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man\nYour father was a man what kind of feelings damn towards your husband and your dad your brothers are male what kind of feelings damned toward them and you may have male children or grandchildren you want to live in a world where because of your gender\nYou're automatically just believed or believed in other words every now and then a woman lives and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up there was a line to be ... merged between the me too movement on one hand and went on a ... percent acceptance on the other\nThe fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney a take off my hat and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar eyes or a victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault naturally want to believe that person\nBut then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says that person is due process rights because that is the rigorous reaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth\nAnd make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor forward through a any rigorous process that determined that Bush was saying was actor now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people that attacked or what had happened how it happened that how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was a kind of hard the fearing to fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out in ... she was a safe\nAnd some of these other factors come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally is not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says just save it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and at one end not because she needed an extra way out but because a small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door\nThat had nothing to do it costs for phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying wait for little planes all over French Polynesia and ... and uh Hawaii we also went on trips to Central America South America and Europe she had no fear of flying it was a lie\nPessimistic about America right now but the way this this mob\nRule mentality is leaving us down a path to what President Lincoln face as soon as he took office Nineteen sixty one and that\nIs what I Am afraid of I'm not afraid of democratic control of the house for the Senate or the presidency I'm afraid of civil war and we're on that path and then let these people get checked somewhere and I'm not talking about suppression of vote so I'm not talking about\nThe limitations of their First Amendment rights I'm Talking about\nThem actually getting control without any facts\nTo serve born there their case without anything else they will stop at nothing when Democrats and and we're aggressive liberals in this day and twenty eight team came out with at the ballot box think of the court to they get one of the courts they go to the streets if he can't win in the streets the next thing is buddy revolution\n... years yet before we go to bed tonight part of the Drudge Report Michael good one who writes for a New York or newspapers has a great column about the coming second civil war read that we got to run take a look let's continue\nLet's go now to Mike in Wisconsin Mike in Wisconsin welcome to the bill Cunningham show Mike how are you\nA great really how are you good really I think we need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller because prior maybe at it that was in its firing phone cut because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side\nHow are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways [noise] number three I think are people like Brian saw\nNot only dishonest they are downright evil they will do nothing to get a power number two that Democrats look socialist progress is incapable of analyzing fact whether it be about climate change or whether it be alive that that Dr Ford present it in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie\nI Want to be ... say they're misconceptions\nBut damn it they were alive because she lied about flying she lied about the second front door she lied about the four boys became one she lied about or late teens now it's Fifteen she lied about the fact that was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learn and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like that is by\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell I talked to college hats off to Lindsey Graham about that political force is the only way that we are going to pick up and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by brute winning forced by beating about\nGhana when you've got to vote you got to you know Schumer said one thing Saturday that was correct you got to vote it down or if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere is no Democrats hardly any word is this the of read from the the shining see it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone and the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president\nThey didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts you there and look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAnd from Notre Dame and when that\nHappens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... major maker you watch that fight\n[noise] really didn't get a thank you today here\nEric Holder who still contempt of Congress you say that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of the of the Supreme Court let me see Billy the last ... years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never questioned malignancy of a prominent but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate\nThere's a confirmation all of a sudden they end up and say we've got to question the whole legitimate process do you recall outrageous\nDo recall in the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media had a meltdown when Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results ed ... elections if he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary plant the New York times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought accord sailor was going to win\nMeant Trump won and up to this point\nHillary in the mainstream media has not accepted the outcome of the election and so they became what if he criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election because it looked like it it's rigged however the media went after him Hillary went after him Hillary said let's be clear about what are you saying and and that means he's talking down American democracy\nAnd I'm appalled that someone is the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton\nBut then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election should never accepted the ballot box\nNew York times never accepted the fact that Trump won\nSo they became what they criticize it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your call let's continue now with a Joe and New Hampshire it's been there for about an hour\nShow in New Hampshire welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead\nI could Mr Cunningham is taking my call um agree with everything that's been said prior to ... and your summation of everything so there's no need for me to repeat any of that but what I'm calling you about tonight is so important have you ever heard of Jonathan\nSigning his book code red about a ... vote and racial fraud in American history of the cities\nI I think that there is\nA bunch of him example in the city of Cleveland there were more votes cast for Obama than citizens registered and certain words and it's because the\nBecause Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York and whatever\nBut Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there's hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance 'cause there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're a code red China concern would be an excellent guess for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and the ... and the companies that are only three or four the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine is program where the Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast Republican has an actual votes cast machine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance\nAnd the person that runs the city the Democrats in most cases they're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballots terms who's on the ballot what have you on the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm what would a\nWaiver from Republican to add to the Democrats\nOr give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon and the book is code red and he was a guest on coast to coast a month ago when George ... he was on her three hours and it was really riveting and it's been happening for a decade\nI Can't imagine a worst representative and Debbie Stabenow and she's running against a a black Republican is he going to get a lot of African American vote or not\nBut I Hope so although um I did not vote for him because that right side of things about him\nAnd I need to
