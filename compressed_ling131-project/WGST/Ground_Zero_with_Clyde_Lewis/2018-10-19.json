perspective without letting anyone know bits equally tucked away and all of our utility drawers he's a tin foil hat that will probably where it because we know that no one truly live to the university this will be objective\n\nI mean what we're seeing limited concepts of time we're hearing\nAbout how there are different dimensions we're hearing about their different ways of thinking we're hearing that you know we're hearing in the quantum immortality I mean science is basically going all\nParanormal\nAnd they want to quantify all the paranormal limits scientific ways scientific way like ah they want to be halfway we'd be religion they want to eat half way with the conscious that they want to do ... and this is where I've spoken to bore about how\nHere we are\nTo ship this ... this was a a major paradigms\n\nAnd we have a temporal blind spot in some regard because events happened or we perceive they do\n\nAnd then later when you're a school on the idea that everything we perceived\nAs wrong\nIs that what we think we know is not exactly what is that somehow we reach a point where we're satisfied with their opinion and then all of that it's based on his bowl nebula stimuli we all agree that the students like this is my opinion and this is my truth and you say\nIt's not true it's just what you think it is see it's all about your selective perception\nAnd we know that selected perception is necessary because we didn't have selective perception we wouldn't be transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory overload we're now getting today our brains are being filled with all sorts of sensory overload thing about it we have simple perceptions of light light light love survival spirituality God you know\nAnd then we're exposed to a media print television Internet videogames cell phones many other things that you know that are pushing the brain further and further\nAnd all that stimulus his place in a limited area known right there and compartmentalize area called the brain we don't know if the brain is limitless and we have we learned that in old age would boost memory\nAnd we lose perception of time I mean the brain can be objective if it chooses to however it's emotion that is driving these guys and so there's this war going on between the brain and subjective experience and this is what they\nCalled the explanatory gap where we've had to bridge the brain conscious is experiencing motion critical announces we're struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experiences worth feeling it all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\nAnd of course\nNow we experienced a virtual meeting hyper reality from electronic allusion\nIt's unfortunate that we're seeing more and more people\nResponding to the electronic illusion they're becoming a non player they're becoming a person who just sits there and watch it watch things or you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script that it is to follow the follow their own hearts follow their own mind\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting for team right now\nOver what George Orwell called double speak double speak actually disguises the nature of the truth\nGiving new meaning to words would would appear to be scripted dialogue and it's provided by the party and it's never ending propaganda that keeps pushing and pushing and pushing see many people who live there not had the the time nor the guess desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four\nOr by George Orwell usually you know they say things like a big brother's watching you ride ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they know a few lines right\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones were groom to follow the wishes the ministry of love\nThe George Orwell was a

the newest beamed and it appeared on Twitter and Facebook and they seem to be a form of kind of propaganda against the liberal left\nOut\nAnd NBC is a mean there are there are and the season games

NBC's bad sign missions to a player like skyrim\nOr they joined the players a companion like in fall out but they create is NBC mean\nAnd what it is is that it's basically there to um to attack or a mock what it's called left wing propaganda\nAnd I think ... cleverly I I think it's being used cleverly to explain what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like fascism\nWhere it's like not seeing overused outright connections to the KKK and the NBC me mocks left us and they make it the base of getting expressionless face is kinda like um\nA statement face and it it ... and and you can see these things on Twitter read it in for Chan and over the weekend twin responded by suspending more than Fifteen hundred accounts associated with the NBC name as they claim it violated the

they started using the term and PC\nThree for the liberals and these people said well they said that you know they joined the anti Trump crowd because they're sheep\nThey're brainwashed she that's what they believe in and they'd been conditioned to parrot left wing orthodoxy in the matter of scripted characters so you look at one of these and PCs they're basically\nThis crudely drawn great

...\nThere was a message and I read this message too and uh it is a a a message of someone who's very frantic\nAnd they say this stop please I did not believe in magic at first I thought it was all a big joke then Trump won the primary\nAnd I thought hey that's a coincidence then he became the candidate and I thought things were getting weird now Hillary he's getting sick again I Know you know she's she's been coughing and they've been getting it on on on on TV lately\nAnd the thing is is that this all goes back to Pepe the frog which was a character that they were using to a ... that was I guess a precursor to the un PC and\nThey're saying you're you are at being with the fabric of reality this is a black magic\nPlease stop you are happening with powers you don't understand if you keep this up you could me must all out of existence [laughter]\nChristian go I I mean is this a form of black magic I mean I thought about that you know I never did talk about Pepe the frog\nAnd the reason why is because I looked at me the frog represented a lot of people had mixed mixed feelings about Barry ... was another one of these meetings where they used to be to represent a lot of things from\nRacism to what have you it was kind of a just a stupid frog but it was a menacing of the medicine type of me now they have the ... this balding it looks like actually one of the characters ... that kind of dreamed up\n\nWell you know what's interesting is um it's central magic as you mentioned before and essential is when an outcome Mr Black magician will take a series of letters or symbols\nAnd you may not necessarily recognize them but I notice that this Pepe the frog guy he\nWas he was drawn very strangely just like these NBC's The NBC means are drawn very strangely now I'm not that familiar with the cold symbolism but I'm pretty sure that if you look at ... work or something like that you can find something similar with a similar type of symbol\nIt's being blasted on the human consciousness over and over and over again\nAs a matter of fact I'm Crowley how\nTo spell that he used to do and this was something that he was very famous for him he used to be able to take control of the body of one of these on PCs and he was why there's a story of him walking down the street with a some prime minister or something like that and he says watch this\nAnd he points to the guy in front of him any needles down and the guy in front of them starts kneeling down almost as he is controlling them like a puppet\nNow if one person can do this imagine what's going on through the Internet through the mainstream media so on and so forth and people have lost their ability to think I mean if I can take a political here for just a moment I'm coming into this\nSelection I've just been so jaded by the oligarchy that we've had that I thought I was just going to be the same BS coming through the pike and then when Trump got it I was still a little skeptical but I'm looking at Trump and thinking wow I Can't find any fault in this guy\nI mean you know I don't agree with everything he does but considering what we've had in the past Trump is has actually done a really good job the only thing I can fault him for is that he likes to eat a steak well done with ketchup which to me I think should be an impeachable offense to ruin an iguana fake like\nThat I mean you look at it ... times but you know he's the president and I mean president said act that way before I mean Bush act like one Cheney was a bigger one I mean I mean Cheney for president\nBut the thing is we're not

you've got a hundred and forty four thousand divided by two\nSixteen get you sick sick sick thick thick thick thick thick thick fat it's an item to divided by three two thirds point six six

part\nOf the matrix system wherein so even God who is the probably the most intelligent program or we have no it was the power of means symbols numbers and coats\n\nAnd this is why tonight the argument that we're making Chris geometry driller on the program Dr ... the argument that we're making is that we live in a matrix and the reason why is because in PCs\nNon playing characters are easily programmed to put the organics the ones that are ... they use a when I say critical analysis of the ones that will not be programs and they are the ones\nThat are going to try and pull us out of whatever it is rent otherwise we'll be mesmerized by this online magic Chris geo will go back to ground zero it's good to have a year\n[noise] um let me finish up this point I was making real quick about the politics because here we have the mainstream media\nI'm putting out a program and the program has been racist racist racist racist thrown at the White House right and then all of a sudden Kanye West shows up and he has this meeting at the er at the White House and what I saw\nWas the dissolve meant of the left's agenda 'em to divide on race and then the mainstream media turns around and uses a derogatory term against ...\nThat I Will not repeat on this brought the N. word but it\nIt go ... and ... to show how this script all of a sudden change\nTell what it All right have you ... did you see the the the the traffic is being blocked in Portland the anti five members were blocking and directing traffic well guy pulls up in a car\nAnd some guy who was holding a plate of tacos I don't know why but he was with the group and he started yelling at the guy goes you look like a Whitey I bet you're a Whitey orange and he says to him I'm gonna go on this guy's a white guy calling another guy all Whitey same with whatever it was ... we have a a a blackface\nWas in ... seat on uh CNN calling ... n word that can read his what he said\nExactly and so all of a sudden what happened is that the script just changed on the PCs and they don't know how to handle this and it just goes to show they're just running a script or that they've been pre programmed with\nSo um you were talking about numbers and number ... symbolism and numbers play a big big role in this you were talking about the ... and PC means the way the means or ... and so on and so forth I mean there are so many different levels that we can take this too and I'm\nFrom what direction do we break this down in because well I just it's huge I just want to point\nOut that parents can actually called me and this was before this is like now in Nineteen Ninety this is\nTen Twenty years before this time that we're in right now he's he called the mean\nThe smallest unit of an idea that still has coherent see and what a genius to biology I mean it's to ideology and so you need a lawn chair mean boldly and see if that will replicate Jess like jeans replicate and in fact and move into the organism that society and the leading as I Do that society operates on a kind of\nBiological economy then I Believe these means are the key to societal evolution\nAnd you see with within PCs I I\nJust have to say it's almost like they they don't understand how to even make means is that it doesn't make any sense to him or to send them in some way whereas the organics are\nFull of them and and constantly creating these means and they really do change our society and drastic ways very quickly\nWell maybe I could use some other magical terms of people are more familiar with like top as a there's a ... a mind form that is that when you manifested becomes an ... which is of course another recalled concept which is a thought form or a collective group mind\nMaking a thought form that becomes a ton of it's kind of like slender man okay I I Would say this litter man's kind of an egg regards Letterman and really\nThe sentiment is is fictional he was made on the Internet okay but he becomes real when two little girls lower another girl into a playground and ... and stab her because they say that this this egg records that serving a master whichever the master the creator is is\nActually influencing these girls to go and kill something so that's what you got you got a a mean you have a toll on you have an ... and those things are are set out to grow and to become either monsters or or just serve\nAnd once again ... the ... says the same thing and what is the un PC mean it is the bald the you know ... basically does the will of its master\nRight exactly and it it really it's it's one of those start changing devices that that as a result it's the backlash\nAgainst this these autonomy and that in the auto autonomous I guess you could say\nOr anti autonomy thinking process that just totally dissolves any boundaries that that that whenever the media or whatever the the whoever's in control of all this is putting out it dissolves all of that in a in a\nSplit second and it and if that's what makes them so angry about this when ever people do come up with means that really did change people's minds and it really quick way\nThis is you know even more ancient manager let's go back to the Jews okay let's go back to ... what was going but he was a a it was an animated anthropomorphic being made of clay that was there to protect it was a monster that was created to protect the Jews pretty much it was there to protect the children to Prague\nAnd and so ah they created this this this creature out of clay uh he was harmless to to ah those he was a made for but he would attack those who are trying to attack them\nAnd and so this is the same principle it's the idea of creating\nAn Internet gum creating an Internet her monkey was an Internet tool or an Internet Edgar Gore\nIf people you know they don't understand the meanings of means means are certainly like this they are the thought forms that when when they are unleashed they can cause trouble they can call it causes ill will once again goes back to what Chris has been saying is is if it's so easy to create a central\nParents love of the game will come\nThrough scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nWas never that go to the bull by the time we go\nBut he also learned how to give them a lot of money on ... which\nIs your story has a happy ending after\nAtlanta jingle twenty Eighteen

times the most iconic brand and the booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peeled now pie times back\nAnd then pretty soon realized that this whole divide between us has been systematically programs within the matrix to keep us fighting with each other while they continue to manifest all of these realities that they once\nBut really the power lays inside each and every one of us to manifest our own reality as I said before I have the CIA document in my hand called\n'em and now it's just an assessment of gateway process and it shows you how to manifest the reality around you\nSo by realizing that we are in a matrix realizing that you have the power inside of you to manifest your own reality what I always tell people as we look at the the huge mountain it's in front of us you know in the church or community and the media community you know all of that and we want to change the world but\nThat's impossible we can't change the world all we can do\nIs just change ourselves but what we can do also as we can pick up a rock and move a single rock and then we can show somebody else how to move another rock and pretty soon that entire mountain starts to change that strong\nLittle by little you know I always used to say I used to be a slogan a you know getting the truth about one mind to a time and it it just seemed to me that that was you know that was spinning back then but now it's the idea of\nBreaking through this except that emotional by us and getting that out of the ways that we can get down to the bottom of what really is true but the dirty ugly truth\nBut it's supposed to set us free but I say hey you know what what you find out it'll pick you up at the end the process so you've got to be careful of what is truth in what you the truth is\nAnd get rid of the confirmation bias it's all part of the program and it's all part\nOf exploiting the N.

hey wait a minute my going crazy here and that's the process that I went through when I started breaking down the matrix I started asking myself am I crazy is this no system and bringing out from Iraq consciousness really lining up and then what happens is I come across book after book after book that's basically saying the exact same thing\nIn a very different language um but we're putting it all in modern terms it's\nIt's amazing I never would've thought that we would be breaking these levels of consciousness or that we would even be waking up to the holographic nature of reality but when science is backing it up ancient books are backing it up\nAnd now we have these means that are floating around and you know these and PC mean sure they're being targeted to the left but it's rooted in some kind of truth I mean it comes from somewhere and that's the reason why it spreads so so so heavily\nAnd the programming is breaking the them at the matrix is breaking and if I can get one more example of how the matrix is breaking\nInto glitches um we have all of these men tell effects where people were genuinely believe that loop I Am your father existed in Star Wars I remember Lou ... her father mirror mirror on the wall um in Snow White doesn't exist in this timeline people look at it from timeline shifts and so on and so forth\nI Would say that it's updates coming from this artificial intelligence within the matrix that's hitting our brains and the update simply are not sticking anymore and so you have a big portion of the population that remembers ... things the way they were before the matrix was updated\nWhile at the same time you had the MP sees that are being updated almost on a daily basis especially through a that data way states that they put themselves in
