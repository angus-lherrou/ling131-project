I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're in depth and you need help cold trinity a one eight hundred three six three five one three seven\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I look at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life would go way\nCommunity will consolidate your accounts to the one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands what I Would\nBut I'm beginning to realize something in that he is I I should have done this a long time ago on my show but I think the reason why I did it because I didn't think it would be a popular thing to do but now I don't care if it's popular or not\nBecause I had made a commitment\nTo all of you to be truthful to tell the truth can be as honest as I can be with my radio program\nAnd that he is\nAnd I know there's a drinking game out there so please get your drinks ready when I was in South America that I Lived there and I lived there in the middle of well it was every event in the middle of his towards the end of their civil war there was there the dirty war but it was more of a civil war\nI saw civil war in a whole new light it was different than the two sided civil war we had in the Eighteen hundreds it was or something else which civil war in contemporary time it was it was civil war\nIn a in a in a major city\nAnd when I say when the Saudis I'm sure many of you think that it's just some backward city in South America no it's it's actually a South America is Spain or France or or it it had the feel of Italy or France or or Spain or any other European cities it's it's an amazing city very uh urban very uh\nAdvance but an advanced technologies there\nBecause they tried to bow down there seemed to work down there they do they move up here sometimes it's the other way around\nAnd so\nThe biggest concern for\nA lot of Americans is what's going to happen to this country what was going on and when you speak of bike civil upheaval in civil war and you\nSay to yourself well it's not there yet or we should people have said quite it's not there yet but I'm Wondering you know duty know did they ever lived through one do we know what it's like to live in one\nAnd\nSaid to myself that maybe I've waited too long to talk about the reality and and and how we're smack dab in the middle of a reality that is out of\nControl I mean we have new laws ... executive orders that pretty much enable the president\nTo act would be really she Powers Act I mean he could make plans any time to just\nArrest people you know and I've heard the rumors that that's probably in the works some sort of a\nArrest structure somehow they're going to go after they're just making the plans to see a big illegally go after people who've been creating problems in this country that would be a more or less involved with what I call this this this island or this or you know very soft coup\nOr there's the soft espionage or you know it's all it's all get soft espionage soft coup\nOther behaviors with a you know certain people\nAnd how uh you know they they they try to say that it's a constitutional behavior when it's not I mean look\nI Know that if you say that if you say well maybe the president's planning on doing that she's planning on exposing all the way back to twenty sixteen some of the problems we have even during the Obama administration even before that the Bush administration or a response to that would be well here we have political sour grapes\nAnd the political sour grapes you get political splinter groups and with political splinter groups you get the uh marginalizing fragmentation of our republic\n\nAnd believe it or not it's a fragmentation of our republic to destroy them they will destroy us for sure\nAnd there will not be and there is not I repeat there is not a unanimous front against an abusive government does unanimous front against ourselves\nAnd we're easily exploited easily exploited by political Jagger nuts that have been hijacked by neo\nCons anarchist socialists anti five black lives I go down the list\nOkay and the media basically\nAll the American people like sheep and it being joiner is and what they're doing is they're basically encouraging what I call divisive colds\nAnd these groups have nothing to further the cause of change it solves the entire process as it appears to be mired\nIn nothing but fanaticism\n\nWere stuck in this Myra fanaticism is beyond protest signs and pepper spraying people camping in parks or a pepper spraying the homeless or what have you or feeling here in America\nIs it it's wise to have a gun\nOr everybody's saying the gun violence should be curbed that you should you know revisit the second amendment there are many people who say that that are still wanting armed\nSecurity and they think it's wise to be armed to have a gun concealed carry the overall feeling in the United states is if you don't have at least\nA gun then you should have at least some stored food batteries radios you'll become swallowed up into the onslaught of attacks in the homeland from an unseen enemy but be unseen enemy has been seen we're identifying the enemy all the time the enemies within and the enemy is among all of us\n\nBack or what was it um yes if you years ago\nActually show this program I says I think it's wise to know and and find out just to your neighbors are\n\nAnd I said you know maybe we shouldn't organizer neighborhoods on her own or the or else someone will come into it for us\n\nBecause the cloud that hangs over the United states now\nIs it no group is safe unless it's legally armed organized overly advocating return of more localized government state constitution rules against the federal government run 'em up [noise] um\nI remember it was a civil war of the Eighteen hundreds that brought us the bloodiest conflict on American soil and that was our first war veterans right there\nYou actually they were having Lincoln an Eighteen sixty was the final straw for many southerners in an all eleven states or their religion states ... succeeded from the union for these Virginia Arkansas North Carolina Tennessee did not succeed until after the battle for Sumpter that occurred on April twelve fifty sixty one five additional states where border slave states\nThey didn't succeed for the union Missouri Kentucky West Virginia Maryland Delaware\n\nNow we're not talking about the session tonight I'm not even though there are a number of\nStates suits that basically said they want it to you know form their own governments maybe like California's been what they want to separate the three states and in Texas has always been wanting to get out of the union and they have a you know the constitution says they can\n\nBut Americans have been angry with government from from way back I mean\n... when Obama was president they wanted us to see now with Trump president they want us to see if they want to but they say they want to move to Canada and all this other stuff but if he thought that this trivial pap it'd be like just right out there to make themselves look important\nBut\nA lot of this has to do with the end of the the the thought that ah there's a part in the declaration of independence I want to jump to a historically an actor but I think it's um there's a I'm\nA part of the declaration of independence that says something big governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends\nIt is the right of the people to alter abolish it and Institute a new government\nAnd endgame an endgame statistics from homeland security can make one feel a little paranoid because the focus according to the new intelligence stated that anyone in the end even point out right wing extremist libertarians there more than likely

decorum\nAnd I mean once you get one foot boat was made there were still doing it is if you know this was going to change anything what you do have lick your wounds and you move on and you try to find another thing but you want to\nIf the Republicans rule the Senate\nAnd his group of both liberals and conservatives in this country than are borderline psychotic and they resorted to screaming and climbing up the doors like animals or better yet like zombies trying to get into government buildings as British reading confirmations or voted upon\nSomebody called me and said was disingenuous receipt of conservatives are doing it well no not really yes liberals are doing it more so we're seeing more of the liberals doing it because of the unpopular votes and the unpopular choices that they don't particularly like yes they are going psychotic\nBut there are some that are responding dinner justice psychotic they the those are the right to responding so\nYes everyone is driving a nail into the cockpit of America\nMore so one side to the other teams actions that we're ... we're basically motivated by sure emotionally now been motivated by fearless rage it's beyond emotion now it's all about right and this is getting dangerous why that would be proven to tell people\nThat perhaps it's time to heal and choose our battles no one will listen because there are been dead has to be settled and revenge is a dish but his best serve cold in America\nYou whenever I speak of civil war ... civil of people in America I often get told that it will never get that bad quiet and then I fear mongering for the sake of quakes are ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back to people\nBut it certainly cynics better there in order to keep telling yourself into America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed and it living through a civil war in South America can teach you what to expect and\nIt just a real experience but I talked about that in the first hour\n\nI mean I Want to make it clear that during the civil war in a modern days in a modern city modern needs to be like when I ...\n\nI mean life was normal except for little things would make you wonder if you would make it through the day\nOr if you will be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine the United states the civil war would be similar except that we have the Internet that's the difference they I mean the outbreak of a civil war in the United states would look all that different\nTo the normal news cycle regularly you know and that's the thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different to the normal news cycle and what they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean it begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\n\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city or directed at Congress or to the president\n\nI Know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but it certainly sent the ball rolling\nBecause there was a political attack using rice and a poison that was aimed at certain people including the president the United states if they would have sent all that their members of Congress we would have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attacks happened in two thousand one after nine eleven attacks\nShall we have the right to the fact that happened just before the cabinet vote\n\nWe talked about the Russian each called an al ... tried to use biological warfare is a way to get people not to vote or to somehow change the direction political you have an area here in in Oregon I mean these are simple politically motivated attacks\nAnd these attacks are usually ... posted not only change directions politically but they're also there to generate copycat attacks\n\nAnd these can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash they're simply done in order to provoke a response if there were sponsors overwhelming and police department's going to keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent and the domino effect you shouldn't play\nThe military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable this will be your martial law scenario except it will either be the military working within already militarized police or the police working against the military\n\nThere also be restrained to start with how or if\nIf if there is an insurgency there will be some re straight at first but then the insurgency military weapons martial law all these things can be applied to a situation I\nDon't know if they'll go that far but it can be applied I mean there's a misconception but in a modern civil war there'll be two sides\n\nAnd the reason why we think is is because we look back in history and we all know that it was the union believed to be into less slavery and the confederation really being more slavery but\nMost people are thinking right now but if there was a civil war in the United states it would be two sided\nAnd that's it like Republican against Democrat conserve against liberal know about how it's going to be a stop when civil war will be in the United states if this happens no it's not modern civil war would have many so called\nSight seeing the dirty war in South America there were several sides were fighting there were the parent is kind of nice there's the radicals are out of college the communist coming east of the Nazis the Catholic Church the Jews voted to the police the moderate than a plaza I could go down all the list of who are fighting against to\n\nThe age group would have their own band if terrorists carrying out executions abductions and torture of\nCourse the government had access to the police they had access to corrupt cops had access to ... military and so of course the government utilize them whenever they could the church would utilize them as well\nYour poll by the way was part of that group\nFeeding America we'd have a left wing group incite violence or insurgency that which Marco response from black lives matter or me too but all eyes would be an anti far because they're usually\nThe ones that carry out all the stuff on this stuff hits the fan\nOver the weekend there was a vigil in Portland, Oregon for Patrick ... there was a black man\nWho was shot by police afterwards members of anti block streets directed traffic getting harassed drivers in other people the police looked on it allowed to harassment to happen it was horrible\n\nAnd elderly man who made the mistake of not following orders of anti pot what's called a racist at a Nazi among other things and there was chased down by an angry mob when they proceeded to use ... times and other weapons the damages vehicle\nThe police flipped on\nDriver since he was following two other cars that made a right hand turns instead of a left when one protester stepped in front of his car and the other surrounding the demand was out numbered probably scared and did not know what he did wrong the truth is he did nothing\nWrong and it could have wound up\nWith him being beaten shot once again the police looked on didn't do anything didn't intervene\n\nYeah I got about three thousand dollars worth of damage done to his car\n\nOnce again in the civil war breaks out there that are here or in the United states would not be two sides fighting\nWe can see hundreds of sides with hundreds of agendas yearning and fighting for independence\nYou see\nYou see this on social media especially Facebook where the algorithm pumps endless part is an emotional garbage in your piece is every day every single day and then people jumped to Twitter to Duke it out some of them take their aggressions out on people\n\nEvery event in this country is becoming socially radicalized by the mainstream of social media if there was a school shooting the tragedies radicalized through a gun debate deadly fires and hurricanes are not so much about lots of property in life it's about climate change rally the troops about climate change\nTV shows get radicalize Roseanne becomes a political football football players dealing becomes a major political issue\nRobert Deniro says F Trump during

I I grew up in the northwest I I'm not\nI'm not used to seeing this type of brutality nor am I never thought that I'd be it'd be a receding into brutality and and that's the thing is that no you don't think you're going to be affected by this and then when you are affected by this it comes home to you and you're like going what the hell what is going on in this country and it it just\nAnd what it is that it it's the reality of the fact that people are angry there fighting and every different factions fighting against the other thing can be just great to do that we're doing our patriotic duty to be asked clowns to one another and it's not working TJ it's not working at all we have emotional zombies grabbing doors\nIn the meantime we continue to feel that the news just tightening the water is boiling and we seem to have a problem expressing just how we're hearing words and phrases that create a schism in the brain and now the confused as to point to the point where we're we're we're frightening terrified\nCivil war civil war\nNo one wants to admit it but we are right now I Believe in a civil war\nIt's time to stop saying that it's not happening because it doesn't affect you directly it\nIs happening the media is playing into it social media is playing into it and just because it hasn't been declared we can say that isn't happening here it is happening here\nThe civil war we are in now\nIs that two sides fighting against each other even though there are two sides but liberal and conservative that are fighting against one another\nAnd that is that that is the main fight\nBut what we're seeing if somebody is asymmetrical we're seeing something that's\nA patchwork of affiliated in surgery or insurgency groups and we have counterparts engaging in fights in skirmishes along overlapping edges of other networks that are demanding your support your attention occasional\n... and then this leads to occasional high value terror attacks windows terror attacks happened there turned into political radicalization points about things like gun control\nThings like immigration\nAnd it's not just that we're radicalized that were radicalized with TV shows Roseanne makes a remark immediately we we turn into a political football they bring back Murphy Brown it's a\nPolitical football capitalistic kneeling a political football\n\nYou know we have a hurricane right

to politically something it radicalized people it's happening\n\nAnd you say well quite known asked me to join the war no they're not going to ask you to join the war that are going to ask you to pick a side because the war itself composing\n\nAnd the thing is if I say one thing we so obviously he thinks like this will know if I say nothing obviously things like that no I'm not taking any side say in general\n\nThis is what we're seeing itself composing there's no official word to be called\nThe wars with it all of us were angry about everything what radicalized about everything we have an opinion about everything but it doesn't seem to be ... or or even a even healed\nAnd the aftermath of course is when we identified the war you're not going to identify it during the war you're identify after the war and that is what historians do\n\nWe take a look at all of the things that we can say we're little skirmishes ... and little ideological or fights we had Charlottesville\nBerkeley Las Vegas and what's going on here in my my city is it is just it's terrifying all fronts aren't territory and we're not fighting for territory we're fighting for ideological or ideological superiority\n\nJust as rigorous missing the signs of network violence thinking in terms of classic civil war can blind us\nTo the many actors working to disrupt the United states from within and beyond our borders we heard Carlos talking about the rough childhood cirrhosis of the word world we got a benefactor's provocative tours all the guards plutocrats transnational credible criminal networks we have\nA Islam we have a border skirmishes where you have MS Thirteen we are I mean we have everybody\nWants to come here and disrupt the system this is why are you know we always hear about Russia provoking anger this was white George Soros is always the guy that's being said well he's funding move on funding all these other groups\n\nNow if you can think of all these characteristics can you think about how we're all breaking down into like these tribal segments another fragmenting everything you can see that this is what a modern civil war looks like\nMore sporadic and unexpected conflicts but with fewer deaths\nFactions products like mushrooms taking different forest but coordinated across invisible networks waves of information warfare\n\nWe're seeing chaos accelerated ... accelerated bizarre of violence in all kinds of I mean look\nWe have a healthy immune response obviously for the local and national authorities\nThe goal of the civil war is not deaths but the fragmentation republic the goal of the global it's just a will America down to a manageable collective and this would easily your heart and resolve I've been increasingly authoritarian world government and would provide more reason to implement smart city infrastructure in order to maintain full spectrum control\n\nWhen I said get ready for anything prepare for anything I wasn't kidding when I was on Alex Jones I said prepare for a war footing I'm not kidding I don't know if it's brinkmanship with another country I don't know if it's saber rattling I'm no it's right
