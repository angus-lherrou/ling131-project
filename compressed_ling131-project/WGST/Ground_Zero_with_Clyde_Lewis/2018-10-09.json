this harassment which targeted his wife Jamie Gardner on Sunday after he voted for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\nI also said that his family members' names and addresses were publicly posted I mean this is just disgusting this is a campaign of intimidation and nastiness you have the Georgetown professor wishing death and cash ration\nOn Republican senators Cory Gardner his wife in Colorado getting a text message with a link to a be heading\n\nGardener made clear that his decision aback cabinet was ah you know early on\n\nSo he he said he was back have it all this was during the summer when the nomination a first was made and then on friday he said he would vote in favor\n\nAfter there was no evidence with the FBI supplemental investigation nothing that would get them to change his mind\n\nA senator a gardeners said we live in a country where both sides should always be heard victimize women they'd come forward are brave and courageous every victim of abuse assault and violence has been through an unspeakable tragedy and we need to do it\nOr we need to do rather a better job listening to them ensuring supporters available and fighting to end the abuse of any kind I Hope that the partisan divide we all feel today does not hinder the people that have bravely come forward\nA very fine words for for his wife to get\nEach heading video which I don't see how that is not seen as anything\nBut a threat\nI Hope they've turned down over a good see if she got a text message\nI got to believe there's some kind of a phone number attached to I don't know if it's going to go to somebody's actual phone or if it's going to end up going to law burner phone which is going to be untraceable potentially but I I sure as hell hope we ought to call senator Cory gardeners office and asked them\nIf they turn to this information over to the uh\nFBI for an investigation you think I'm done with the the poison pile on cabinet nope not yet still more to come\n[laughter]\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part of rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\n[noise] and she was there for me and ah she did everything she could to support me so I wanted to pull my resource story team to support her and so that's why\nOn the fourth of July I came to the office and I put together a go fund me page for her\nAnd if you've been to the Facebook page you see the Janine is there and I tell the story as to why and how we came to this and the general support there was already been pouring in for Janine is amazing and I'm so thankful and grateful engineered even since her love and thanks for all of the prayers and all of the support\nAnd ah we do have a goal but we're going to try and see if we can surpass that goal because that would give us more incentive to at least get some more things in check that she can use to get better quickly\nAnd and\nWhat we're doing is we're we're ... we're literally having to plan\nKinda ... kinda been a two month way or how to get around all the things that we need to do financially to get out of the situation we're in we're still of course paying on my\nMedical bills from my cancer skill or because of mine was a little more expensive for her is of course we can cover now because of the fact that you know over time you know you're able to beat financial goals but we were coming up short so I wanted to ask\nAnyone out there if you could to go to the go find me pages on my Facebook it's also you can see it on my ah my ground zero site you go there and take a look at that and if you can help contribute to helping my wife\nAnd Liam too you know we keep the family together and and that way we can we can still you know\nWell to provide help to the family\nAnd it's hard to ask that's why I'm having a hard time trying to faces because ... you know I'm dealing with a lot of things right now behind the scenes and it's just it's so good I'm going to tell you this from my heart is so good\nTo know\nThat your loved in that people support families [noise]\n[noise] so that's why I'm going to say about that and um it does my heart good with all the madness in the world [laughter] there are a lot of good people out there that was semi program\nA lot of good people they're looking out for my beautiful white Janine thank you thank you so much Janine says thank you too so I'm going to [laughter] I'm going to let this go just go to my go find me page I put out for Janine help us out please I really appreciate that very much\nCan I show is a is going to be a mind bender for everybody and the reason why it's so fun subject for me ah you know one of the weirder aspects\nOf quantum mechanics could be explained by an equally weird idea but I've always talked about and that's retro causality we're talking about causation that runs backwards in time but then it can also run forwards and time Feinstein\nCame up with the idea of spooky action at a distance quantum mechanics he said that's how you'd be a radical explain or bring about evidence to show that retro causality exists which is the particle equivalent of you getting a stomach ache today Thanks to tomorrow's bad lunch\nAt the idea that you got a stomach ache but there was nothing that you ate the gave me the stomach ache but something that you're about to eat is going to give you the stomach ache does that make any sense\nI don't like explaining it that way that's kind of a waste science would explain I like explaining it as for example\nYou're at a bar or somewhere like\nA like let's say that a guy sitting in a bar and a woman comes up to him and says I Want to marry you and they want to marry you on this date so you set a date when the marriage is going to happen right set a date for that\nAnd ah and she says but there's one thing you need to do you need to cut your hair you shave your beer to you to get yourself a suit and tie and I want a house okay\nSo you're thinking okay I'm going to marry this woman and this is what I got to do and you don't even know if it's going to happen\nYou just do there is a date set ahead and that that future date is going to be affecting the president and the pastor okay so they passed after you\nYou know after president goes away and continue using continues so finally you do go to the day and you find out that all this stuff you prep for was retro causal okay so you're\nYou're preparing for some people may not happen but it's happening it's it's because the futures influencing president passed in in that way\nWhich is you know a simple way of explaining it probably not it's probably too simplistic maybe but that's that's the way I see it as the way it works this is causality you know there's cause and effect but what does it affect happens before the cars and that's something that's hard for science to graphs although there\nIs a pair of physicist right now from the ... from a from the United states and Canada that actually took a closer look at some basic assumptions in quantum theory undecided unless we discovered time necessarily rent one way measure which made to a particle could echo back in time as well as forward\nSo we have kind of a shadow\nOr an echo in transit pretty much and we all know quantum mechanics is is we are right we we know that part of that we're just comes down to the fact that at a fundamental level particles don't act like solid billiard balls rolling down the table but rather like a blurry cloud of possibility shifting around the room\nNow who Stephen Hawking that told me all about this when I met him\nLong time ago when we were discussing Heisenberg and uncertainty principles and Adams and all kinds of other you know who are particles moving about and we're talking about the blurry cloudy ... ... and and the blurry cloud comes into sharp focus will be tried to measure particles meaning that we can\nOnly ever see a white ball hitting a black one into a corner pocket but we can never see the countless white ball sitting by balls in every pocket okay we\nCan have we can face forward okay we see everything in front of us right our feet but behind as there are so many possibilities going on behind it but we don't even if we take a look back we see what's going on but with our back turn there's so many things were happening but we don't understand\nWhy we can't understand it all at once otherwise our brains would explode\nSo this is all about me these candidates might happen this could happen right so when we're dealing with maybe in ...\nI mean these are these are all part of of causal progression it's all part of the trends that the ... the trends you move whether it's an echo or whether it's cause and effect whether it's effect before cause whether or not you're going and loops\nSo have you can prevent me just a minute\nThis represents these maybe these clouds of maybe represents something very real possibilities on a positive level can be very real see that's why I don't like the idea that you know we're all feeling like we're doomed to some fate\nWhere everything falls apart and collapses I mean some some resort in that mindset where there's always hope for something to go better we should always try and focus on that hope that things are going to go better you know what I'm saying so if if if it does represent something real up all the particles\nAre like bouncing around and we don't see the possibilities behind us but we only see what what's in front of a sometimes with getting to see beyond beyond our own feet so this is just a convenient representation\nOf what can happen\nTime goes by time goes back and forth [noise]\nUh [noise] it it's beginning we're beginning to see that it's kind of like having a a [noise] kind of like a [noise] a knob where you can push you hadn't time go back in time that sort of thing [noise] and it's becoming more evident that the future [noise]\nWhat do you believe was going down and I just think it's fascinating to hear once again how something for the past seems to have a grasp on what is happening today or what would be happening in the future at twenty forty five so very interesting to go back and listen to that\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's triple eats except for three thirty seven hundred I'm quite

in the program today we'll talk about a rather serious topic [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter] you're\nNot already\nI don't want to say they want an emergency Colorado on like the last one emergency [noise]\n\n\n[laughter]\nNo us [noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nHey what's going on about this topic [laughter]\n[laughter]\nWhat what you got to forty eight hours and hours of the time\nWhat what was the same amount of money\n[laughter]\n\nI'm white Louis\n\nYou're listening to ground zero the numbers that I travel a six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nLazy seven thirty seven\nRetro causality is always said one of my topic\nFavorite of mine because it it it's always kind of weird to think that yes maybe something in the future could influence the past\nOr vice versa and I and I started thinking about that back during the nine eleven days seriously um it was because of the fact when nine eleven happened I just felt like time stopped\nAnd I felt like a that there were some things that happened during that that that era that reminded me of things in the past the quite possibly were affected by that very moment in time ... and I don't know why my brain went that way\nBut it just happened to go that way for some reason I mean when you're in the realm of fringe analytics\nI like saying that it's been a conspiracy theory we should start using that right were fringe analysts [laughter] like that idea rather than saying you're a conspiracy theorist you're fringe analyst and that means you analyze everything that's fringe including paranormal unfair political\nBut ah in the realm of fringe analytics and and being a fringe a\nAnalyst there's a whole lot of maybe using coincidences that should never be ignored even when they sound outrageous\nAnd so when I played that audio just now the broadcast the man on the tape or the man on the radio back in Nineteen forty five he\nCould have made a lucky guess right but\nI'm a sucker for time travel and prophecy especially when it has that paranormal vibe to it and how would lead you down the roads that take you to what it's called the further beyond see modern conspiracy theory there is a notion of predicted programming\nAnd we talked about this all the time as it seems to be a pervasive way to approximate or otherwise force structure of the future in some way it was proposed that to what is called revolution of the methods\nThat were warned or were being prepared to accept certain ideas means or ideology\nWe see it in film and TV shows and many things that eventually come to pass but we see like for example I don't know about you but if you if you go on the Internet a lot you see The Simpsons predicted a lot of things even even the nine eleven attack even predicted the election of Donald Trump which I think it's fascinating\nSo\nWhen we see these things happen we wonder about retro causality we wonder how these people who are in the arts can somehow\nPredict the future or at least give us something to think about in future tense like science fiction I remember I was at a uh a convention one time\nAnd at the convention and we I was on a panel discussing just what science fiction writers got it right there was this one science fiction writer that I was sitting there so I didn't know who he was he was a local\nScience fiction writer he's eyes science fiction is never gotten it right and I said I beg to differ man I says you write it you write science I read it okay I I read the comics I read the books I see the movies and there are a lot of things\nThat people like Harlan Ellison who just passed away got ride for people like Ray Bradbury or Isaac Asimov got right Philip K Dick amazing right he he got allows surprise\nUm and and so when you're when you're thinking about this revelation of the method it's a it's a very deep\nFascinating conduit to time travel and to the fantastical concepts and most people considered the stuff of science fiction and while the idea

is that shit\nSide does it have to be scientifically ... verified is just to predict the future is all it is\nNo Nineteen forty five I mean it's just it was from a big t._v. they said it was made in England in Nineteen forty five post World war two and it just somebody predict the future adding team forty a Nineteen forty five a hundred years in the future twenty forty five\n... something that you've found on the Internet\nIt's somebody was produced it was something that was a released by a pax TV a bingo and that was a prediction given ... an ounce or on the radio in Nineteen forty five\n... okay\nAnd I mean I mean it was it ... it was kind of address but not really all that accurate right\nWell right\nAnd what ... what do you what's the problem you have with it\nJust because I mean anybody could make\nThat is right anybody could make a British show if this was made in Nineteen lives if this was made in Nineteen ... sixty five and it it was filled by\nA month ago\nWell it did it they say was Nineteen forty five so I mean if it's Nineteen forty five and they say it's banking forty five in the group is called the effects TV and they said they had that from Nineteen forty five I mean I I I think it's something you see quite made in Nineteen sixty four that basically said the same thing with this set\nI I read Nineteen eighty four I read that book\nRight well okay so Nineteen eighty four was made what in the Nineteen twenties and Orwell much predicted the future duty not\nWrite write questioning the soundbite that you played if it was late last month right and\nWell okay fleet just tell you this it was released by a company called apex TV\nSaying that it was an unknown radio broadcasts from Nineteen forty five a man was on the radio basically predicting the future and that's all it is I mean you can ... I mean I could do that of course you can anybody can I don't understand what your problem is\nMy problem is I don't think that that clip that you played was originally from Nineteen forty five okay and when do you think it was from [laughter] I Wonder why I think it's from\nYeah when when you think that was paid I mean I I don't understand what you don't know what the problem is with this I ... I'm really I'm Wondering what the problem\nLike somebody he made it look like this person from Nineteen forty five was saying that but it was really made last week\nThere was an audio file but I played last hour and it was an audio file becomes from apex TV okay a apex TB claims that this radio filed and play your comes from Nineteen forty five\nAnd I played it in some guy called left already says oh it's a hoax and I'm thinking well okay if it's a hoax and who benefits from it\nThat's what I Want to know who benefits from a hoax that this was a hope it just sounds like a typical guy on a radio making some prediction is all it is and so I don't know why this guy was just so hung up on the idea they thought it was a hoax but what I Want to do is want to play you that's broadcast the man who's been recorded off the radio could have made a lucky guess\nBut I'm a sucker for time travel and prophecy especially when it has the paranormal by to add something to play this for you again\nAnd ah there's no fear mongering here at all even though the guys do this this is big business the intent is to scare people know this is not to scare people but it's here to make you think listen to what this guy says well have said Nineteen forty five it's a radio broadcasts where a guy attempted to\nActually predict the future what would happen in the year twenty forty five here we've got\nAn gentleman welcome back in the program today we'll talk about a ... a serious topic ... what does your child today we are going to make some protections maybe someday my back on the SATs productions I yeah I Do know is Nineteen\nForty five hundred years from now it'll be twenty forty five it is difficult\nTo imagine the state of the world and one hundred yes we have seen before the world has changed drastically and the boss and yes just one hundred years ago\nIn the Eighteen talking fine concept of self our frying machine seemed as an identity ever to many that's great and dust colonel revolution\nThe wellness seen all changed in the fall came to mind as we go over our predictions for the next one hundred years and one hundred years I predict that man will have stepped foot in front of a celestial bodies such as I'm On\nThe planet Mars and one husband yes I put it that the average man will get his news and entertainment from a variety\nOf sources big companies will no longer have a monopoly on the news and entertainment people enjoy\nI put it that in one hundred years calls will no longer be constrained around I Will have the ability to fight and the average well and the energy that powers the cost will come from the sun and one hundred years I've been at the television sets we'll get increasingly smaller connect the television sets\nTo the point that they can get on our\n... and what not yes that will be filmed cameras at every street corner there will be put in place in the name of a safety but our freedoms really increasingly vanish we want to crate our freedom a safety wait well our rights to read it because the off our hands tell us and we'll keep our\nChildren are safe now remember protections no say maybe some of the future man we're back on a ... day\nWell future man looking back on them and they are pretty interesting predictions if their predictions that come from Nineteen forty five\nAnd a some of them are accurate some are a little off by ... by just a tad I think\nBut when you're dealing with something called revelation to the method we have science fiction people all the time making predictions and having them come true I mean we're warned through this type of predicted programming about how we should be prepared to accept certain ideas\nCertain ... certain ideologies\nWe see in film and TV shows many things that eventually come to pass and would they do we wonder about the theory of retro causality unreal time travel ... physicists have been talking about retro causality and whether or not there are things that\nShape the patch future shaping the path time travel is a fantastical concept in most would consider the stuff of science fiction and\nYet we hear more and more that the idea of dream through time he's he's he's quite possible actually uh but\nChange the course of history yeah I don't know\nI mean we're we're told that they were different timelines that if you go back in time uh and you kill baby Hitler that won't matter 'cause there'll be another time my little form after that that kind of thing I don't know\nBut um it is possible or hearing more and more about time travel is becoming more and more possible plausible but um there are those who before us\nHave had insight to see the future or they say they've come from the future to let us do you\nKnow through science fiction but time travel is possible and it's happened from time to time or time after time or or time into an item and and that's it and yet as you may\nKnow like I said I I in the last hour I I just stumbled upon a film that I saw before called tomorrow and there was a Disney film with George Clooney in it\nAnd what I found most interesting is in the film or they discuss a secret society called plus ultra now\nAccording to the fictional history of the film I did some studying on this uh the story goes that good stuff Eiffel\nMet Jules Verne and Thomas Edison and his power apartment just started a secret society of optimist plus ultra was founded it'd be Eighteen eighty nine world's fair in Paris, France\nThe organizations purpose is to create moderate and expand upon new scientific advancements for humanity now key members of this group included\nPeople like H. G. wells Ray Bradbury Amelia Earhart Mark Twain Nikola Tesla and other scientific figures Walt Disney eventually became a member as well so it started\nIn Eighteen eighty nine and there were people who became members of this plus ultra group and what plus ultra was was a group that\nCreated a breakaway civilization in another dimension okay so I Know science fiction right but is there any truth to it that's the question well\nAs we do as we dig deeper into this story okay\nIt says now this is according to the movie fiction this is this is the story\nTomorrow land in Nineteen fifty nine had an expansion at Disneyland it was actually about and this is what they said in the film that tomorrow land was actually a training facility\nFor future societies future members this society's they were training them for a journey to an alternate universe\nAnd at this alternate universe was found and later developed\nBy plus ultra now the blueprints for the expansion he'll keep technologies that enabled the journey including something called a super transport\nKey VIPs were encouraged to join plus ultra are given special VIP audio tour a tour as the world's fair\nOr the attraction there there was Ford's magic skyway there was the it's a small world world ride and for those who couldn't attend the fair there was a there was a record player or record that they could play to get information about the details now Walt Disney\nHad the it's a small world attraction at the Pepsi Cola pavilion in the Nineteen sixty four New York world's fair that believed to contain of portraits tomorrow it\nIn reality does he does have a secret place\nAnd it's near the pirates of the Caribbean it's below the pirates of the Caribbean ride\nThis is where it gets even more interesting because well of course predicted a lot of things in his books and that was the Eighteen hundreds or well predicted a lot of things in his book Nineteen eighty four also animal farm was also an allegory for government changes strange this\nSo we got these visionaries they were in you know the earlier\nThat we're giving us information the earlier twentieth century and also a towards the end of the nineteenth century\nSo yeah people even Charles Fort would be in that category got Charles for you ... you've got a you've got a you know George Orwell just go down the list of all of these visionaries they've seen the future or that they they had a vision of the future that we're all living in today\nSo somehow\nThe future that they saw with the future that was happening right now [noise] and it was influencing these men in the past [noise]\nTo write about [noise] the future [noise]\nThat makes sense it's retro causality right so we moved from H.
