honeymoon for Obama the honeymoon for Bush and usually I talk about the honeymoon so yeah the honeymoon will be great you know we have a great time of president you know everything's cool everything's great and then of course we started hating him after a few years so this way it's supposed to be but\nNo we hate him now we have it even from the beginning we hate him\nOr you know maybe it'll turn maybe eventually you'll do something oh loving everybody in the country of Donald Trump as a savior he's he's got he's wonderful who knows I I just don't see how this is going to go anywhere but bad because like I said I'm I mean last night I think it was pretty evident\nThat I really needed to escape the reality of discord not only in my country but in my state here in Portland, Oregon where I live It's MORNING I woke up thinking about the speech the President Nixon gave it is not grow member a he [laughter] it was back in sixty nine\nI'm Nixon was speaking and he said mankind how'd he said he said some mankind was reaching with magnificent provision for the moon\nBut falling into Iraq is just court on her wall a shocking to me um\nAnd he basically said that it was really unfortunate that we're living in times where\nAre we reached the magnificent precision of going to the moon reaching out to what is above us but we fall into discord here on earth we tend to fight here on earth but we're trying to go out and dismay and I thought about that for a minute I thought that you know here we are\nGetting all kinds of messages from the guys I mean technological notes tech you know

thinking\nThat I hate that I hate it I hate you know I hate everything you're saying I hate it I hate it so we got going on right now it's all about hate all the anger you know we all know

like the fact that they're fighting these wonder as things in space right now but what I Do like when I have is they're not talking about it enough on the news no they're not\n\nMe in fact the truth about what is out there\n\nAnd the seriousness ... what is coming sounds even more outrageous\nBecause the corporate media will not touch these stories and store experiencing a sort of self imposed

are conspiring to make something happen or the conspiring to cover up something okay that's the theory you have no proof\nYou have circumstantial evidence of the theory but you don't have proof\nBut see this is a conspiracy theory I'm Talking about it's it's a bona fide proven conspiracy\nBeing put forward by the world's leaders and of course our leaders who have now decided that a lack of

[noise]\nThe number of people going to the Internet saying oh it it feels like we're civil war even um you know they were a lot of people\nJames Woods a matter of fact the actor James Woods was tweeting actually got shadow banned for tweeting that if they if Hillary Clinton wants civil war will give him a civil war\nSo out whatever was said you know and I talked about how I felt like we were in the middle of one number of them were threatening and Hillary Clinton said well you know we're not going to be civil unless you know we take back what we have and Donald Trump says well if we lose there will be violence\nSo\nWhat is that going to do for America I mean what are you going to do about this that's the question I have is that you know and so you go to the Internet\nAnd you try to you know state where you want to stay on Facebook what is Facebook do well they go after eight hundred Web pages shut 'em down eight hundred a Facebook pages especially some that have a lot of power like a nation in distress\nIt was the first online publication to endorse President Trump um three point two million likes three million followers gone\nGone because of what they were where they were saying back then of course ah revert press seven hundred thousand followers attacked Trump referred to Republicans is cheating scum bags so a political rhetoric they were saying it was done because they were ...\nI think what was going on is probably both of them had something to say about the civil war or the idea of a civil war and that they were taking down\nBecause it just seems to me they were going pretty good but they only mentioned knees I think these are these are the ones to make them look like they did this uh you know fairly you take away a conservative you take away a liberal you know what they're saying is we're taking away extremists or removing the extremists on the Internet then in eighty five page briefing comes out called the good\nCensor leaked to the press\nFrom Google which advises all of the tech companies to police tone instead of content\nAnd not to take sides when censoring users ah you know this is their rush to say wow we got to do something because if if we eat we show our hand and say that we can remove all the conservative viewpoints then there's going to be held to pay with the conservative\nSo\nWatch these moves these movies are very important to watch\nBecause\nWe see this internally could Google and we realize that of course well this okay this is what they were saying and they're in their ... to some of the fact that they they they believe in change they they say we will change with the times if necessary meaning that if they just so happened to wipe out if you\nSearch entries based on tone than they can make that dragon apply deal with China and no one will feel that this is some sort of people move\nThis is what the briefing says if I can get a quick says Google might continue to shift with the times are changing it stands on how much or how little it censors due to public governmental commercial purposes or pressures if it does\nA knowledge of what this shift in position means for users in for Google is essential shifting blindly are silently in one direction or another rightly insights users\nFury\nAnd I think about that yeah [noise] so both sides say violence gay November you don't vote Republican violence ... says we will not be civil until we take over [noise]\nHere you have two leaders threatening violence hoping their their their zealous followers will start a civil war [noise] but then you see the Internet now going after Web sites that are radically inclined boat liberal\nAnd conservative [noise] and then Google issues a statement saying that we certainly don't want to eliminate certain viewpoint [noise]\nTo start any site users fury [noise]\n\nSomething scaring them okay something just scared them and I think what scared them or the statement [noise] but you heard from both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump\nThe politics because it seems that politicians seemed to want to take old techniques put a fresh coat of paint on them and then resell them in some contemporary concept\n\nIs a little something needed Frederick a pretty neat neat you talked about he talked about something called eternal rip currents this is what he said about eternal the currency said if some day or night a demon were to steal after you and you're lonely is loneliness and say to you this life is you\nKnow it is life is you know and now live it and have lived it you will have to live once more\nAnd the numeral times more and there'll be nothing new in it but every pain and every every joy in every thought inside and everything out of a notably small or great in your life will have to return to you\nAll in the same succession and sequence even if this spider and this moonlight between the trees and even this moment and my and I myself the eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down\nAgain and again and again and you with\nIt speck of dust so when you look at me just concept you know and you say to yourself\nYou know things are happening over and over again you've seen this mirroring process this darker mirrors that we're looking at and whether or not we have a demonic power that is there to steal your government away from you\nOr to take over your government when it's most vulnerable I mean what if this power\nWere were were brought back and you didn't recognize where this power was and the power was there as a directive okay some ... or whatever it is a directive to control a populous\nIs confused and frightened and what this would do if we look through history which we see that a frightening populists and invited populists a well tried and true results come from that\nAll the same succession sequences as other moments in history like the times of Hitler's why Omar Soviet Russia Mao's China and as I've talked about many times the Argentine dirty war\nSo what if something happened that would create a small uprising or a big surprise me and that uprising turned into full on civil war\nI keep in mind that insurrection combative and revolutionary events in history had small skirmishes before the big ones are up to this is why now\nWe should take a page from history and understand that we're about to witness the return\nOf what would be called the mob or the mob rule or the vigilante justice or perhaps even something a lot worse\nAnd the reason why I say this is because of the fact that a\nCouple of nights ago I did a show called new in New justice no peace and ah I attempted to point out that the traditional way we think of civil war in this country has crowding the fact\nThat we're already in one end well no one will attribute school shootings that pizza gate shootings Las Vegas attacks the symptoms of civil war in progress our leaders both left in writing knowledge that violence will be an inevitability in this country after the after the November election\n\nPresident Trump\nWarned that there will be violence if the Republican Party loses the November's midterm elections and he stated that the rights of the American people were under threat from violent people\nAnd I'm sure he mentioned he did mention that they were on the on the left many people told me the left or violent Clyde you gotta start talking about how the left or violent yes they are violent\nI've seen it myself here in my own home town I seen it all over the country now this type of rhetoric do that Donald Trump talked about the violence if we don't when he's now being foot noted in being pointed out by the news that the you know they basically saying we'll see you see you see he wants violence\nYou see the arguments are such that they can be both ways\nAnd extremism became even more intense after CNN's Christian um and poor sat down with the interview with Hillary Clinton I'll listen to what\nChristian on a poor says she talks about the mirror and the black nearing or the dark mirroring and the idea of a vast left wing conspiracy against Donald Trump and listen to what Hillary Clinton's response was\nCan Conway the friends that said by the talks about this process and she said it ... have a left wing conspiracy it echoes what you said about when your husband was being that she ended by investigations back in the nineteenth of a white right wing conspiracy\nSocial you comment on that merit language and secondly\nAnyway even consider St Clair speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America is try to get back to some civility and just try to make it even if we have to include disagreements we're not going to war with each other and not try to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to pass return to civility listening to one another I'm working out are different that is not the Republican Party that exist today and that has certainly not the administration that we have in power right now\nWhen the Republican Senate denied\nThe right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland a Kurd\nI think anything that they stole a justice from the ...\nI think they did I mean to keep it at the same court said open for a year or two deny distinguish Jared they couldn't vote even down they could've said well for ideological reasons philosophical reason that we're not going to vote for him but no they fell in law\nAnd that was such a breach a horn of Africa and the constitutional responsibility of\nA planet to advise on can harm a nomination [noise] that you cannot be criminal with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house band Oregon that Clinton ... started damp\nSo she says when we get the Senate back that sort of civility we'll start again but until then civility or instability if you will will knocking saying you cannot\nBe civil with a political party that wants to destroy you stand for and what you care about and that's why she said I Believe if we're fortunate enough to win back the White House and or the Senate that's when civility can start again there you have it a declaration of civil war and a license for violence\nDonald Trump said violence if the Republicans don't get the vote Hillary Clinton says violence until we get to vote or we we haven't sensibility until you get the votes so\nThe motive of course is getting what you want by any means necessary not not that their vote matters just how much trouble intimidation and instability you can create\nIn order to change the direction of the votes and that's that's very disconcerting and ... it's on president I mean while while the media will say that Trump's words are to be expected they failed to expound upon the comments she made Hillary Clinton made no one not even her interviewer\nChristian I'm a port\nCheating stop her and say wait a minute wait a minute are you saying\nThat you know civil war would continue or it's really ... I mean you shouldn't even say this is reckless shouldn't say you're fueling the fire you know the fire it's already been started consequences be damned a civil war has to happen in order to take over the Senate that's that's what I'm getting from both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump\nI mean her claimed civility can return when Democrats have power is it a mission that the ends justify the meat\nI mean this is at a time when Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten mailed a merry mailed and\nRice and powders or run out of restaurants and death threats I mean Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more on civil [noise]\nI mean [noise] what is it [noise]\nI said two nights ago that this is a civil war New York post yesterday said this is these are words the civil war [noise] and now hearing Hillary Clinton I'm beginning to think fall look if they're going to keep being angry and keep doing these problems up until the the vote and then they changed the vote and then the Republicans get violent [noise]\nThese white by a white guy I mean it's just been sanded he doesn't make any sense [laughter]\nIt is a better climate or just keep on keep\nDoing what you're doing and I'll be ... I appreciate\nThat thank you so much uh I I got this from surely I call my biases my values I'm biased on my morals and values and there's no compromise\nNo biases are not moral they're just not I disagree biases are not morals biases you can have ... that are based on nonsense that would make them right in order to make the moral morality is when you do good to others morality is when you do good to yourself or rallies when you love God morality is\nWhen you continue to spread hope and and you you were a person who believe in being upright and straight\nAnd understanding what it means to be a probably a straight a good American into good patriot has nothing to do with bias that's where you\nKnow biases what you develop over time and you could be wrong and you're buying Tripoli tricks every three thirty seven hundred a triple leads except for three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nThe news radio special report tropical storm Michael at least six steps are being blamed on hurricane Michael four of those casualties were confirmed in Florida's Gadsden county not far from where the category for storm made landfall\nMeanwhile officials in North Carolina and Georgia each confirmed a death in their states one victim was an eleven year old killed near lake seminal\nFlorida governor Rick Scott is getting a firsthand look at the devastation at an afternoon briefing Scott said the worst damage she saw was in Mexico beach in nearby Panama City however he also detailed the devastation in Bristol and Shipley\nWhich of course out what you see it cheaply in Denver so it it is sort of looks like there was tornadoes spots where everything was a tornado whether\nThe governor said more than a thousand people are involved in search and rescue operations today the storm is moving through North Carolina at twenty four miles per hour Brian shook NBC News radio\nWere to strike is it ready dot com slash business brought to you by the federal emergency management agency the American Red Cross and yeah cancel\nEach time for you or a T.

incivility don't want to shake Hillary Clinton out of\nContext now do I no no she said we cannot be civil and the thing is is that whatever her civil definition is\nI've noticed what the stability and instability is in my own home state of Portland, Oregon I I Am at home town of Portland, Oregon I've seen what this whole idea of being in civil meet the means walking traffic and he's calling people names it means scratching their doors that the Senate during the cabin are gearing it means harassing people that's what it means\nIncivility violence maybe\nTrump said violence he said well you know what's going to happen this this this and this so uh you know I don't know it just seems that this is what they're talking about and so then when people started commenting about the whole idea of what Hillary Clinton said\nDonald Trump said basically goes in and said oh we got to stop this eight hundred people eight hundred sites gone\nAnd the Google turns around leaks a memo and says oh by the way we are not going to shadow certain sites my politics alone we're just going to do it a ... because ... you know we don't want to or we don't want to ruin anybody's when we don't want to start a

talking about today I go\nYou know I recall anything but if somebody if one of them Alex Jones or if I was just talking about this Google's life either call ... said yes you call this a can of a strange thing is\nThe algorithm or what what what I say it's about it is that girls gather information all the time but not really for our good\nThings are sad and then actions are done and what actions are done we try to figure out why the actions of done it they're done because I have a feeling that both Facebook and Google realized that what they're doing is they're creating\nAn atmosphere for civil war and we'll let me when we hear our leaders today aren't leaders saying things like well there will be\nViolence or if uh you know we don't win and the other one says we're we're going to continue to be a\nCivil until we when\nMrs ... motion and that's why they're trying to do it they're just trying to buy it but\nWe're real quick 'cause I hear the music okay do you think Trump and Hillary actually working together in order to make the civil war happened and then bam all of a sudden we have the whole global is just the martial law they looked at fourth no idea\nI don't think

[laughter]\n\nGo to dawn and Tennessee I Don Young but I Do love to\nHear of it is on I'll just watch enough they hear the other like a\nLot to do anything they did not many but a history shows that did not have had a lot of the ... last night alone I ... and it was going against certain groups\nCertain opposition a boat like eight thirty six eight thirty a\nGood you and your annual compare what the Democratic Party is doing to the Christians are late white male\nThat's going on today that you can pay that you know not as you know a ballot as it is right now I mean I think they go into the ...\nWhere you're at and it's you know ... and I was just wondering if you could say the parallels\nTo ... you know I could tell you that you know I I don't think we're seeing the Democratic party doing anything not see\nI I'm sure that I'm sure the Democratic party or people who are ... representing a the the left wing will say that everything the Republicans are doing or not see I mean calling out of Nazi or calling not be here and not see there's kind of it's the God when argument and it certainly dumped pills everything into a soup of not a nothingness and it makes it less effective\nBut I Will tell you that's about all this oil no but I Do like let me finish I'll tell you where it's going\nWell you have a mayor in this town that is corrupt and deserves to be arrested in fact today I came to work wondering how I get organized group to arrest them he needs to be arrested or on many reasons many reasons he's arrested because he is not holding together the rule of law in this in this city not at all uh\n... it's it's like it you know the same as the live um right without the violence but we still have the same kind of their employees you know I don't know if he is saying you know a little before last they shut a laser bridge going across the river to live as\nWell what we had when we have okay well we have groups that are uh basically blocking traffic a and there and there are abusing people and the police look on the police are told not to do anything so their their arms are tied their hands are tied when it came on the ice or when there would be a\nIce takeover here the icy takeover in ah Oregon\nSame thing happened in fact they were saying that what he did was unconstitutional in and would be a and I think there is somebody actually suing him for what happened there but we also have a governor here and that is very corrupt she's actually a bear a lot of things that she's doing right now\nBut in my opinion uh would would probably boring arrest as well for some reason we have two very corrupt leaders\nA mere Portland it's a corrupt leader and the mayor in a in a new governor of Oregon is super corrupt and both of\nThem are in power right now and so even if they're gonna wait it out to the election but in my opinion [noise] something's got to be done sooner than later [noise] and uh so and this is why we're in the position we're in right now and I you know I don't normally I don't normally talk about local politics I leave that up to a guy that I work with the Mars Larson is amazing with that stuff\nIs conservative very staunch conservative but still you have a handle on Portland politics and a lot of ways\nAnd I keep telling them every day what are you going to do to get people to start talking about arresting our mayor Ted Wheeler and tell him look you don't you don't allow this type of\nThing and a lot of crime to run in this in this in the city and I think that uh you know it's being well known across the country now his reputation and what he's doing and what has been happening here in Portland, Oregon\nThey said before prepared for anything anything can happen and anything is happening right now so as I say it's best to be prepared I'm not calling for civil war I'm not asking\nAre running the streets I'm asking to throw up your hands and scream and yell all I'm saying is be prepared for anything will be back [noise]\nHis online banks for closing on how they even have documents that I signed for home equity loan only I didn't what a nightmare\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud your hopes title and mortgage are kept on line where these foreign and domestic hack them it's simple they forge your title and borrow every penny of equity you happen to your home like this police officer I Know about title fraud so our register with home title\n\nI think somebody felt be\nI'd be new beginning to feel the heat I think they're beginning to realize that they can't be bias like they are they can't continue to do this and there is any go hog wild and be all violent and crazy on on Facebook or on Google but they're looking at tone and once again once again this brings to mind this social credit score\nWill will could tone will have a scale will will run the site to the algorithms and the heat scale and we'll see just how it measures up in a bit and we turn out to be\nTurns out the ... they get an algorithm that you have a lie he hates the junior and your Web sites we won't post them\nOnce again the robot determines whether or not you're a racist based on their criteria you know when you're constantly getting these scenes\nAbout more civil war\nAnd license for violence and the motives of course getting what you want the motive you know we want so many people to go out and vote but we don't want certain people to win and if they win will keep being on civil to one another if they if they lose maybe there'll be more violence\n\nAnd of course the media says about Trump when he said about the GOP violence to Georgia wow that's expected you know he's a he's a fear mongering narcissistic blah blah blah blah blah blah you do that anyway but then Hillary Clinton\nSays consequences be damned we need to have instability until we get what we want\nEnter claim of civility could return when Democrats have power is as Mr the ends justify the means\n\nMeanwhile she said this when we've had Republicans are being shot stabbed docks be mailed a a rice in powder\nRun out of restaurants sent death threats and yet she says we got to be an siblings we get we want well who's giving the chilling response is right now\nSome guy I guess a bit of two hundred pound bomb but you want to detonate on election day one guy said he would do as long as it was reported the news Eric Holder's basically sat out by the quote somewhere Eric on the streets we said we need to kick them talking about the Republicans we need to kick them when they're low\n\nThese are words and warm\nAnd I know people don't want to you know want to they want to admit to it but they are so what do we do well you've got to be fighting a civil war which many people as they're going to do with why don't we take the task these people are making these statements including President Trump\n\nYou know we we stop blaming the Russians for meddling now we're doing it wide open\n... or ... there's meddling going on the media is meddling Hillary Clinton is battling now Donald Trump says well the that's meddling too\n\nThat's voter manipulation in my opinion is more to manipulation\nRegardless of what you think of your president regards what you think of Hillary Clinton back is voter but if you only should\n\nSomeone who just sit down with him and say you know you just did what you about your ... your manipulating the boat Hillary when you said that the Christian on the ... you really believe in the boat\nI'm sure they don't care\nI'm sure many of you don't care that I'm telling you this because you're thinking well their car delivery my card the conservatives are neither I basically telling you what is\nIt is what it is\nTo go to Sarah in Oregon Hi Sara you're on ground zero would feel they saw the heat [laughter] do that than the food industry\n[laughter] okay\nThere's one thing you haven't touched on now [noise] I'm going to preface this by saying that red as it stands nothing Hillary Clinton said actually suggested violets\nAre really really ...\nThe opposite of civil is not violent it is rude now I Know that they're being very push ally and dangerously rude but they are being rude nonetheless not violent not yet ... does not have a party ... I don't think anybody realized that they don't have a party\nThey don't even have a left right there a black bloc okay that I didn't call the shots about any thought\n[noise] what has been done\nBy Hillary in the service of whoever's\nPutting out the black lots and all the other thing is a lot more insidious than simply saying we cannot be violent anymore we have to be violent now that's not what she said remember that must mean you you prove this the other night when you did your show that\nMost Americans have no idea what the word civil war means\nIt does not mean a civil war no not necessarily all means no not necessarily not at all civil means state Sable civil means within the state or city or something else it it means it means\nWithin state instead of with other states that is what civil war means and that meant civility nothing however\nHillary said the exact opposite of go do a the pilots said the civil what she did no one is realizing is they use of the word civil\nSuggesting exactly the opposite of what she is saying she's calling on all the people who don't understand what civil war means and using that word as I said it's a dog whistle\nIt's so subtle that you didn't pick up on it wow she all she had it was dropped that word because it confuses too many people and that way she's not saying anything bad she's nine citing any violence she's just saying I'm don't be nice but\nShe's using that word because we don't understand it and it has a lot of connotations that we don't even understand\nBut in that case then she's going to have a backfire on her when you agree\nWhat do you mean\nWell I mean if she was you know if it was a dog whistle and you've seen or how you know people have acted towards a conservatives you've seen you know like Ted Cruz being harassed I'm not ... you know\nI'm I'm not sure she knows what she did I'm not sure she goes to cheat I think somebody encouraged her to say that\nWell but it is obviously you got to New York post printing out newspapers said or the owners are going to just declared civil war\nThat's right the Hillary doesn't doesn't control the post no controls Hillary than me controls Hillary and media controls Trump because the media is controlled by those who want to civil war and the media doesn't know it\n... doesn't know it to be strapped doesn't know it to the deans said basically are you is usually the media diminished doing civil war and they're using both Trump and Hillary as pawns in in in the whole matrix that's an anyway no I yeah it's interesting I hate the word hate the word ape statement yes what you're saying\nWell say he's real I mean come on what you want to call it man I got a way to get what they what are you on a term for your beep\nBeep say a dark said a ... billion or does really a darkness or I don't know what I Want to call it we've been doing really got talked about the big long time ago when my little by this or is such a well\nWell well that was really good point really it really was if they said it's just as scary as what I've been probably a little bit more intelligent but they're\nAll yet because it it goes deeper than Trump's Hillary this goes deeper than Democrat Republican this goes so we don't know where it's originating\nGoes back to when I said the other night about all the factions\nYet I can get out to the point when they know language in the air it put it in there we don't want you to give up we want you to listen I Do think you're okay well thank you\nHave a good night yeah that's the story but the opening theme it's all about giving up when the loudspeaker says ground zero they want you to give up you know we've already had our ground zero we have it back in two thousand one will be the theme was made long before\nNine eleven happened and I remember after nine eleven have they called the ground zero President Bush was right there with a bullhorn going we hear yes big loud speaker\nOf the news radio
