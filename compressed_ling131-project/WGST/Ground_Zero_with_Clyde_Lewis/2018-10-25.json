his wife transportation secretary Elaine Chao and some guy was yelling and pounding his hand on their table at a at a restaurant as fast casual joins and took his takeaway bag and threw it out of the

Mitch McConnell it's unfortunate it's unfair she should be able to have a dinner with his wife and not get screened that have a table pounded on and his leftovers is doggy bag flung out of the restaurant but to then suggest\nThat you know whoever that was whether it was a you know actual Republicans are angry at McConnell and it was many many many Republicans have been angry at McConnell\nOn you know thinking that he's more establishment not doing what he needs to do or to suggest that it was a Democrat or Republican to try to make it look like Democrats I don't know how you

I Know\nWho to even think that it would be part of the mainstream to say which is gathering from all over that area are banding together to put a curse on Donald Trump but something more than a binding spell and Donald Trump cabinet though got the worst or his was a harm spell\nHis was the harm spell\nWe had a cold writer Thomas shared it on the program exist Sherman in the cold writer and he said\nYou know he called us\nWe're on with him he was in Ireland we were talking with him and he said these spells will somehow backfire\nAnd cause harm to America\nCause harm to the families cause harm to the children cause harm to America you said this is what will happen Paul email last night what remarkable show that was Paul ... appeared on the show to talk about the dark wave of parasitic demons\nThere were\n... with a he says are in fasting in the world causing people to become possessed an acting like monsters to one another and while some people may not see a spiritual form of Armageddon taking place\nThere are those who see the material world crumbling with geopolitical tensions that went analyze you know when you analyze them thoroughly it would be considered civil war and other countries I mean they say well look at every ... we're on the outside looking into what's\nGoing on here we'd say ooh that countries is civil war today I woke up with the news about these suspicious packages that allegedly contain pipe bombs were sent to the Clintons the Obamas and to CNN's offices in New York and this happened today after George Soros it to\nBe out of suspected explosive device putting his mailbox\nWell\nThis is ... mass hysteria and the newsrooms their predominantly left wing and and and and the the the left wing mouth pieces are simply speaking for the resistance now and it's all Trump's fault again but this is happening\nIt's got to turn down the rhetoric stop saving news is fake all these they use the excuse is just ... I mean the attack is similar to the rice in\nBiological what's actually happened before the Kavanaugh decision was made it is I reported there would be a final blow\nEvent\nIt would certainly affect us remember I said that the final blow and I said it would be a biological attack and I was asked to be on the Alex Jones show and I declared there I said it will be a biological attack\n\nAnd when it happened I was suspicious of it because I'm\nIt failed and and it didn't you know it was the biological scare okay but I was thinking if this would be a trigger that would create copycat attacks so I was asked\nYou're on the uh go up to begin to go into the Alex Jones show and infowars again\nAnd Alex asked me what is next quiet what do you think is going to happen next and I said well we're not going to bend would start a war footing in the United states\nAnd he said I agree I agree well today I was notified it'd be tempted bombings and it was sent an email that featured in October third at twenty Eighteen article for the Daily Beast and this was a headline said cabin are could be the final blow\nFor Democratic Senate everything happening around the issues that final blow\nIs about cabin on Senate war what comes with is asymmetrical these ... symmetrical attempts at a decapitation strike all is it appears to be perpetrated by deep intelligence conspirators within the opposite agencies and you can call it an inside job if you want\nBut in order declared a false flag which I hear everybody calling it there has to be\nA suspect in order for the accusation mystic but I mean by that is we need to see what they decide or who they decided to bring forward as a suspect in so far there is no suspect which it makes it even more suspicious that this uh this is a bad day false flag of it if it's a false flag it'll okay\nIt really did happen yes the pipe bombs were sent me didn't blow up any one\nBut I Want to know who they decide dependent on and then we'll know just how keeping now many\nGaping holes are are in the story there already gaping hole in the story now and I'm sure I'm not some guess on the\nPointed out we have a a few people that are ... you know well\nVersed in this stuff they're not conspiracy theorists they're very important people and you'll be hearing from him soon\nBut the final blow issue you know whether or not you know we reached that point now I mean what does happen today I mean like I said you can call them inside job I mean no bombs were detonated it makes the entire attack a bit of political theater in order to create a terrorist bogeyman that\nAttacks the left in order to gain sympathy for the vote and this is what they do and the third world you know they just in third world countries and most of the time the suspects are always traced to rogue intelligence or rogue military actors\nI mean like the guy who um sent the for the rice and he was from Logan, Utah and I think he was an ex marine\nBut yeah rogue military actors are rogue intelligence actors that do that somebody who was involved with intelligence or military uh is usually the suspect they they they choose or they they use a scapegoat or a Patsy and this is where the false flag starts to ... starts to materialize\nMean these extra always carried out for what are called decapitation strikes which of course is a military strategy\nWhich is aimed at removing the leadership or command and control of what is perceived to be a hospital government or group so it's a tactic of civil war or strategist with other government plot to a limited military generals or even political leadership now if you recall the rice attacks\nWere aimed at the president and military leaders and the latest bomb attacks are aimed at Democrats who are former leaders\nSo this is a tit for tat exercise this is the copycat exercise this is\nPart of the final blow affect it all started back when Kavanaugh was appointed chief justice it all started the you know and it it it it lingers\nBecause of the fact that there is is is Hillary Clinton said she said something the effect how can you be civil to a government and the civility we'll come back if you just allow is our positions in the Senate\nAnd Donald Trump says well no there is going to be violence if if ah no matter what happens to the violence is happening\nAnd I still argue\nThat if if we were looking in on a country doing what we're doing we would call it a civil war\nI mean think about it you got people in the streets that are fighting with one another you've got you know presidents and generals getting sent poison in the mail you're getting pipe bombs and and I don't know if they were even capable of exploding when you get pipe bombs or what looked like pipe bomb sent to officials\nNow how are they able to do all the addresses of these officials were to send them and how to send them there are a lot of give away is here to tell me that somebody is not very bright and then it looked at some of the of the ... or or the bomb volosin if you want to [laughter] what are the bomb below is if you will\nOr the ... better there don't have any post mark on them and it's like how can you get a pipe

I guess you could call it a quandary as kind of a confusion here because\nYou know when you jump on a story to sue and especially something like this that appears to be a dare I say at an inside job but it inside job from the standpoint of who the players within the intelligence community is responsible for this you know people tend to want to play politics again with it and it's not\nIt's it's an attack on the Republican we've had Republican a leadership being attacked with rice and we've had\nCongressman attempted assassination attempts we've got all these things going on and people are saying well since nobody died it's really not a civil war but no this is this this civil war would you agree\nThat those type of the force of responses you're getting her for from the left for educators\nThey're just trying to throw a monkey wrench into your relation you are the four runner and if you are the best of the information I've talked to and I'm telling you you're hitting\nSo on line with this stuff that's all they're left to do is to try and you know for people to tell other responses this stuff has been going on for years I mean I I keep thinking 'cause I was quoted in some other national magazines about uh some news of this school year ring a bell\nYeah a friend of mine area where this goes back\nAnd there's another reporter Gary Webb dead I mean how many hours you kill I say separates you said the richest Gary Webb that's another reporter John ... I mean a kind of anti viral yeah Danny ... he he got killed I\nMean you did it on the legs this takes me back to the nineties\nWhen I was working closely with Mike roofer LAPD who helped expose John ... of the CIA or the axis of the ... about the cocaine then infiltrated the black communities where the ... freeway Ross the rapper [noise] then I knew\nGary with I got a picture of me and Maxine Waters page on these two cars scripture dot com [laughter] she didn't do anything to help us out really really did Feinstein I'm Sorry there's a big D right after each of those names right right right well\nWe'll just see we're just seeing how you know ... we had to be rising attacks just a just a little while ago and there wasn't much commotion with the rice in the tax and even at a suspect within you know what a day or whole yeah yeah\nThe um the um on a miss using my words here the social scene or rice and beans and it's um [noise] the the and it wasn't actually the process is they're being you know\nThe castor bean that's right so when they're shoving a tons of castor beans in the mail is like wow really I mean\nLet's say end but this goes back years so if you think that part of the stuff like you do and I do and I know rod those you sift through intelligence information you guys are on top of this stuff and that that's good because that means that\nUh I don't have to explain too much but it's like with all my background and training I mean I was within two or three hundred yards of explosions at the Russian embassy or sixteenth street\nWhich is two to three blocks away from the White House of Venezuelan embassy wearing a bell yeah yeah and also outside the White House a couple of times Seventy five Seventy six right around that time frame that was four and then\nSo we think to say is it safe to say that this has all the earmarks of a criminal element within the intelligence\nOperations that allowed this to go down to that was somehow put together by a number of aerobics\nI guess you'd call them rogue agents or I mean I hate to use the word deep stake events kind of you know give me a minute\nLeft wing left wing Democrats socialists or is this what you're saying is that we believe yeah that's what those guys are yeah\nOkay so you're ... so do you believe that that's what this was the was it was basically staged by what eight extreme left group\nYeah they're stressed out they don't have anywhere to throw a little arguments like back saying you know block this block that they'll let them do this created a crowd or you know why it riot also the ... I'm Sorry but that's a that's a felony and that's inciting riots\nWell do you think though that you know I Know Donald Trump has been also raising the rhetoric and I find it weird that with all the

disagree they bring their differences to light the boat they use constitutional law we use law and order which is based on a constitution but solid\nFor centuries\nNearly centuries almost two centuries but more than two centuries actually yeah more than two centuries little over\nNow we've had disagreements in the past and that's something that this country does it we have a debate and we have conversations we talk we have dialogue\nHopefully dialogue with his balanced and uh and and that's something\nI think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with him and that's nonsense\nEighteen sixty one\nIt was only one time in our history and Eighteen sixty one where\nWe just trusted the systems so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil war I don't know if we decided that the civil war broke out because we didn't agree we had such a disagreement about how our system was run we have some we had a civil war\nThere was so much instability at that time the civil war broke out it wasn't declared it broke out there were divisions on on a on front lines there were a you know border divisions and things of that nature it was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability\nIs increasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\n\nAnd I know it's difficult to see the civil war is happening because we always thought it would be an armed conflict that one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pulpit and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country\nWhen he establishment battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration has proposed by none other than John McCain\n\nWho now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day we're the police would be forced to shoot Americans every day where martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment\nThe symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed by the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis that you'd get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military\nHad identified illustrated the point by point sign post\nAs to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on\nContemporary standards not the standards of the Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there are major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned and and and I actually executed by a those in the deep state against President Kennedy\n\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one the country would be in Princeton\nNational polarization would no obvious meeting place for resolution number two there would be increasingly divisive press coverage you need information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\nNumber three there will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimate as they are and the illegitimate evasion of violence to solve any and all disputes\n\nNow I Know that that's pretty damning\nTo actually point all these out\nAnd of course we have been analyzing and speculating about deem state manipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst said this is a an invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shadow government is always been\nDark command that leads from the shadows\nBut it needs to be clear here\nThey while we're looking under rocks for falsify proof while we're having these disputes and the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs into a moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\n\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins Republican from Maine\nReceived a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis and chief of naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and and more than a year ago\nThere was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressmen during a charity baseball practice and yet since no one died this doesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all it's just we're attacking officials\n\nBut this isn't registering in the media today the only thing that's registries the persecution complex we see on the left because the left is all one sided in their pain\n\nBut continued attacks on political figures from shootings to attempted bombings or part of a civil war tactic and it's becoming more and more pervasive these are attacks or the Republicans and and the intelligence that are linked to these resistance or you think of her sympathy they're using on the Democrats were simply be the truth is Democrats are not unique Republicans are not unique\nIn the American people are not unique we can and will if we're not already having a civil war in this country\nBe attacks are happening to a lot more people than just the Clintons than Obama's there are journalists that are being attacked we've had anthrax being sent the journalists we've had a rice and being sent a journalist\nSo time to wake up\nSome Americans if it is Suze Orman since they're not affected directly by the evil in this country they walk around like outsiders just like in John Carpenter is a movie they live they have not put on the glasses to see the real world that has been glazed over by an overly political narrative that does not wish to expose the demonic Lee infected among us\n\nThe movie they live created by John Carpenter was actually released Thirty years ago this November\nThe film still remains chilling only appropriate as a metaphor for what is happening today of course John Carpenter is responsible\nFor the movie Halloween which is having a bit of a renaissance is is forty years sequel selling out to the theaters across the country the original Halloween introduced to Michael Meyers who was eventually referred to as the shape kind of evil that cannot be killed\n\nJohn carpenter's films or horror metaphors exploit what trauma does to the soul when he also infuses his films with a strong anti authoritarian messaging concerns about how our society is unraveling and there's always some evil hidden in the shadows ready to pounds with every moment in the film they live\nCarpeted portrays the government working against its own citizens\nThat appears to be some silent alien infestation the echoes of the films invasion of the body Snatchers you remember that them however in the ... movie there were some people that we're realizing that their loved ones were losing their humanity\nIn a film they live\nCarpenters shows that the majority of the populace are out of touch with reality and may have allowed technology to run amok\nThey have allowed the lead to choose their values they are unaware that a war has been waged against them and their way of life do you recall\nCarpenter also did the film escape from New York where the future of America is fascism\nThirty days supply free when you text the word\nJolt to Seventy nine Seventy nine
