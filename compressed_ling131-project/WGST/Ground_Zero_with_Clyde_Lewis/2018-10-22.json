science\nFor CBS when he thinks meteorologist smelling a column\nFollowers on Twitter at six forty WG as the [noise]\nCorey Lewandowski welcome again to the bill cutting Hampshire Corey how are you I'm doing great how are you today\nDoing well you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president a privately it was wonderful you spent like hundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I sit on the air the other day that uh\nThere there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is before we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kinda stuff the idea of the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I spent so much time with that then candidate Trump and now President Trump and a truly cares about other people he's extremely\nUh magnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to help me that just who he is and if you listen to the media they tell you is the worst human being on the planet help but the truth is\nHe's exceptionally gracious I've seen in so many times helping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever he can\nWhy is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media ... Research Center ... well ... all one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough to good\nThey only report the bad and this administration the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working in any other time in our nation's history it conflated those to see that Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about\nI here's a great example just last week I think it was a President Trump did an interview with Leslie stall for sixty minutes\nShe interrupted him sixty five times during that interview had to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him four times and they have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad\nNot to give him credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they're no longer in the business of reporting the news now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night in Montana friend it as mobs versus jobs the only difference is the immune to Jay\nAnd I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh about a trucks that have a Trump sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I looked at a Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with tens\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kicked in the head of the the calls to violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break\nYou know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember\nRepublicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders sleeping with secretary Nielsen of da ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life because the mob violence say antifa is so\nOut of control here and there you go on their desire is destruction it's not going to make our country better this president has created I think\nOver for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences\nThat Democrats I hate to say this hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally it is acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady\nYou may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper then I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ and I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump\nWas stripping nude in the oval office performing sex acts in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of lot of his songs and records from that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad depicted Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office in performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt would be front page news for a week on and that ... the the country artist\nWould have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to each other again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her\nI mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no it was appropriate because she was an adult [noise] even if the president of the United states", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "22"}
