I I just like it's very comfortable and uh\nI just thought it was awesome she got me this NASA shirt because it just makes me feel on NASA like you know and it's cool but uh\nYeah announce it gives me such Natasha they should call it a notch you are because they every everything they do anymore just makes me kinda\nRationed and feel a little sick to my stomach\nI Know the earliest days of the U.S space exploration situation ... one of the most fascinating chapters in human history\nThat's why I like NASA 'cause I like reading about Gus Grissom I like reading about and ah you know Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin ... and I I like reading about all these guys you know I read about it all through team um I got in in in my office and maybe if I get wrong to\nGet it out of the opposite I can take a picture and put on a\nFacebook I've got um\nI've got the uh uh a picture of something it's supposed to be the Apollo Thirteen no not Apollo Thirteen Apollo fourteen astronaut and it's a little piece of the gold lamb\nFramed I have it's it's kind of a cool thing I don't have any moon rocks but I have that and I have that in my office and I uh I really liked that thing and one of my earliest producers on this program Daniel he work for NASA\nAnd\n... when I had him on working with me uh it was amazing because I got to get all this inside information and he was the one that\nWas telling me you should do shows about this shows by that asked why this isn't happening announcing that enemy big conspiracy theories about announced that he worked for them to actually so yeah you are you going to see first man is gonna be\nCool because it's going to be like going to see Apollo Thirteen or any other space movie running with the historical narrative we know that scientists had a determined effort to go to the moon and they had limited time table\n\nAnd their efforts gave us the Gemini program and the Apollo moon landing with Neil Armstrong acting is the first human ... to an extraterrestrial world\nAnd there's so many things we can talk about with him you know leaving the planet along with bugs and\nAnd go in and doing it and you know\nTouching putting his foot on lunar soil and all that whether or not there aliens there whether or not they saw structures they're I mean there's all kinds of things that you can speculate about but almost from the point of the first Apollo mission\nThere were many Americans they expressed skepticism that the whole event taking place at all it had\nThey argued been faked in Hollywood by the federal government for purposes ranging from embezzlement of the public treasury the complex conspiracy theories involving international intrigue murderous criminality also using money to foot the war effort in Vietnam this was all thrown together as a propaganda basically a propaganda scam\nTo make the Russians feel inferior and to be honest it worked\n\nIs whatever it was I mean the Russians were ahead of us in the space race then one day they find out that we've got a man on the moon immediately as hell we don't want to do that and see and that's what it was always bothered me about the moon landing as we landed on the moon\nAnd it's kinda like climbing Everest one man climbs up ... makes it to the top there are several other people that want to climate ... ad rescinded the saying they don't succeed okay some do but some don't\nSo let's look at the moon is like ... we go about adverse we landed on Mt Everest and the Russians that work so hard to go about average decide that but we're not going\n\nNow why didn't they go why were they in the second on the moon why when when the when the whole fever pitch was going on we're we're the only ones who are going to and from the moon no one else was going up that Russia wasn't going up there China wasn't going up there\nNobody cared to go up there in fact after the first three moon missions they were kind of getting bored with the moon mission they would rather watch Lucille Ball I mean that what the ...\nThey were rather watching Lucille Ball wondering if they're busy aren't as a kid or whoever was going to have a baby or I it was like\nYou know\nComedies were more interesting than the moon landing the first one call second one now okay third one or [noise] or care about about how their lives and moving thing was here a lot of people that that skepticism about whether it on the moon happened at all when\nWe landed among Americans\nBetween the ages of Eighteen and twenty four years old Mrs figures from the Nineteen sixties uh twenty seven percent expressed doubts but NASA went to the moon and over the years there have been many more dollars and anymore if you express doubts you were called a science dinner\nYou're up there with Blatter's right uh [noise] down to about the first moon landing had been on the rise for some time now and there are a lot of people that don't believe that was it turns out\nThroughout the ladder third of the twenty twenty century onto the twenty first confidence in the United states government by the American public you've been in decline in those remember the Kennedy assassination Vietnam Watergate the nine eleven attacks all these other scandals malfeasance\nMay find it easier to say well you know the government's lied to us about a lot of things why wouldn't they lie to us about the moon landing and what's really weird is is that\nYou know out of all the things you can question questioning the moon landing it's probably one of the worst things you can do okay it's it's one of the worst things that you can do\nYou ... you know using ... question Iowa and that's that's kinda bad because people say how dare you there was the most horrible event and history and you're questioning of people died at that you get out all the time you're talking about Watergate and yeah you do some ... they don't\nCare about Watergate I don't care about Monica Lewinsky is dressed but yet we spent less money on nine eleven I mean ... and that's the thing is you know you look at the embarrassment of at\nAll the money they put into the moon landing and we haven't gone back in fifty some odd years and the rockets ... what happened to them and you know all these questions that people have and when you start speculate they won't even allow you to speculate that it never happened\n\nThey'll tell you you're crazy they'll tell you you you need to go back to physics class\nWell\nYou look back in a bottle of it and you say to yourself well this is kind of interesting and you know with all the the deaths in the accidents before Apollo eleven we sent\nThree guys out into space and\nNothing really happened to them\nWe didn't lose any astronauts we didn't destroy any equipment in the process maybe on earth we did when the\nWhen the alarm on\nYour Armstrong almost killed himself in the lab and his wife said you're not going to the moon\nNo way oh yah money I'm going to the moon\nNo not after you crossed to the lunar lander on her as well you know we're not we crashed it on earth but we're not going to crash it on the moon nitrogen trust me you're not going to do that\nYou see the space shuttle blows up or astronauts or killed or stop the program\nDid they decided that they're going to put James Bond on the moon's that make you looked like he broke you\n[laughter] what about Capricorn One that was like Seventy eight right\nUh that's where NASA supposedly bake the landing on Mars the lot of people that they can do it on the set they did a pretty convincingly two thousand what a space odyssey\nWow some people\nSay that even Star Trek was canceled before the moon shot because\nThey were afraid that if they were running Star Trek were a bunch of been land on a fake planet but somebody will get the idea oh yeah just\nLike they do in Star Trek Star Trek how to how to resurrect it because they could do it now without having people\nQuestion

seven hundred and [noise] you know\nOne of the first topics on ground zero that I did was the debate over whether or not we went to the moon I was able to interview built casing one of the old timers you wrote the book about it [noise]\nIt was also Robert de Martin ... roller several was later on today and I beard was property in a a Penn and teller show time special a show where they actually make fun of conspiracy theorist I was they didn't really make\nFun of me all that much but they put me with a bunch of other guys were kind of bizarre\nAnd uh it really was kind of unnerving to watch but still I mean I I was one of the first talk show host I mean I always be are dealt with a ... when I hear you were working together one time when I was on\nDoing a ground zero we're broadcasting on the Internet first shows broadcast on the Internet it was ground zero than our though\nAre real show we're dreamland art bell and uh I don't believe that our\nBill was very supportive of me doing just doing the topic and Richard Holbrooke knew I was doing the topic and he laughed he thought it was funny but uh because he was telling me he says well yeah you know right off the bat\nYou know people are already thinking just a minute we went on the moon but nobody but we didn't win it didn't go\nThere was just communist propaganda you know the you know whatever so\nI did the show and then uh\nI think it was February of two thousand one I was very surprised\nWhen Fox or did a special called conspiracy theory did we landed on the moon\nAnd uh\nThat changed the entire nature of the debate because this is what mainstream and this is just a ... this was a situation where a major network\nPresented a conspiracy scenario without any serious re bottle it was reported to suspect that and that made me feel uncomfortable because at least on my show\nAt least on my show I gave a balance I said okay you know I have my doubts but here's some people to try and convince you otherwise\nAnd uh I think it was still plate actually who got wind of all bits and and ah he didn't like me [laughter] I don't think uh but if you have you\nSee the old Penn and teller BS Showtime TV show\nWhere I'm On and talking about the moon landing already talking about the moon landing hoax or what have you a bill plates right there and I recommended him he was he's in the show and you know I recommended it because I really respect that if I thought it was awesome that he responded to my show\nAnd that he uh responded to my uh I wrote an article called good luck Mr Gore ski and other\nOther uh other lives about the moon and ah it\nWas just me you know what if it was just saying what if it's not that I believed it totally I just had doubts so having doubts I decided well I have a doubt that can say okay I Want to present this to people and say oh man that was the ugliest thing I'd Jim oh bird from NASA right we had dirty letter I had I I just thought what the hell of a gun you know what I Do\nSee at the time I was young and I didn't care I thought well or whatever you know now I'm older I care a lot about you know it was his views and [laughter] I just because I Love talking to people

well\nYou're a liar that and fever cheat and how dare you how can you sleep at night so I was when I was all just popped him in the in the jaw\nUm so yeah I I mean people get all kind of had a big test if you tell them I I haven't doubt I doubt that we landed on the moon I mean you'd be skeptical about UFOs you'd be skeptical about everything else that many you start being skeptical about the moon landing\n\nIt's like you've kicked the pope somewhere in his body parts I think it's really a bad thing people don't like it\nWell I can tell you I still have my doubts about the moon landing and uh you know I had them even more now after what I read today um you remember back in when was that it was a two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon and twenty Fifteen\nAnd he said the NASA will test the new spacecraft was called the crew expiration vehicle by two thousand eight and ... the first manned mission no later than twenty four team\n\nWhere we are four years after the fact nothing we don't we don't have men men started back on the moon again we're we're just really talking about sending the first space tourists he's not even land on the moon he's a string go around the moon\nBut the President Bush had a goal set\nOf having a man on the moon living and working there by twenty twenty having a base there and it's not out of the question I mean if you look at what Bigelow Aerospace is up to with\nMaking these inflatable moon basically I could have been done even Mars base could have been done\nWell in two thousand nine we were told the NASA was carrying out this LCROSS experiment and they were lying to us about it about what they were using it for they said they were looking for ice on the moon but there are plenty of missions prior to the moon landing plenty of missions like the Clementine mission where they were scouting out of the moon finding ice pockets\n\nAnd so they didn't need the LCROSS mission\nBut ah and of course NASA had five hundred million to spend on a rocket who's going to slam into the moon blow up and then a cause of created it's about six miles wide\nAnd uh you know people say oh my God they're going to new moon and they were going to do this two days or two days shy of the forty of anniversary of first landing on the moon\nAnd there was a lot of stuff about that and they shouldn't have been all add up didn't make any sense\nAnd\nTwenty love and after the LCROSS mission failed rock Obama cut funding for the proposed constellation program and the space vehicles he he basically cancelled the five year nine billion dollar effort to build new Orion spacecraft in aries rockets\nThe new space vehicles were slated to replace the masses three aging space shuttles and launch astronauts into orbit and onto the moon that was the thing but no Obama pulled the nine billion and they put the money towards better than I thought about climate change climate science\nSo Obama killed the space program in order to turn nasty and the climate change police and that's that's really sad I mean if there was ever a time but now that we went to the moon at all that was the time because it you know they just shut down you know here we have this dream or going forward and Obama says not\nNot that we're not going to go so here we are in twenty Eighteen and we'd again been told that the moon is the goal and later Mars to\nTo the stories today that I Want to tell you about that really helped me excited but uh some\nBad news first of all a Russia seems to be out of their minds are apparently may have detected would appear to me to colliding stars\nAnd I think somewhere I have the sound of the stars I'll Try and dig it out but uh yeah they they detected these stars are putting off a sound\nGate of weird sound and are there going wait a minute or these really colliding stars are we looking at a space armada coming our way and if they're moving is asked we think they're going to be here by twenty twenty two\nI'm kidding I'm not kidding Russia found these colliding stars they start collecting stars and they before them out there saying\nWell if these look like cutting stars but the sounds are giving us she may have intelligence in them so they may not be colliding stars at all\nWhat are they well they are um are there are no mater of of huge space craft coming our way\nUm\nNASA also reporting today that Seventeen scientists\nOften to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national mission\n\nThe briefing was offered by the national academies of Science Engineering and medicine it emphasizes the importance of including astrobiology\nThe study about life originated on earth and how it might evolve elsewhere in the University of every phase of all now submissions destined for space from inception conceptualization to planning to development and operation so once again we have Seventeen scientist saying\nGuess what guys every mission that we do from now on is going to have the purpose of finding life out in space\n\nOnce again\nEvery mission is going to give up finding life in space to have to have a a quest of finding a life in space Russia says they picked up on to quote colliding stars that may be a space armada heading our way\n\nSo I Believe that the reason why this is happening why they're saying hey every mission has to have a fact finding like giving whatever\nIs because they have confidence that there's intelligent life out there and the recent reports of techno signatures in fast ... actually it's fast radio burst or the motivation behind the quest\n\nI don't know that it has anything to do with these climbing stars are possible are modest coming our way but it certainly has a lot to do with a techno signatures and get this\nAstrophysics says are now saying there with all the thousands of exoplanets out there and and how they're uncovering new insights into the complexities diversity of life on earth the authors also sitting\nIn a briefing that not only are you going to be looking for techno signatures guys we want you to look for bio signatures\n\nSo this is pretty amazing don't you think I mean I think it's cool I mean this bolsters the chance at life could exist out there\nAnd therefore all space exploration missions should incorporate technology and find traces of alien organisms\n... signatures take those things I mean look our personal view of the universe is more cramped plants than ever before\nWe have two thousand three hundred confirmed exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission and that leads to efforts to six out of every ten stars could host Earth like planet\nSo the sheer number of known exoplanets offers exciting opportunities for finding bio signatures fighting chemical markers indicating that yeah there's live out in space\nAnd the reports scientists recommended that NASA accelerate the development of technologies to detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument that can travel to a distant world and measure the composition of its elements minerals and organic matter\nThe report also suggest that direct imaging systems that suppress star like should we use outside our solar system to improve detection of ... signatures from planet that might orbit those stars NASA could also play more missions that the peer under the surface of exoplanets\nWhether or not the rock the icy or ocean worlds to find some journey alien live according\nTo the report however [noise] ever ... neighbors either in our solar system are light years away [noise]\nWe'll take more than technology alone and all of these advancements will cost money and guess what guys [noise] NASA's\nTo return astronauts to the moon after nearly fifty years just got slammed by an internal auditor [noise] that means [noise] they weren't going to the moon anytime soon and we're not going to look for aliens anytime soon [noise]\nWe're using Saturday and Matty and astronauts are really excited about the possibility

yeah I remember that\nSo I I mean so everybody if they're putting fake cardboard planes on the tarmac it could be one that could easily uh put together some you know grace soil put it somewhere on the

them oh well I Know they have about like magnetic signature\nYesterday what I mean\nYeah well I mean they they are they just they come out with all this stuff saying we want you all do you know when you do your mission has got to have some sort of a plan to find daily life whatever you do from conceptualization to be on\nYou gotta you gotta make this happen and then they say well okay but we're kind of like a over budgeted for the ... program so what are we going to do now\nPutting to lay out right yeah what happened what had happened to that I\nI ... either way I I think I Will come out and the next few years whether that it or not it'll have to\nWell I don't think they're ever going to go back on their uh I mean there are going to go back on their idea that he went to the moon but
