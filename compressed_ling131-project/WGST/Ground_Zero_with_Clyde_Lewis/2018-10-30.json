understanding that you know we don't want you to talk about they said it probably didn't you know he just kept quiet Patel the family a way it gets really way it is that he told his family also\nOne of the reasons why he decided not to really talk about they try to write a great was because in the aftermath of ... and I'm ... by the air force he was followed by these sort of creepy skinny pile\nManning black type character you know it's sort of put the fear of God in him and I'm so in other words just from finding one page document save the FBI's\nFiles I was able to put together an anti\nSaga old I was based on these guys are in abduction experience in the sixties and I'm so a lot of cases like that in the book where\nOne style led to another laid and you know another sauce and

psychosis to demonic possession\nAnd we react to fear\nMore than any other emotion anger is destructive and sadness slows down to character but fear\nFear works in a lot of cases it creates a lot of action and reaction\nThere can be exist in the periphery of our subconscious every dark character can appear in the corner of an eye shocking and throwing your mental health into a cautious state and you second guess yourself when you have paranormal experiences and you also find yourself confused when you realize that your world has many layers\nIt's layer upon layer upon layer upon layer like an

in a child is based on their hidden\nFears and many people find refuge in the refusal to commit to a belief system however there are moments where strange advance can nag at the staunch non believer\nAnd this is why some people walk away confused by walkway statement and says well we don't there's there's no such thing as God there's no such thing as demons there's no such thing as evil but yet\nAttitudes of hating vengeance can be jarred up\nConfined to a small space and released into the world at a whim and what can be called the other well [laughter] it's creating a framework\nThe

parasites that attached to the body of if they are not spiritually attentive to\nThey can possess and destroyed and otherwise healthy individual\nYou know\nI've often said the people that\nYou need to try and listen to what your heart is telling you about what is happening in the world I mean there are so many people who are writers of the women they forget that everything we see is not always what it appears to be and\nYou look at science fiction you look at horror films and you look at all the things we think about Halloween to protect their programming that's given the images the means and the consensus philosophical evolution that brings us to this point where we feel that evil is ruling\nEverything we do and so what or who\nWas behind this doom\nWhatever our future may be well it's not always certain you'd never know what's going to happen next one thing you do know is is that somewhere out there\nThere can be and there could be a group of people that are always in the shadows

every one of those nightmarish creatures you always think about it Halloween all of those nightmarish creatures that many people have had encounters with are afraid to talk about them\nWhen I'm Talking about is I'm Talking about like the other night with a guy who said he got bitten by something you didn't know what it was sounded like some ... attack you've had other people who said that uh with one man who called and said he was in Germany and when he was there he said he took a drink from an old ladies a cup\nWas water for some reason he came home and he found the gun that was sitting in his house no one knew where was he found out where it was grabbed the gun pointed at his face and something spoke to him in German saying you've got to do what you've got to do it he praying the gun he struggled with the gun and he put it down to his leg and shot himself in the leg instead of in the face\nAnd he survive and that's what's bizarre right I mean the interview that Nick Redford did with this\nThis uh this guy who was a this priest\nA bit too was with new fun\nAnd they worried about human entities are these non human entities and what they might be\nTalking about the ... to
