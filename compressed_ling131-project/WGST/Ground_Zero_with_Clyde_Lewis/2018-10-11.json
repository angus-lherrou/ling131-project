I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nIf you're in depth and you need help called trinity at one eight hundred three six three five one three seven to talk to a certified counselor\nThey were able to take all of my different payments and put them altogether\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts to do one easy to manage monthly payment put a stop to late fees and over limit charges reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors or being able to pay off close to Fifteen thousand dollars in Eighteen months\nIf your dad has your down coal trinity a one eight hundred three six three five one three seven\nMy name is Stephanie and I'm debt free for keep\nOne eight hundred three six three fifty one\nActually they were showing a ... or what was it a a hologram of Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan library\nYou view of the Ronald Reagan library UC Ronald Reagan or you know\nAre in a Hawaiian shirt you get to see him talking about\nYou know his wife ... Nancy is amazing he didn't have the new Nancy thing about Nancy and talks about being in the oval office and all kinds of cool things but yeah I I don't know if they cover though that Reagan was the president they told us be ready for extraterrestrials because if we ever find ourselves in a situation where\nThe entire world's at odds with one another there will always be that\nAlien threat that would unite us and that's and that's the thing is that so we're we're needing now I think we need that alien threat that Reagan talked about um maybe even uh what was it a Jimmy Kimmel Bill Clinton said the same thing but\nYou know you said like he's a David alien thing or something\nTo bring us together and ah you know that that's the whole the president's talking about alien threats that you know it's so easy thing really to search for signs of intelligent life beyond our solar system\nI'm\nIn addition to the incredible distances involved in the fact that uh\nWe really only have indirect methods at our disposal to look for us to trust your life and we have people who say they look up and they see the stars and they they see the the flashing lights in the sky or they see UFOs during the daytime which by the way there seems to be this inordinate amount of UFOs sightings there was actually a signing on the east coast\nUm some ... in the Carolinas before the earthquake and not the before the before hurricane Michael hit to the Gulf or apparently is going to get into the the the Carolinas Carolina's having some really harsh weather since um\nSince Florence and and so now Michael May give them a little taste to some more water and more more rain but that doesn't mean that after the hurricanes they didn't see UFOs and apparently I like someone sent me footage I'm\nFrom ah Myrtle Beach actually someone saying that a UFO oversight over Myrtle Beach and they said it was just for the black he was talking about\nAnd um I really and CD you out for myself I was looking at the footage but I didn't see the UFO I sought whites but I don't know\nThat we could call that something that's outer space but you know I guess if the person you know when they saw her the by two shows said well you know you hear the UFO it's supposed to be seen and that was what Carol David Davis was saying\nThere would be a UFO that would seem to be at three o'clock in the evening east coast time so I don't know um I don't know if that counts you know it's like I told somebody I said you're sixty percent of the time I think the cubes right you know the times I don't know but uh you know it just depends on you know if you can really understanding here\nWhat's being said and so you know in and let you use something like that but then again it's still specious as to what you're getting and like you said a lot of ... indirect methods to contact or at least try to find\nA science and tells you a wife and I mean there's also the small problem of not knowing exactly what to look for\nAnd I think you know while we've had many people saying well this is what you're supposed to look for these are many UFO researchers and writers that of take it upon themselves to the researchers and writers scientists are like oh we don't know exactly what we're looking for so they're arguing\nOver synthetic lives are arguing over extraterrestrial biological live they're arguing over small celled organisms are arguing over aquatic life maybe\nLike on cell it is or you know other um ice planet ... icy moons like hop in Star Wars intelligent life\nDoes exist beyond our solar system\nI've always wondered well okay you want to communicate with alien well how are they going to communicate with us I mean or would they even communicate with like we do I mean would they use radio transmitters that use other forms of technology communicate I'm probably not\nAnd will be will say well they shouldn't be advanced enough to know our language not necessarily I mean there are plenty of\nSmart or intellectually advanced human beings who don't speak the language you speak and sometimes we if they don't speak our language of misconstrued as being not as smart and that that was one of the problems I had\nWhen I was learning a foreign language and uh you know I was a young kid and I was like you know\nI was learning a language but I forgot that you know when I'm listening someone else speak English from a different country you know they're trying to speak the language\nAnd sometimes we say well listen to them the way they speak they they don't know language enough so we we misinterpreted that is not being very smart but the truth the matter is that the fact that he can foreigners that they can even formed sentences the fact that they can even formed sentences that are even intelligible makes them intelligent\nIt's like the argument over whether or not millennia Trump was smarter whether or not being an underwear model made are stupid and they were comparing and Michelle Obama and I thought well God you know yeah I'm a shell has her good points uh and she's pretty smart but then they said no millennia Trump stoop and they wait wait wait wait wait she speaks like what eight different languages\nAnd uh you know it's so ... I don't know how many that that Michelle Obama speaks but come on I mean if a person can speak that many languages are really smart and if they're able to keep track of those languages they're pretty smart in fact I envy what our producers he speaks Mandarin Chinese\nHe speaks Mandarin Chinese I Would love to learn how to speak Mandarin Chinese because then I'd be able to say I speak English I speak Spanish and I speak Mandarin Chinese\nThe three languages that most people should learn if they want to get ahead in business\nOnly got two of them Spanish and English\nAnd Spanish is the language of labor or English Mandarin will be the language of big business because we all know the future and we all know where China is in our future so Mandarin Chinese baby gotta learn Mandarin so you can get around and you know order things on their menu other than general ... chicken so\nThat sets important of course if you want to be in business but see that's the thing you know communicating with daily and so that's a bigger deal\nDoing if we were you in language of the of of other people's ear on this planet ancient languages would be difficult I don't know if anybody speaks ... I'm a you know made up languages I guess that's Broncos made up we're going on is made up but you can still be going on in Esperanto\nBut ah using radio transmitters using other things are lights signals hell even smoke signals these are a ways of communicating\nAnd so\nThis seems to be what the preoccupation is right now\nI mean it used to be well we want proof of aliens have arrived we want them to land on the White House lawn well Saturday and Medi course the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and many messaging extraterrestrial intelligence international these groups are dumped care ... plan on the White House\nThey want to be able to get a signal a techno signature they want to be able to get something\nThat can prove that they're out they're communicating they they and and believe me I'm I'm going to tell you this today I was looking over notes and what prompted me to do this show tonight was an article in business insider\nOkay Business Insider talking about what we were talking about a few nights ago\nWith regard to extraterrestrials with regards to um the numbers with regard to techno signatures with regard to listening for the communication looking up and this guy seeing what ever it is out there keeping your mind open looking for extraterrestrials in space\nOr looking for a you know that moment you know we should be looking for those moments because those moments are happening more than we realize\nLast night there was a um\nThere was a a huge media I guess the crash in a place called ...

picked up on the signal and unbeknownst to most people it's affecting them a different way\nOkay now that's that's pretty huge now there's no need to panic but there is a cause for concern because we don't know who are being exposed to these sounds\nAnd those were really listening for them as I said many people just got it right opposite tonight is or something else\nTruth is the universe\nIs a

and and and the uh\nYou know sending of extraterrestrial intelligence at many practitioners although it's been a lot of time wondering how these messages are being transmitted and they're hoping they can find a source before more people pick up on this sounds but at the moment are buried in the background of yours noise\nAnd here's a little secret some people already hearing posting waves that are hovering above us\nAnd for those of you that I've heard it I'll describe it as a vibrating low hum but is usually heard away from the city enforced deserts and uh they're it's hurt all over the world okay so\nRecently there was a story out of Sweden where there was a mysterious humming ... it was recorded the sound was a constant pulsing home that according to witnesses lasted forty five minutes\nScene was filmed by a man named Renee ... print ski back in December but only recently did he catch the attention of paranormal investigators according to the world are witness Mr ...\nNoticed he basically noticed that there was this odd sound in northern Sweden he said that he was after snowstorm big snowstorm covered mountaintop beautiful area quiet morning\nAnd get frisky it said it was really the says that the humming noise was constant and seemed almost vibrate the air above me\nAlthough he expressed certainty that the harm was coming from the sky crane Pinsky conceded that he couldn't quite determine from which direction was emanating from as it appeared to be coming from every direction in the sky above me also noted\nHe had visited location before and it it's unusually very quiet there which was weird because that home could be hurting a quiet area which made the ...\nWas just made it more mystifying for him and he's you know what it what\nHe said that after about an hour you said the noise dissipated exhibit a move somewhere else\nYeah how\nMany of you probably if your Internet a to Z used it probably already heard that song because it's it's making the rounds cause it's an amazing sound especially when it's out in the middle of nowhere in in the snow in in northern sweet\nSo here is that sound you just said pulse wave sound it came from out of nowhere and ah well explain more about this fall sway sounding what might be going not listen to this or we go [noise]\n\nNor do they know how to identify it [noise]\nBut yet the sounds are

I thought it was ... I didn't know I knew in county\nAnd a very ... it had impact right it it hit the earth\nWe don't know what we thought flash out in the eye but you're the only person who has said anything about it we've been waiting to hear something on the news or anything really because we weren't sure what it was and you were the first person either an educator urge\nYoung I had I had so many people who said that they saw something I'm a first came in and that was in Lincoln county\nRight and I saw ... S C I didn't know what ... was a and then\nWe had never heard of ... when I Lived in Oregon for\nNearly a teen years a little town yeah\nYeah so ... and then uh other people said they these sites or in other states have big fireball so it must have been huge mostly came in on a trajectory out pretty huge and then uh\nAnd then of course they said that ah somebody said that it was impact there was impacted style so somewhere else I oh there's a very very very valuable rock\nThat came out of the sky and blew up\nNo kidding yeah yeah we kind of break apart and then move on but yeah you get you to bring it up\nAnd was there okay was there any rumbling was there any pop was there any boom I heard booms to is there a boom you heard\nWe were we were in the car I'm Sorry we were driving we just saw the light attack object and it looked like it broke apart\nBut so I'm the only guy to report of this [laughter]\nAt least we can now right either\nOkay well what'd you think what what did you think what you thought\nOh I got fired ... ... ... well I yeah I Know I get\nSo you didn't think it was an alien or anything to do when you first saw\nFile hurtful\nDonuts good old Tyler how old are you ...\nYou're almost ten was that your\nFirst fireball you've ever seen have you seen them before\nThis one calling\nWhile ... in and that's an amazing thing you first thing is a firework and then when you see it explode and you go wait a minute that's a firework what'd you think that\nYou got a little scare\nYou did oh man yeah I got a little I got a little scared when I saw my first fireball too\nI was a little scared they was it was because I thought oh my God this is a big fire both going to hit the planet and we were gone were governors\nSo that's good you're still around to talk about you'll be able to tell everybody about it oh and did you make a wish on it because I have you make a wish that you get your wish did you make a wish\nNo okay\nI figured I'd be maybe we're wishing that the ... the parade is destroyed our planet\n[laughter]\nPretty big Well Tyler I really appreciate your eye with this report buddy\nYou for letting me\nOh you bet you bet buddy and Jeremiah thank you for the time was a I Would this report I really appreciate it\nHard to hear you better take care Bye bye bye\nBye wow [laughter] Jeremiah saw the\nThe a big old fireball came down over ... county Oregon I I got a lot of people who said up all over the United states is western part of the United states is on his fireball but it wasn't until it was reported out of Lincoln county was being came down it was huge\nAnd some people so they heard of boom and bust and\nSo obviously and hit the ground over in ... S C I oh say oh it's ... a truly except for three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three three seven hundred meanwhile we're trying to determine what those sounds were heard out there in ah\nNorthern Sweden [noise] northern sweetened the guy a it was recording some weird sounds coming out of out of the sky\nIs the low rumble of it to he said he's never heard before didn't sound like a car or a train or anything in the middle of nowhere out in the mountains beautiful snowy mountains that of course there's this weird strange that noise coming out of a Utah in August of from Doug boy proving grounds which the area where they may call it the new area fifty one\nSo we have to wonder if these are spaceships or if this\nIs part of a techno signature a re\nWhen the sounds in the patterns maybe seeing a boat Mehdi ... city [noise] and they're not telling us about it because we just don't know how to identify it or communicate back with AAA thinks it with three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\n\nMessaging to raise ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a

overhead and so it was my little shut up and I drove people there in Florida and Georgia and all the places being affected by\nHurricane Michael so anyway\nSo we were talking about tonight let me just to get back to what we're talking about night so I'm really I'm fascinated here and I am I going to let up until I get to the bottom is okay I'm fascinated by the comments coming out of the search rush rush to intelligence\nAnd the\nExtraterrestrial ... and they're beginning to act as though they are located something okay they're not telling us they've located somebody but I've had several meetings one in California University of California Irvine\nThey had a workshop in Texas just a few weeks ago on how to identify technical signatures in space it's one of the reasons why we brought the black Cuban skull on because we wanted to talk about this techno signatures maybe some people be up as we can pick up on both frequency higher frequency whatever\nSo\nWe have to look at various ways did aliens would be make contact with us or how we make contact with that money on this program as well I mean not just a black Cuba we've also at times he wouldn't run brought this up would you do to reduce we'd blow\nInto did reduce and we'd blow them over the over the air blew they did reduce over the years so in hopes that the signal would go out on all the radios all over the country and all the signals all over the country we send the huge orange found this ancient sound\nVenture aliens would understand and listened to\n\nAnd uh you know and and nights we do this we've had like UFO's sightings you had all kinds of cool things going on\nJust last night we had a a a huge fireball come down out of the sky silent Oregon in Lincoln county up you were telling you about it or we just got tired of Jeremiah calling the program the last star seem to be so that was the only guy to report it and they saw the wonder if anybody else ...\nAnd apparently it had an impact a little bit of boom there\nBut see I've been reading a lot of things lately about this whole techno signature ... stuff and for more advanced uh you know what they're looking for more advanced civilizations using these take the signatures\nWell\nI also was reading that there are some people that are bitter believing that uh that there's more to it than just listening for the techno signatures that we may be under the control of some of these techno signatures as a human ears picked up on the signals and unbeknownst to most people\nAffecting them in different ways so far there's been no need to panic because they don't know which is how the sequels affecting people but it certainly is affecting people and the truth is that there are plenty of extraterrestrial signals out there the world the whole universe is awash in extraterrestrial signals that we can't even perceive\nOr do you even know about and let someone else ... basically says listen that you hear that that's what we're looking at right now the and so city in ...\nThe guy that runs city and Betty spend a lotta time wondering how these messages are being transmitted they're hoping they can find a source before more people pick up on the sound at the moment they you know because they married they actually buried in the\nBackground of earth noise but uh\nLike I said some people were already hearing his pulsing sound I recently there was a a story out of Sweden where mysterious humming sound was recorded that sounded a constant pulsing home\nBut according to witnesses lasted forty five minutes to an hour a there was there's a film on the Internet going by right now a snow covered mountains ... out in the middle of nowhere you leading out there are a bunch of guys on a\nOn a snowmobiles and they come by occasionally but what you hear is just a really low frequency home and here's that sound this is from a northern Switzerland or a man by the name of Renee ...\nHad a record of this back in December after snowfall just recently got the attention of a paranormal investigator sitting here\nIs that home no that's not the hummus try another one\nIt's a wait a minute [laughter] here's behind that was from Utah here's another home [noise]\n\nSo this was filmed by a man named Renee ... Pinsky back in December mysterious humming noise that day he picked up on he said that uh it was rattling the house she said that he will like it was rattling the sky\nOr very mystifying he said he was like something was moving from one end of the sky to the other\n... could not figure out what it was it was like so many visible thing will be cross the guy who was rumbling a sonics out\nIn August it was a report of another home near Doug we proving grounds which of course Doug way proving ground some people say is the northern arm of area fifty one it's in Utah I've been there it has a lot of ah gates in danger science don't go in there and uh\nSo here's the sound of the home it that way which is a little bit more aggravating to hear but here it is [noise]\n\n\n\nThe earlier I had talked about how a sounded like bees the humming sweet and in the ... in\nAh Utah Doug way reminded me of a well known a recording of police officers in Saint Helen's Oregon uh they said they saw white a bright light on the Columbia River at four thirty\nIn the morning or for twenty three in the morning and they wanted to be able to record the sound of this shift to space ship as it was taking off from the Columbia and I wanted to play that moment against you can hear how it compares to the other sounds you've heard so here's that recording the police officers recording to take off his UFO\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] so you have it says the hell is Oregon police officers watching a UFO take off from the Columbia king up their microphone on the radio so you can hear it you hear the ... the sound and this is why you\nKnow these sonic sounds or whatever they may be\nA these strange noises that were picking up on in the skies not just the orange anymore these homes these lower ... sees a peace pulsating homes now these could be experimental aircraft but then again they could be as I've said before\nSome sort of techno ... signature technological signature from extraterrestrials okay\nSome extraterrestrial intelligence [noise] sending pulse it [noise] and just setting them through space or the setting them through the skies and were picking up on [noise] and ah [noise] we don't know what kind of effect it has on people see certainly amazing [noise]\nSee here's what these craft if their craft sound like a what the common sound like when we play the [noise] so uh I mean if you've heard them and you've written off as a as the night as I'd like to talk with you wouldn't let you and ask you though actually where you've heard the\nMonth after the discovery\nOf of these nano particles that something bizarre happened we had a number of people we had a Russian\nPatriarch a few others go down to Antarctica to visit and this may be why we'll be back\nNews radio special report hurricane Michael hurricane Michael is moving across Georgia meteorologist bill ... says that even though the storm is weakening overland it still causing damage\nWe still have trees that are falling out of houses card power lines so central Georgia and people are sitting in their home tearing the whistling of the wind and grabbing their kids and our dog and heading into say from\nThe storm is continuing to weaken now down to a category one storm still it's rare for residents this far inland to face hurricane force winds\nAlbany is about a hundred and Ninety miles from Appalachian coal of Florida close to where the storm made landfall nearly three hundred thousand customers are without power in Florida and another eighty thousand in Alabama and Georgia officials are urging residents in impacted areas and that could be up to thirty million not to risk driving at night\nPresident Trump says his staff is working with the governors of the southeastern United States to help deal with the impact of Michael\nBrian shook NBC News radio\n[noise] sweater on TALK radio six forty double duty as the\nHurricane Michael makes landfall with heavy rains moving into Georgia beginning tonight I'm CBS forty six cheaply are all just tossed me mostly cloudy skies with showers low temperature in your seventies Thursday morning windy conditions twenty to thirty mile per hour winds with a steady rain\nNow the worst of it will be to our south metro so we're talking about eating than pike Lamar Spalding counties heavy rain windy conditions but by the end of the afternoon and evening that moves out quickly and maybe some sunshine by the end of the day I'm ...\nJust listen to launch and you'll love us if you don't they listen again until you do talk radio six forty ...

neutrinos in Antarctica so what does that mean it'd be well something's coming from face going through the planet and coming out the other side caffeine in Antarctica at least evidence has been going on\nIn March twenty sixteen [noise] February March twenty sixteen\nSo okay so let's just go back to the timeline for just a bit record the timeline gay so December\nTwenty Seventeen we heard these homes gate August of twenty eight team we\nHeard the strange comes in Utah\nOkay well we go back to twenty six to eight\nYou remember the focus everybody had on an article research into extraterrestrial relationships twenty six feet before march twenty six team and the discovery of these strange particles emanating from Antarctica\nHe's alien neutrinos this cosmic signature and an article Russian patriarch here real visited a Russian outpost in Antarctica he reportedly went there to see the penguins were blessed the penguins they say\nWell just over a month later on march twenty third President Obama rejected the southern orange and joined resort of body ... and some say that he was there also to investigate a moon communications outpost\nIt was going to be built in Patagonia by the Chinese oh he was also rumored to have also been washed away to Antarctica now why well\nNovember ninth twenty sixteen elections right secretary of State John Kerry lands in Antarctica just after the U.S presidential election we have the hand off between\nObama and Trump but why is John Kerry flying to Antarctica what was said that he was there to observe fine conditions

what's called altitude sickness as long as we're filling up with new cars and they had to fly him out of Antarctica\nSo a Russian religious strict you're a U.S secretary of state and astronaut president all went to Antarctica after scientists discovered what could be evidence of extraterrestrials I'll be a communication and our life forms that that live off the air there\nOkay we talked

grew up in West Texas so we used to go skiing or all the time\nOn a [noise] you know the last twenty twenty five years I've always heard like little reports about uh people ... hearing some strange down the ... is in\nIn that day those are the Lincoln for this area and uh I I never heard it myself but other than in the waiting an article in the newspaper when times I've seen it on like a new shows throughout the years about people\nSay they're here will weird noises here so I you know I I I don't know it's close to ... is what seems\nA little range pretty close right there and further west there's a there's a town called so called ... ... ... so called the nuts but to the consequences will click on\nInterstate twenty five ... west ... national forest is a huge array of satellite

... for\nSo have you ever heard of a towel some it's a New Mexico to\nYes I've heard of the ... and I've been to to Santa Fe I've been in the house area not as much as to the U.S all but\nI I've heard of that housing that's any average ... ship the natural over the last twenty five years at a ... ... ... you know never said that I'm\nWell I'm a you know we saw something on our way to Roswell from El Paso that was kind of interesting we saw this curved we don't know what it was it was curved and it was in the clouds and it was near the area on the road from El Paso to A Rod's well\nWhenever the church and there's a huge cross on this big a kind of a mountainous area out in the ... area and we saw this round cylinder coping in the clouds is we're\nGoing in so it was big it was huge I thought my God and independent thing\nYou see that in the middle of nowhere where no one's going to see it except view and the and the coyotes and so that's the that's the problem so ah you know have your camera ready when you're out there and play with like El Paso and sickle row and white fans areas you know\nYou go you you you can pick up on some really interesting things about daylight UFOs and anomalies out there so\nIt's pretty weird weird a sightseeing if you go out there in the middle of nowhere [noise]\nYeah that I don't know that if there's some one of those more to see their Seventy something in that area I'm interested to other intelligent life ...\nI Would say so in fact we were talking about the atomic alien theory where you know they actually have ripped open a hole in space time right that area near trinity I just the whole area you'd be creeps because of what might have been or what [noise] aliens mia blended there but now we have this strange homes and noises that they're\nPicking up on ... an article what do you things happening Tripoli six have been three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free

aircraft could this be something that can be sent from space like a signal\nThese these Bill Cosby XO cosmic dust signals coming through there are a lot of things to think about especially when they're discovering some of these particles that don't exist there they go against the standard model and that's what blows me away\nI was going to win in Tennessee I heard when you're on ground zero\n[laughter] Hi Hi I'm\nI'm I found this topic very interesting and uh um but I did a little research on the ... because it was my understanding that you know neutrinos generally just came from the sun\nRight during my research I found out it or they were getting from a number of sources are ablaze saw large metallic cloud of ... and and the supernova Nineteen eighty seven eight mhm\nAnd and um and and the fact that neutrino or detectors have to be buried so\nVery very deep in the ground and they have the extremely large\nOr what what are you where it came to my attention is this has been an article where are you know at the poll a media writes in in media or where they're all they're they're found very easily and and it's commonplace to find things that just fall who stay\nIn in that and touch region of our planet right um so you know it came to mind a lot of tension that way if while they were building this neutrino detector system has to be so deep in the ground\nSo large that they ran across something they've found something that lady shouldn't have been ... you know ... and and and that may explain these new or a microorganism\nSee that's it you know it might be if y'all out from from whatever they may have filed was building there's detector so the question is you know where each\nOne is the fall out why does it go against the the uh when they called the classic model these go against everything the classic model opera see right not son particles these aren't new part these aren't these are not neutrinos from the sun is not neutrinos from Russia quasars something else these are neutrinos from\nOr what we called break off from any kind of I guess\nNuclear fuel or anything it would be similar to nuclear fuel so this is somebody that doesn't belong on this planet is being a ... for the Antarctic ... into space\nExactly because you know neutrinos generally follow one path and um the majority of them was perpendicular throughout pointed and we're finding their detected large numbers of these\nAre coming from the poll you know that that that's\nThat's a bit odd out and to make a magnetic field or or whatever even affect the trajectory of the armored particle right and ... and you know it it is really concerns me 'cause well you know\nThe the pay is detectors have to be buried deep underground in deal with a water\nAnd in in order to the you know to detect the neutrino that large numbers of it has to bounce off a particle right have a ... a a heavy water ... you write and what we need it said he'd be water molecule it creates a splash that the detector can detect\nAnd that's how they detected neutrinos\nNow while they're building they're incredibly large apparatus this you know this is the he's the trainer detectors are not quite ... not quite as widely known as the ah had drawn a collider right at least those things are models twenty the mile law in intercom\nNow needs to take these neutrino detectors they're not quite as large right but they are in the vicinity of at work and she wouldn't nature and when they're taking down into their eyes but has not been disturbed\nOr hundreds of thousands of years I mean I'm we might they look they may have found a thing\nLiterally yeah like the movie yes they move around a thing as if they're\nIn and and they could open a planet up to something we're not ready to ...\n... and that's why they had to bring down the Russian Orthodox a patriarch a president sitting there ... all the all these our all all of these\nUm um public figures in in the politicians in and scientists to what you know it it it's scary\nCome really come see what we discovered come see the alien that we've discovered come see the the the creature that lives on practically nothing lives on Aaron sunshine doesn't live on any food lives in a harsh conditions\nAnd look what he's putting up putting off neutrinos that are not the classic model sending a signal out into space and then we're getting a signal back and this is why we're so concerned about type technical signatures SETI\nThey could just be the microorganism whatever they found charity you know we carry microorganism bacteria\nIn our bodies are foreigners just to live just for us to survive you know have good farmland bad right now what ... wherever they found that may be there and it may be very first to our biological\nSo they're keeping contained there obviously but they they're they're they're certainly concerned about the signatures is giving up there certainly concerned about what we're hearing what we're watching this the the fast radio burst the ... the the rumbles in the horn sounds in the air\nThey're concerned about these things because they just don't know how to identify it they can I did I\nNot coincidence no it's not a coincidence and all\nThis going out and said oh something's\nBeen found in an article something was ah\nAh actually sending a signal out from space I Believe it was more and more they traced the signals to an article that neutrinos signals were also trace this is definitely communication and they won't tell us it's communication until they most certainly habit pinpointed as to how the communication was set and what was done and what the what the result will be\n[noise] in the in this day and age they can't hide anything no had anything from the public I

I Hope we don't find out too late before we can do anything about it yeah\nIt's amazing time 'cause Oh thank you for your expertise thank you for calling the program said it's a it's it's definitely something that I'm sure\nThey both the president or those who want disclosure and all this never thought this was going to be happening the way it is a lot of people are like you know talking about you know\nOther things going on in Antarctica that may have nothing to do with this but it certainly is interesting how this is all coming together I don't think anybody is mentioning\nHow important it is to notice that the things coming out of there do not and and do not fit they do not fit the model the standard model that science has show is breaking all the rules of physics right now\nVery very interesting time to be like very very interesting time to look at what's happening around the planet and how everything is pointing to\nPay in habitable date and time for full disclosure of what's happening out there in space Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven three three seven hundred will get back [noise]\n\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it seeps are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet wouldn't it be great if there was a saint that had to look up a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino\nIron works safe had rhino safe dot com American Made an antique styled our Shapes Our part art part furniture and\nSomeone in your family but was ground zero and also you know you go to Amazon dot com type in my ... my books are there you can get my books as well so they make great gifts you can get them now whether it's still an expensive because I don't know how the mark up on Amazon and I know that if you go to the ground zero store ground zero store dot dot org\nThey are very kind to actually slashed prices at first and then the courts give you some great deals every once in a while you go to the store you get a great deal in a ground zero to ...
