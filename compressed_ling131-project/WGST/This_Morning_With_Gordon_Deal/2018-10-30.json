impact conference for registered investment advisors\nDefense secretary Jim Mattis discusses national defense strategy at the U.S Institute of peace President Trump as you heard Michael mentioned is also making news this morning telling Axios he plans to sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship\nFor babies of unauthorized immigrants Bloomberg Washington reporter Kathleen hunter joins me now with more on this a breaking news that would obviously go beyond the order we've been hearing about in the previous day's Kate\nThat would have a bar to asylum seekers essentially using emergency powers\nYeah it seems as though Trump is kind of I'm going a step further as you say and um I think it's not coincidental that where you know a week out from the mid term elections I\nHe does now say that he doesn't that idea that's come up before um and something that he floated as possibility I'm trying to pursue an end to birthright citizenship you talked about it a little bit during the campaign\nAnd a couple of times since then but it seems as though he now is potentially going to be taking a much closer look at that although I think it's worth noting that he doesn't seem to be mentioning a time and the White House this morning when we contacted them obviously wouldn't commit to any kind of timeframe for that so it's unclear when this is going to happen\nRight and you mentioned the timing of this announcement makes you wonder what with a coming just a week before election day whether the president is essentially using this announcement as as something of an October surprise\nI think he definitely is using this announcement coming on the heels of the announcement yesterday from the administration that they're going to send more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border\nAs a way to sort of fire up the base out of the mid term elections obviously this is these are both policy a policy doctrines that would appeal to the base and would resonate with them and\nCould have the potential of achieving our public and goals a political standpoint which is to get their voters to the polls on election day a week from now which is something that I think has been a Republican concerned that those voters are not going to come out as strongly as democratic voters who have a real enthusiasm edge over Republicans according to a lot of polls\nYeah when you talk about uh the the White House not telling us when perhaps the president could sign such an order a it raises the question of the that probably has kept the president for acting all this time on what he's talked about a year in terms of\nUh acting on birthright citizenship whether it was such an order would stand up to constitutional scrutiny\nAnd that's a real question because you know on the fourteenth amendment essentially and I've been interpreted to guarantee birthright citizenship that states that someone clearly and I think that it's interesting to note that in the ... and the accidents interview on that was released this morning excerpts of the interview that were that were released this morning\nThe president essentially asserted that he does have this authority he conceded that in the past she's been told he doesn't have that that you know but now he believes that he does it's a little bit unclear what he thinks it's changed and what kind of guy and he's gotten that's different now\nBut I think the real interesting questions has been all play out you know there's no clear answer the laws kind of a fluid thing if the president decides that he has the authority to do that single it goes ahead and does it it would be up to the courts send to determine whether or not that caught that passes constitutional muster and that would be some of in a somewhat of an open question that the courts would then have to resolve\nBut if nothing else I guess this is telling us that the president really does see immigration as a ... what would you say the issue for the mid term\nI think the president sees it as a winning issue for them in terms and I think that a winning issue for Republicans and I think that that is clear and many of the actions that he's taking over the past several days and whether or not that turned out to be the case I think will be a one of the big questions on November seventh\nThanks for this case that's a Bloomberg

President Trump we found that he it's only topped by two other issues in midterms advertising in that health care\nAnd taxes [laughter] um so he went to them or three and a common theme in mid term advertising\nRight and then in terms of those themes he is portrayed sometimes positively and sometimes negatively\nThat's right and there's actually a\nSurprising amount of positive Trump ads out there when we found that even I'm In a Democratic Senate and\nHe's turning up any positive supportive way not singing in places like Indiana\nWest Virginia where the Democratic senator it's trying to
