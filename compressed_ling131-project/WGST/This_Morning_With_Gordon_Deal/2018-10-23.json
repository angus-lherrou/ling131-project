would do if they get a life changing jak blocked\nOne point six billion billion somebody's got to win it tonight I mean I'm I'm Still surprise nobody won at the last time around when it was just below a billion dollars\nThey were waiting for me you know must have been what it was in line last night [laughter] that was me to four hours a day or they are in a dark on Twitter powered by more than ... other journalists metal is more than under twenty countries are Michael Barr this is Bloomberg may be\nAll right thank you Michael we're live from the Bloomberg interactive brokers studios coming up on six fifty one\nOn Wall street time to check what's going on in D.C some of the top stories in our nation's capital include the White House holding a state Leadership Conference for officials from Alaska California Hawaii the Heritage Foundation hosted event on the U.S auto industry and trade Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio among the speakers\nAnd ... the U.S takes part in an event at the Brookings Institution today called on the brink of brags that the United kingdom Ireland and Europe\nAlso making news this morning as Michael mentioned Turkish president retro type air to one statement on the death of Saudi journalist ...\nFor the latest we bring in Bloomberg Washington reporter Kathleen hunter and Kate Irwin is now saying that the killing was meticulously planned plod rejecting the Saudi explanation that it was an accident in the middle of a brawl uh now I guess the question is how does President Trump react\nExactly I think that's what everyone's going to be watching in Washington and across the globe this morning Trump so far you know as we've discussed previously\nHas been a bit reticent compared it leads to his ah you know allies abroad um other world leaders\nAnd members of Congress to criticize the Saudi Government if he's kind of set all along you know we need to kind of wait and see what comes out and now in light of airlines comments which were fairly harsh and frankly harsher than what Trump himself has said so far I think there's going to be renewed pressure on Trump to you know be more for him and what he has to say\nFairly harsh but one name or that or the one that didn't mention in his remarks crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\n[noise] yeah I think that's really really um notable and I think in in some ways you know the fact that he didn't mention the crown prince by name I think is being viewed as\nPotentially him leaving the door open to kind of giving NBS an outs when it comes to being personally responsible are personally were ... involved somehow in this killing which is what you know obviously a lot of the speculation and you know evidence that's come forward so far has has at least pointed in that direction and so I think the fact that\nEveryone didn't mention him by name I think is is very pointed on his part\nSo how much pressure now is Saudi Arabia on to conduct a thorough and open investigation into ... killing\nI think there's going to be continuing mounting pressure I think uh the the thing to watch it again as Trump is that you know\nAir to want to certainly called for that a U.S allies in Europe and elsewhere have called for that um and I think that now you know Trump if Trump were to come out and bury member of members of Congress are calling for that if Trump were to come out very directly and call for that\nThat would be significant um however you know if he doesn't do that in the absence of that I think that also will be significant and that will give us some additional breathing room for the crown prince and also for Saudi Arabia more generally\nWell let's move on to something President Trump has called for a middle class tax cut around the mid term now he's saying that it's gonna come after is this plan looking a little bit more like it's starting to coalesce now\nA little bit more although you know Republican lawmakers in the house are still saying they don't have any specific legislation in the works when it comes to this I think the issue is that Trump is being a bit more specific and he's kind of indicated\nThat on this tax cut they talking about which would be a ten percent tax cut that wouldn't apply just in the middle class but you know what it would apply it\nOffensively across the board which means that you know rich people beginning it too but um I think that you know it sounds like they're like they're looking to attach it to some smaller scale legislation that might move on after the elections but um you know so much at this point Nathan really hinges on the outcome of the election\nAnd you know if Democrats are to gain control of the house they're going to be really really unlikely to support anything and um you know Republicans may lose their motivation to do anything so I think the real issue here is that Trump is trying to message on tax cuts and tax cuts for the middle class how to them in terms without actually having to do any real follow through necessarily\nMan in terms of the outcome of the election are less than a minute left Democrats are starting to raise some concerns about turnout particularly among Latinos and young people\nYeah those are two groups that are going to be really pivotal I think for Democrats in part because you know they they are two groups that are tend to vote very liberally very liberal so they would be natural democratic supporters and also because\nThey don't tend to come out in his in high levels during non presidential election years so it's a big unknown really if those voters stay home that could mean that'll that some of these races the Democrats are hoping when actually don't break their way\nBloomberg Washington reporter Kathleen hunter thanks as always you can read more about these stories on Bloomberg dot com or on the Bloomberg Terminal and a reminder that you can follow all the latest on Bloomberg Radio in Washington DC on Bloomberg Ninety nine one one oh five

some definite science to tell you as a small business or whether it's time to take on additional workers according to the payroll services provider ATP if you're spending too much of your to your chores but take it away from critical decision making and strategic planning think about adding staff\nOr the other side your workforce is inadequate is arise number of customer complaints too few workers can result in customers falling through the cracks or the loss of priests\nFact of customers used questions go unacknowledged\nOther other red flags says ATP get noticed was staff experience increased stress levels display or lack of attention to detail request time off more frequently due to illness\nStill iron requires money and if you can't afford to shell out for full time right now

when you look at that um the cohesion that they have to put together\nI was trying to figure out what is it what are the bellwether state will tell you whether they can pull this off or not it seems

school will be um [noise] targeted but if a state law to practice and so they do and they take it very seriously\nAnd um [noise] you know it's it's it's a lot of work when you have students who are severe autism Down syndrome other behavioral challenges that one of them are\nA few disorders or you know medical issues and um they they work hard to to to do what they need to do\nA lot of these students have one on one eight so when the when the alarm found the it's you know it just goes to as a student and they walk out together or some of them in the oxygen tanks or\nI'm sort of items to calm them down like blankets or fit spinners some of them have these things called social story which are like um [noise]\nLike flash cards with visual symbol and stuff you know a flame or um [noise] you know people lining up outside of a door to help uh students don't understand really what's going on to the to sort of get the instructions [laughter]\nIt's a fascinating story by the wall Street Journal's Leslie Brody she writes about education and her piece is called an era of school shootings the most vulnerable students most prep for the worst\nHow would a first responders help out given some of the disability or fears like overwhelming fears of some of these students may have\n[noise] well I I think that the school has a relationship with the police department in town and so you know police officers now ah\nThe kind of students that attend\nA digital that I didn't have first responders there but um you know with such a high staff to student ratio I I think that the uh you know the staff would be largely in charge of the students in the first responders I imagine would be instructing the staff\nBut I I that's a good question and some of these students are are very I'm terrified by noises and they're they're really crave consistency so something like a drill that gets them outside of what they're used to can be hard for some of them\nYet to that point I I think you mentioned there was one student who sort of froze when he got to a doorway and didn't necessarily want to go outside of that time\nRight and some of the male staffer ... where I used to him doing that it's it's happened before so they very quickly kind of came over to him and scoop\nTheir arms under his arm pits in kind of lifted him up a little bit to get his feet to start going again and helped him get to the evacuation site and another girl who are really hates the noise she's about Fifteen she began to cry and kind of hit or south in the back of the neck aid knew exactly what calmed down which was having her\nHead rubbed in a certain way some of these teachers and AIDS another student\nNeeds so typically that they know what Congress them down so the flare ups I thought were pretty quickly address but it was interesting when the same thing happened on the when they were the drill with over and they were heading back to\nSchool the Eighteen year old who budged on the front steps before that you know getting to the evacuation said he did the same thing on the return trip\nUm and uh that the teacher knew what to do\nWith Leslie Wall Street journal education reporter Leslie ... it is
