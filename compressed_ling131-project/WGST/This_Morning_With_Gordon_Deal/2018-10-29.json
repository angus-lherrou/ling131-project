Bloomberg bedroom\nFull disclosure I liked the Dodgers but I Love sleep it is that six fifty now on Wall street and we are live from the Bloomberg interactive brokers studios\nTime to check what's going on in D.C with a little more than a week left until the mid term elections two acts of hate filled apparently politically motivated violence dominated the Sunday Morning political talk shows heard here on Bloomberg Radio eleven people killed inside the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh at least fourteen crude bombs mailed to critics of President Trump across the country last week\nABC's This week Hurd from two members of the Pittsburgh city council Corey O'Connor\nIs scary when you look at\nTimes that happen across the country and then when it hits home and it has\nAn ... burger and\nPresident Trump is adjusted the carnage inside the synagogue could have been avoided if an armed guard were inside Pittsburgh Mayor Bill produced hotels NBC's Meet the press that's not the solution\nFor dealing with an irrational person who acted irrationally and trying to create laws around that is not the way that we should govern\nDiscussion also turned to other overheated political rhetoric is driving a rational people over the edge\nI Am concerned that this hateful deranged act by a man I'm acting on his anti Semitic hatred\nUm it's just the latest in a series of violent incidents this past week that shows that our national political culture is motivating folks who are inspired by a stage by fear by bigotry democratic\nSenator Chris Coons on CBS face the nation Republican James Lankford was asked on the same program whether President Trump is stoking that fear\nI don't see any connection where you would connect the president or to this particular shirt and just like I wouldn't see that connecting Democrats when a person walked up to a baseball game last year in Washington DC so does this or where the Republicans are practicing and opened fire on there was simply because they were Republicans\nHomeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen address the same issue in reference to the accused male bombers things are say are who was apparently a Trump supporter telling Fox News Sunday\nAnybody who he is the first amendment at Harvard to threaten or commit an act of violence that will not be tolerated\nAnd that is just some of the discussion you can hear every Sunday on Bloomberg Radio starting with NBC's Meet the press at eleven AM Wall Street time followed by Fox News Sunday at noon ABC's This week at one PM and face the nation from CBS at two o'clock\nLet's get more now and all this from Bloomberg Washington reporter\nKathleen hunter and you know with just eight days left now until the mid term election it is really interesting to see how these acts of violence have sort of morphed into this discussion of the vitriolic rhetoric we've seen in our politics over the last movie I guess I guess you could arguably say couple of years now [noise]\nAbsolutely I think the thing he doesn't mind that mid term elections always and I'm very specifically this midterm election is being framed by the minority party as a referendum on President and on and you know the White House and his ... his leadership\nAnd so I think well normally that turns into discussion about policy in this era when so much of Trump's White house in Trump's persona has been characterized not so much by his policies but by his political style\nI think what we're seeing now in what these attacks in some ways are under scoring is the degree to which this mid term could be viewed as a referendum on his style of leaders\nYup and you know the tone that he's brought us politics\nAnd the ... the president has a we've seen on the many of these rallies but he's a headline a talked about how she's on the ballot but at the same time no you're not hearing quite as much or in the home stretch about uh the so called red wave you talked about\nThe possibility of a red wave no we're not drink that much lately\nThat is true he's not talked about the red wave in public since August and so here we are you know almost November and um it it seems as though the lack of mentioning that might be indicative of sort of a growing belief and comes to mind that that's not actually going to happen\nSo does that mean that we're seeing less enthusiasm from the president's base at this point\nI don't know if that's necessarily true I think I went there is some arguments that could be made and some polling suggests that things like the Kavanaugh hearings actually did some did some uh good for the Republican base in terms of getting them up\nAnd this was always going to be an election where the perception going in with that Democrats were going to have a a vast enthusiasm edge over Republicans and I think what we're seeing now is some of that or do the as ... as having been eroded but you know Democrats are I'm Sorry Republicans were starting from a really steep deficit in that regard\nNo one thing we're not seeing though is it really a tamped down of a lot of the rhetoric even a down ballot the from from a lot of these candidates ah it it seems like both sides are really getting dug in your even despite the you know some of the external factors we've said\nDefinitely you know I think if he's in look even you know race by race to Florida governor's race is a good example obviously that's one that's not going to have very uncontrolled Congress but I think it's indicative of kind of the tone and where things are going in the country that race has gotten very very very um\nSort of a very vitriolic in terms of how it's being conducted in so I think that you know that's just one example of a down ballot race that's a you know kind of\nA existing in the Trump era as being very very um harsh rhetoric\nSo it was a ... days left now ah and the obviously the outcome in doubt but you know we're not going to do until a week from tomorrow or what could we see in terms of policy changes depending on the uh the results\nWell one thing you know Republicans have been talking a lot warning a lot about you know how democratic control a democratic wave that would be the control of the U.S house would lead to you know for two years of non stop congressional investigations and subpoenas of Trump Administration officials\nUm et cetera I think what Democrats are trying to do is sort of tamp down that concern by talking about policy issues and what they really zero zero in on is at the idea of an infrastructure plan that something that Trump talked about himself as a potential area early in his administration\nWhere he saw the potential for cooperation with Democrats um in terms of building roads and bridges that sort of thing and so now I think that's it's not coincidental that we're seeing Nancy Pelosi and other House Democrats\nTalk about wanting to focus on that if they do when a house majority because I think they don't want to be seen politically it's coming out of the gate really gunning for Trump\nInteresting to think about whether we could see some of my points of agreement on both sides are\nAfter the

difficult it can be for delivery companies to detect dangerous items before they reached their destination all the packages containing the devices so far have been identified as suspicious\nIntercepted by law enforcement authorities before they were delivered to their intended targets which include former President Obama no one has been harmed here's Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today maybe it helps opposite to screen\nUltimately a lot of these pictures aren't screened at all or when there's just so many packages and throughout the U.S that it's very difficult for them to actually you know apply X ray scanners for example to see what's inside every single one\nIs it just uh the volume I think there's you said there's something like thirty four million packages a day they're delivered\n[laughter] yeah and that's only UPS and FedEx doesn't even count the U. S. P. S. so all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages going through these facilities every day that's the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to\nPut a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if you're talking about tens of millions of packages [noise] um\nYou know that this is an order of magnitude that we simply can't handle when ah you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat up a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious\nThis thinking about is is that they're just a dropping this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed regularly wind up on some sort of security camera that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening in I think that sort of the the the way that the terrorists often tend to do things according to the experts in show [noise] you know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for\nAre the you know basically a package it has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know a sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing [noise] um but you\nKnow the good news is any packaged it's put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened it's suddenly all the time if the the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming he's got a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seemed like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that the technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak [noise] um and that's a good thing or you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up in these facilities as we speak but UPS\nAnd FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now the you know consider that to be the security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that had been bike so far to the the mail through the post ... postal service and so um you know the postal service has investigators who have deployed to try to ascertain exactly how to use\nThat just got through um but the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult\nAnd especially if they ever went through a screener to begin with um then you know it's just the volume is just so significant that it's tough to stop it and that's why ultimately [noise] um you know the last and last line of defense or those you know the people in the
