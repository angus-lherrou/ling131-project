President Trump's son in two bills today related to drug prices before he heads to Pennsylvania for a rally tonight\nSet of Commerce Committee holds a hearing today on consumer data privacy and the new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nGot through his first day of arguments with for questioning even a few jokes after is tough confirmation also making news of course the sudden departure of US ambassador to the United nations Nikki Haley and the jockeying already beginning over whom to replace her Bloomberg Washington reporter Kathleen hunter\nJoins us now a lot of folks in ah Bloomberg's D.C bureau we're a somewhat blindsided by the Haley announcement how biggest surprise was this\nWell I think she's someone that really hasn't made a lot of headlines in terms of controversy each as a part of the Trump Administration and someone that by all accounts you know have gotten along pretty well with Trump so I think it did take a lotta people myself included by surprise when we saw that she was going to resign yesterday I\nKnow a President Trump says he's got to be four or five people he's thinking of a to succeed Haley including his former deputy national security advisor Dina Powell who courses are now a Goldman Sachs so what would you bring to the role\n[noise] well I think as a former member of comes on administration and also a member of the Bush administration she brings some experience on you know in terms of Washington experience to the rule which I think would be potentially helpful also her having worked in the private sector for Goldman and to stand sustain your second one\nUm I think that could be an advantage as well I'm also there was some talk yesterday about you know highly being a\nA a woman a prominent woman and Trump's administration's having her place with another woman I think would be um you know ... that would be notable and it's you know itself\nUm so I think you know we know that Trump Blake's people who are loyal he likes people that he feels like are known quantities be seen him several times replace people with people he's worked within the past so I wouldn't be surprised if he went that route but it sounds like he's trying to keep his options open for now\nWhat other options could you be looking at\n[laughter] well his daughter Yvonne guys taking herself out of the running she was mad and as a potential um replacement and he actually seem to briefly entertained the day yesterday saying that he thought she was\nPerhaps the most competent person or I couldn't think of a more confident person for the job but that you know people would accuse myth nepotism they basically said I Would like to but I Can't and then she took herself out of the running\nSo she's the one that you know I think we'll continue to be talked about until the announcements made 'em there's also been some talk of the U.S ambassador to Germany or the Trump said yesterday that he's not under consideration 'cause he's you know basically Trump's happy with him and the work that he's doing in Germany now and so I think that\nYou know right now it looks like ... maybe the front runner but are certainly the person whose name as being most discussed\nAll right let's discuss another issue on the foreign policy front the president talking about a possible second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong on but not until after the midterm elections I guess he's saying that he's too busy campaigning\nYeah he's basically saying it's kind of interesting to see sort of read between the lines it sounds like kind of what he's saying is you know I'm such a big asset here to Republicans but I Can't possibly be ... and the final weeks of this campaign\nAnd in truth he is doing a lot of campaigning he was expected they set an August to spend upwards of forty days on the road campaigning for Republican candidates heading into the midterms and so we've seen him doing that you know he has been all over the country and swing states and we're likely to see that continue and the next four weeks and you know um I also think however when it comes to North Korea\nThat you know may provide kind of a convenient\nExplanation or excuse along with his is his pretty pack travel schedule as to why uh they're not scheduling this this next summit um you know when that's all kind of happening against the backdrop of what appears to be not a whole lot of progress between the U.S in our three on the nuclear ... issue\nYeah and the ... despite that the apparent lack of progress the president at those rallies or one of the talking points now is his good relationship with Kim Jong on or how does that play as we head closer to November six\nAbsolutely I expect him to continue talking about that I feel like he can point to share interesting I feel like North Korea and Russia are so like the two countries that he can point to as or that he has been pointing to as you know areas countries where he is improved relations you know meanwhile a lot of the traditional us allies and the e Canada\nEt cetera the U.S has been picking fights with you know obviously there's a trade war with China\nUm so I think that's really what we're seeing here is Trump I keep in mind that Trump's someone that\nImmediately after his summit with Kim declared that North Korea was no longer a nuclear power which wasn't really or nuclear threat which wasn't accurate at all and hasn't turned out to be accurate so I think Trump is you know basically spiking the ball and the end zone but you know trying to hold that nobody notices the ball ... fifty yard line\nYeah and the president has moved forward on the field or to keep a metaphor going is going to be in Pennsylvania tonight interesting as we're seeing the Republican Party pulled back in a couple of key districts there and in other states\nYeah this is something that we typically see towards the end of the campaign particularly with the party that is maybe I'm On defense or that it's spreading the stand and in that case in this case that's Republicans you know there's upwards of\nSeventy Republican House districts that are in play this cycle in an hour and that uh that field has been expanding and rather than contracting which is you know not a good sign for Republicans and so I think what we're seeing now is Republican basically strategically trying to focus what resources they do have in the time they have left\nOn races that think that they are they really think they can win and essentially cut their losses on races that might not be ... for them um and you know this is makes the makes it you know in some ways is this is a sign that they see that Democrats than a democratic surges really possible\nBloomberg Washington

the people and stories that matter to you you're listening to America's first knew this morning with Gordon Deal\nWith us we'll come into Wednesday there are competing advertisements\nRepresenting an effort to grab the attention of the world's most powerful TV viewer President Trump there's also a belief by Washington's influence industry that Mr Trump can be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker which Julie what's up\nIt's no secret that the president is an avid watcher of Fox News and particular and we know that because he is frequently tweeting in real time as he watches the ticket literally found can friend in the morning and then also um\nDuring Hannity in the evening ... them over at the Fox business channel until the general public notice this until have lobbyists and tea [laughter] and lobbyist had\nFound that in fact his way to get a message in front of the president is to advertise during his favorite TV program [laughter] that's what we're seeing happen more and more\nWild like ... like for example who's airing what\nWe took a look at the story now because there is a big fight that's been going on over there now and so groups that are\nSavoring [laughter] you know President Trump increasing the mix of ethanol in gasoline has been um advertising a lot lately during Fox News programs and then groups and also oppose that are sort of counter messaging to him during the same program\nIs you know to be influenced by them\nWhat we can see that he can gauge sometimes directly after an ad\nThat popped up on TALK on this happened when a group of a steel workers it's advertising during boxing fan in March you know out there and I came up\nThe president started talking about the issue suggesting that he had seen the ad um and then sort of on the other side here if you remember last\nYear billionaire Tom tire who constantly and fight with the president and started and and teach me too movement I'm kind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noted that and tweeted about it right away\nSpeak with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces called interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you went to do the ad revenue for these programs that Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and to not only is the president watching but the the program some towns have really strong viewership um during this administration the viewership has written and and so have the ad rates and we've actually seen some ... from\nYou know notice that not only is the president watching these shows that people who are highly supportive of the ... and are also watching and to the thinking is not only to reach the audience of wind that perhaps you know out in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads\nAnd maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that a strategist also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president um express dislike for programs on on those two channels and there's there's no debate that at least they're monitoring how those channels are talking about him and so the thinking there is that\nPeople who are influential with the president made the types of advertising and and death flag it to him\nThat ah that that sounds I guess along the lines of what ah the guy Kevin Mac from that group need to impeach how he feels like ... you just suspect that the president's watching and knows he can talk and it was like a little elbow and the ribs kind of add\n... exactly um and then also sort of interesting here is the president has been

them Mitt nineteenth century so what we're seeing today is truly an unprecedented event\nWas it a surprise that a jump to a category for\nOil or you know I'd have to admit uh looking at this last week we were expecting at least a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico but uh you know I I have to be honest I was not expecting a category for landfall [noise]\nUm you know it's just basically been such a theory or go to Mexico water temperatures get just some some optimal wins a law that allows the such rapid rise emotionally I Will the hurricane and it's just take it off in the Gulf of Mexico far beyond what I expected it\nWell so was landfall time would be roughly what middle middle of the afternoon\nIt looks like already looks like the eye of a of Michael should make landfall in the early afternoon hours somewhere between Panama City beach in Appalachia cola Florida\nAnd you can kind of think of this is kind of a somewhat larger version of hurricane Charlie if you remember fourteen years ago were truly a rambling on saw through a southwest in central Florida as a category four\nSo unfortunately the uh this is going to try a massive storm surge possibly nine to Thirteen feet above ground level\nI mean can you imagine night the thirteenth even no water outside your front door a so you know really if anybody's still along the Florida a Gulf Coast they only of hours left to get away if they if they in order to any that evacuation\nGoodness wish we could live this morning with Weather Channel senior digital meteorologist Jonathan burden via or other worthy comparisons to Florence which struck the Carolinas last month\n[laughter] well you know it's interesting because actually this is probably do is you know we get to Florence and one of the big differences of course the intensity or looking at a category for landfall as opposed to foreign spinning down to a category one\nAt a record ... slow crawl through after line is when that produce the you know the feet of rain and the uh the flooding that occurred for weeks out or or what we're seeing what Michael is again it's much more intense\nAnd it's going to accelerate fairly rapidly through\nA show where the central Georgia and an end of the Carolinas a Thursday on Thursday night and really by this time friday morning it'll be off the east coast than it out of the way so it's moving but the good news is moving quickly but again it's a ferocious Lee intense storm unfortunately for the Gulf Coast\nWho seems so a bizarre the kind of the historical perspective you gave before about this type of storm not hitting the Florida Panhandle in so long or ever but I'd like listen I'm up in New Jersey so I think Gulf of Mexico I think hurricanes big storms ... why I guess not those area\nYou would think so I mean I I'm I'm looking right now at a map of all the historical category for hurricane tracks the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd you know there there's been a number of them that have hit the Alabama Gulf Coast the Mississippi Gulf Coast but Louisiana and Texas and South Florida but there's just this strange gap a from a north of Tampa through say Appalachian coal and Panama City", "show_name": "This Morning
