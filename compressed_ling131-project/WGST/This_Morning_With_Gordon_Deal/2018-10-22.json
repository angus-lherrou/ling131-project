Trump's fellow Republicans aren't buying the official explanation New York Congressman Peter king on the same program called the attack Savage an evil\nThere's no way that one person but it's getting overweight civilian has to be killed where he is facing up to twelve or Fifteen professionals they could have brought him down and matter of seconds without causing any physical harm at all so

coming from modern Sally said we have another in case we will never engaged to this is an operation this is a mistake this is what I found that Republican\nRand Paul sits on the Senate Foreign

noon ABC's This week at one PM and\nThe nation from CBS at two o'clock Sundays on Bloomberg Radio what to talk more about what's going to be driving the week in the nation's capital Bloomberg Washington reporter Kathleen hunter joins us now and ... we heard this a wholesale rejection seemingly in Congress of the Saudi explanation about to show you stuff even President Trump is now saying\nA in a Washington Post interview that there has been deception there's been lies is there still a rift between the president and his fellow Republicans on this\nAbsolutely there is um I mean I think that the president asked showed some movement a bet where you know he did talk about as you point out the deception and the lives that he's he's coming from Saudi Arabia however\nUh you know he's still not going as far as a lot of members of Congress from both sides of the aisle are notably several you know significant Republicans like Rand Paul Monday Graham in calling either for sanctions or for cutting off arms sales the president has not gone that far\nAnd so I think that you know while there's been a bit of movement in the direction of condemning Saudi Arabia he's still sort of withholding judgment and that still signifies a pretty significant rest with members of his own party\nThere's this ongoing geopolitical dispute resonating with voters now just Fifteen Fifteen days away from the mid term elections\nI mean I think that [noise]\nIt's hard to tell a bit but I think that you know obviously there are other issues that I think would resonate more but I think particularly for Democrats this could be yet another thing that might motivate them to come to the polls because I think there's a lot of outrage I'm On the Democratic side um in terms of Trump's handling of this\nAnd so I think that that um could translate into you know even more enthusiasm from democratic voters by you know that the cabin that being that you know\nA lot of these voters are already pretty motivated to begin with\nYour point no issue or certainly that the president is keeping a focus on the head of the midterms is this a migrant caravans are now headed toward Mexico from Central America in the past the president has seen a immigration is a winning issue for him in his campaigns what about for the midterms in congressional races\nIsn't it something that could turn out to be a real mess calculation on the on Trump's part I'm particularly because\nHis policy of separating children from their parents was widely unpopular even among independents and some Republicans some more moderate Republicans\nI so I think that his decision to kind of bring up immigration again it's close to the elections on even know what he's focusing on is this this caravan issue which does resonate strongly with his base I think also serves to remind folks of\nHis policy of of at the border separation from over the summer which you know again was deeply unpopular so this is something that\nParticularly in districts that could end up designing control the house a lot of those districts we know our Republican controlled now but in suburban areas so they might be more moderate and we would be considered kind of swing districts I think that this could end up potentially backfire and\nThen our last ... seconds here just a few seconds President Trump talking about a mid term tax cuts\nWell yeah this is in most interesting part of this is that this tax cut that he brought up which I think signifies that he wants to talk about the economy uh apparently was news to members of Congress would actually be writing such a bell so it sounds like we're not likely to see that any time soon\nBut Doug ... we can be single watch more perhaps as we\nHead closer to November

considered the favorites to win back control of the house many of the races\nNow tightening or districts where President Trump won modest Leon twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot at a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain this\nWhat I was looking at in particular were races that were kind of ignored at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive but in the last sort of final\nStretch here have become closer than than people expect that they would and were seen that in particular in a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge him out so maybe forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent so districts you know that he comfortably carried but where there is more room for a Democrat to pick up votes if people have become dissatisfied with the president can\nStart to one of them was like in a in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's very interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and there is a third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people and becoming very competitive\nAnd in that state district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera butler [noise] um she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and as sort of cruise to victory\nIn recent years but this year has a significant challenger has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered more votes than congressman\nOr a butler and Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as did the highest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor\nSo it's an unusual waste there in that um this hasn't been considered you know one of the sweetest districts but Carolyn lungs campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points [noise] um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight great well\nAll right how about the Long Island New York with the the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYeah it was probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger democratic female opponent and this is the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of energy and enthusiasm for voters especially female voters um our pool and other polls have\nShown a gender gap and and it reveals that women are\nShow more of a preference for a democratic controlled house\nAnd are also more energized to vote this year so you know it's a truism of terms that it comes down to turn out but if that is indeed the case it looks like a women are more poised to turn out and that could help some of these female challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blowout for hidden there you ought to\nSpeak with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house races tighten as mid term elections near or to down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman rub what'll\nYes this is an interesting way to connect with all its definitely being outraged by Carolyn a boy do who is also a professor she's at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been one of them are like classics suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while one of the factors that could be at play here is that Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down on the ticket and that\nUm are do could benefit from that\nAnd so and as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um [noise] there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and uh so do you know they can see it can feel they have a better shot rather than an seating a democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them it's actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hardy [noise] uh and then the second to the to Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and had a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada [laughter]\nUm this is a little bit [laughter]\nProbably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a

female Democratic House candidates are under forty\nA sort of them are women of color hundreds more are running for state legislature Wall Street journal national political reporter Janet Hook says the diverse crop of young candidates marks a departure\nFrom an older generation of women with ambition\nWho tend to to postpone political careers until their families were established Janet what's up here\nBut you know there's been a lot of attention paid during this election cycle to the record number of women overall they're running for\nOffice but within that um there's this really interesting trend of there being more younger women running I'm sort of under forty women in their twenties or thirties um and it's interesting to me because there's been a kind of a career pattern\nFor women in politics I'm In the past\nIt's much like like the clear pattern in in in other um line of work where women would tend to wait until their children are grown before they take the plunge into politics and the classic case of this with Nancy Pelosi\nWho had five kids didn't run for office until the I'm the youngest one was sixteen\nI'm and she was forty seven by the end by the time she started her political career\nUm and I think what we've seen in twenty Eighteen wave and women running scientists that women are also are a little bit less willing to wait that there's a sense of urgency typically among democratic women who are running there's a sense of urgency\nAbout running to it you know we need to be part of the movement to also part of a broader idea that women can start their careers and their families at the same time\nYeah so what ... what happens if a um I don't know what ... what we might consider a significant number of them when I look at what kind of message I guess gets sent\n[noise] well I mean it's been broadly among Democrats a real clamoring for kind of generational change I mean there have been a lot of complaints that the leadership in Congress being all
