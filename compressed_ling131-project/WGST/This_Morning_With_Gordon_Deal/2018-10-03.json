{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Bloomberg for your inbox is filling up on Tom Kean emails right now John\nDo you not your jump jump you're kidding me in trouble about ten minutes is how do\nYou ever get back on track here live ... interactive brokers studio joined by John pharaoh good morning John it is now six fifty on Wall street time to check on what's going on\nIn the the among the top stories in our nation's capital as we've been talking about New York state opening a probe into the New York times report on potential tax fraud by the Trump family Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's accuser saying the FBI investigation into the nominee is in broad enough\nAnd deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein plans to meet with two house committees a week from tomorrow on reports that he talked about secretly recording President Trump more now on the New York times report and more from the president his father and their taxes we're joined now by Bloomberg Washington reporter\nKathleen hunter a cage was a very thorough expos they buy the times into how the president's father supported him through the years with potentially illegal tax moves now in New York tax authorities are investigating how big an issue could this be\nWell I think it's it's to put it lightly it's it's one more thing in the list of things that are both a distraction and a liability for Trump\nAnd potentially Republicans who are in his party heading into you know the mid term elections which are just now barely a month out so I think it's you know it remains to be seen what more will come of it particularly in the next month or so but just having this out there I think I again kind of just goes to under cut\n... credibility and get one more reason for his detractors to criticize him from a political standpoint\nYeah the White House there's apparently a making that point in the statement it put out about the New York times report essentially saying the paper should focus more on the growing economy\nAnd the successes of the administration and less on reporting negative stories about the president at the same time that the White House reaction wasn't exactly shooting down the reporting calling it falls\nYeah I mean we have it is kind of standard compliant ah you know to sort of\nBlame the media and accused the media sort of either explicitly or implicitly as a as actually being biased against the administration and focusing overly on the negative I mean I think it's obvious at this point\nThat if Trump and his brother is known to talk about anything except for\nThe fact that the economy's growing and not is silly in his mind due to his policies\nUm but I think that you know you make an excellent point when you point out that they're not really directly denying it however at the same time other ones you know Trump a personal lawyer that did come out and and called story you know say that the accusations that are raised in this story are false\nSo I think they're kind of a you know White Houses responding from a different perspective I think a little bit then you know Trump's personal lawyer\nYeah really saying that the uh uh the tax issues had been looked at in litigated years ago a let's look into the other major investigation going on of course the FBI looking into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's pass\nAnd his accusers are now raising concern that that investigation isn't going far enough even as the FBI or is the you know I'm facing a deadline to wrap up this investigation\nYeah I mean it's striking to me to hear that on the attorneys for ... before and he testified last week\nOn say that she's not in contact to get the FBI um I think that that um you know would be significant given that everyone I think at least my understanding I think a lot of others understanding of the of the pro but that it was supposed to be looking into\nWhether or not there was a potential to walk to corroborate some of the claims that she made our you know provide additional information on the claims that she made her Senate testimony\nSo I think that's certainly giving people ... um I mean we're getting ever closer to the friday deadline and Mitch McConnell shows no signs of wanting to postpone the boat in fact he's seen the proceeding full steam ahead I think everyone's waiting to see what if anything that comes up with but I think that you know some of these questions that are being raised I'm\nCertainly laying the groundwork for democratic criticism at the FBI probes saying that wasn't enough\nAnd is this FBI investigation goes on President Trump is really now openly mocking that first accuser Christine Blasey Ford and what she had to say and her testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee ... here's the president at a rally in Mississippi last night\nI had one well do you think it was it was one of ...\nHow did he get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't\nKnow it was just a few days ago that President Trump was you know really holding his fire now it seems\nThe gloves are off absolutely it does and I think that you know on two things here I think one is that it's\nA it's an indication potentially that the president is it wavering on his support for cat and I think there was some speculation earlier in the week when the president was you know it's sounding more measured on his support of whether or not a Trump might be considering dumping am um I think this cuts against that a speculation\nObviously and I think also um it shows the degree to which Trump still is not scared of this issue and Republicans aren't scared of this issue when it comes to their base but as you heard in the sound you just played you know there he was greeted with\nHis impression his mocking and ridiculing of this accuser Christine Blasey Ford was met with the you know rousing cheers in support of his campaign style rally so I think that what we're seeing it on both sides on in terms of Democrats and Republicans the views on this issue are hardening\nAnd um I think Republicans are aware of that and when it comes to their base which is going to be important in this midterm election on that may you know embolden them to stick with Kavanaugh\nEnd up putting it is in the broader context of the overall me too movement what did you make of the president saying that this is now a very scary time in America for men\n[noise] well I think that the president is perhaps\nA re interpreting the me too movement and that this is I'm kind of ... me too in a way to point oh and not now what we're seeing as this very strong reaction from certain men um you know who are worried about I think an overreach of the me too movement and what that could mean for\nA for you know men in general um and I think that the president\nIs a very clearly focused on that aspect and you know certainly that's where his concerns lie and he's made that very clear\nBloomberg Washington reporter Kathleen hunter thanks for clarifying all this for us always appreciate your insight and you can read more about all

among the four hundred and fourteen companies that have remained in the U.S it'd be five hundred since twenty Fifteen increasing numbers or either prohibiting or fully disclosing direct contributions to candidates\nAnd contributions for election related used to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofits more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tail what are we seeing here\nWell you know there's a lot of a concern in some quarters consternation about the idea that companies are you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling out a lot more freedom to swoop in and get involved in electoral politics I've always had lobbied I've always found a lot of money in Washington and in state capitals but the idea was that they would start spending\nMoney and in large quantities and ... and certainly there is some corporate Goldman election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is what this shows though is that some big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd then when when you talk about interfering in elections with money talking about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWell so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support candidates in other ways such as an independent expenditures they can support political parties they can support organization that then go on to support candidates such AS Party a democratic Republican a government as a tax cut that basically support a gang\nGovernors one party or the other or are there similar groups for attorney general and state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them to support candidates but again ah what was seen as a little ripped showed of a company as large companies are saying we don't want to use money number one or more of these areas\nWell we're speaking with tail Francis Wall Street journal business reporter he's written a piece titled companies curb their political spending what is the phrase up backsliding that you wrote about\nHer decision that produced

five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclose a in a\nCow and where and when they spend on and in some cases how much they spent on these different electorate activities and they also call out companies that\nHave gotten more so for example they used that published a report on the political activity and now they don't or their reports or less a informative than they used to be a fewer companies now in part because of new companies joining they asked me five hundred index pure companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their uh to display their political stranded reports that something I expect you'll see change as those companies stay in the index it turns out that larger companies and come up and then the index longer\nTend to do better at disclosing how when where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies referenced a Lowe's and they're the big home improvement chain date a misdemeanor do they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a being less for coming in the in the center for political accountability is eyes in how they disclose what their restrictions are on a on political spending in talking to me they said their position that and changed they still\nDon't contribute to political campaigns are candidates they don't contribute to nonprofit groups like Fargo and four and five twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language that Adam ... versions of their annual political spending report um other companies by the way there's about ten companies\nThat say they don't do any of that say don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or and they tell their trade associations not to use the funds for a a lecture activities\nSo that show very small number but it is a number that's been growing year after year\nWhen I was gonna say so is that does

[noise]\nHow about a ebbs and flows as I don't know particular issues come to the forefront in any given week does that is that happening\nNot really I mean we've seen for example recent polling in North Dakota which shows the Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble that's not surprising it's North Dakota's very red state\nUh there's been some indication or or or I should say some some\nAh we're we're cool arguing that a high camp is suffering from support for cap and all that ... that she wasn't immediately on board with a supporting Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nHas been pointed to as a reason that she's a falling behind their state but the Democrats have consistently had trouble in any way so I'm not sure that's really the case the main thing that we're seeing is partisanship\nThat in states where there are a or wherever you're Twenty one for example the Democrats and you will in states that Donald Trump won\nA Wii Remote offended well there are some outliers like West Virginia where Joe Manchin still maintains a lead despite the fact that he's a Democrat in a very red state but as a general rule no it doesn't seem to be swayed by ships\nWere speaking with Philip bump national correspondent at the Washington Post she's written a piece in Delaware the fight for the Senate stands right now um how much could things change over the course of the next month there was starting to get really locked in here\nTo some extent I mean we were starting to see where races are starting to separate to some extent and what that means is that parties will then stop putting money in those races which means that those races will become even more soundly whatever color they were training in the first place I guess where you can see some of that\nReally this is going to come down to a handful maybe five Senate seats on election night which will determine control the Senate I think the house pretty likely to to go to the Democrats at this point in time the Senate continues to be a big question mark\n... what were those that did you ... five thirty eight crunch the numbers than they about are the odds of one party cleaning the house in the Senate\nThey did yeah and so those numbers change a lot depending on what polls they get in [laughter] but essentially it is the Republicans are about a woman by chance of holding the house the Democrats have about a one in five chance of taking center\nOkay so you were to it like this some of the gubernatorial races correct any any notable similarities\nWhat's remarkable about the gubernatorial races is that if you look for example the Senate back and look at the state of pulling there there's a lot of sort of we areas where the Democrat and Republican or wanting sort of even [noise]\nIf you look at that map though there are a lot of states where there is an incumbent\nRepublican governor who is usually going to win reelection right so you look at a state like a Maryland or Larry Hogan is very popular looks like he's not going to have too much trouble running for re election even though it's a blue state\nAnd there are a lot of reasons for this one of course is the fact that the Democrats have enough map on the side to you're going to see 'em a fewer ... great voices they're simply because there aren't a lot of\nYou know strong popular Republicans are up for re election but another too is that there's obviously a big difference between state and federal and so people in Maryland is like Donald Trump but like the job Larry Hogan is doing and in another a Republican governors that represent blue states\nActually came out and said hey let's let's put the brakes on his cabinet nomination which is a sort of thing that you can do as a governor you can't do the Republican Senate\nLike Philip Philip bump at the Washington Post [noise]\nFor some of the program as ... by our friends at Harry's up in a Harry's\nUser for years now my favorite part is this leak candle him to close comfortable shade you get each time my son who's a teenager now uses Harry's my father's a user that's three generations of my family\nFor a limited time only new customers can save big on a Harry's shapes that with the code deal at Harry's dot com get a five bleed razor waited handle shaved Jill and trouble cover for just three bucks oh and free shipping\nHarry's bought a world class blade factory in Germany where they grind steel into sharp durable blades and they stand behind the quality of their products to if you don't love your shave let them know they'll give you a full refund\nFor a limited time only Harry says a special offer for listeners of our program new customers get five dollars off a starter said from Harry's\nWith the code deal at ... dot com that's H.
