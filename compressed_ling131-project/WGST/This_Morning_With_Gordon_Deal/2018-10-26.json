quarter GDP first read on that comes out of the thirty Wall Street time also making news this morning reports that President Trump is considering an executive order to bar migrants at the U.S Mexican border for more on this Bloomberg Washington reporter caffeine hunter joins us in Cape from what our sources\nUs the sounds are quite a lot like the travel ban from the beginning of the Trump presidency\n[noise] it does and will recall that that travel ban actually targeted predominantly ... majority Muslim countries and so on and that's it you know limiting or ending migration from Muslim country that was something\nThat Trump talked about during his presidential campaign but I think it's interesting that now here we are you know eleven days out from the mid term than Trump is once again apparently talking about are considering\nUm you know having a bad and that's based on a similar model\nYeah it sounds a lot like a joining up the base to a great extent here but could the president be of opening himself up to the same sort of legal scrutiny that the travel ban received if this is a serious move on the president's part\nAbsolutely um I mean I think that in some regards you know the president and his staff of probably learned from their experience and the first travel ban which I don't get a lot of legal difficulty and eventually had to be a fancy rewritten [noise] um and so I Would imagine they would do you know\nTake that into consideration of crap this latest travel ban but I'm starting to this to what probably draw legal legal challenges pretty quickly\nI was just affect a Republicans politically because we know how difficult this issue has been for Republicans on Capitol Hill just to craft some kind of immigration reform\nYeah there have been a whole lot of appetite in recent years um to do that I think that you know the most serious recent effort within twenty Thirteen when the Senate which was controlled by Democrats or the time\nPassing comprehensive immigration overhaul bill and that legislation as as we all recall it didn't go anywhere in the in the house which was their outlook and controlled at the time and you know since Republicans took control both chambers of Congress and now the White House there hasn't been a whole lot of\nUm appetite for moving on broad based immigration reform and we've seen more it's kind of these right for this rifle shot approach that's been focused on really cracking down on immigration at the border which as you point out\nIs an issue that rather than a it's a with the Republican base and I think you know at a time when Republicans are particularly concerned about making sure that they don't lose out on um the enthusiasm\nIn this midterm election two Democrats were pretty motivated to move the guy I get out to move 'em on something I you know to try to beat back again to come campaign it seems as though that this could be a winning strategy they're hoping now\nLet's move on to something else it's been a driving a lot of partisan rancor these mail bombs that have been aimed to address to a presidential critic says the investigation goes on now I guess we have some evidence that to some extent it's keeping the president up at night\nYeah the president treated at that free fourteen am this morning eastern time I'm about uh you know is a launching basically his latest attack at CNN which you know he loves to call a fake news and you know I'm I think that while the content of his treat but not particularly\nNew in the in the sense that he's long criticized CNN and you know media outlets and what's interesting about this or that I think he is drawing the strongest connections that\nFar to kind of blaming the media for its coverage of this recent string of bombing attack and against his political rivals and also more significantly even just the timing of the ... to ... to see the president tweeting it he's early morning reader but not quite that early\nUsually a lot of people in Washington have gotten used to be ah six am tweets from President Trump I mean there are a little bit to the significance of the fact that uh yeah well before the sun comes up President Trump is on a sweater\nYeah I made me think you know there was a very famous\nCampaign ad in two thousand eight that I'm gonna do a better Clinton's campaign actually ran against the Obama campaign was called the three I'm all add and basically they just did\nIt was you know who who do you want in the White House answering the call about a crisis at three in the morning it made me think of that you know and here we are at a time years later you know ten years after that we're here and we have the president tweeting and south at three in the morning\nAnd say he's putting

such\nYou know if they say he's on vacation or she's on vacation then you know there may not be anything to worry about but if they come in and they say air aside for that I gotta go gotta go gotta go

pay how could that work we're joined now by step Simpson president and founder of GDP advisors ... is this possible with the president plans to do\nGood morning you know it's actually possible for the president can control certain things so specifically to ha just outlined\nTargets Medicare's reimbursements a specific drugs that are administered in physicians' offices and so the Medicare system itself\nCures roughly forty percent of drugs in the United states actually it is the consumer of these drugs and therefore it's under a mandate or how it's going to pay for these trucks so I guess has the power to go back and say this is Medicare is going to pay for these drugs this is how it's going to work\nAnd doctors are prescribing and and and the ministry and these drugs are only going to get paid to some\nFocus so then the pharmaceutical companies if I can try to guess what they'll say is well that's fine we now will no longer have enough money to do research and develop new life saving drugs\nThat's the argument that they're already making on the heels of his announcement is that this will die in their ability to reinvest or even make minimum bottom line requirements\nOf their cost and this is a great step in the right direction I think upset for a long time\nThat the federal government being the largest consumer needs to act more like a consumer uh and and how they're paying for drugs and Trump said yesterday is absolutely right in the U.S pays in some cases twice as much as other foreign countries\nThe challenge here though is that it's it's what the us pays that helps subsidize the other countries at the end of the day this is still a profit margin issue for you\nManufacturers right All right so is that approach than anti free market or no because we're describing the federal government as a consumer\n[noise] yeah I I don't think it's anti free market for that latter part because the federal government in this case is a prince ... as a consumer the government is not shutting here the government is just saying what they pay for these drugs\nAnd show in in this we've got to remember this is specific to doctor administered drug blood pressure medication or standard over the counter type stuff [noise] this is specific to drugs specific to like cancer multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis\nSo these are high cost drugs already and the government's saying we're not going to pay as much doubt this is also a problem because it's the way the Medicare system works and this is specifically what this is targeting\nMedicare part B is actually the piece of Medicare that reimbursed his dish and it pays doctors a commission for ministry ... through the traditional Medicare part D system which is a prescription drug plan\nTo get out of the weeds here

president and co founder of GDP advisors were talking about President Trump's attempt to lower the cost of Medicare drug or why are the costs of drugs so high by the way what are the basics here\nA couple of key things one is and it's just absolutely pointed out in a real problem is that the U.S government as well as the U.S consumers subsidize the rest of the when it comes to\nThe challenges you have and this is a multi layered complex situation is that it takes roughly on average two billion dollars to bring a new drug market and that is largely based on FDA requirement upbringing that drug now\nTo in order to offset the cost and recoup the cost to do that the U.S patent all also gives factors a twenty year pat and\nThose manufacturers are really good about tweaking the drug at the end of that Twenty years later they keep it for a little bit longer so this is a complex issue and we really weren't caught this is a great first step but we also must reduce the regulatory requirements are bringing trucks to market soften that\nAllow foreign testing uh in in certain countries to be allowed in the U.S to reduce that cost so you can have more competition and let the free
