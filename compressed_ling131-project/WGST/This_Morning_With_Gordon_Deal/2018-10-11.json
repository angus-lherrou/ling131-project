{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "All right thank you Michael six fifty on Wall street Joe ... joins us now he's the head of the Americas news desk for Bloomberg and Joe nice to have you on Bloomberg day break I mean I guess you could sort of put the reasons for this global market sell off on a dart board I mean a where where's your dark headed\nI I I think that's really the key thing is that there's no obvious story or catalysts\nI think the simplest way to say it and I hate to do this is the people enjoyed of the long run gains and sometimes the herd can be fickle and the best way to demonstrate that is to look at what's losing the most and then the U.S it was over the last few days\nThe stocks that had been doing the best throughout the year a lot of these hedge fund favored stocks whether it's your ah shop of ... or Amazon or whatever it is have been hit the hardest\nAnd the areas of the market that have been a the weakest so far this year which is some of your utilities bond proxies safety stocks they have done well\nAnd that's just what markets are I mean they're sometimes they're based on fundamentals and of course the ... tell us about stories like rising interest rates are trained or whatever but a big component of what makes the market move from day to day just going to be a the whims of the crowd\nMm So you think this might just be as simple as the bulls running out of room to run\nIt could be and you know I'm not saying that that's a permanent thing or that they don't have more room to run in general but one thing that I think is a worth noting is look at currency is today and you see who the some of the best performing currencies are\nTurkish lira at one point six percent South African Rand\nA point nine percent a Mexican peso Russian ruble if this for like a general global panic that we're continuing that were about some sort of fundamental change\nIs hard to imagine why people would be buying the Turkish lira or the south African Rand you'd think people would be selling that\nAnd again it just sort of speaks to some sort of shift\nRotation people might look at that and say well maybe this has computers sort of re allocating or quantitative a rotation whatever it is and it could turn into a panic it could be bigger but right now like you said it's sort of a dark or the reasons\nYeah it is interesting though that you you bring up a emerging market currencies because the the the story line for so long the last couple of months that seems has been that the Turkish lira get hounded the south African Rand or having issues as well I mean it has has that the table sort of turned\n[noise] you know I don't want to I don't I I I Would feel a little bit too premature to call that but it really is interesting the degree to which we've stopped talking about turkey over the last month and a half and quietly and to market and its currency have been on a pretty nice\nA run so you might argue that in some of these extreme situations there really is um rebalancing going out and now there are certainly lots of risks oil prices hurting a vulnerable EMs that are a importers turkey is an importer of oil\nThe slowdown in China is really interesting and really important\nAnd that seems to be continuing brutal night for Chinese markets yesterday we saw the sell off in luxury goods companies that sell a lot to China so\nThat certainly are an important area to watch and that could have em spillover but on the other hand you have to wonder like okay at some point a lot of this is going to be priced in and you sort of think about where there are opportunities now\nTalking with Joe ... head of the Americas news desk at Bloomberg News ah yeah let's let's talk a little bit more about this uh plummet in Asia ... raises the or the specter of the trade war between the U.S and China I mean the markets had you know sort of looked at this here and there\nA is there a tension sort of deepening into this\nIt's not good um there's no evidence I don't think that there is a thaw between the U.S and China and I think um you know there were two ...\nShe'd make company announcements this week\nHave been really striking so of course we have the luxury goods makers Louis Vuitton having come out yesterday talking about China cracking down on imports are at the border\nAnd then also a number of industrial companies warning about uh the bite that Chinese tariffs are the tariffs on China are starting to have on their economy under a businesses fast and all yesterday was one\nReally been getting covered on these sort of like globally integrated industrial cyclical stocks cat or federal pillar had a really bad day earlier this week\nThe PG or paints company so some of these big macro things are really starting to bite and I think that might be getting people nervous ahead of her earnings season which is really going to kick off friday and starting next week what our company is going to be telling us about the terrorist situation and is it really starting to bite\nYeah and if ah this ah equity slide in Asia continues it raises the question about whether a China might try to ah\nIf ah if China might try to step in and uh uh do a little bit more of a ... I guess I don't want to say manipulation because that's the word that\nYou're right it's not supposed to be you know it's weird because everybody knows that China manages its currency that's not controversial uh there are limits on how far can move in a specific day so\nI don't know this word manipulation carries weight but of course if we the more the U.S imposes tariffs on China the more incentive China has to try to counteract that and one way I could do that as a further currency week as\nYou mentioned uh the the started burning season really getting rolling at the end of this week we're going to be looking for as we head toward that\nWell banks are going to be really interesting on friday because they might tell us you know we've had this curves deepening and in theory that's good for financial stocks so that it'll be interesting to see what they say about interest rates\nBut also a banks are just a great window into the general economy companies willingness to do deals take on debt so I think in light of the market turmoil especially\nThere'll be a lot of scrutiny on what the ... not just how the banks are doing but what they see overall\nAlright Joe ... head of the Americas news desk at Bloomberg News good to get your insights this morning as we continue to watch this a global market route Karen\n... is there a standing law says this morning after the NASDAQ one hundred index plunged more than four percent he asked her day for its worst day in seven years textile again they were hard hit with investors are rushing for access Netflix is among the biggest decline or chemical eight points\nFour percent shares are down another ... percent this morning squares separate at ten percent drop yesterday and as you down another eight point seven percent this morning after that companies said chief financial officer Sarah friar is leaving to become a CEO of next door dot com\nIt's another attack ... lower this morning apple down one point six percent snap is down about ... percent didn't Twitter down one point eight percent\nAnd taking a look at NASDAQ futures this morning they're down about forty six points right now it's in the future is down twenty and Dow futures down two hundred eleven\n[noise] straight ahead Bloomberg surveillance for Tom Kean and Jonathan feral and for Nathan hangar I'm Karen Moscow and and this\nTraffic on TALK radio six forty WG as the\nGotten wanting a border north on rapid ... down remains shut down after flooded out from the storm last like alter your ... in the right lane of water job I don't have prejudice labeled vehicles report earlier on ... north ridge on the right side along with the tree down which faces bury your ... drive and we had reports privatize\nMalfunctioning that highway till eleven by shuttle on right there at the end he bought interchange I twenty east bound remains shut down an interstate dirty bomb in the east side with an early morning ... that the investigation continues you're going to be taught at Columbia court that down there and talk Radio's exporting only G.

Mexico Beach Florida yesterday ranked as the strongest storm to hit that region since at least eight teen fifty one when recordkeeping began\nWorn out from Johnson urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel he's with us why It's MORNING on each other just how bad was Michael\n... morning Gordon yeah it's not every day that you see a category for making us landfall but uh you know a Michael was pretty impressive and that uh you know a lot of these hurricanes when they approach the U.S will tend to either holds or or the week and a little bit of the approach land but Michael Woods\nEquipped to find just as it was getting toward land in fact the lightning as I was with making it for [noise] so yeah this was almost a category five hurricane and to give you a perspective on that\nOr they're only been three a continental US category five hurricane gone to record Andrew Camille in\nAh Florida Keys Nineteen thirty five Labor Day hurricane so this was a ... this was one intense hurricane landfall\nBoy and and the the aftermath now is what this thing is ... moved north east across George a writer or the Carolinas threatened here by rain\n[noise] yeah that's right right now uh the center of Michael is now just over a or Europe goes to Georgia and it spread it all of the terrain into a park or the Carolinas me ah Appalachians and or over the next twenty four hours it will just blew a pretty quickly to the northeast across the Carolinas\nThe southeast Virginia no spread some rain or as well along parts of the north east seaboard including a south east New England patriots and the terrain or so on its northern like it to a New York city of Philadelphia but fortunately by friday of this thing will finally be able to see will be gone with it\nI think this compares to some of those other big storms I feel like it's slightly different because it didn't hit a major metropolitan area\n[noise] well that's true you know uh you know with apologies the Florida Panhandle you know it's it's a you know if you think about the places where hurricane to hit and do the most damage or think of the places where Michael didn't get it didn't hit New Orleans it didn't hit Tampa\nOr they need Houston mhm ah so it's a it's a road if they lower population swat in the floor and they'll still hit very hard but ah I guess if there was a small all sorts of relief that is certainly as far as the the the the overall damage figure from this instead of hit a relatively unpopulated area the Gulf Coast\nYeah why such a little time to evacuate as some people say to Florida radio show host on earlier said that there shouldn't be the case you to Florida is good about giving people a Seventy two hour window but I was surprised that some people said they didn't have time to pack up\n[noise] yeah I mean a part of it is a part of it is due to\nBecoming so intense so uh so close to land fall you know it just kept intensifying intensifying that's something we we never liked to see but certainly the national Hurricane Center National Weather service had a watches and warnings out well ahead of this that you just put\nA watches out a good forty eight hours ahead of time and uh we we knew this thing was coming you know a good three or four days in advance but uh I think the intensity the ferocity of it\nUh you know I I personally did not expect the borderline five later today so I think that'd be a benefactor\nThat's something we're speaking live this morning with Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel I hate to even ask when you and I have these conversations what's the rest of the season look like either I don't know next couple of days or weeks [laughter]\nWell you know we still have about six weeks of the hurricane season left that typically goes to the end of November ah right now there's a there's a couple of systems on the central and eastern Atlantic not worry about it was the dean\nA there could be some develop in the western Caribbean next week or that will probably stay up buried in Central America that could be a flood threats so you don't see any us threats over the next week or so but again the hurricane season do can go into November we still could get a surprise here and there\nYeah you know I was I was thinking about this the other day the hurricane season runs June through November I mean that's half the year but the concentration of this stuff the worst stuff seems to be my wrong like September October", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day":
