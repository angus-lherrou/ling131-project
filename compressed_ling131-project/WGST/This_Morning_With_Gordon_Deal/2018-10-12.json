more on this Bloomberg\nChief Washington correspondent Kevin ... really joined us in our Bloomberg interactive brokers studios Kevin president sun turning into quite the draw not just for Republican voters but donors\nYes absolutely an effect on junior for quite some time has really been largely perceived as\nThe uh the the the ... the child and the Trump clan that is really much more aligned to the base of the Republican Party and the Trump political coalition here's someone who\nHas really aggressively hit the campaign trail not just a this cycle but also in the previous iteration of it and has really inherited what once belonged to Steve Bannon and uh that is a fascinating to watch and I think that he is someone who has long also been rumored to harbor political ambitions on his own\nHe has spent much of the past couple of years a meeting with Republican donors meeting with Republican I'm activists as well not just here in New York but also all throughout the country\nIt's interesting that you bring up that Don juniors taking the mantle of populism for Steve Bannon when he also along with his brother Eric has the mantle of the family business I mean are we seeing a further blurring the lines between business and politics and this administration all the\nSources that I talk with your work closely to the Trump Organization\nAs well as a to the administration would argue that they've worked hard to try to build a wall for lack of a better term between the operation of the Trump Organization as well as\nThe within within the Trump a political orbit or and and you know I I think the Democrats have risen concerns about conflicts of interest not just within the Trump Organization but also within the president's own personal business dealings and we've seen that play out um you're seeing those criticisms are once again\nBoil up now and the geo political space with the developments in the middle east in Saudi Arabia\nAre wondering whether they are putting done junior a more prominently on the plant are on the on the stump or will further drive the base a out to the polls on both sides when you have a\nYou know not just done junior taking on the populist mantle a but Democrats potentially seeing him as a as someone who was a prominent figure in the ongoing Russia investigation\nWell you know what I think it's also interesting is just how just how much the Trump political orbit has integrated itself with the Republican National committee and that wasn't the case during the presidential campaign that wasn't the case by case when ... was at the helm of the Republican Party before entering into the Trump Administration\nBut now you see whether it's through and that's the Trump who is of course the wife to Eric Trump\nOr through other a top

thanks for\nJoining us this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is work has this to the wall Street Journal Laura where do we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\n... four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent of rapes are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher and it's a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference as even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I Am a I'm a little bit younger I even though I covered with all the time and I know that right to to be deeper than ah it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as idols I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the six percent is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that soon\nI'm with that said though I think that we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a sense that it has been in the past that I think one of the reasons is what we just touch on that we have younger people who don't remember rates being left high and I think the second is because we saw\nA huge run up in prices when rates were low and I and so I think by or they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the higher rates are negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner had the rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around report but anyway a full percentage point at least below where rates are now I'm so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they just had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost nobody anymore was a strong incentive to refinance [laughter]\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing up price growth is slowing and I am definitely share a especially in front of the more\nExpensive markets um but I went to somebody hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a New York we're seeing or hearing more and more up a price productions\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI mean if you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump we've seen in rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go and are going to reflect that right away prices are still high but I Do think it for a buyer that just got\nExhausted I'm far from a bidding war as and cash buyers that my real friends say that we've had in the market that has really cold and so I think for buyers who want\nA little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust our prices down were to bed I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise] thanks Laura Laura ... of the wall Street Journal\nPortion of the program is brought you buy Brooklyn and did you know the Brooklyn in sheets are

school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the states so far\n[noise] you know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more districts spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural districts [noise] and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTurnout why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east and you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out [noise]\nAnd um so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like world you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's a no other unexpected benefits at some of these districts initially going into it to save money or say wow you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know they're noticed and fewer teacher absences\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs of the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours\nAnd you know at some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day\nIt just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already feet in the hours that there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nThat does each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey when kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that\nHave the four days or those states that basically look at ours they don't care [laughter]\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the you know to be in a chicken for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever and there are some states that still\nTo base it on how

care what your schedule live just make sure your kids you know have this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that in the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day and uh what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day they typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday\nAnd they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nAnd the school district might provide the meals\nUm doodles nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up all night friday just to serve meals because there are some very poor communities were that might be the only meal the child might be getting\nYou know during the during that a school day period so a daycare has been\nA really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the districts that use it for a day and and talking to those parents there were a lot of
