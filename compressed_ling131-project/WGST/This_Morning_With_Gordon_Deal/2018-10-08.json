{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Michael thank you it is now successor rolls through some of the stories in our nation's capital include this morning secretary said my palm pale receiving a\nFrosty reception in China Bryn ... so to hear his first argument is spring for justice that's tomorrow less than thirty days until voters go to the polls for the mid term elections\nWill get more of these stories with Bloomberg Washington reporter Kathleen hunter\nA Kathleen let's start with geopolitics suddenly ... Mike Pompeo has the visit going\nWell it's been a bit of a rough one for Mike Pompeo in Asia um you know he started out with a visit\nTo a young man and walking into it didn't have a whole lot of leverage and I think that you know the north Koreans pretty much made that clear from the time he landed on the tarmac and they said basically you know your body guards kept bringing a gun is only three people out of the meeting um they put a lot of restrictions on him and I think that with ... and Val ugly to show on I thought\nOK and a Beijing didn't do much better to\nKnow it really didn't um [laughter] I think in Beijing what we're seeing and you know that kind of that at the exchange and um I think what we're saying is kind of the uh trade tensions\nUh the fallout from the trade tensions that have sold over and say you know military tension and and you know tensions on a range of other issues um it just sounds like it's a it's a difficult time for U.S China relations and that being reflected in the meetings that ... that I'm I'm a U.S having in Beijing and Pyongyang\nOr a back to domestic issues ah ... he's going to hit the ground running a confirmation abroad repercussions ... tell us about that\nYeah we are um basically just less than a month now out from the mid term elections Democrats than you know\nAfter Trump was elected have basically had their sights on the maternal action and wanting to win control of the house and he tends to leaving the Senate things we're looking like they were going their way in terms of the political wind blowing their direction\nUm but you know I think that Republicans are now feeling a bit emboldened because they feel like the fight\nOver Brett Kavanaugh has in bold and as a energize their base and so I think that thinking is that perhaps could have eroded the enthusiasm edge that Democrats are enjoying in public\nPoint and so it really a kind of crystallized as the what the stake in the midterms and you know I think Democrats who had been on the on off and they're not playing a little bit of defense which isn't a great position to be in less than a month out\nOf it is on the Supreme Court was a couple of those first who's going to be\nSo he's going to start hearing a couple of kind of low profile cases at the outset I'm but later that term you could hear a case that does have some implications or potentially could happen implications for the president and some of the legal matters that the president has\nBeen drawn into there is a case coming up that basically would deal with whether or not um state and federal prosecution and both proceed\n'em down a related to the same batters and so that's something that could affect whether or not um you know it's someone like Paul Manafort for instance was convicted who have been convicted and if Trump or to issue a pardon or whether you know he could\nHear someone like him than they charge of the state level so that kind of\nA big issue that's coming up later this term going to be a case that involves um sexual discrimination our debt by job discrimination based on sexual orientation and not one that people are going to be watching very closely but I think the sense in the first couple of days is not necessarily the stakes are so high because of\nThe kind of how cabinet conduct themselves on the bench he's someone that was that I'm very kind of avid questioner um when he was on the appeals court and so I think that the you know he's going to be speaking up and asked me a lot of questions and what type of question I think people are going to be watching that very closely\nOkay I'm Susan Collins the Republican from Maine she's under a lot of scrutiny for her vote or that's prompted calls from some of the someone to step up and oppose her so was it was up there on the\n... yeah so she's up for reelection and twenty twenty two more years and I think that she's basically going to have a target on her back now having been good advice vote in favor of cap now I wouldn't be surprised if she draws a pretty that the uh a stiff challenge she's the one who you know a moderate\nAnd you know main which is a more moderate state\nUm but I think that you know she could this vote could put her um could end up being a liability for her and already there's people that are talking about challenging her Susan Rice kind of briefly entertained the ID on Twitter and so I think that you know Collins is certainly someone that's going to be and liberal\nA site coming up uh in the next campaign cycle regardless of what she does now\nUm how did the columns explain her vote or or did she with the reasoning behind it\nI think you know she said all along she doesn't believe they have an um wouldn't necessarily overturn roe v Wade and so that's something that she was looking at she said she hadn't seen any evidence of that and then I think also she just essentially said that she didn't uh wasn't compelled\n'em by the FBI investigation to believe that there was any real corroborating evidence for Christine Bobby border and the other cabinet ... claim and so in light of that I think that she basically we're looking for a reason\nThat we should explain it at least is that she's looking for a reason not to vote for him or reason why she didn't vote for him and she never really found that reason\nOkay we want to Bloomberg News Washington reporter\nKathleen hunter or you can read more about these stories all the work done a moron WBUR terrible also a reminder you can follow all the

numbers of the latest jobs report from the government the unemployment rate fell in September from three point nine to three point seven percent the lowest level since the Vietnam War\nWhile hiring cooled slightly one hundred and thirty four thousand jobs were added Here's Mark Hamm Rick senior industry analyst at ... dot com work what's that number means\nIt means that there's nothing to see here and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nAh we believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country\nFor Eighteen straight months Gordon the nation's unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent\nFour years ago the Federal Reserve projected a and a sense adjusted\nAbout projected back then that four and a half percent was essentially full employment in our country and ... been below that level for uh Eighteen months so uh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this is a good time for workers\nEmployers are having some strains from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers uh but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets sorting push those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would've expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the are hoping to get more pay standpoint average hourly earnings up below three percent two point eight percent actually a bit of a backtracking there\nAnd so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a you know uh we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case\nAnd speak with Mark Emmert senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report\nUm does the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kinda waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously\nYeah uh well for one that's of average right so that's the old your results may very routine and we think about\nHow ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as a full informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience or you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nA and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is I fit as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good place as well\nWith it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector your work again so [noise]\nUm for the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world\nAh and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked\nBy people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh the ... you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does that extend to another words does it mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output\nFor another two plus years [laughter] or does it mean that we're overheating at at some point you just can't prove any further and back to the answer that only comes after the fact ah but I think for most of us I think the the most important attribute that important question is for now it looks positive uh the impact of the tax cut begin to fade and twenty twenty\nI think probably

is that you have a lottery Gresham districts in Texas are are fairly gerrymandered in the Senate Democrats as possible and then they just haven't seen competitive races are not just for Congress but the the guy on the ballot for for local races\nOr you know and so that the general elections have been a cakewalk for one party or the other and\nUh and there hasn't been there's been no add add on to that there really hasn't been a competitive statewide race in Texas for anything in Twenty years uh\nAnd so there's not a political machinery ticket folks out to vote a destroyer works campaign has

that come from\nJust now and if you asked a Mr O'Rourke he'll tell you that nobody's come and ask for their uh and he is he talks a in his stump speech about having lived around two hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and the taxes the big state uh and some of these counties are very small uh\nSome of the county is that if I were a bit of this crisis here to visit him a C\nAnd campaigning and

person is kind of throwing out I'm the baby with the bathwater\nAnd we're speaking with Wall Street journal healthcare policy reporter Stephanie Armour or pieces gold some Democrats want Medicare for all others aren't so sure how much of a role by the way those the slogan itself play Medicare rule versus say the phrase\nSingle payer system yeah that that's a good question wouldn't even when the parents go out and ask people voters about Medicare for all the support a strikingly high around\nSeventy percent but that Medicare for all that\nHas gotten the most interest that brings haters plant in the form of single parent is single payer and so if you ask people what they think I'm Single payer as a form of health care that that dropped precipitously show I think some of it is quite frankly a lot of people don't really know what Medicare for all isn't even among the Democrat\nThey're widening support for more watered down version such as allowing people to buy into Medicare's want the

consensus on what they mean what they want and as we thought with Republicans and their efforts to repeal and replace a theater that's not an easy task\nIs there a perception among those who support\nMedicare for all that the government is good at running programs\nI don't know it would go so far as to say it's good at running program that I think they\nThey are building on the ... the popularity of Medicare itself which had you know high\nApproval rating some its beneficiaries and cut it serves as a positive connotation the public and I also think they that they see the uh as a way to expand health care coverage to everyone on as well as a way to a\nA word us health care spending which I Would say the the critics of it being that they disagree with\nMedical groups would rally against it I presume because there'd be less money for them\nRather than the federal government generally in almost all cases pays a lower reimbursement rate for care\nAnd um private payer such as\nInsurance companies do their concern obviously about lower reimbursement but also they're looking at it as okay let's see you overhaul the complete healthcare system they're saying that this is going to mean what we're left my coming into hospitals which tend will cause massive job losses in the industry is that their argument or their concerns", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning
