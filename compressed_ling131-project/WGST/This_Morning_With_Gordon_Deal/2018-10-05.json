{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Thank you fly low T Farnsworth area where I live from the Bloomberg interactive brokers studios where it is six fifty on Wall street\nSo I'm not a check in with what's going on in D.C among the top stories in our nation's capital of course the Senate said to take a procedural vote within hours on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh the U. S. pressing Japan to see more ground on trade ahead of the first round of talks on terror actions\nAnd secretary of state Mike Pompeo traveled to North Korea for more on these and other stories Bloomberg Washington reporter Kathleen hunter joined us Happy Friday Kathleen so ah get us up to date on the timeline for the cabinet nominations I guess the first votes coming up in just a few hours here yeah\nAbout ten thirty eastern time is when the Senate will vote on on ...\nWhich are on Kavanaugh's nomination which is really just fancy Senate speak for limiting debate\nAnd basically what that means as if he overcomes that hurdle and his nomination moves forward that that would set a maximum thirty hours the debate which means there would be a final vote no later than tomorrow on his confirmation\nSo basically this is this is kind of the moment of truth in the Senate where these hold out Republicans either haven't said firmly which way they're going to vote\nThis is when they're going to have to give an indication of that this morning when they vote in its initial kind of have to procedural the defendants planning\nYeah absolutely I mean we've gotten some indications of where are those key swing Republicans we been talking about for so many days and weeks now a might fall now that they've seen that FBI report Jeff Flake and\nSusan Collins both saying it appears thorough now going to see what whether that translates into a yes vote\nYeah I think the people that have been like myself as a sort of been watching them very closely and trying to read the tea leaves on\n... it seemed to extrapolate from that that they may be leaning towards supporting him which if both flicking Collins did that that would give him the boats that he needs to be confirmed I'm assuming that everyone else you know goes along party lines um\nI think that you know however I think about a week ago when you know we saw Jeff Flake change his mind in the middle of a committee mark up on and you know I think this could be a nail biter and certainly people will watch closely and you know don't it's not over until it's over [laughter]\nYeah but there's not enough must see TV must listen radio coming out of Washington but let's turn to geopolitics and we're getting some tough words for China from vice president Mike Pence here's what he said yesterday\nChinese security agencies of masterminded the wholesale theft of American technology including cutting edge military blueprints and using those stolen technology the Chinese Communist party is turning Ploughshares into sorts on a message to\nBuy those are some significant words from parents we don't usually hear this kind of tough talk in public from the administration\nYeah this is really I think it would be fair to characterize it as you know the harshest I\nAt most high level of criticism that China's trade\nIssues and the U.S China the trade war that the U.S is waging against China is is being waged on national security grounds I think Trump I think a pen yesterday outline that case more clearly that it's an outline before and I also think that um it's significant because here we are a month out of the midterms and we're seeing a very high level speech dedicated at\nChina China's potential to metal on you know in in us democracy when Russia has really been the focus of a lot of this and as by be seen as the culprit in twenty sixteen and there's been no similar move by someone at the Trump Pence level to condemn them public I\nNot only getting warnings about China meddling in democracy but we're also getting warnings that the U.S military could be at risk from Beijing\nYeah and that's where I think you know this report that kind of come in this report that came out yesterday and it was commissioned or I guess a commission my trumpet led by the defense department\nA basically a provided some backup to some of the claims that Pence never talked about in his speech and you know kind of again drew this connected the dots between the idea of\nYou know ah what what China is doing and a national security threat um and kind of making the case that that that Trump has been making rhetorically for a while but does that China does pose a national security threat to the U.S in part through some of the trade practices\nMan does the administration ratcheted up the rhetoric against China secretary of state Mike Pompeo is headed across the Pacific to North Korea once again\nYeah there should be an interesting meeting a ... going over to try to\nNegotiate the terms potentially of a second summit between I Kim Jong on and and Donald Trump I think what's interesting though really is that a despite the White House's protest stations it's not like ... has a whole lot of leverage going into this meeting or North Korea so far really hasn't taken a lot of concrete steps to denuclearize\nAnd you know there are actually been some reports that they've been building up their nuclear stockpiles and so I think that the question here is you know what ... is really going to be able to achieve in this meeting and I think the um looking looking at it on the on the front end it doesn't look like the outlook is very very positive for him it's going to be a tough time meeting maybe\nBloomberg Washington reporter Kathleen hunter thanks for that as always enjoy the weekend to read much

lose situation for Republicans abandon judge Kavanaugh and depressed the base ahead of the midterm elections or attack Dr Ford\nAnd read the whirlwind with women come November but Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner says now it's possible the battle over judge Kavanaugh could rally apathetic Republican voters especially in the red states that will decide which party controls the Senate Jim explain\nAll even though Brett Kavanaugh's poll numbers nationwide or are not all that impressive and there are a lot of people who believe he is accuser over him\nIn the ... states where a lot of the Senate races are happening this year there's a little bit of a different factors are Republican voters have seen their enthusiasm for the election go up\nA in some cases we've seen Republican Senate candidates begin to open leads races are pretty close\nAnd Cavanaugh is a factor at all of this there are a lot of conservative voters Republican voters who believe the Supreme Court nominee who's been treated unfairly\nThey believe for the media has not covered him\nPartially and they believe that the Democrats are stalling underway and rather than try to get to the bottom of the sexual assault allegations and and to understand what really happened thirty six years ago so that has at least for the time being a little bit of a boost to Republicans in terms of their\nDesire to turn out to vote in November which have been in question and a lot of previous polling that the Democrats were more enthusiastic than Republicans are Republicans in a lot of cases seemed to be skeptical that the house and Senate majorities we're really at risk\nMm right so what races are being impacted here by the cabin on Tuesday as him\nPlay a big one is we've seen in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp of two remaining undecided Democrats who has been committed to which way she's going to vote on Kavanaugh a Republican challenger representative Kevin Cramer has opened up a double digit lead on her and the last two polls that have been conducted\nA we're now in the upper single digits in terms of his lead in the polling average is\nUh yeah that was a race would spin cos it's been considered a proud Republican pickup opportunity it now looks a little bit more solid than it has in in the last few weeks it looks like he's got a really good shot at taking I kept down which you know whether that makes her more or less likely\nTo vote for Kavanaugh remains to be seen\nI think we've seen also a ... has the potential to become a real issue the Missouri Senate race where Claire McCaskill declared fairly early that she was going to vote against capital she didn't vote for no Gorsuch Josh Hawley the Republican challenger the attorney general the state\nHas been really hitting her on this issue on the issue of conservative judges so he has a much narrower lead in the polls there are some polls that still\nThere was a recent CNN poll that did have a three but at the polling averages he's clinging to have a very narrow lead and this could be a race for its influenced by by the Supreme Court matter\nYou know we're speaking with Jim mental politics editor at the Washington Examiner he's written a piece titled Kavanaugh fight boosts Republicans in red states\nIt's probably took a life on its own I Know there's always politics involved with the Supreme Court nominees but is this sort of found material I guess for the midterms\n[noise] oh definitely I I you know it's always a very political process has become much more so in recent years says each party has began to escalate what kind of tactics that they're willing to employ to keep the conservative liberal balance on the Supreme Court what it currently is sort of shifted\nIn their party's favor a but certainly to have something happening so close to the mid term elections where Democrats are already pretty energized because they dislike President Trump\nThey dislike Republicans are doing a Washington there seems to them like another power grab by narrow Republican majority is at a at a president that was the popular vote\nFor Republicans I mean a major factor in why they voted for Trump as the first place was they wanted\nConservative judges they cared about who was controlling the Supreme Court\nThey didn't want to see that particular to go to a liberal\nThat Anthony Kennedy she go to a more reliable conservative potentially a really does deliver a pretty big promise to many of the voters who turned out for Trump and twenty sixteen and so\nThis could be a real motivating factor for them to show up in the mid term elections are it really is something that energizes both sides to a certain extent\nIs Jim Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner\nForce of the program is

protect intellectual property and a a digital assets\nWhich really were not part of the original NAFTA which went into effect in Nineteen Ninety four which was before the um Internet as we think of it today even existed in the agreement has been updated just to take account of changes in technology so that's a good thing I guess right\nAll of those changes what has been in Trans Pacific partnership

that's pretty good um and what it would take to get up to an eight or would probably be a better wage grows and better or\nExports which are two six factors we look at it but we give we are saying that Trump presiding over a stronger economy or I I don't get into rather Trump deserves credit for that or not I usually say let the economy kind of does it sound the same uh the truck but president either get credit or blame for it so\nI was doing OK and the economy um but some of the things she didn't have to say\nWe're just really want all the controversy undisturbed when they're on a we're going to tear up the north American free trade agreement that might cause a recession apparently we're not we're just going to make some minor changes and call it a victory\nReceipt with Yahoo Finance columnist ... new many species called Trump speaks strategy on trade rebranding how much of this still might be geared just toward China and getting them to do something different\nI think what we've seen in Trump's overall trade strategy is an evolution or where he began earlier this year\nKind of like picking fights with everybody or ... or\n... everybody who in court room and him and the United states out of college Japan and of course she picks fights with China China and with Canada and Mexico so I uh we progress through these development it does seem that ... that Trump's strategy is getting shrewd\nAnd he actually listening to trade experts are saying look\nI'm we really don't have it much trade problem with Canada we really don't have a problem with Mexico either\nThe big problem you know the real problem here is China and if you want to confront China you need to make nice with everybody else basically allies to pick a fight with allies um when you read there to put more pressure on China so that's actually what's happening\nAt what point or how long into the agreement you think would be fair to measure it against the old NAFTA this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement us MCAA how how long is you know worth letting it go and then in analyzing it yeah\nYears uh I mean we may not really no er during Trump's first four years okay I'm In ... first of all I'd have to be ratified by the legislatures of each of the three countries\nAnd that is not a given 'em if a turns out that Democrats take control the house and or the Senate or both chambers next year\nOr that'll be a very interesting dynamic because while Democrats actually support some of these protections that Trump are also a favor they may just not want to give Trump a victory on anything
