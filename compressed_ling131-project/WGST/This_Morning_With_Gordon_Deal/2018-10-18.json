countries I'm Michael Barr booth is Bloomberg may be\nAll right Michael thank you it is a six fifty on Wall street rely from the Bloomberg interactive brokers studio starting to move from Sesame Street to K Street and check what's going on in D.C some of our top stories in the nation's capital include White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow speaking today\nAt the Detroit Economic Club director of national intelligence Dan Coats as among the speakers at a D.C cyber talks event on cyber security priorities\nAnd President Trump kicking off another round of campaign style rally tonight in Montana also making news this morning the mounting pressure on Saudi Arabia to explain the disappearance and the parents killing of journalists ...\nBloomberg Washington reporter caffeine hunters following that and joins us now a Cape the administration has been taking I think it's safe to say a pretty cautious tact with the Saudi royal family and uh now this is starting to expose a a pretty significant rift with Republicans on Capitol Hill\nAbsolutely I think that it's on the kind of interesting in the context as Republicans who've been pretty hesitate to challenge the president a number of other issues or even have you know really strongly backed the president are really divided and um and pretty far apart from him on this particular issue Lindsey Graham is a good example of someone who\nAre in the most recent fight over the cabinet nomination was you know when it comes on and have it on the defenders in that and you know now he's someone that's really being critical of the president in terms of his policy toward Saudi Arabia\nI Trump has I think I from the beginning been\nEager to be closer to Saudi Arabia to many Republicans in Congress would like and so I think that this is kind of a risk that was waiting to be exposed and this incident involving the Saudi journalist is really just kind of lame that bear\nNo I mean how far could this rift deep and I mean there's been a increasing talk among Republicans on Capitol Hill about sanctioning a Saudi Arabia could Congress do that over the president's head [noise]\nWell I think that you know the president's made pretty clear that he would not want to do that that he would not want to cancel an arms sales to Saudi Arabia but I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't see sort of a growing push to do that in Congress and you know I'm ... it to an extent you know Congress does have some authority when it comes to sanctions president has\nSome executive authority dealing with that but there is a legislative component to 'em so you know\nThe a Congress could essentially kind of\nForced Trump into a position where he'd have to choose between you know be telling something like that or you know backing down from his dance\nSort of raises the question of whether the administration is choosing between backing Saudi Arabia and back in Turkey a NATO ally or if this administration is continues to appear to give Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt how could that affect relations with turkey particularly after the release of the American pastor seemed to a cool things off\n[noise] yeah I mean the the relationship with turkey I generally am between Trump and airline specifically has been fraught from the you know from the early days of Trump's administration and so I think that as you say the release of the American pastor kind of cool things down a bit but you know this is kind of threatening to heat it back up and I think that\nGiven that turkey is a NATO ally and on\nThere's already a lot of concern out there about Saudi Arabia's record on human rights issues and some of the details that are coming out to that what may have happened to the journalist on in the Saudi conflict are particularly disturbing I think that this could even in a court of public opinion I'm you know the U.S could be seen as siding with ah you know a\nPotential uh Middle East power that is not necessarily on subject to the same sort of a\nStandards on human rights as you know NATO allies would be and so I think that you know in a weird way turkey seems like they're on the right side of this and the U.S I'm from a human rights standpoint um even though airline doesn't have a particularly strong human rights record himself\nReal quickly started the midterms now less than three weeks away and President Trump getting ready to headline another rally out west tonight and the cycle is already shaping up to be the most expensive on record just quickly\nYeah five billion dollars which you know every ... every every election tends to be more expensive than the last summer certainly seen that happen in this midterm election and you know it's really just kind of this is just an appetizer for twenty twenty which will be you know astronomical in terms of how much people tend\nTo kill continues Bloomberg Washington reporter Kathleen hunter thanks as always\nYou can read much more about

Republicans and Democrats fight over repealing or replacing Obamacare what the real action this election might come at the state level here to explain is Maureen ... Washington correspondent at USA Today Maureen what's up here\nWhere there are two issues the most direct way that voters could be a have a say in health care isn't some ballot initiative that we're seeing in Idaho Nebraska and Utah or some of the states that did not go along with the Affordable care act's expansion of Medicaid and this time because because the governors in the state legislature there haven't done it\nVoters are trying to to do it themselves they are and they're saying that they want their legislatures their their public officials to go along and expand Medicaid people the way of Obamacare intend to\nDo these state legislatures and those three states they can handle it\n[noise] well there's a there's some some pushback from state officials in some of those states\nAnd one of the interesting things that's going on is that for example in Utah their ballot initiative includes a way to pay for the state's share of expansion of federal government pays her most of the costs of the state does have some portion of the cars and in Maine which was the first state to do this to ... to expand Medicaid true about initiative\nThe governor there has refused to go along in part because the funding issues and Utah they're trying to avoid that additional roadblock\nBy including a funding initiative along with their I'm finishing their ballot initiative from\nHow similar or the initiatives that are going to be on the ballot in Idaho Nebraska and Utah\n... the main interests as a saying that the Affordable CARE Act are allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people up to earn enough to a hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um this is an issue one reason it still I'm practically and as an issue and said that there's a lot of\nPressure from hospitals particularly real hospitals and other medical medical providers in these states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us\nAnd we're not tapping into it even though my tax dollars from our states are going to find these things and you know across the country one argument for why that is happening by mail initiative is there is neither conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public officials the Republican public officials to look like they're supporting\nThe Affordable CARE Act but if their voters say we want this and there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen grabbing Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece titled midterms healthcare is a key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level or could this be a trend where state legislatures are addressing this\nIt potentially to their Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican\nWho has worked on health care issues for a number of years on on the hill and he said a foreign with health care reporters that he thinks if these initiatives he spelled initiatives in these states passed that it it could have a sort of trend for the rest of the state that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the only thing that's going on\nIs some states that haven't expanded Medicaid ... conservative states have been asking Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that\nAdvocates for the Affordable CARE Act don't like such as a imposing work requirements and that's another issue that set play some states might be willing to expand Medicaid if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that that are being challenged in court and we're saying that for example it in um Kentucky okay\nYou've written to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races thought to have an effect on this right\nRight that that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact on the ballot initiatives because governors aren't the only ones in their states that have a say in it there's in the state legislatures are due to but it's come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\nOr what would I Do too much time do I go to the federal government money would be guaranteed that would be there every year\nThat's the way the law is written by one of the arguments that are opponents of I'm expanding Medicaid I'm One of the argument that they're making is that you can't guarantee you can't guarantee that they said that funding will be there forever\nSo they their their argument is that if states get depended on his federal money and then if the federal government can't live up to bargain of funding Ninety percent or more out of the expansion than states are going to be on their own\nMaureen Maureen grumpy Washington correspondent at USA Today twenty minutes in front of the hour now on this morning Americas first news [noise]\n\nHe's wrong everyone did yours and be more to

but for what purpose analysis from Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank re read what are some findings\nTwo thirds of Americans are limiting their spending a buffer buried reasons but uh the the fact that two thirds are holding back and what does it all the other was a pretty good economy is notable this is the highest it's been four years\nSo a meal in the middle of the range that we've seen over the years um but it's a reversal of the trend where you'd see where as the economy got better and better\nEach successive here we saw that people are a little bit looser with the purse strings and that changed the share it jumped from sixty percent now to sixty six percent that say that they are actively limiting how much they spend every month reversing that downward trend that we had seen a an several years prior to that\nYou represented in the ... remarks there but this is a solid economy right to wages are creeping up the tax cut pour more money in Americans paychecks with why this trend now\nYou know it's interesting you mentioned the growth in household income and I did that is one thing that we have seen consistently show up of the last few years\nThat was initially a well we started looking at their self five or five years or so ago that was the top ... and people limited they're spending it was like as their incomes weren't going up what we noticed over the past several years though is that as\nA income growth became more broad based that became\nLess and less the case where that was the reason people are already back and instead people were saying Cuomo holding back in order to save more money that continues to be the predominant reason and buy a pretty wide margin\nA couple of other things that that they're watching the percentage of Americans that point too too much debt as to why they're holding back\nThat's been creeping higher each of the past few years down the highest that it's been at any any point that we've looked at this over the last five years and I think that's consistent with a rising interest rate environment that better economy we\nAre seeing debt burdens come up but that the higher debt burdens and coupled with rising

whole lot different from what we've been seeing last year a lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows that even on a sunny day somebody's worried about right\nNow [laughter] we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at ... dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending about my generation was that break down\nAnd you know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending and little inclination to save more as a reason falling back\nSkew younger so a lot of those in particular lead the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend hand are also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on spending Gen x is not far behind um but it's so similar trend there\nMost inclined to be limiting their spending because they want to save more money\nBut that's where change it ... baby boomers those are the sandwich generation a couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back\nOn their spending as their younger counterparts [laughter] but when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth it on the economy's doing well I think that's another indicator that you're particularly for baby boomers is entering the workforce stagnant income is still very much an issue\nYeah how much of this is a recession hanging over that may have been passed on from parents
