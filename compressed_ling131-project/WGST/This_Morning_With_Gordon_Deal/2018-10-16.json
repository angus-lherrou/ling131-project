campaign you know in the first couple of months to partake in months really of\nPresident Trump we are very different Senator Cruz and I'm always saw when he came to the Senate in ... he was working collaboratively with his colleagues he was working collaboratively White House he was working very hard to kind of play the inside game and get things done and so what we're seeing now is in the last six weeks there is some concern that Senator Cruz a face and a little bit of trouble from ... you know the the massive\nDemocrat keepers sharper tone and record sums of money or you know maybe make in Texas that competitive and uh you know one thing that Senator Cruz said not rely on in the past but that he was able to rely on and get help with was the party establishment kind of coming in and and helping them out you know the vice president raising money\nOr the president's son campaigning for and the president offering to come down and campaign for him or so you know Senator Cruz is sort of the quintessential outsider candidate got to get some help from the Washington insiders and the Republican Party to stabilize the rates and make it a you know give him an edge on that in Texas\nAnd how does this play among those who supported him for being an outsider\nInteresting what I think the coffee from Ted Cruz's supporters his hardcore supporters as they would argue that you know the conservatives are banned but he always was a huge though you know he has been abandoned his values one of one of the person I talked to protect the comments actually you know Ted Cruz is changing his values are are becoming more of a moderate you he collapsed\nHis support uh and that's not really what's happening is that he's just relying on helping the more collaborative of a bomb thrower and that that you know it's benefited him and I don't think he lost supporters because of that sort of it\nWhat is he a as you said the pieces campaign ... earlier this year uh why is that what it would have Mr O'Rourke do for his part is part of the Senate campaign\nBut I think the thing about that or get out of money and out of the ... um you know he only crazy amounts of money he was told in these rallies that you know thousands of people who were going to and and he he kind of sparks sort of a little bit of a movement um\nAnd she was on TV for ... the without bending occurs\nOn TV and not very surprising a Democrat could be outspending an out raising at a Republican impact that especially wanted as widely known as Ted Cruz and and so it just sparked a little bit of concern that maybe the the sort of better movement was real impact and I think his campaign and looking from Texas kicked into high gear\nTowards the end of summer and going into the fall out of realizing that they were challenging and you know they they step it up and call in shows that that that group of leading pretty clear that running away with it but he's got a healthy pretty safely\nAnd the race and and so you know they had to take it and again they charge them better over any rich thirty eight million dollars in a third quarter wow that is just an absolute record\nFor speak with James ark and sort of campaign reporter for political who's written a piece titled cruise plays the inside game to beat O'Rourke um you said that a Senator Cruz standard down some of the sharp edges on his personality by it could give an example\nI think the clearest example of that as you look at the Affordable CARE Act Republicans by turkey on the court will pack and remember famously occurs shut down the government over Obamacare when he first got to the Senate you know he was running rallies outside the capital and he was really sort of an outside\nPressure force on the public and in fact the capital to force their hand and he did exactly force their hands to the chagrin of his colleagues and folks\nIn the capital and uh the the new time around in twenty Seventeen was\nYou know meeting with Republican senator or very closely with his colleague he wasn't there\nAnd bombed up that he tried to get a and you know they were unsuccessful but they were unsuccessful you know not because of the Senator Cruz Bob and Bob's a bomb the way that ah yeah he had previously and\nYou were quoted a Republican consultant in your story who said something to the effect of that a federal federal Rourke had become like Ted Cruz of this election almost like he was taking a page from cruises playbook\n[noise] in a sense it's it's funny you know um you get some pushback from Republicans and your credit that are working outsider because he's been in politics are more than a decade in and out of your house um\nAnd but he's he's running this kind of campaign against you know the average met again politics as usual against the way things are usually done in Washington and so he gave kind of trying to go on to this sort of anti establishment anti politics as usual\nMaple trees and famous for and contracts that

critical decisions that were Mr maybe nineties\nI'm certainly going online much more aggressively or keeping up the stores\nAre keeping up with the latest fashions are competing more aggressively with the company is going after them whether it be Home Depot or clothing stores but it was it's a huge company that I had a lot of employers will the high cost space it would've been hard for them to survive with is very brutal retail environment\nYou know what what are the thing about fears too is is that the fact that they anchor so many malls what about those malls now do they sort of live in fear\nI think so I mean the fares stores have not been that popular anyway so they've been an actor but a a debit card right out of those places will be we developed\nA maybe feathers stores maybe for other purposes I mean those gems in restaurants all kinds of things that come into these places [noise] um so ... even Amazon Amazon starting to open stores though\nSo that's purpose will be the space will be repurposed but it's got to be a big drag on a lot of malls I'm currently have a total of about eight hundred and twenty stores Sears and Kmart and that they're going to close a hundred and fifty pretty soon\nThey're in chapter eleven reorganization but if they don't do well enough to the holidays is probably liquidate them all so that's eight hundred and twenty large stores\nThat will be liquidated on the market including all their inventory\nAnd speak with Jordan Goodman personal finance experts at money answers dot com he's known as the America's money answers man we're talking about the Sears bankruptcy filing the irony by the way of Amazon actually opening brick and mortar stores\nYeah well uh they're doing it a very selective way they do these Amazon Go stores where you go in and they know who you are you just take things off the shelf they walk out but I Know exactly what it says no cashiers whatsoever so\nUh and they're doing all the best of what Amazon offers its own products and so and so it ... but they're doing much more strategic way with much more limited inventory and select locations fears just got too big and had too much of a jury of too many big stories of people didn't want to go to\nIf you're a savvy shopper are you preparing to pounce on what Sears may have to offer\n[noise] yeah I mean the products are good and um yeah so I think you're going to fail incredible low prices for appliances electronics and clothes and all things will fears offers yes I think people will go up there and clean the place out with them which is a tech sales away from other traditional retailers\nWho probably have to compete maybe you'll see lower prices from Walmart and target and other places to compete with this huge liquidation from other figure stores will\nWe still know the Sears brand than a year five years from now\nNot really I I it's not going to be around I mean some of the individual brands Kenmore for example ... fears are bought that for four hundred million dollars um they've got some rare but most of the brands have been sold out so I think the fears name itself is probably going to disappear overtime\nThanks Jordan Jordan
