wounds for ... well you know it's mixed martial arts right so maybe it's good it's a mix or I don't know\nIt was ... case let's do it I'll ship bottom is a global news ... hours a day on her\nTo talk on Twitter Power by more than twenty seven hundred journalists metal is more than a hundred twenty countries and Michael Barr this is Bloomberg News and\nIt is five o'clock somewhere but it's six fifty on Wall street we're live from the Bloomberg interactive brokers studios\nSo I'm not a check what's going on in D.C and some of the top stories in our nation's capital include Brett Kavanaugh joining his new colleagues on the Supreme Court in just a couple of hours time after a presidential apology over his bitter confirmation\nPresident Trump heads to Iowa this evening where he plans to make an announcement on corn based ethanol gasoline and bill and Hillary Clinton are hitting the road for Thirteen city speaking tour after the election from on all this Bloomberg Washington reporter Kathleen hotter joins us and Kate as we said justice Kevin ...\nJoined says a new colleagues on the bench to hear his first cases in a couple of hours five conservatives now so is this the cabin on court\nWell I think he will certainly be the one they'd be the justice that folks are watching the most closely today when the court can beans I think just because of obviously the recent controversy and which has been embroiled ever as confirmation fight\nHowever you know it's important to remember that he's going to be that the most junior member and then he also is a you know very solid conservative and so in some way as chief justice John Roberts become sort of\nAnthony Kennedy to point now where he's the he's the most moderate of the five solidly conservative justices\nAnd so I think people will be watching closely to see if he what kinds of questions he asked and to see if there's any sort of hint of the recent confirmation fight and his comments or whether he's moved on from that I think that you know to say it's his court I think might be a bridge too far but he's certainly going to wield great influence over it and pressure\nYou know it's interesting you raise the question of the kinds are the raise the point of the kinds of questions that justice Kevin I could I ask because the uh\nThe parallel the we all draw from the ... just acrimonious confirmation fight is Clarence Thomas in the Anita Hill hearings a generation ago of course after those hearings we haven't heard many questions at all from justice ...\nYeah and I think that that is at the forefront of people's minds you know if we're going to the cabinet and take a similar tactic particularly again be at this stage where he's the most junior member whether he's going to kind of be\nQuiet and deferential and observant or whether he's going to be an active questionnaire I think his record on the appeals court showed that he was a very active question that role a and and so I think that that couple potentially with his performance during the confirmation hearings might lead people to believe that he will be quite vocal but I guess that's what we're all waiting to see\nAs much as a justice Kevin I said that he enters the high court with no bitterness following the confirmation fight as he said last night during his ceremonial swearing in it's hard to\nSeparate politics from all this happened over the last couple of weeks we saw President Trump apologize on behalf of the nation to Kavanaugh though not all of the nation might uh joined the president in that apology\nCertainly I think uh at least a significant chunk of the nation does not and um I think that\nIf it's if it's at all possible for people who oppose cabin out to be even more whipped up than they already were\nThe president's comments on both his apology and also his remark that Kavanaugh had been proven innocent I think um we'll you know just get people even more outraged who are already feeling outraged about cabinet and getting confirmed\nYeah now it's just a four weeks to the date till the midterms do you think uh this is going to resonate as voters had to the polls\nAbsolutely um I think the interesting thing to me though is that I as the degree to which is also resonating on the Republican side um there was some interesting polling data last week that indicated that Republicans have us been successful in eroding Democrats enthusiasm edge\nHeading into the midterms on over the last several weeks of this cabinet controversy has dominated the headlines\nAnd so I think that that is something that should be concerning for Democrats and certainly something that\nRepublicans having knowledge as a potential point in their favor as they try to hang on to control of the house and also the Senate that you know there are voters who may not have been as motivated to go to the polls suddenly had this issue that's motivating them as well\nNow the campaign trail of sorts President Trump heads to Iowa this evening of course the first in the nation caucus states are not a not a presidential election but nonetheless he's going to be making an announcement that many farmers had been waiting for on ethanol I mean how important is it for the president or to shore up his support in the farm belt\nI think it's important for the president on both for twenty Eighteen and for twenty twenty you know as you mentioned I was going to be an important state in twenty twenty if if Trump does in fact as he's given and the and every indication he will do to seek re election\nSo that you know is is on its face significant and I think but uh you know heading into the midterms in a couple of weeks\nA lot of what Trump is done on trade policy has elicited um you know obviously retaliation from China\nAnd that retaliate retaliatory China Chinese actions has really caused some concern and limited Trump's support in farming communities and farming states\nAnd many of those kind of rural areas are represented by Republicans and there are there areas that Democrats are trying to flip on this this midterm election anything Trump can do right now to sort of sharp as support in the farm out I think I could have the effect of helping to minimize the Democratic gains in those areas or at least that's what Republicans I'm sure are are hoping\nTwenty eight days to go till mid

here they he is part of a five justice conservative bloc it's more conservative than it's been in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court could do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law\nBut as we say in the story I mean the big challenge for him is Brett Kavanaugh comes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some\nInflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee parents and the whole process just isn't that sort of process that reflects terribly well on the court and then to the challenge for the chief or\nWill be to to try to steer the court through these ... pretty rough partisan times\nWithout also just looking like another part if somebody you know\nHow to steer it though 'cause I mean there's a rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice is like you know do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him and steer it\n[laughter] well I I guess a few things I mean there have been times the cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big\nHot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll kind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't\nThat's not the sweeping so that's one way to minimize the court throw a little bit there have been other times and on\nOn issues that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that so you know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for the court and there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some big legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have\nA choice but to take it so so\nCertain things they won't be able to talk about it is a case where the court has almost entirely discretionary docket meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear the you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn\nRoe v Wade for example meat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with him about\nInteresting for speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle tests Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean ah two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name\nAnd now with all of a sudden the the high court is\nUnder this renewed spotlight\nPromoted it when they go through the confirmation process they have something to do this for a little while but then that kind of fades but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar but Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar sort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's is probably easily the most recognizable\nMember of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings\nAgainst like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get back to the judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time\nAny any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice to us I mean if if a new justice Kavanaugh\nTakes very bold stances in cases you know that cutting a strong conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he\nFinds ways to moderate and the end to forge common ground with a with a cross section of people in the court didn't then maybe slowly that that sort of makes things a little better for him\nIt's Brent

was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in ah like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is the company is called the Bateman grew up in the offices in New York and San Francisco and a partner at the company sent out a memo early last\nWeek just outlining the resources and benefits the company had\nTo deal with this uh and and what I call it interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slacker him they had had to set up for the past year\nTo frack room was called ... resistance and it was a police for workers there to really engage in these conversations without talking out loud [noise] so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room\nAnd if they didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees

phone he's take care of him he's the one who pays for salary enough talk about politics here some have taken kind of hard line approach like that\nUm I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see what happens is we can determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps\nUm but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door crying she said it's important for corporate leaders to have\nAn open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there they did have concerns or wanted to talk about politics and then we'll go from there\nHow much of this boils down to gender battles\n[noise] well I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are these are gender issues that but I think that we we heard on", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon
