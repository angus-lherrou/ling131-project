a day on the air and a tick tock on Twitter powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists an analyst and more than a hundred twenty countries I'm pat Carol this is Bloomberg Nathan\nFake iPads are we are live from the Bloomberg interacted brokers studios were six fifty on Wall street time to check what's going on in DC but some of the top stories in our nation's capital include President Trump giving a speech this afternoon on drug pricing at the department of health and Human Services Federal Reserve vice chair which require to discuss is the economic outlook in monetary policy at the Peterson Institute\nA former Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos goes behind closed doors today before the house judiciary and oversight committee is also making news this morning as had mentioned more suspicious packages sent to more places let's skip the very latest now from Bloomberg Washington reporter\nKathleen hunter you we just heard the reports from NBC to Robert De Niro his restaurant and tried Becca is the latest target here and uh you know following a former President Obama former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats uh apparently being targets of these suspicious packages the pattern is\nA tough to mistake here Kate\nDefinitely it seems like a very clear patterns of merging and if anything it seems like the scope of the individuals that are being targeted is is is widening 'em Robert Deniro I was very critical of the president earlier this year and a public forum that in the ward ceremony and I think that you know that\nUm he unlike you know some of the other people who have been targeted or if this turns out to be a similar events\nOn the you know he's he's more you know he's obviously a celebrity an actor and not you know a politician or a former politician or democratic you know major democratic donor like George Soros so it seems almost like the scope but that was being targeted as expanding\nYeah and it has been a fascinating to watch President Trump's reaction to this are calling for unity but at the same time uh putting a bit of an edge on it\nHe did you know it really struck me overall I when I when I saw the quote from his rally last night you know he he called for unity and\nAnd said we need peace and harmony I mean those aren't types of words that we typically hear Trump saying very kind of an champion of him but then you know he did go on to basically say the media shares their responsibility for disseminating what he described as you know I'm sort of the ... will having sort of a hostile tone and raising the\nSort of a level are lowering I'm Sorry the level of civility in public discourse he blamed the media and part for that\nUm so you know we did see Trump kind of come back to be more of what we're used to seeing from Trump and I thought it was interesting that he even asked the crowd last night you know he noted how how uh you know see how kind I'm being this is unusual for me right so even the president I think knowledge that it was a bit of a change in tone for him\nI Wonder I mean it it's probably sounds a little too callous to put it this way but where we are less than two weeks away from the election how could this if at all ah affect the uh the midterms\nWell I think it's hard to separate you know on what's going on right now from the fact that there's major elections coming up you know I think ah\nTo me it just seemed jacks yet another variable into potentially how these elections could shake out um I think you know ... obviously I think everyone is agreed that that you know it's a it's a good thing that\nSo far none of these devices have gone off but you know if if people continue to be targeted or God Forbid if somebody actually is injured you know this could\nReally change the conversation and and you know kind of dominate the dialogue heading into the elections and you know what the impact of that is I think is hard to gauge at this point but it's really just kind of another variable and certainly not you know doesn't reflect well on Republicans ... so you know that's something that I think there are well aware of\nLet's move on to the other breaking news this morning a joint Saudi and Turkish committee has just come out with its finding on the killing of a Saudi journalist ... she'll get inside the consulate dissemble finding now but it it was premeditated how could this play out now\nWell I think that provides on this finding provides another kind of level of clarity on what's been sort of an open question since ... shake it disappeared earlier this month at the beginning of the month several weeks ago now\nAnd I think that this will continue as as several other developments have done to increase the pressure on the u._s. um to respond in some way\nUm and also you know increase the pressure on Saudi Arabia to be more forthcoming about what actually happens\nWe see more clarity a later today as far as what President Trump's response might be a after ... years from CIA director Gina Haspel who's been in the region\nDefinitely and the Washington Post reported that Haspel did hear a taste of on the uh encounter between ... and the ... uh the Saudi official a while and and the Saudis and the consulate\nAnd so on I think that you know that will certainly be probably a topic of discussion in the media I Would assume and there'll be a lot of questions after the meeting about whether or not that in fact that happen\nAre Bloomberg Washington reporter Kathleen hunter thanks as always for these insights on

they believe combines the best of patriotism with progressive bona fides enlisting military veterans to run for Congress in the midterms November six years Wall Street journal reporter bank Kissling who covers veterans issues and what have you found\nThe Democrats' strategy to try to run veterans or the ... or the sheer\nAnd to define folks who could walk that tight rope of being proof on national security issues that being bona fide of their progressive or the rest of the background [laughter] I mean a lot of times that you pee the public and to the ones who who are sort of aligned themselves with the party of the flag and country of patriotism\nBut there's a book to open up and coming crop of recently elected congressional veterans\nWho were sort of shutting the framework to bring other back then and then there's a few dozen veterans running on the on the Democratic side or the vets are seemingly willing to do this\nSo this is a this has been sort of a two fold upper wanders um folks in the Democratic party it said that a veteran that have been approaching a party so we're we're interested in running or in the same time\nThe Democratic party has a has a number of different things that's pretty good place to to welcome back in the party so for instance there's a couple a couple of first term a first term Democrat in the house of representatives to\nPut together fundraising apparatus take a leadership role in the party and ah have a really come out to support that were veterans are coming up behind them in the system\nIs that right is that number correct that there is a hundred and Ninety nine veterans I guess of of all parties who are actually congressional candidates\nThat's right so that's a Republican Democrat independent and any other any other stripe [noise] I'm a a a bipartisan superPAC who supports supports veterans\nFor Congress to pledge that sort of have a to have campaigns that rise above the box you know they don't\nBut I don't want to engage and and and and mudslinging and a and a negative campaigning this group called wick honor and tracking that uh there's nearly two hundred veterans from from both parties and independents ... ... as well as a\nYou know new new candidates is all income but ... there's a lot of veterans that are out there for this mid term a midterm season\nWhile we're speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Ben ... covers veterans issues he's written a piece about how Democrats are trying to win with help from military veteran candidates\nUm there was one analyst or expert or observer and your story you said a military service doesn't necessarily translate to the best candidate for office which seems obvious but what was the point there\nRight well the the point there is that ah with with any military veteran running sometimes the the iconography of a form of learning as a patriot the background and experience of being in the military\nOr can can and I should warn people into being one trick pony so that the military service can become the summer there a couple of parts and right now that's that's a strategy that that some folks are using it there if they aren't veterans themselves in the running inspector him to say hey look yeah well you know like\nUh we we appreciate we appreciate the person service but you know there's there's other qualification there are more important\nAnd very hard to an environment a ... election cycle [noise] um there there are there are observers who are saying but you know the end of the day\nYou need to have the best fit for the best for the congressional district and how close they are going to are they going to shoot at a party line and in some ways that can come back and hurtful short pledging to be independent voices\nYou know maybe they don't have that they don't have a bona fide that are needed to say they're going to work with work with their particular party\nA year when voters oftentimes are are looking for people to align with them politically or whatever but um\nYeah I Know it was anecdotal but I think there was one woman in your story you said that was a ... why she was choosing any particular veteran because he seemed willing to compromise with the other party\nOr the ... the one woman I spoke with that I think illustrates all you know talking to a number of different people said hey I'm really I don't like the partisanship that that that that's happening in the country\nI don't like the direction we've gone I Wish people would talk across the aisle but at the end of the day I Want to make sure my party when so there there there are a lot of voters that I've that I've spoken with to have that\nHave that um have that opinion\nI don't want people to work together and yet I stole my party to win because I think my parties the one that's going to work with the other party", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "25"}
