Hill the Senate banking committee holds a hearing on the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee holds the closed briefing on Russia's role in Syria and the middle east\nMeanwhile the controversy over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's high school and college years continues\nSpring and Bloomberg News washing the reporter Kathleen hunter for more on all of this case we're hearing new information from one of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates a different one from one that we've heard from before what is this classmate saying\nWell this classmate has accounted on an incident that allegedly occurred in Nineteen eighty five that had the same timeframe that we're talking about here in which he described Kavanaugh as having actually instigate at a bar I I'm with someone I I mean I think that\nMight as a significant is that you know it does a paint yet another picture of you know having all those someone who might be aggressive and also might you know a\nB B a heavy drinker um which is something that came up in his nomination in his confirmation hearing last week um as it relates to the actual allegations against them and so I think that you know I think it's a myth again I vote for that reason and also because just inherently it in ... which kind of the picture that\nHave an opportunity to themselves and they are English where the you know a very Judy\nI'm a teenager who you know really just hung out with friends that went to church and you know study and and made it into its study so I think that shows kind of a difference again between how he's portraying himself and how you know other than that I'm\nTrying to of course we heard a Kevin uh repeatedly said he likes beer but a saying that they're pretty much denying that he has a drink to excess and a blacked out in the past it was interesting to hear from President Trump yesterday in the rose garden news conference\nSaying that Kevin ... appeared to have had a little bit of difficulty with alcohol\n[noise] yeah I thought was interesting too and I think it's important to remember that President um you know is\nUm had you know alcohol and then ... and his family and so you know he is\nSomeone who doesn't drink and you know is concerned about you know the damaging that alcohol but I thought it was interesting you know that he noted that and that I'm just from a political standpoint I think it it it raises some questions in my mind about you know whether or not these allegations that I raised are causing Trump adds some doubt now\nHe's not said that really pretty much said pretty firmly behind him but I thought you know given\nHow the president how we know the president views you know alcohol abuse I think that it was up against that he thinks that have it on my that might have a bit of a drinking problem\nYeah it was interesting also to hear that sort of light moment where President Trump said that you know could you imagine if she drank was how\nHow a a what a mess he would be but uh I guess the question is now after hearing from the president of you know perhaps putting a little bit more shading on Kavanaugh's own depiction of his past whether he may have under cut his own nominees testimony before the Judiciary Committee\nI think he definitely did you know I'm I think that whether or not that ends up mattering I'm not sure that it\nNecessarily well as long as ... you know continues to stick with the nominee which all indications are that well um but I Do think that it you know takes away I guess a little bit of the cover that Republicans have had to continue to support cabinet off the president um\nIsn't maybe questioning of bad weather and not everything Kavanaugh I picked it out and thousands actually entirely accurate\nNow which makes you wonder whether this vote that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says is going to happen this week is going to be even tighter than it might have been otherwise\nYeah I think that you know\nIt's not surprising knowing McConnell and how he approaches the things that I met him in like an immediate ... try to work with it that and his strategy all along and I would expect them to it and tell\nYou know that comes in lesser until that becomes an feasible and so essentially what that means is that you know I think he's going to try to put pressure on his Republican senators to vote and support Cavanaugh I'm and do that quickly before you know\nThey have more time to consider it and um before other things may have come out and so I think that's what I Would expect him to continue to do but you know Mitch McConnell's also a very good note counter and so if if he get the sense of the votes aren't there I'm not I think you'll back off his push to have that go forward\nAnd of course this FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's past has to happen quickly as well I think the deadline for that to wrap up is friday even as the White House\nIs saying there aren't any limits as to what the FBI can investigate but when you have a time limit it makes you wonder whether whatever the FBI comes back with by friday is going to have any real impact on the Senate vote\nAnd ... and I think that's kind of been the concern of Democrat and and the question along the Democrats and you know some are probably going to have had I think get back you know\nIf the FBI as you say only has a week to investigate how much are they really going to be able to find out um and also I think you know if ...\nSenators are expected to vote basically immediately upon hearing whatever it is that the FBI does come up with um that doesn't really give them a chance to necessarily digest that information but I think that would be a can of some senators as well\nObviously the Kevin confirmation process dominating what's happening on Capitol Hill and it certainly dominated the presidential news conference at the rose garden which was extensively about this new U.S Mexico Canada\nAgreement can't call it down to any more uh but now the president\nI guess can say that he's made a least a significant move on trade\nYeah absolutely and I think the timing of that is you know particularly good for Trump and the Republicans coming get them on the head of the mid term election matters I think that there hasn't been a concern out there among Republicans that a Chinese retaliatory policy towards the U.S on on\nThe train or that to that Trump is waging in that arena um could have some negative impact on Republican candidate that term election\nAnd so I think that the um the hope now is that you know Trump having gotten a deal on NAFTA or or you know ... point out well how about\nYou know cut again and also will sort of take some of the team added republic out of Democrat argument that you know Trump is so belligerent on trade in Congress problem\nAlways good to talk to your case that sub Bloomberg News Washington reporter

everyone he thought that the FBI should be talking to and it's much cheaper than the FBI is expected to go so\nWhat do we learn the parameters or or Willie publicly learn the parameters\nWell Mitch McConnell wants to go on this nominee this week and so we would expect that and I think Senator Cornyn said that generally and something like this you have to prepare some sort of summary or some sort of thing document and give that to the senator so they wouldn't\nBe able to understand what the FBI founder what their line of inquiry was\nAnd we'd expect that based on Jeff\nFlake not wanting to vote until an investigation with that and we'd expect that to come before the final confirmation vote what we do know is if Mitch McConnell will move to procedural votes but for\nThe final vote and the four there is an investigation about so far the final but we don't feel to it but for the investigation has concluded\nSo what we might get from the FBI is okay here's what we've found based on

court ruled against him a second time\nHe came back and said hey can you can you hear my case again and rule on this one term for all and the court said yes and so his case is one of the ones that we have a pending here for the fall\nAnd just to be clear eyes because the court right now is operating with just eight justices a new justice could join at any time right just because the court just

floating trash collected to try to scoop it up it's a daunting task though the patch includes about one point eight trillion pieces of trash\nAnd ways to eighty eight thousand tons the equivalent of five hundred jumbo jets\nAnd while many scientists say it's great that people are trying to clean up the patch others say most of our efforts should instead go towards stopping the out of control flow of plastic garbage into the ocean is a story by Doyle rice science writer at USA Today soil tells about the patch\nIt's about like the solid mass it's that like a it's not like a thing you can necessarily see from an airplane or from space because a lot of it is just under the surface and it's also a lot of little\nA lot of it it's broken down at a rather small pieces so uh when you think of it it's not like you can't walk on edge and you can't like a you know it's it's not this blob of something that's like a solid by any stretch it's kind of spread out over an area about the twice the size of Texas\nGoodness gracious to do um currents play a role in sort of keeping\nIt all together is in weather patterns things like that\nIt's mainly ocean currents that's the main thing that keeps the thing's going or a ... they're called jai ours is just the scientific term and that's just a kind of a circular pattern swirling around the ocean Abbott and eventually it's kinda like in the bath tub it circles around and around there all the stuff kind of collects in one area\nAnd that's what's happened here that that it's a a gyre that's kind of goes around much of that part of the Pacific just ends up circling together and did this one maps and as I said there's other jai hours in the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic ocean and ah so this is this is one of several around the world well\nWho's responsible for ... for all this mess [noise]\nAnd yeah it's all humans it to you know there was obviously no plastic before the fifties or Nineteen fifties and so basically it's just a\nUh it's just all of us around the world um and dumping plastic not disposing of properly allowing it to just slow out into the ocean\nI'm this particular patch or it's probably mainly uh from Asia or they they they they seem to think that most of the ocean trash is from China\nIndonesia the Philippines a and that's that's kind of been the source for a lot of it the U.S is is somewhat of a contributor I it's not we're not completely blameless but we are overall doing a better job than some of the some of the developing countries around the world\nSo that does it wind up in there if if ... if let's say that China is to blame for a good chunk of this are they actually dumping it in the ocean or they can't process what they have or being sense\nWell yea for quite a while they were happily accepting garbage a plastic garbage from around the world you know 'cause other countries didn't know what to do with it and so we are other countries which ship it to China and that that was something that was well no we would ship them our garbage and our plastic\nAnd for whatever reason we didn't know and really seemed to you know see no evil well you know it's we've ship it there we didn't really know what they did with it well you know could very well be there were just don't make it into the ocean\nAh we we don't know because we don't really ... track that but they have actually China has stopped accepting trash from other parts of the world that was the last couple of years so that that will no longer be a a dumping ground for this plastic\nUh so we're we're other countries are going to have to figure out what to do with it a rather than just dumping China\nWe're speaking with soil rice science reporter at USA Today has ... where did the trash in the great Pacific garbage patch come from\nAnd how do we stop it you quoted somebody in the stories that are ... there were these wonderful cleanup efforts going on a but that's a waste of time largely we need to spend more time figuring out how to keep this stuff out of the ocean\nWas just mentioning that this is a pig to the to the ocean clean up project which is a very noble and nobody nobody saying you
