{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Bob generally are live from the whole bird interactive brokers studios where it is now six fifty on Wall street\nTons of check what's going on in D.C some of the top stories in our nation's capital include\nUs or Canada and Mexico reaching a new trade deals to replace NAFTA the White House denying reports it laid out a narrow ground rules for the FBI's probe uh Brett Kavanaugh and this afternoon President Trump\nPresenting the Congressional Medal of honor let's get more are they using other stories with Bloomberg News Washington reporter Kathleen other Kathleen good morning welcome\nLet's start with the new deal to replace NAFTA or what do we know about how it's different than the prior agreement\nWell in a lot of ways it makes only modest differences which I think is worth noting given that jumped on the campaign trail and says he's been president has really blasted NAFTA\nAnd it always kind of said that a bad deal as as it is not preferable to no deal and threatened to walk away from it so I think it's worth noting that it makes me modest changes but the court does involve improved access to Canada dairy market for us farmers\nStronger intellectual property provisions and tighter rules on on on the origin of the ... the origin of auto production\nOn that's according to to a senior company ministry official so I think that's worth noting that those are some changes that the U.S is going to be touting a politically the Trump Administration is going to be touting politically as being wins for us consumers\nYeah he said he could walk away with no deal but he walks away with a deal and that's that's significant in itself\nAbsolutely I think for Trump who has been so bombastic and so combative on the trade front I think it's I worth noting that are I think it's significant that he was able to strike a deal on NAFTA\nAnd on however though in some ways I think it does politically give him more ... more latitude\nTo be even more aggressive and he has been or ... or to continue his you know sort of come out of approach towards China because he can say you know hey it's not that I'm being unreasonable I look I was able to get the NAFTA deal um and so really you know it gives them some more kind of kind of room to to play on on on the China friend\nOkay let's turn to the FBI's probe of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is this a case of he who controls the investigation uh controls the nominating process we're hearing conflicting reports about just how deep this probe is going to go what's going on [noise]\nYeah so what it sounds like I'm not in dispute is that the pro won't look into you won't include allegations raised by a third woman on who said that um I was at a ... who was the allegations were raised via her attorney Michael ... author present Stormy Daniels those were some of the more lurid\nAccusations that involved kind of a systemic issue by\nWhich he alleged was sort of a gang rape culture on the Kavanaugh was at least tangentially part of um those won't be part of the pro it sounds like it's going to be more focused on specifically lazy forward the allegations and potentially the allegations of Denver mayor as he was a\nClassmate of Kavanaugh's at Yale I think the issue here is that you know I'm the White House has certainly set terms of the investigation and I think that's not in dispute\nI think what the White House is trying to push back against Jerry is the idea that they're going to be really micro managing the investigation as it goes on and I think that's what they're trying to dispute they've said okay we set the terms of this now but we're going to let the FBI do its work and come back to us um but I think the issue there is that when they do come back\nYou know they can ask to investigate more speak to more people and it's a little bit unclear on whether or not the White House would have to sign off on that or whether they could do that on their own\nDoes the appeal I have a particular mission here or a particular question to answer\nI mean I think the idea is that they're supposed to be looking in specifically to um you know broadly uh any issues in Kavanaugh's path that could\nI you know impact his his confirmation now that's how the FBI typically approaches abroad background check but in this specific instance we know that these allegations raised by ... others came after they had already completed their initial background checks so I think that's the sort of mission of this follow up on the investigation is to probe those allegations somewhat\nAnd while we wait for a resolution of Kevin O's confirmation Supreme Court starts a new term today what's on the docket for the eight justices on the high court\nSo they're going to kick it off with on a consideration of the scope of the endangered species act so that should be interesting to watch them and environmental perspective on I think uh\nThere's some more low profile cases there'll be tackling I you know especially given that anything that does end in a tie while there's only a justice was justices would have to be re heard once the ninth justice get cabin are someone else's seated\nOn although that being said from the beginning of the year on there is a gerrymandering case they may tackle on and also a case that involves I buy employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation so there's a kind of some of the highlights to watch during their current term but it's it's going to get off to a bit of a slow start given\nUm which is which is fortunate I guess for Republicans who had really hope to have Kavanaugh seeded by now and it doesn't look like that's going to happen\nAnd finally the White House is wading into energy markets again this time as the president speaking on the phone over the weekend with king Solomon of Saudi Arabia of what exactly did they discuss\n[noise] yeah so this is after Trump has repeatedly you know slammed OPEC and um what was interesting to me about this is at Al Arabiya the middle eastern a\nTV station had more details really than what the White House is willing to release said the White House basically just said that they were discussing issues are elements in that in a in the region whereas on it sounded from the other end like what was being discussed out more specifically was how to maintain stability a price stability in the oil market to so it's interesting that Trump\nUm I think people are on the lookout for some kind of a maybe guidance I'm where what might come up all this but it sounds like you know at least Trump is is talking directly with the kingdom and I think that's worth noting for sure given his criticism of of OPEC in the past\nBloomberg

should be mid term elections approach America's electronic voting systems are more vulnerable than ever what's being done to fix them we're joined now by cyber security journalist Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times and what kind of security do we have\nIt's really what I Would refer to a band aid security there were really not in um much of a different shape than we weren't together sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aid by what's what's what's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's that ... prior to that extent it reached out to the states and it I'm offered the scanning service that it does\nUm what this means is it simply will scan the Internet facing system so these are the um\nThe server at like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line the jets will do the remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability is better knowing that we know about that I'm also have a ...\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and\nI'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis defeat when the um the customer has and patch that system so they did that to a few states before um the to the ... and then they've done that to more states are more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it getting at only the Internet they think system could not getting at the core back in ... [laughter] they're supposedly not connected to the Internet about getting at the voting machines at all not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's also not touching um water the election management systems and these are the system that sit in a county headquarters a there used to program their voting machines and they're also you to tabulate the vote so these are actually the most critical instance not the Internet they think that the\nOkay so if you're if you're an average voter do you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence where are you saying there are there are some doubts about whether or not we could be hacked\nThere has always been the possibility for our elections isn't the act as a court glitz going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want motors to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the back in\nA state and county need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail either a paper ballot the voter filled out or they have the machine produce paper trail\nI mean they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't though\nWho you point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\n'em yet so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots that did all those can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other idea Nate optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets Canada machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um states the county election officials are looking at that paper after the election is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cyber security journalists also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got to be running in the New York times titled the crisis of election security how we get so vulnerable\nOh we got vulnerable because of a reaction to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential election\nIn that case I'm sure everyone recall the dangling Chad while you're um that that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington DC decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that were the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount and so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh his thumb and many states I'm over reacted and went to system that didn't have any papers at all\nAnd that's how we got the more we have

had made loans they thought would never to faults and repackage them into securities to make them seem risk was\nWith time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from ... is chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how to use it\nWe've got to ... basically because uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk weather was bankers who\nThought that the loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes and never decline and price\nThey essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and we as individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by limiting are exposure risk whether it's in regulations or attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts sort of crises but it's been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting so you you wrote household and investors are much ... of risk what's the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be the year we'd build one and a half million new homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and there are several reasons for that one is that while I'm\nAsian countries so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages such a limited it can buy a house I and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitate to make cuts\nEither commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess does that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand of the crisis and they've kind of learned to sort of like be more cautious they're investing\nAnd so we see an investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted you don't have as many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know he used to turn to a home equity loan to start your new business are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do\nSure you have your job bagels here and you realize there but it really kind of the exception you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley what people want is to not start the next Google or Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook\nThe level of new businesses being formed because actually historically quite low I think it's troublesome I mean essentially a people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nKnown for speaking with Greg it chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk\nFor a while so you mentioned it before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or that aren't related\nI think it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bowl mark markets climb a wall of worry that if they say if everybody pessimistic there is nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices are down you don't have a lot of people ...\nAnd fell into that so in some sense that some of them is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nAnd that is similar for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy project she left like if he got busted a recession\nNow that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well and some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off [laughter]\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances but about which that rich start to grow and if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis\nBut you know risk there but kinda like goes away that sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill\nAnd counter the barrier tried to find a way around it and and we hear happening now some of the risky types of loans that banks will make like to like heavily companies those are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds [laughter] so you in some sense skill at risk out there is just informed that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence

sons brothers pressured the women in their lives to vote like they do that is what former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is hinting\nAnother explanation she recently gave us the reason for her last Donald Trump and twenty sixteen more from Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard who says her comments bring up the debate about voting by mail versus showing up in a private boost in a place like a school Eric set this up\nIt's one of those things where to the extend it happens at all it's a threat to you know basic democracy and we have a system that works where you can't have that kind of bad kind of anecdote happened at all everybody's got a perfect privacy when they're in the voting booth\nPeople don't have perfect privacy when they're voting by mail so why would you want to switch from the voting booth to voting by mail that convenience factor to me does not outweigh the risk of even one person being denied their honest to vote\nAnd Mrs Clinton I I think made it sound like women or weaken powerless that times when it wants to this stuff\nYou know there may be some abusive or men out there who take it out on on the women in their lives if they don't vote the way they want and a ... to the extent that that happens even if it's just a few instances it's we're protecting against by going to the ballot box um\nAnd as as for\nThe general notion that women are too weak to stand up for themselves so I think you're you're spot on that most women in our lives um have a good sense of self centered willing to stand up for themselves to\nSpeak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard I'm Still the ballot box is not always convenient is that the argument for the mail in ballots or this is it's an effort to get more participation\n[noise] well you know it's actually been an effort in in large part to get more participation because of making it convenient but in particular I'm making it more convenient for liberal voters\nOn this has been a question by the left to get a ... vote by mail because so much of their effort to turn on turning out the vote\nAnd they can go and make sure everybody gets their mail in ballot and take a lot of time when when there's a whole laying on a given day at a given polling place there's only so many fans you can send out to get people to the party who\nUm but vote by mail gives you the opportunity to get more usually I'm liberal constituencies to vote\nFor him to turn out the vote a ... is more important to Democrats aren't there more registered democratic voters\nTurning out the vote one way or another generally helps\nUm democratic candidates\nI'm In part because a lot of what that would be um democratic candidates rely on our get out the vote effort\nUm and there's only so much you can do when there's one voting day but if you have a month or two months of voting by mail\nI'm available you can turn out a lot more of the voters who will be discouraged to vote by inconvenient should show that more convenient you can make it more likely you are to get\nVoters to turn out who are otherwise that deterred by inconvenient ...\n... ... uh I don't I don't think I've heard pushback on this through with regards to these comments from Mrs Clinton is is\nThis like a fairly new excuse or is this one that she's been using\nYou know to the point was Hillary has been making this excuse for why she lost\nAnd I kind of connected the dots with\nThe vote by mail because\nShe was not making the claim that vote by mail is responsible um but I didn't connect the dots in the sense that if there are any women who are being pressured to vote one way or another the only way they could possibly be actually pressured is if they don't have the secrecy of the ballot box available to them\nAnd combine that
