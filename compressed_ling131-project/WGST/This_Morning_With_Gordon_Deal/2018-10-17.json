young and attractive heat they say he looks like Kennedy and talk like Obama\nI'm hearing a boatload of money and people really thought that that race might him play\n'em in retrospect at John out that didn't really come that close to the only four point\nUm but it was not in the race that Democrats thought that they might have been that district um and there was just the galloping enthusiasm for this candidate um that is stunning term any a lot of better order a very similar candidates I'm very similar dynamics in those races and so\nI'm as Democrats are running toward work and so absolutely unbridled in there and do them about this guy I wanted to get tax breaks and say we thought it made me very recently and it might have the kind of thing\nTo do those um [noise] I don't know these comparisons wind up being distracting for these candidates like a you know maybe the the simple Boulder is more likely to say oh yeah I heard he looks like so and so or sounds like so and so I have no idea what he stands for the like the I just thought I'm just wondering what does that hurt\nYou know I don't I don't think it helps in the long run for these candidates and somebody like um Beto O'Rourke is a really he's a really strong candidate and his own white and he's a congressman from the area\nI'm In LA been there for many generations he went to Columbia He was on but I'm at the council a better qualified very dynamic um but when you have the dynamic that has the marsh there is that national recorders out\nAnd as we can do a sort of get in to the state or the district meet the guy right and very growing profile\nI'm a new situation for Democrats is incredible strength with online fundraising um national profile tend to eat in the feedback loop with literal liberal activists around the country I'm In the profile of a work the him compared to Kennedy you actually do like a lot like Robert Kennedy you can't help that\nUm but it makes them a little bit of a short hair you know that you know he's looking at ... but what else is there there's a lot more to him but I think that um that getting this kind of enthusiasm and tension and I'm an expectation really start to weigh a candidate down on when you get to this point in the campaign\nOr speak with Patricia Murphy columnist at roll call about her piece titled is Beto O'Rourke the next Jon Ossoff what was the point you made through about a week and the giant when it comes to fund raising\nShirt bearing a with turn off that I talked to a lot of his staff members that after the race they want they raise thirty million dollars [laughter] special election and they're in a\nDistrict that typically get set out one million dollars tops for you know for any candidate um and again at the very it was that if the Republican district there's just no question that there are just more Republicans and Democrats air\nBy raising the enormous sums of money that really drew attention to the race from national cans so in a race where maybe I'm also could have come in and quietly had erase that go to a took\nRepublican by surprise maybe they wouldn't have spent so much money maybe they wouldn't have\nBut just on old field offices into that district\nRepublicans but not remotely taken by surprise by Don Knotts house they were ready for him they were spending money against them they were attacking him I'm just

[noise]\nPredictions are very dangerous but if you were to take a snapshot today it looks as if the picture's improving somewhat for Republicans\nDemocrats probably still have the or in a good cause or should take back control of the house [noise] um because a lot of those house races are playing out the swing races are playing out of the suburban\nDistricts where they're Democrats are stronger or where the college educated suburban women I've become a very strong democratic constituency so they seem to be in a good position to take that\nControl the house but at the same time\nRepublicans look as if they're in better shape to keep control of the Senate or in some measure because the Republican base was very unhappy with the way Brett Kavanaugh was treated as a Supreme Court nominee and that has kind of energized\nThe Republican base and reminded them that they like having Republicans pick and confirm judges and so\nAh the balance in the Senate will be determined in a bunch of red states where there's a lot of pro Trump support and so\nYou're going to have it you could very well end up with a picture of a divided Congress and Democrats thinking that they uh have one they are a national vote in essence the same way they did when I went and won the popular vote\nTwenty sixteen but don't have a very big hold on political power if they said we have one half of Congress and so\nThat's a that's a recipe that is probably going to produce um obviously divided government has a hard time getting things done and it's a continuing democratic anger at their position within the political system\nStarts so there's no for example uh [noise] so I'm no lessening of the divide because the Democrats let's say when the house and Republicans maintain control of the Senate because there's more balance I mean\nWell you know if that's possible and in order a couple of issues interestingly trade maybe one actually may be some common ground you know there are a lot of Democrats who are\nCloser to President Trump on trade and his use of tariffs and um basically challenging allies on trade issues of some Republicans are Republicans have tended to be more free traders [laughter] so you may actually have a slightly bigger\nBalance of support for the president I'll trade in a in a divided Congress but on most issues and particularly on health care it's going to be very hard to get something done 'em and I think you're going to have a ... if he if Democrats do in fact take back control of the house there's going to be inevitably pressure from the Democratic base to begin\nInvestigations of various um activities in Trump world including potentially a re revisiting the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh but also having a look at some\nFinancial dealings with the president and the aftermath of a mall or in investigation and so you're definitely going to have a more confrontational atmosphere in Congress or if there is democratic control of what House\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry side\nHe's written a piece about how the election is unlikely to end the political divide that we're seeing\nYou're up to that a ... and I want to ask to be forty incumbent House Republicans who are vacating their seats with the feeling about a democratic wave be different if the ... the majority of those forty we're sticking around\nI think it would be I mean I think it's a big deal a you know some of it it's actually more than forty depending on how you count so it's a big number and you know I saw some of those are the Republican incumbents were going to be in trouble in this environment anyway so they you know got out while the getting was good\nSome of them probably could have better defended their seats than a newcomer can answer that opens the door all the wider for Democrats is actually I think one of the unappreciated factors\nIn in this campaign is the amount of open space Republican retirements left for Democrats to move in and one of the interesting things that's happened in one of the reasons Democrats feel good about house races is that these democratic challengers in swing districts where there's an open seat or Republican U.S left\nBut by and large well funded this time they've managed to raise a lot of money um there is a very active democratic financial support network now a lot of small donors a lot of it's on line\nAnd so you have not only democratic challengers who are facing an open seat that they have a chance to win in a swing district as well financed democratic challengers are trying to open seats by and large and and that again is a different situation than you would see in a more normal a midterm election year", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning
