{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "With the twenty percent requirement also somebody had asked about um appraisals and and the initial appraisal and so forth that are kind of alluded to it as inspections um\nKeep in mind when an appraisal done um it it's either done as what's referred to as as is meaning that here's the value of the home the way that it stands now or you get an appraisal that comes back is referred to as subject to meaning that here's the value of the home but it's subject to this this this and this being completed\nSo new construction when you do the initial appraisal you're going to get that subject to\nOf course subject to the rest of the house being built and finished um and they'll do multiple appraisals and inspection due out that process to make sure that the value is remaining the same as well as you know to give the the buyer and the client kind of the warm and fuzzy to know that everything is still on track so I wanted to kind of give some of that clarification as well\nUm you\nMelissa wanted me to talk a little bit about some of the financing options you know it's kind of a weird dynamic when you do new construction because unless you're buying one of the spec houses that you alluded to before\nYou're buying a place and you don't have a place to live right off the bat right correct yes yeah so a lot of people own occurring home and they don't want to sell necessarily off off the bat\nLet's just say because they're not going to have a place to live and they don't want to necessarily rent\nYou can tap into that equity of your current home to use that as the down payment for some of this product and then when the homeless completed once we do to take out refinance as we talked about before if you're in line to sell your current home\nYou're in a position to kind of even pay down that low and a little bit more and use the remaining equity that you had in your house by the time that you end up selling it\nYes absolutely so that's been great um key\nFactor that really helps the decision making process for some of these fires because like you were saying they don't want to rent a place they don't want to sell their house and be homeless for several months\nAnd with it taking us eight months to build these houses they are just wanting to be educated on the different options that they might have out there so I think you know having some great loan officers that I work with ... you know being able to educate them on their different options has been very helpful\nYeah and I think you know people have become kind of more accustomed to that as well you know we're in a real estate market right now where people are selling their houses before they even find a new home to buy\nSo this type of thing might have been a lot more scary for the average everyday homebuyer years and years ago but I think we're experienced it now to where it's actually become part of the norm so I think the comfort level for those people will kind of be uh going up some as well\nScott let's talk about red barn real estate in general real quick you know kind of what your plans are what you're thinking about what the company\nYeah no I mean we we've got big plans for sure I mean we we want to grow in you know the Atlanta market Georgia market for sure I mean we're looking at some out of state things as well to 'em again like I said I mean we we built this hybrid and and what we wanted to do was we want to take the good parts of a team\nAnd give little pieces of the team to agents that need that so\nLots of agents whether they're big producers or their brand new to real estate you know at times they one leaves they won't consistency they want things that you know we can offer in the brokerage so\nBiggest thing for us as I mean we are a production based brokerage so we're looking for agents that want to make a career out of this we're not looking for fantasy agents were not looking for people that just kind of want to do it on the side here and there\nI'm In one of the things I talk to my parents about all the time is\nYou know we want to come along side down to make them successful in day dictate what successful is so I've got agents that want to do twenty million a year as successful I've got other agents that are happy at a million or two million for sure so we just want to be able to take our resources everything that we have to offer from\nCoaching been touring to our lead share program\nI'm In kind of put that out there to help the agents just be successful for sure\nWell and what that means for the the buyers and sellers and the people that you're working with is that you don't have that it's real estate agents that are doing and this is sort of side hobby because that it it's extremely difficult\nThere's a lot of moving parts in these transactions and if you've got people that got radio silent for eight hours a day because they're they're in another job uh it it does make it extremely difficult I I feel badly for real estate agents one of my favorite means is thank God it's friday await our real estate [laughter]\nYou know so because it does feel like you have to be available for that eight hours a day and again as we said earlier in the shadow than at a pie and that's when all of the like urgent stuff starts to happen\nUm but you really do need to give someone the assurance that when they see that broke raged they know that you've got professional fulltime people that are doing this yeah this is their living this is their job is to protect the buyers and sellers\nYeah and and to me I mean it has to be I mean our industry is a whole I mean\nWe need to be looked upon as professional and so that's the biggest thing at our brokers that we want to make sure that our agents were being professional to consumers out there um you know it's not a game does I mean it is here it's just the biggest purchase and sale that most people are going to be involved and\nThere is always joke I say you can learn a lot about people when adversity and money is involved\n[laughter] we get it off and on\nAnd so I had I mean I came out of the corporate world into real estate um was a sales guy put out a lot of fires and problems and uh I did not realize the time and emotion that went in to each one of these deals\nSo being that I'm not in production anymore and I'm supporting my agents I see it at thirty thousand feet now which is a super cool place to be sitting here watching it\nBut understand emotions I sympathize for the clients I mean you know it is just when somebody's houses on the market a week for us flies by for them it is like so slow and they are going crazy\nYeah so you know I think emotions it it's so important to talk about 'cause you're you're talking about from the south side of things and you're exactly right because most people aren't selling\nJust to move in an apartment they're selling for a reason they're going to buy something else they've got to get out of this place and get to a different town or send\nA life changing event yeah but there was a motion on the other side as well I mean you know if you're buying a new house you're buying what you want to be you know something that you've been visions and something that you you you've dreamed up your whole life for a lot of first time homebuyers this is you know this is the American dream I guess in a certain sense\nYou know how do you handle that emotion on the ...\nMan will and you just mentioned first time homebuyers and let me tell you I mean when I was the first time homebuyer life with a lot easier there was lots of options out there I could kind of pick and choose I mean I remember called my realtor and going out on a Saturday we could see eight or nine homes and that could be picky to days first time homebuyer I feel horrible for I mean\nIt is such a competitive market and the price range that most of them are looking up against investors they're up against caster ... up against a lot of challenges and\nYou know they get to see one house at a time and it is like as soon as they ... they're calling the age of the agents taken him immediately because if they don't\nIt could be off the market and it's starting to slow a little bit and it's starting to get a little bit more you know in line with where where it should be but you know for the first time homebuyer man I just I feel sorry for him I mean it is not a fun game that I got to do when I first bought my house\nYeah our our months of supply we had new ... new reporting that came out in the last week and and it is certainly it is still on the ... even though it's you know we're trying to me than the right direction for this uh but also finding you know the Wright houses in the right price ranges as Ben and an extreme struggle in our city\nMelissa clay new home sales specialists red barn construction and Scott Martin now managing

booth recently on ... now\nWearing a make America great again hat wearing it everywhere and he was wearing it today and it it's really funny in the oval office I just kept thinking\nThis is so unusual because a Donald Trump is not the most puzzling figure sitting here in the oval office today and he was out the most talkative person in the oval office if it's sort of a monologue from Kanye West he was also not the one burying the make America great again hat so it's very weird\nIt was so interesting watching the video because the president sitting behind a desk and he has his hands class and

rumors and raining down some of the top stories of the week\nDon't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] one of the most dramatic stories of the week was the story of the U.S astronaut and the Russian causes but not\nThat had to make a dangerous ballistic re entry into the earth's atmosphere after that are ... rocket failed and they were on a mission to go to the international space station\nAnd two minutes into the flight or something happened one and the second stage of the boosters something failed and they had to abort mission and returned back\nThe only way we can get to the international space station right now is by using these Russian rockets these soy use rockets to get up there to cramped little thing they're old\nUh we're waiting for these new rockets to be able to take us up there from space acts and Boeing um and it's kind of a little below to this troubles Russian space program\nIt's the only thing that gets us up to the international space station so for more on this we turn to rod pile he's a space historian he's a science writer he's an author he knows everything you need to know about space and space exploration you can check out all his stuff it piled books dot com\nAnd we just started off by asking them for more details on this crazy story\nThis was a flight as you said a woman astronaut when us as not one cause not go up the space station and they're in the Soyuz\nSpacecraft which also writes up on a rocket I'm the same name\nThat was going up and they're supposed to swap out for a couple of crew members are already up the space station or we're gonna come back\nNow the space station always has a Soyuz capsule attached up there just in case so that they get out of jail free card if they need to come home at an emergency but the official seal of approval on that are coming home expires in mid December so I really needed this one to come up and swap out the crew\nOr not there's a tour down and didn't\nSo apparently what happened is it made it through about two minutes of flight staging per se just second stage and what I can tell and if you look at the video of it there's some kind of odd\nDetritus falling off the rocket looks almost like silver glitter from a distance I don't think that normally have derived aging but it's been a long time since I've looked at that tells you that it might have been something going on with\nWhat are the engines but at any rate that's strictly conjecture what we do know is that something happened at staging either an engine failed to ignite or what I've read more recently is that the first stage to drop pre properly\nSo for one reason or another they had to abort\nNow the rockets designed to be able to do that\nAnd they all have been since the early space age both on our side and the the Soviets except for our space shuttle which really didn't have it aboard auction until much later and when you abort your ground control punch was a big red button and a capsule let's go for the top of the rocket and fires a smaller set of rockets up above the capsule which are extremely\nPowerful and just burn curfew seconds if you're an astronaut inside that thing\nAnd you hit the abort but it's like getting slammed with a block of concrete right in the face\nThey said they were forced to do a lipstick reentry what exactly does that mean and because they said that during that stuff that they did have crewmembers can face a G forces ten times greater than that of what's going on in her\nIt's rarely more than eight but it's still a lot and even in a normal ... year to look at it maybe four or five but each one is significantly more so\n... means that this is what they did in the very early space age days back and mercury and\nThe boss stock on the Soviets I'd normally when a space capsule comes back in\n... a little bit it's almost like the space shuttle in a way the shield is designed in such a way and the and they use guidance rockets to ... themselves so that kind of glide back a little sideways and the heat shield so it's kind of this Shiloh gradual reentry that gives you four to\nFive sometimes six cheese a ballistic ... means you've got up over the top of the arc that whatever speed you had goes away and then you come back straight down like a bullet in because you're not ascribing up any of that energy by moving sideways you're generating a possibly nine jeeze which is a lot\nThe U.S astronaut Nick hey it was his first mission whatever ride and what a crazy turn of events for him\nWhat a rotten that no no and they showed some video the fat and at the point that whatever happened happened it started I guess the rock star to vibrate significantly you can see these two guys and their hands are flap on around like they're trying to learn how to live and it's really it's almost comical but realize it was a top ride this\nNormally that doesn't happen so they're really they said there there were weightless at one point even before they hit the panic buttons so cut out\nNo other way now these are rushing saw you spacecrafts generally they're pretty reliable is whenever I said I Know they've had a couple of problems here and there but can you comment on that and then also talk about the new fleet of things that are happening 'cause SpaceX has a capsule
