{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "And um that you just need this house and nothing else matters because you lose your negotiation power ... watching I never even thought about that yeah oh I ... and we do have we have up there there are a series of brochures that\nThe George association of realtors puts out to help buyers and sellers\nAnd we rewrite those things every year and we add things too and we added lead based paint this last year because obviously that was like a Detroit thing\nBut um but we also added the alert because every state law can be a little bit different so if you've got to buy her coming in from another state even if they have heavily researched what the surveillance laws are in that state which I don't know what they're doing\nUm you know once you come to once you come to Georgia the the rules maybe a little bit different so in in some states you can you can only you know it's video or audio\nOr vice versa or you have to have you know you have to have a party consent or things like that but George is a very a property right owner rights said we take our rights to ownership extremely seriously in our great state of Georgia\nWhich means that in Georgia if you're in my house um you're no expectation of privacy whatsoever I can use audio and video surveillance I can type it I can watch it live and and I absolutely positively would\nAnd and you know some people feel like that's an invasion of privacy but you're in my house I got to be really on it\nAnd it's something you know if something comes up missing or damaged or there's a fall inside of the house there's all sorts of liability and risk of lost that I take on when I allow strangers in my house and I'm not there and I am not one of the sellers who sits there and watches the buyers as they come through the house like I think they should have\nYou know the ability to look at it without a seller staring at them so\nI Know it'd be difficult to prove but are are there any ramifications if it can be documented that the solar used some of the surveillance to affect their negotiations with the buyer\nNo because they have the right to record it or anything that they here it's like over hearing a conversation in public it's the exact same thing so they can use it in their negotiation set of Christians point sometimes you can give away your negotiation position from the standpoint of your overly excited and exuberant and very vocal about it\nI'll be eating also go the other way you can just take a seller off because you've made fun of you know some dated wallpaper that's in one of their rooms or you know how they keep their house or you know at the picture of one of their children that's on the mantle or whatever you say\nI'm into Christians point earlier on that sellers can make emotional decisions and they just decide they don't like you\nSo poker face it's kind of like you know old school going to buy a car we're used to do these negotiations face to face I guess now with the surveillance you've got to have the book or faces a buyer of a house as well\nAgain like nine definitely complement something when you go and just so the person doesn't think you're [laughter] you're just like in their house like what is your job to walk around with your finger over your outlook I did I can or guard that's what I Do before we walk and just to remind clients again that hey we don't know if there's any surveillance in here like\nKeep a casual say hello you know than like the cabinets or whatever but just don't don't give your position away interesting what are some of the other things that I think buyers need to be focused on at this point I mean what does it look like for them [noise]\nUm I think the great thing is a joys are much Homer associations are much healthier now but that's still something that um people need to be careful be careful up with an mindful of with town homes or condos are there any assessments coming up and that they're really asking the questions about the ... health\nBecause the last thing you want to do is moving to a place and then get assessed with some ten years that's meant for however much a month well\nAnd you know again you go back to why you need a real estate agent who's actually thinking about that because I you know I don't think all of them really do quite frankly\nAnd you're more issues with condos in town homes because you've got there were periods of time in the during the the market melt down that we had where everyone in the condominium had no water because it was one ... you know one water meter in and it was a a an association paid water bill and there were not enough people paying their condo dues\nAnd so every a hundred percent of the people in the building Heather water shut off seeing it can get serious\nAnd remember to from the lending side of things you know on a smaller downpayment loans were going to do a ... exam on that homeowners association answer your financing is going to be contingent on the health of the major ways you discuss with larger down payments were going to do with streamline one but it's still going to be you know an investigation into the health of the H away\nSo you know from a wedding perspective if you're talking to them even if they love the absolute you know condo and and and and have to have it no matter what and you talk to them about you know potential pitfalls of ... will come in right behind that and make sure that it's in good situation or good condition in order to get financing\nOrder and ... that's one of those times when when all of the due diligence that you guys are doing are really probably protecting some buyers that may not be protecting themselves with with real due diligence on their part\nAnd I patrol bar worried about all the time that are looking or condos you know they get very upset when we have an issue with the homeowner's association and I'm like listen you everybody works on to the actual ... worth protecting ourselves because we're financing the collateral which is ... ... condo where the home or whatever but it's for your protection as well I mean if you've got an ...\nSure way that as half of the people sixty days behind on their age ... a venture we that's going to trickle down to you if nobody pays that so it's for the for the clients protection as well\nYeah yeah and a lot of that a lot of the H always you know had to dig themselves out of a little bit of a whole because I'm the lender doesn't you know if the lender foreclosed on a property they're all of the ... at that point are probably going to get wiped out so that are are going to get wiped out\nAnd probably about it so the condo just took an absolute financial loss and the only thing they can do is go back and track down in Sioux a seller who had just lost their property to foreclosures that's all a losing effort for the most part\nUm you know and then the lender would start to pay from the data foreclosure forward\nBut uh but to your point I think that most of the neighborhoods and the condos and all of these areas are probably pretty good shape based upon the number of people that are coming to closing and called houses are getting rebuilding pools are getting improved upon I Know they've ripped our stuff to the ground\nStance or on the ... there'll be getting this assembling these packages an attempt to trace them back to their fender and so now they're going to try and see whether the constructor of the single pipe bomb whether they left them sort of\nThing that chart whether they left some sort of air in the wiring and maybe that was sort of their trade so there are a lot of clear that investigators now have to put together they just have a big puzzle ahead of them\nAnd we learned a little bit more about the devices themselves they said they were made out of PVC pipe covered with black tape beach I like a small battery some wires maybe some broken glass for maximum damage but is there anything else that they've told us about these devices specifically\nAuthorities have been releasing very new details about the ...
