big deal\nWell lenders you know ... before closing lenders are going to call and verify your employment usually twenty four to forty eight hours before you close to make sure you added quit your job and you can still qualify and we happened to call the day of and you know he doesn't work here anymore why he's sitting at the closing table\nUm and you asked me so well no I got a new job what's the problem\nWell you know Cheryl jobs here he would say the closing attorney kind of put the pen down\nFederal let you guys discuss and I'll let me know if you need me\nUm you know the the lesson is communicate with your with your professionals your your real estate partner your your lender or the earlier the better you can have communication we're able to closes loan I wasn't a big deal that just took a couple more days um\nBut it was a big deal for him and his family right because they were planning on moving over the weekend at all those got other things and there was one of those where if you just wouldn't let us know a week ahead of time\nNo big deal at All right but here we are at this big moment of your life go oh my God this is this is going to be a big deal so um\nYou know we we've all had these stories in the industry for for years of we're going to tell the ones we're allowed to tell all their names with how do we have to protect the innocent um but it's still aren't right so ... what's your ...\nAh my latest oh [laughter]\nI'm In LA back again gene ballet was on I was representing the seller and buyer and transaction Andy buyer closed on a home they sold their home in another state we're closing on a Monday at eleven am a ...\nAnd just following up within that learning just a quick hey see a little bit and making sure they knew when they were going she just commented I verified the wires and the wires had come in shape but there was a strange little extra five thousand dollars wired\nAnd she goes oh yeah that was a big deal the taxes are messed up we didn't get all the money from closing so which is why it's money from another account\nSo I said okay thank you very much hung up and immediately called my local Linda we're working with and my lender was amazing and pulled a rabbit out of the hat 'cause normally that would make a transaction context screeching halt for at least a couple of days to verify the Fonz [noise]\nBut um we were able to come to the closing at eleven AM and know what was the wiser so it really helps to have partners you're working with throughout the transaction um but that is a very big deal funds are always verified\nYeah the the game of hide and seek these days does not work well in the lending business right we're not two thousand and four anymore where we didn't verify anything or ask for any documentation and we clearly saw the results of that we nearly\nMelted the economic world so you know things are a little different we verify everything and so that trail that Tracey at all of that has to be verified and as you said usually it's not a problem it's the communication the local knowledge\nAnd uh it was their money they didn't do anything wrong it's just an account they had not put down as we're funds were coming from for the closing\nAnd I you know you brought up something and this was really more specific to this time and it just it it came off when you said at wires and show you might be able to even talk about this there's wire fraud out there going on right now the buyers and sellers need to know about where people are going into email accounts\nSending what looks like an email from a closing attorney or maybe a real estate agent saying oh something's changed on your closing Here's New information new and here's where to send money\nFictitious money's gone disappears to God Knows where um and it's a big deal people are losing get lots and lots of money so she could you because you've probably seen it the most\nDo um and we will probably do an entire segment on it at that point because there's a lot there um but uh it it happens a lot so with a firm of our size we see one every week or two where someone has tried in a transaction involving are from\nIt's usually the actual parties email or the realtors unfortunately the realtors email usually the closing attorneys and the lenders are dealing with a little bit more secure systems for communication some of them unfortunately are not\nUm but most are I Will say that the one\nIn that people really need to pay attention to is that they're sending money they need to make sure that the account they're sending it to matches that closing attorney that they're supposed to be using because a lot of times the buyer money coming to us when it's intercepted the account they're sending it to makes no sense it it's an individual's name at something crazy\nOr the other thing is that if you're a seller and you want your proceeds wired which a lot of our sellers do if you're getting five six figures and proceeds it's just easier for you to get that wire just come to closing and bring the copier checkbook which you bring a copy of the wire instructions to not email these things around do not\nDo not have the impression that anything in your email account is actually secure because it used to be that when people ... account they would spam all of the people in your contacts that's not what they do now they sit in your account and they read all of your communications\nThey know enough about the transaction to pretend to be you and to communicate with the other parties\nAnd and to redirect money so don't bring it for us for our from we have a secure upload that's in the signature line of our emails so that people can just send things to securely\nWe don't want your Social Security numbers going out the e mail we don't want your PIN code it's for your bank accounts we don't want your banking account we don't want any of those things going through email and also pick up the phone and call people if something doesn't feel right\nCommunicate to me and I have to get ... I you know I I just thought of it when Kelley was talking about wires out port that's been but I I agree Cheryl maybe next week we we talk about that 'cause it's a big deal absolutely um [noise]\nSo you know we're wanted out our first show a blast hopefully our listeners uh enjoyed uh some of the information we're able to show hopefully somebody picked up on a tip or two that makes them better by or a better seller make better decisions I'm Kelly were working folks fondue what's the best way to track you down a\nBest way to go to the Atlanta find homes dot com website and you can just type in Kelly trash and you'll just pop right now will pop right up 'cause you're a pretty big deal I mean I you know I'm a ... yes [laughter] shell somebody's thinking about the property taxes are talking about are the wires or you know how can they find you guys and you're from what's the\nBest way to attract younger uh we are s K W our law dot com we are on Facebook we're on Twitter we are on Instagram ... all of the other good things [noise]\nUm if you if you Google my name you'll actually get made you might want to put it land there apparently there's some fancy designer out there somewhere who has my name as well\nUm but feel free to to reach out to us we're there to help and uh also just wanted to to give a little shout out to our veterans ... weekend this weekend so\nIf he dies because of harsh interrogation techniques let's just say that's just something pretty serious it's not like they\nWere probably the questionnaire and all this takes about step further and where the body\nOne of these people that apparently went in had a bone saw that's why they think that he was dismembered and the president has made that Saudi Arabia one of our allies in that area the reports are that\nJared Kushner is very close friends with the crown prince also and you know they're trying to open up the area to business and things like that so I don't know if it would put a halt to it but it would really severely impact what's going on there\nAnd it was extraordinary than I Am I'm being told oh that like inside idea right if people are a bit frustrated with it because they're saying the Saudis have stayed with the United states has so many different things we cooperate with them on every level why should this one\nGuy this one incident it's got all all that and there's no indication of the ... to by any means and that relationship with I mean it's not even I don't think any administration wouldn't ... over over this\nBut you have to remember it's not just any other opinion writer jealous I mean this has very prominent he knew people in many many people in the U. S. foreign policy community he broke for a very powerful newspaper council you know frankly like when it comes down to it often when you have a single face\nOr single name that often captured the imagination of the public for more than when you say a thousand people were killed today in this war you know [laughter] so it becomes very emotional issue I Know members of Congress are very very upset about this on both sides I mean they're really mad\nAbout this and we're still waiting for any type of evidence they're saying that turkey might have a lot of evidence but they're not sharing any of it just yet and works\nOr not the most reliable ... either they have to be really out of everything that\nA lot of people are making something out of her show jeeze apple watch saying that he set it up to record and it went back to the cloud into his iPhone which is fiance had and there might be some type of recording of what that interrogation sounded like yeah\nBut the other theory on that is that turkey want that story out there because they don't want to admit that they have the Saudi conflict wired\n... foreign affairs correspondent for Politico thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me\nThere has been a ton of developments since that interview that we did with in the hall that kind of sets up with the whole story is about after that Turkish officials were leaking all sorts of stories to the media part of it was they said they had an audio recordings of what happened inside the Saudi conflict\nThey said that Mr ... was dead within minutes and within two hours\nOf the killers were gone there said there was a Fifteen person\nHit team that went in there Miranda tell us what some of these gruesome details or because\nIt plays like a spy movie all this secret shady stuff happening in these political constantly as you know it's crazy the secrecy that happens in there that they think that they can get away with this kind of stuff what are some of these details of how they say he died\nYeah and like you said there were Fifteen people waiting for him for hours to show up and they knew what they were going to do they have this all planned out from the beginning and like you said he was dead within minutes they separate his fingers and cut his head off\nAnd asked they cut off his head and dismembered his body there was a doctor a forensic who had been brought along so that he could assist with the ... section and the disposal of some of the body parts and he had some advice for them including one was to listen to music as he put his own headphones on because that's what he like\nTo do to try to ease the tension when quote doing such work\nThey said that he was dead within minutes but how quick and fast the torture was\nYou know I'm assuming well and what were those minute flight right exactly I'm assuming some of those minutes where spent cutting fingers off I Want to cut off your head that's kind of not seeing the end of it but yeah for the doctor to want to be wearing these headphones and listening to music just so drawn up the craziness of what's going on in front of you is just ridiculous\nReports that one of the members of the Fifteen Percent assassin team world in there with the bones are right that is going to make some at gross noises exactly don't want to hear\nThis is turn into just a mess on the diplomatic side\nThe United states is struggling with how to respond to this the world is crying out that Saudi Arabia and the crown princes directly involved in this the Trump Administration wants to tread very lightly they are an ally we do a lot of business with them they buy a lot of weapons from us in the billions of dollars\nAnd the president doesn't want to endanger that President Trump spoke to reporters and acknowledge that it certainly looks as though he's dead now what else did the president saying how what else is going on in the administration\nIn addition to his comments that quote certainly looks as though\nHow show jazz dead he threatened very severe consequences if the Saudis are found to have murdered him\nAnd before he spoke treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin pulled out of a major upcoming Saturday investment conference Mike Pompeo has been over there interviewing people trying to figure out what's gone on and he even advised that the Saudis should be given a few more days to finish and make public they're credible investigation before\nThe U.S decides how or if they want to respond\nTo give them a few more days to think about how they want to cover this I'm ...

A. G. S. T.\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThis was the daily dived weekend edition\nI'm also rumors running down to the top stories of the week\nAnd don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday morning news without the noise [laughter] I think one of the sources captured everybody's attention this week is that of the lottery the mega millions jackpot is the largest that it's ever been Powerball is going to have a big drawing over the weekend also\nI think between the both of them they're going to be given away one point three to one point four billion dollars in lottery Miranda if you won the lottery who would be the first person you'd call a ...\nI think I called my friend Meghan McCain because her family has been insanely wealthy forever [laughter] and so she's the only person I Know who would not try to get money out of yeah and she would know that people to call the ... that leftover generations\nThat's funny but I bet you're going to say something like hey I'm as rich as you guys but [laughter]\nI mean I might say that the experts say that the first person you should be calling is actually a lawyer because there's a lot of stuff\nThat you have to deal with when you win the lottery a lot of times in states your name has to be publicly announced you can't get away I think there is only six states where you can't be named where you can remain anonymous oh it's crazy but just you know\nGood luck to everybody out there playing\nFor the mega millions your chances of winning\nOne in three hundred and two point six million ... for winning the Powerball it's one in two hundred and Ninety two million so and then the chances of winning both let's say you played everything\nOne in eighty eight quandary really an eighty eight followed by Fifteen zeroes so I mean I was on the odds are crazy we spoke to Rodrigo ... he's a reporter for the record in New Jersey and we talked to him about why you should be calling a lawyer for us and how they can help you out\nKeep your mouth shut and call a lawyer towards winning a big I spoke to a uh chasing Carlin he's an attorney based in union New York he's actually the self proclaimed lottery lawyer he's represented more than thirty lottery winners ... eleven\nI saw him and his name mentioned in a bunch of articles yeah he is the guy\nI guess you'd say the expert on this type of stuff and he said that's pretty much the first thing he told me before you speak to anybody call a lawyer particularly one that has experience in representing lottery winners and basically protected them from a lot of the pitfalls of winning so much money as such a short time\nRight 'cause people don't know what to do with all that money at first and the jackpot for the mega millions is nine hundred and Seventy million dollars if you take the cash option it's five hundred and forty eight million dollars is\nStill a ton of money one of the main pitfalls is a lot of states require you to be publicly announced it's like a matter of public record so you can't get away with being anonymous\nIn New Jersey I actually did another article trying to answer that question because a few months back the jackpot for the mega millions was also pretty large so people the the question that I get most frequently is\nTonight claim my jak anonymously if I win\nSo I figured it out and unfortunately the answer is no you you really can't in New Jersey it's a matter of public record in other words if the average citizen is allowed to and encouraged us to file what's called the public record request and through that you can obtain the name of any lottery winner\nBe a director actually of the state lottery said you know this is a very public game\nSo we want people's names out there you know this is\nWe want people to know who's getting the money that they've spent on this state wide damn this lottery and you know a lot of people have also offered up well can I start a allow the or an entity to claim that pride Ryan James carry his his name the director of the lottery he said yeah that's fine you can do that of course\nAnd they'll pay the jackpot to whatever entity you set up for that but your name will still be public record\nWow I I guess may maybe the only thing in that is that you could ... your name coming out because the the trust of the house he might get first building\nAnd there's there's only six states where you can remain anonymous Delaware Kansas Marilyn North Dakota Ohio and South Carolina [laughter] you know pretty much anywhere you're names and to get out there I I Know people have said you should get off the Internet immediately\nBefore you announce close your social media down if you have a landline making unlisted before skipped town if you can write when they're gonna announce it so that you're not there and you know you work in the media as you've seen when\nAnything major happens in the news the media starts hunting down any pictures that they can if you ah you know all the details because everybody wants to know so you know some experts have said close all that stuff down just to help avoid it\nThat's one of the first tips that I've gotten from multiple experts is yet tried to get off social media because like you said that's the first place that not just reporters look but people that might want to start contacting you for money for charity and that's another issue is that you know a lot of charities that", "year": "2018", "show_name":
