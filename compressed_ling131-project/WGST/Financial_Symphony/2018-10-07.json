{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "You know if you if you're a buyer out there and it just kind of get your feet wet and thinking about it and and maybe you're you're you're you're younger or you're not tied to a school district or something like that\nWhat are you seeing where where where's the hot or what's come in or\nYou know you got it anybody into any different neighborhoods these days when they when they wanna\nYou know catch the wave [laughter] well\nI I'm you know the belt line is still a big part of that yeah I mean it really is I think we're still on the upswing with that um the belt line anywhere along the belt line and now I Would say the next wave is the west side belt line yeah because you know we're nowhere near as built\nAlong there as we are on the east side so you know I think there's a lot of investors buying on the west side because they see it coming they've seen what happened on the east side\nSo those investors gonna sell it sell it off to someone else and make some money in the middle are they going to rent them out or a little bit of both\nI Would say there's a little bit of both and some of them are just renting it out until time is ripe right um but yeah the ... right now and then absolutely absolutely but I mean the belt mine still\nUm you know draws a lot of attention it just just one of those things that does people just have this vision of it as as being the utopian place to live so it's it's certainly throwing a lot of prices up [noise]\nUm you know there's um a lot of different ... and again I can speak really mostly for in town neighborhoods that um\nOr you know some of the the east the south east neighborhoods as well are getting more and more built up I see more and more flippers out there now and again I Know that's a whole nother subject [laughter]\nBut I Do see more of it now and then I've seen in a while\nThere's a ... that used to that as a cook which of the world are they exactly ... no no I I mean it used to Atlanta Kirk would but stretching east Atlanta okay you know a ... where it was the trendy east Atlanta to\nUm you know other areas and I see a lot of flipping going on there\nAnd I think you know because when you want one of the things that's unique about in town Atlanta is um you know other than obviously location and all the amenities that has\nJust that it's not like buying in a neighborhood where everything was built by the same builder and the same thing and you know so you got a lot of properties that that may have never been touched that I was in a renovation I was helping teach at renovation lending class recently and they were\nAll listening was talking on age I was talking about a house not in town but that still had the the old like a Nineteen fifties like you know kitchen things like that you can go back to the Nineteen twenties obviously and and a little bit earlier with some of the things we have around here but I Would imagine that is one of the things that that effects\nAre trying to tell a seller whether they can sell for trying to tell by or what they're going to have to pay as you can have two houses that all things being equal you know same school district you know only only twenty five feet different than a walking distance to a certain bar or something like that like you really have to completely different properties\nAbsolutely and you know that's that's definitely one of the things that's more unique to in town I wouldn't say because it it's more you know the the housing is more diverse it's easier to do and market analysis for a house\nOut in the suburbs where they're all basically the same and all you have to do is look at the cost per square foot\nAnd a I can do that in a way that you know artificial intelligence is going to have a harder time they may be able to guess a few things with permitting and and some other things that are public record but it's really it ... everything is very very unique in town\nIt is it's I mean and again like you said you could have two identical houses one is totally renovated and one is a dump [laughter]\nYou know they're going to be priced very differently and but the stats look the same which is one of the issues I have with things like Zillow coming out with what they call there's estimates right which they don't see the houses so they have no idea\nYeah and you know have you started taking ... into the I'm kind of the southwest part of the belt line yet do you think it's too early over there as far as\nYou you know where appreciation can go to is that still need to be kind of determined that although I I went for a quick little walk kinda tore through the rock quarry park over there and it's going to be just amazing I mean it it's going to be fantastic but or you know what's what's a conversation with your buyers right now or are people interested in and move and\nI'm just really haven't had that much interest in that area personally but I Know that I'm sure that there are a lot that do the um there's just not the market us by tend to work I work with more and move up buyers so not really that are ... right exactly and move up buyers\nAre that's not where they're headed generally\nThey're you know headed to a\nYou know more comfortable neighborhood they're not as much interested in prospecting yeah um you know when I first started and I was younger and so my you know the clients I was working with were younger they were more looking for what's the next thing\nThey were willing to be pioneers they were\nWilling to be pioneers in I was a pioneer yeah I Lived in him in part when it was scary [laughter] um but you know the the movement buyers this just not really their market but what they're doing now\nIs you know uh I live in live his depart near Emery in my neighborhood and Brookhaven which I Do a lot of work and it's all about the tear downs I mean they're all about the ...\nYeah 'cause I mean ... so the the properties in brigade them were built like a little bit or they they are a little bit newer than some of the ones that are or am I wrong about that I may be thinking about the areas where I Know really know people in\nYou mean the newer ones are just\nThinking I'd ... I'd rather build that you know I'd rather ... down at fifty or a seventies house than I Would like in Nineteen twenties you know like that sort of thing\nYeah although I honestly it's getting to where a lot of times it doesn't matter I've seen some beautiful house torn down yeah well then it doesn't have the best reputation for that year they do not um but it's just part of a city growing and and yeah ... or where\nWhether we like it or not we're in a city that's going to continue to grow at a at a fairly rapid pace and uh that's just part of it um [noise]\nYou know but ... and we could do a whole show about\nTearing down and building and I I could talk for eight hours about the the financing side of that which would be incredibly boring for every one um but yeah that's a whole different thought of\nYou know if you can't find are you prepared to uh you know buy something and do either a massive renovation or a full on tear down and have somebody here we are having lots of those I have a lot of those conversations with yeah and there's you know the financing piece of that's a whole different animal\nUm I Know it's over and we do those type of loans or call construction permit our business but it is really a different deal and not for the faint of heart [noise] definitely not for the faint of heart\nAnd and you're not even just talking about the financing it still living through it ...\nIt way while you're married survive I'm so ... you know I Know you've got a great PR firm right I've I've heard the word on the street if they do it every day job [laughter] yeah um but I tell folks how they can find you and and you know a track you down\nUm my website is bill golden homes dot com I'm On Facebook as bill golden homes on Instagram a pill golden homes sensing a theme\nYes how about that they got or my dream or which is four oh for tuna\nMass hysteria would break out so they cancel that program 'cause it was going to be totally ineffective and then around the time of Nixon there was a new system that they're trying to get set up\nRichard Nixon and LBJ wanted to develop their own version of it which they called the decision information distribution system than ... device hand what this was it's it's something that you can plug into your TV they think about a fire stick right in the seventies\nBasically the same concept and so you plug this into your TV and what it would do was change the channel if you had some kind of warning set from Washington they would get on all the TVs and ... automatically change the channel to everybody'd be watching the same program informing of what's going on it\nBut at the same exact time that this was happening and this is what's leading as to what happened yesterday the public lost all trust with the government because of what happened with\nWatergate and they were very concerned about government having direct access to something that was inside their ...\nAnd as you said people were kind of mad they don't want the president to be able to buzz your phone whenever he wants to just\nTo clarify if not the president sitting in his office and saying I'm going to say now this alert no ... there's a process that goes through he does have to direct FEMA to send it out so there's a whole process behind it you know after that in the eighties they settled on the emergency broadcast system the one that we all know takes over television and everything like that\nSo you know there's this long history that we have in this country of these emergency broadcast system\nThis was a new one I think it's actually a good idea everybody always has their cell phones on it were hyper connected you get notifications on your phone you can turn on TV and obviously if something's breaking it's going to be on a news station but it is good to have something direct when you're in your car you're just walking out for a hike it's good to have it come to you personally\nIt's really about how to use it and then obviously what the emergency is hopefully aliens don't invade us\nRight in the event that something were to happen and we get these alerts they say Americans have about eight to twelve minutes to seek shelter before something happens\nAnd in a life threatening situation that could help we just don't want to mess it up like Hawaii did the last time so I can talk was half forgot about that there is among strange history of emergency alerts thanks Miranda think he wants to [laughter]\nYou're listening to the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors and we'll be right back with more\nEngineer

investigator Darryl card well I've done the research already so you don't have\nKnown\nAs the [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWell come back to the daily dive weekend edition next up is my favorite story of the week really I Love stories about bank robbers and bank robberies it takes a special person to have to go through all this stuff to finally come in and say I want to Rob a bank and then research and figure out how you're going to do it\nThis guy in particular has an interesting story he won the lottery hit it big one Nineteen million dollars and then blew through all of his he fell from the highest of highs\nAnd out of desperation turned to robbing banks Miranda you were actually lived in the area where some of the stuff was going around\nSanta Clarita native and I think like five out of his eight or nine banks that he had worked in that town and that's my home town so that's all anybody was talking about on Facebook for weeks was this peachy crews are banned it it was completely captivating and I'm ready for like the Martin Scorsese as he good fellas style movie about this guy\nI remember seeing a lot of news stories about it when it's happening locally especially for you you know you think\nHave I ever run into that guy have I seen that getaway car and that's why they named him the P. T. crews are bad at it was his getaway car use the stolen money that he got from the bags to buy this getaway car so we spoke to Natalie O'Neill she's a contributor to the Daily Beast and we started off by asking who was the P. T. crews are banned it Jim have\nKim have was a security guard who back in the late nineties one Ninety million dollar and the California state\nLottery and then over the course of the next decade sort of amazingly I managed to\nLose it all and then after everything it all came\nFestival bank robber got away with ten of 'em in the LA area before he went then caught by the FBI last year\nSo I just had been talking for ten years in prison now and the writing letter so he kind of ended up telling me everything that happened in between the time that he won the lottery and started kind of life of crime\nMy first question here is how do you strike up a relationship with a former bank robber guy in prison how do you broach the subject of tell me your story\nI called his lawyer and we had gotten her pour his lawyer then told me you know I\n... going to be the kind of guy when it in mind telling his story so why don't you send him a letter in prison and he went up for it he had already pled guilty and he was waiting for\nSentencing hearing at the point that I contacted him so who basically before we started talking wanted I wanted to wait until he had been sentenced in case anything in the article came out that he felt like you know maybe made him look bad so basically I just wrote him a really personal handwritten letter saying\nHey I Am fascinated by what I've read about you know I Want to know more can we talk can we can we had any pen pals and he wrote in bed and then I send them all that stuff like five or six questions how can he might get back to me and he wrote me back\nJust like really amazingly like up the letter with\nLike a really good sense of humor and like a lot lot of exclamation point is just not what I expected at all like in terms of tone right so I was like oh man now even more fascinated by it because they don't seem to\nBe found out about the fact that now you're doing great I'm all for years in federal prison were kind of ... happy\nTo

week I don't have to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] Nobel Prizes\nWere also being awarded this past week\nOne of the more interesting a Nobel Prize is awarded was for that in medicine physiology or medicine and went to two people Dr James Alison and test Sudoku on Joe for discoveries that led to a new way to treat cancer by targeting the body's immune system rather than the tumors themselves\nA it's led to a host of new drugs immuno therapy it's quite expensive but\nPeople are saying that it works pretty well on a certain types of lung cancer and melanoma which is a form of skin cancer so for this story we spoke to Peter loft is he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal we started off by asking who are these Nobel Prize winners James Alison and test to ...\nBoth of them have specialized in immunology studying the body's\nImmune system this turned out to be a critical part of what they discovered and to put it in context if you think about the mainstay of cancer treatment over the years things like chemotherapy and radiation which were effective and are effective in certain situations but\nThey can also be blunt instruments in the sense that they can destroy healthy cells ... along with cancer cells will so that kind of the causes all sorts of complications going\nBack about Fifteen Twenty years there was another set of events in cancer treatment and that was the target genetic mutation in cancer cells now this immune based approaches sort of the new wave and one of the more significant approaches to treating catcher in the long time\nThese two scientists working separately but in parallel discovered features about the body's immune system that led them to figure out that have used certain kinds of drugs to target immune system cells in a certain way it'll basically better equipped to the body's own immune system to go after and destroy cancer cells\nSo exactly how does it work I was reading a lot about checkpoints and how a lot of this stuff let's T cells basically attack the cancer cells of T cells are form of white blood cells and this is where the magic really comes through in\nThat I mean what's so interesting about what they discovered was that the body's immune system has sort of its own natural checkpoints were great so that\nIt doesn't go overboard and attack that healthy parts of the body cancer cells have basically figured out how to exploit that and so they in some way to sort of latch on to the break about his immune system in a way that helps them escape describing destruction and so these drugs\nThat have come out of the research from both scientists essentially take breaks off with the body's own immune system to go after cancer cells in a way that they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise\nSome of the drugs that have been able to be developed because of their research I've seen these like ... you know commercials for these on TV a key true to end up even though I think it was former President Jimmy Carter who said that he used to be true to to treat his melanoma and it worked out very well for him\nI think a lot of people have become aware of them through those things may be hearing about Jimmy Carter taking the true to an yes the TV commercials now are promoting\nThe use of TiVo and keep true to I think primarily lung cancer because lung cancer is one of the more common types of cancers and then one of the most deadly these drones have shown some promise\nThe research still obviously continues they're finding out that these things help treat those things but you know it's not a hundred percent success rate so the next step is to find out why it works the way it does work and then who would benefit most from it\nThere's also a costs things somebody's immune therapies can cost upwards of a hundred grand per person so that has to be figured out as well but Dr ... himself as even said this is a work in progress but he you know confident in his own work\nIn progress of these treatments says by the end of the century cures could be found or you know just even more therapies can be developed to help out with this stuff\nThis studies have shown that as welcoming as these drugs are and as much as they represent an advance struggle alone I think for the most part only works in a minority of\nPatients that we see that in the study what's striking to doctors about these drugs is that in that minority patients that can have a lasting effect that can help people live in some cases for years so the trick now\nIs to try to better protect in which patients these drug will work and by doing things like ... Singh tumors and then\nAlso studying different combinations of the drugs to see if like two or three of them together can do better than one alone and as you mentioned I mean you mentioned the cost that approach is going to compound the cost factor than the sense that you've had their struggle loners relatively expensive and so combining them just going to be even more of a financial burden\nThese are effects that we're seeing that from things that they've been doing for eight years beyond that even you know longer than that that they've been looking into this stuff specifically Dr Alison the American he has a very intimate relationship with cancer of family members had cancer he had a bout with cancer it's been around him for a long time", "show_name": "Financial Symphony", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "07"}
