{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Not I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there is there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThat work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home\nA and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drugs ...\nI've practiced something called modern ...\nAnd that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them and they accumulate in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment or whatever and doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises difference from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say Shannon priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who\nAre agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion so I wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates\nAnd spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and\nThey're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out ones and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply cleaner own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great extra assistant every religion I'm not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra system just about every religion\nBut they all but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of work in past lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances this universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you\nKnow do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which\nHow long me all the time\nI'm even evangelical Christian have you know they need help to\nEverybody knew everybody needs help hold on for more on the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website ... clear dot com his book

tests and that we do in the office than blood tests as well\nBut the tests only make sense and people that have had symptoms before\nThese do not work like other kinds of tests and medicine like say a pregnancy test where you get an answer yes or no you are pregnant or you're not pregnant that's not the way allergy tests work so if you run a whole bunch of tests on people you'll find that they can be positive and people who are not allergic\nAnd that that means the history is really a a very crucial piece I like to tell patients\nEverybody that's allergic to have the positive test\nBut not everybody that has the positive tests is allergic and that can get somewhat infusing which is why it's really important to sit down take some time and go through a careful history of the kinds of symptoms that people have had after eating\nYou are the director of the children's health care of Atlanta food allergy center and then I was right you're very very specialized and so you have physicians I'm assuming from all of the state of Georgia referring children to you talk about what you do there at the food allergy center and where you're located\nWell thank you um I was pleased to be recruited to establish the center I started in the end of march this represents and investments on children's part and Emery university part\nTo establish this new center and recognition of the fact that millions of kids are affected by these problems and there are no approved treatments to use and um and so this represents a major\nUnmet medical need both around the country and then certainly in Georgia where where no such center previously existed so I'm happy to be here to get this started the center has sort of I Would call it a try apartheid mission of clinical care research and sort of education in advocacy\nWe will be happy to see patients from all over the state and region on a ... basis\nAnd provide the highest quality evidence based care that we can for those patients and start to implement new treatments as they become available on the research side of the house will be offering patients the opportunity to participate in studies either as we simply follow them and clinic\nIf they elect to participate or uh even potentially in clinical trials of new medicines and treatments that are being studied\nA it's a very exciting time right now in food allergy we have not had much to offer patients but through research it seems very likely that pretty soon we'll be able to do that and this is the kind of thing that the center is set up to do\nHow can people find out more information about you and I certainly um I'm sure won't physicians to refer people to to your services to\nThat's right so we built to a website\nThat that we will continue to keep updated and the address there is show a dot org slash food allergy and that's probably the easiest way to find information about what we do a and reach out to us we have a referral line that everybody can use at the area code for oh four Seventy five kids\nWe obviously wants to be a resource for the state and the region and a big part of what we do is is that outreach and opening our doors to everyone\nThat don't you Brian victory director of children's health care but land is food allergy center children's health care sports medicine treat more than the traditional sports like baseball and football but also dancing golf\nZoe shepherd is a dancer who developed a foot injury but has been able to make a comeback with the help of children's physical therapist Colleen Crosby Zoe talk first of all about you know what you experience your dancer what problems are you having\nSeen it happening made seasons now president towards the end if he wants to say that it was an easy 'cause she's dating them in the last ... last name and I kept going head to the point where\nI couldn't even evil to many things like well how can we can just turn off the floor\nAnd I told my mom and then she\nTelling you dancing sometimes how do you know or I'm Eighteen continues you been seeing so how how long ago was this ... ... ... years and not to first of all ... and what she told me\nI had had goose deformity and then also that I had to say affairs which I'm highlands is basically where you have like X. ship them in your heel\nAnd I'm ... years it's been that growth play in your heel is growing faster than your muscle until your muscles really tightened to pulling on the ... and then from there I went to physical therapy\nCalling when she gets when she comes to see you take us from there was\nA very it was interesting because she was more of a high level dancer in her studio she was an up and coming next kind of star and so\nUh she was a performance dancer I'm not a competition dancer which is two totally different kinds of therapy right when I saw her I knew that she had just come on come through a big growth spurt um it happens a lot a grizzly issues happen a lot with uh the onset of a gross part because your body doesn't necessarily\nMove the same way um when it's three inches taller as a dead when it was three inches shorter and so what happens is you start to use the same muscles you used to when you're three inches shorter and isn't doesn't quite work out when you're three inches taller so what'll happen is um you start using muscles more than you should and they start becoming tighter\nThat's pulling on the growth plates and with her it was their heels because she was up on point\nAnd so she was constantly rolling your ankles constantly using the calf muscles and so it was constantly pulling on the ... of the hill the problem with that is usually what we see is a lot of times\nThe core glued to the hips what's supposed to stabilize them and keep them up tends to be a little bit weaker because they are going through this Chris Burton they don't quite know what to do with their bodies and said they rely more on what they need to use at that point in time\nLike the ankle or the foot and uh so we just kind of focused on is always core hips includes and then we started coming down her cats and it started to stop polling and and the pain started to slowly go away\nYour background and dancing yourself\nI Do kind of started like dabbling and as they grow up six years ago because I had a a patient that kind of piqued my curiosity and so I started later on as an adult answer and I'm working my way up to a point and a and I'm kind of started dabbling and point out\nThat oh you came to the right person [laughter] on rides you mentioned competition dancing versus ... is that what you mentioned earlier how old is your first\nPerformance several former dancing um they don't necessarily get on stage like uh like the popular show death moms um their competition dancers they they go for the wow factor is for the tumbling the stunts that what our whatever all make the the audience happy\nI'm performance as more based on the intricate details of like where your hips placed in your feet are appointed and if you're a turned out and they do mainly performances during the year and so it's a lot more injure kid a lot more um detail oriented than a competition to answer\nIs all your performers danced with ... obviously ... performances butter or the the moves you make geared towards Sirte before much or a certain way that would be different that would cause part of your shoes if you were having\nI don't think that\nLike training up for performance is different I mean sometimes you like focusing more things like for the performance to like um my teacher will have like a lesson plan focused on my core\nApps sharing their different things like that because it's what you need for the dances that you're doing but um normally it's not that different from like your typical class and you're not getting ready for\nIt and so they've been calling when she comes to you you assessed that would have some of the ways you tell what the issue you know the issue 'cause it's been diagnosed with ... comes you how do you determine the best way to go about helping her\nUm it's really to watch the way that she moves though he was so fluid and um she was very technically a sound which is why she was reading in the ranks of her studio so quickly but the problem was she was just getting kinda Lucy goosey 'cause she had grown so fast um\nAnd so we just had to kind of tune in on where where the muscles just links in longer than they should have and didn't quite strengthen at the same time and it really came down to like really finding what muscles used in a in a larger body would help her turn out better and use those muscles better and\nAnd kind of political her quarter goods and her hips I'm just more so that it could support the lower area like parochial and her ankle\nHow long the process to do it before you started feeling better\nI see a couple of weeks although sometimes they would get better and then\nI'd have like a good week and it wouldn't hurt and then it would start hurting you can sell it was kind of off and on again until maybe lash well this whole year's been pretty suddenly had an heel pain so during that process it was just all\nYou have to continue physical therapy\nWell I said that it has a ... for different reasons but I like physical therapy that was the other reason as a um I have a and T nice in jail and and I think it's like an over ... kind of like ... ... for that that I think if I didn't have an in jazz still want to\nJust 'cause you're like falling right one of those may be said of calling that I Know there are no typical cases probably but is this a typical case kind", "show_name": "Bloomberg: First Word", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "13"}
