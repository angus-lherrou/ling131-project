trying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to\nThen bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with\nAll the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trade and\nWe're John traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure\nWe're defining the natural flow were defined the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that the one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine night it was very mired in merger and right yeah and we do know margarine is not so great for like\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits in suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we didn't do that if we take it on or who who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know and but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right or we have a a a a ... year peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen\nRobots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so forth and so on but he\nRecently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm\nA tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence and you know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect\nGod because they know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because\nWe want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the chance that they you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYeah I ... you\nWrite an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall E N I mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers are not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once boasted about being very good at about well you know like you they're ... it just putting it out by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand\nOther than that to a hundred and twenty five so [noise]\nYeah and it and I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right to go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be like we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine so\nAfter I liked that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I quote one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how easy would that be right now I fully believe that completely and ... and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships [noise]\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile than people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future we'll get back to that thought with Michael ... plus they're shooting the numbers coming up in about thirty minutes for you to join the conversation\nAnd then it's open lines for the rest of the night coast to coast am\nIn for George ... this is Ian [noise]\n\nTalk radio six forty WG as the Atlanta single bomb twenty Eighteen presented by capital what happened on December ... the former ... during\n\nMarshmallow it'd be\nTo get the wrong way\nAnd yours and be more than ... presented by Capitol line\nFrom usa down the official source for government information on thousands of topics and like any good connection there is no\nOnce in a while a detail on that and you get your ... some years back our investigating a man and found what your though who had not been adopted by UFO\nBut when a dog but then going towards that they should have pond\nAnd Europe vote suddenly appeared and everything crew man couldn't Lou Dobbs sitting in the handling the ilk that ... and the alien ... out all the ship and they ... either ... or ... ... is going down the nation\nAnd are in a in a really weird from in on the Uss cole\nThis man hurt avoid calling out my name is Amy hall line in the gym your home and then he would suddenly cut all now I call man your neighbor who found and the people at the ... they were treated him Shockley going in\nAnd they all sort of thing happened with a man but that will allow your neck of the word that nobody in areas where you believe\nThe book is called Erie Georgia chilling tales from the mountains to the seats and the author Jim miles and that's we've been talking today about his uh his latest work Jim is always a pleasure talking to you I really enjoy it and a look forward to more to come from you thank you so much\nI think he's done things like we do that every Halloween\nThat's Jim miles the author of eerie Georgia is a senior executive at one of the world's largest movie studios Judy rigors spend her days marketing the imaginary stories of those ferries superheroes aliens and more fantastical creatures but after the devastating loss of her mother the world of make believe became reality\nWhen Julie captured her first goes in a photograph and blew open the door to the other side to feel like I Know you because the book is written in such a way it's a very very personal obviously for you in it is obvious from reading it but it's so informal and I don't use that word is a bad sense it's like we're just sitting down talking about it\nHappened I start with my first confession oh gee confessions threat or a whole conversation about getting my first one I Am not trained writer she could tell by reading\nAnd I had barely made out of college I did the best they could you know many authors actually go on journeys or adventure so they can seek something to write about I actually went on this huge journey and I had no choice but to write about it and I decided to write about it as if we were sitting next to each other on the couch because I had no other training and they do have any other way to ride\nThis all started after the devastating loss of your mom who had also timers and and passed away take us for through that and then from there\nI was I was craving I was the breathing deeply and I think that anybody who has dealt with a loss of a loved one can certainly relate and five months later actually after I lost my mom in February twenty eleven why of my closest friends was killed in a car accident so it ... it was like a dog pile of grief on top of faith\nAnd shortly thereafter I I started saying goes and photographs and\nI thought it was crazy I Would gentlemanly thought I was going crazy luckily because I Am a nerd I started researching and started researching fetish I've researching you know just the whole idea of ghosts and what are they in all these you know I have a lot of questions and then plus I I had some friends that I could connect with about it and\nYou know I actually found out you know that like forty five percent of us actually believe in ghosts and so I felt a little better that I wasn't the only one and like twenty five percent of people felt like I've been in contact or seen them so I felt better with that as well\nSo I started feeling well not crazy but they actually kind of I mean if he thought seeing was enough and kicking in that or the other side just to see them ha I wasn't even deeper into what I call it ... and started actually having contact with the other side\nWhether it was through vision or sharing smells and those are all called players\nSo I've I literally I was I [laughter] it's it's even hard to it's like I said now and I'm like it's still it's a kind of hard to believe so I went into this this whole other realm and strangely enough started hailing from the grief\nWhy do you think it was a distorted after your mother died\nYou know I Am I saying that spirit show up in our life for a whole lot of reasons and I think one of them is they show up for us to find some peace for us to believe that you know our our spirits continue on that are self continue on and the reason why there's a lot of reasons why I actually read the book but\nShe just said something on a really big refund that's not evident to a lot of people but when I started kind of searching to try to understand what was happening I wanted to read and I found a lot of books\nThat were written by psychics who were born with their gifts that I Love by the white I've met a number of them and they are very much the real deal or I found books that were written by people who've had indeed ease which are near death experiences\nNo one had written their encounters and you know this you know cause of the wilderness or spiritual world that was written by a schmo like me I'm just too\nI guess I Am I I call myself a schmo just because I wasn't born with the gift I didn't have to die you know I'm a girl from Oklahoma that I thought because I've had these experience I could not possibly be the only one and it was you know it was more related to us all in the middle\nYour answer being a ... that's the whole attitude of the book that makes a really fun to read so that you do your personality comes out in the ... I'm\nKind of funny yeah just kind of funny I'm even funny when I'm sad yeah well you got to have that if you exactly [laughter]\nNo use utilitarian your your picture and you see it goes in there and you show you have some pictures in the book and you can clearly see some things in there it's very interesting did that happen by accident\nYes completely by accident yeah it it did you know and a lot of people asking what did you take the pictures that goes with I'm like well my iPhone just like everybody else I've a feeling it works on an Android but I had and I yeah I was taking\nA picture of of a it was actually a bird that had flown into our kitchen window and it left you know that mark that you know it looks kinda dusty that white kind of dusty look oil and dust and in the background of that as a photograph ... was it goes the first coast I saw in a photograph and what's\nReally funny is I've gone back to look past photographs and I can see ghosts and they're too I didn't actually go look at other people's photograph to because I'm a ... my next confessions I'm slightly obsessive my personality is and I could sit on people's Facebook accounts and look through their photos and it's like oh so yeah I can do that\nHow many pictures have you taken what sounds like that but then you look at if you look at other people's because it has to be ...\nYeah I have I have an embarrassing collection of science house and photograph them does because on obsessive and I think what I think what was happening to me is if anyone you know again who has dealt with Korea can understand that you know you you're lost\nAnd weirdly I was found by ghosts that sounds very strange statement but when you're a loss\nYou know um because you can't ever go back to who you were you have to figure out who you are to be because your whole belief systems have to change your how you look at the world changes it just does\nI think that at a time when I was feeling invisible I started seeing things that were invisible to everyone else so it's a bit of a not a word play but it's a lot of irony in there\nSo I just kept taking them and I think I kept hanging up because I wanted to ... it's like it's this is this a moment is it one time thing or are they really hear it so I took them for months and months and months and yeah they're real\n[laughter] they always showed up\nWhat's the last one that you've taken the last one did you see\nThe last one that I've seen is I\nI made a trailer for my book I Can't help do that do that kind of stuff because I'm a marketer at heart give I buy mark and movies for a living\nSo I decided to make a book tour like a movie trailer and went to a a very famous which I Can't say which one it it had to find a ... a release that I wasn't a very famous state in the hills in Hollywood\nAnd if you go look at the tray there there are three goes photos that will will pop up because we went and kind of just smoke is a canvas to see ghosts that that I discovered through my journey\nAnd so we went to go kind of smoke out this this area\nWith a stage smoke and there's a number of them and those photographs of those were just taken you know probably a month ago\nWhat do you think they are widely they are in that particular location\nHere's the thing is I think they're everywhere and I will do my best to kind of give everybody a sense of my hypothesis cause I can only call a hypothesis at this point of you know what is happening on the other side the first thing is I I fully believe there is a natural balance on the other side of light and dark and I address both light and dark\nIn my book on purpose because I think there are people who want to understand what's happened to them if they had been afraid and scared of ghosts and I want that those stories in there\nAnd then I think those who have had encounters you know to make them feel better to believe are also and therefore um but there's a balance of of light and dark and there's also hierarchy on the other side and so I think there's a hierarchy and and mostly what people are interested in are those are they're Muslims who passed\nOr those that they know who have passed and you know there's a hierarchy in terms of here's a reality if you know someone or if there's someone who was murdered another human\nThey're kind of going in at the lower end of the hierarchy they just are you know taking another life is not okay so they're going to show up at a very low vibration and you know you could see a lot of old souls that are still cruising around\nWalking the earth because they may not even know they've they're dead to be quite honest and then you have a really high vibration folks like our friend Mona had actually die twice\nThe first time she died and that's why she was twenty five\nShe had an N. D. E. and near death experience and she came back\nThe second time actually took and Mona that was a very high vibration she very much believed in God in heaven and the other side and and very much practice sat and talked about it and you know so when she passed over she was ready to come back very clearly meaning to tell her she was here", "show_name": "Bloomberg: First Word", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "27"}
