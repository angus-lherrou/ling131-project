{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "That was fun I remember those days used to talk with me about\nThat yeah that that was you know back in the days they say and ...\nAnd Jennifer ... love is so happy now with her husband and her two babies I mean that's all that little girl ever wanted and of course she's on a new show this fall I see but I I think she's just so happy to be married and have her children that that seriously that's all she really ever wanted how important\nMarion or the dreams for communicating with a dead\nIt's very important if somebody died in there was unfinished business\nBecause it wasn't that person comes in your dream you can ask them ... or apologize to them or what did what happened why did we break apart anything like that the same thing somebody that died violently or was murdered\nIf I Can't get to that funeral before that spirit crosses over I Can't give them any law enforcement agencies any information\nBought if that person that was murdered comes in your dream and it was a relative or a friend that's what the heck happened and you'd be surprised how ... how much information you get from them and unfortunately they still don't know the lottery numbers\nNo I don't know or or if they do they're not passing them on exactly rent\nFor a lot of people who were brand new to the show maryann in uh want to get to know you are a little bit better you've had this gift since you were\nA little girl correct a well were you\nGrammar realized I was a little over two when I could see and talk to earth a spirit the problem is most\nBabies and children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative\nThat died and Italian ... everybody's related somehow and so you know I was grandma special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person would just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gasket\nBut he was he was talking to me and\nI you know there was no question but would ask the question or the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever ask the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had way ... these\nYoung they did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOn carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the ... to me it wasn't the dead person as the live person because I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did or did you always happen like that\n[noise] no I think than the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ... even though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff all the time\nAnd by so it it improves every time I I really believe that it does it takes me about three seconds now to open a white light make a big enough for somebody to walk through\nI can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like a hospital or an airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over\nThe county morgue um gosh there was all kinds in there and I just had I learned how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and it's crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter ... can do this\nAnd but she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop it and how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you been a speech about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that has happened\n[noise] I ... this past year has\nBeen unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five thirty years ago that happened a a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face\nAnd and I wouldn't go to houses if I thought it goes to kill me I Am certainly not stupid but I remember I was in the garage\nAnd that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when that hit\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here [noise] and then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy\nI Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the light it still free will\nBut you're gonna leave this health one way or the other\nAnd now that I'm older you know and I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five\nFive Seventy five year old man this is look at me and go sure girlie [noise] not so much anymore now when I tell them to do something they usually listen but I'm usually older than all of\nThem have you ever okay have you ever come across Miriam the double\n[noise] I think that I was seeing him maybe three times or the ones that were so evil that they had come from the black cool\nYeah and I if I ever run across that situation now I really\nTry to protect the family the best that I can and I actually get a hold of a religious person somebody that has more training in that field than me\nTo try and get rid of the devil or the demon or whatever it might be exactly\nThat's exactly right and there are people that say they're deem and I'll just like they can take care of that [noise] more power to them\nYou don't perform exercises and things like that\nI Do not I people have had um possessions where I had done that\nAnd I actually stopped doing that because every time I Would do a possession I Would end up leading somewhere I Would get scratched or or looked like I was\nBit GE or something and it's like oh no no no no no no no don't have to do this anymore and that's again something that I Would refer to an ordained\nPreserves probably pretty smart we are going to come back and take phone calls with ... stories and questions was marrying when comes [noise]\nOne of the perks of being a ... is that you can participate in our twenties monthly lined champs issues for read the transcripts leader George ... chats with insiders and the second do the month and a special guest beach littering the month\nAnd so about a whole bunch of images in my book or from those images you gee nobody that's published in the cold storage for years on my should've narrow it down to probably be trying to find the most interesting and it had pictures of people's houses being moved\nBuilding theme of the gas station they\nActually do to see all those people naturally wonder what was going on at the time what and how they ended up\nAnd now a lot of yeah the most um documented information I could get was unlike linear and they were a lot of controversy on that one\nI think it was games will times I did a lot of articles\nAnd they did an article about a couple that says you know we're not better off without all this money was going to help us we're not better off\nSo it's very political too especially linear and and I'm now tune or very political they didn't they to do it you know all these you know parades all kinds of stuff so politics got involved in this funny how Jimmy Carter basically in the end when and then to the book he when he was president he found that the U.S Army Corps was\nBasically you know some agencies try to justify their existence or and they kept building lakes because that's what they didn't they did it well since the fifties low thirties\nWell they started ... more like in the forties and fifties\nBut Georgia Power had build all those lakes is is it that was called the great lakes as north Georgia starts with a up their Rayburn county and you know down like Raymond\nBurton like all this bird was probably the earliest one that I said Blue Ridge but I think it was burned and I have a chart much book that shows the earliest ones in with one of the some of those areas to pick the polls are those are the the reverse because I'm pretty sure\nNo I'd have to state that I'm not a biologist them not historian I'm not an archaeologist but I've become a little bit of an amateur enjoying loving it because\nI joined organizations so I can learn from them and somebody suggested I joined the society for George archeology and I did because they are you some of the material and now I'm going to be speaking at there in in November at their big southeastern if they get oh my gosh I'm outta my league because I'm not an archeology that\nThey want to know the stories and that's what writers do is they just tell a story and I write creative non fiction micro history is and what they do is I take something small something that\nIn significant sum forgotten and try to make it or the ... it made a big difference that I I'm trying to make a story out of things because if if he could tell a story people going to read it and understand it but if it's just a bunch of facts you know sometimes they won't listen and it's interesting it was a whole journey so\nI understand what you mean where you start out with something and it's kind of becomes living breathing thing and nobody wants to go it takes you where it was\nTotally I mean I just had no idea I wanted to know what it was like for ... you know in the Seventeen hundreds to come to Georgia what would it look like so I Would read the stuff and I'd see it was a wild place with wild rivers and and people my children and grandchildren will never see that I never see that you know I was raised\nWe talking about the legs the natural my husband was born and raised in which he'll Katty Kay is that he saw quarters like being dug out in the rivers damned and he heard all the stories his grandfather is in the book you tell stories grandfather told them a lot about the area\nThe thing was I was born in western New York Yankees but I've been in the south lawn or I'm going to college here to me I took my husband up to Lake Erie to visit my family and the first thing he said when he got back he goes you can't see across\nAnd I'm like what we can't see across I never seen anything like that and I realized she spent his whole life in North Georgia where there is not our natural lakes yeah so you can't see across\nI've been on the middle of Lake Erie county's right it's like an ocean to me said oh he thought it was like the oh she's the honestly said to me are you sure we're not looking at the ocean I said we're in western New York\nToday we're talking about the underwater ghost towns of north Georgia that is a tiny little book by Lisa Russell fascinating topic we all know these lakes around Georgia we don't know how they got here and there is a great history behind that to a and probably some not so great history around that as well something that you bring up in here\nIs obviously the movie deliverance everybody's familiar with the Burt Reynolds one of the stars just passed away James Dickey wrote that\nIn your book you talk about what might have been this is about four men are going to canoe trip because the rivers going to be flooded by lake just like we've been talking about the legal haven't seen the movie James Dickey it's based on him and some friends taking a trip down a river mhm it seems very cryptic that he came back and we talk about it\nBut yeah 'cause I was like wanting to know you know 'cause I went to the MSA program at Reinhardt just to speak one time and they have a whole thing I'm Jane stinky 'cause he's a Georgia author so I didn't know much about him and everything and I and I only watched deliver it's part of it so I\nI started getting into it more and I and I uh James Dickey son came to that conference and I said ... Chris Dickey he wrote a he wrote a book called summer of deliverance and he talks about how his father came home\nOne day from a trip he was all shook up you know and they use all beat up in the ... you had this summer kind of weird experience and he didn't really want to talk about it but um his father sat there and I don't know if they had to use the type of court or whatever and told wrote down the whole thing again sticky one would not he's not alive anymore but he would not\nAdmit that it was a truth what T. when they were about to build Carter's lake and the timing of it was just seemed to be like that was what it was yeah so I asked his son\nChris wrote them an email I said um that are that I like to talk to you but just answer me this but if it was it ... quarters like I mean that was being built\nAnd he said yes he he confirmed that that is father came back from a trip with ... and some weird thing happened but it wasn't that whole thing that happened so weird thing but it was based on the fact that he was sad\nThat's why they took the trip that they're going to be losing the wildest river of north Georgia as as you know the ... film there because it was gone and it was a film it was filmed up and I'm like the to the gorge and I'm a now to Kayla things\nI've made got that wrong but I'm not that it was in North Georgia somewhere but one of the likes that we're still wild\nHere's the part in the movie to place sheriff revenge James Dickey folks they don't ...\nI read his father his son's book the whole but you know ... and he was a real sneaker somebody said I'm the only thing comes out of his mouth or allies unless he's writing poetry yes that's why even a poet and I'm just going to say that I always I teach literature in my I'm a judge order 'em at Georgia north western and\nWe have one of his poems called cherry logger cherry something ...\nI I just they don't know who the heck he is but [laughter] cheapest memory alive but he was a big story I mean I liar and what they say and so he never would come out and say that it was about the coup so I think\nIn the book is ... yeah I'm going to walk the veterinarian close yeah so the characterization of him then means it could or could not be true we don't know or ...\nI think a Christmas book at and what I asked him is that he didn't have some strange experience that happened to him but it wasn't that All right yeah it's it's a it's a hormone law really is a\nProblem with people who are or watching I read the book and seen the movie multiple\nTimes thing it was interesting to me is why was the story written you know that that just for me as they were making it um the river into a lake\nAnd it gives you really are picture into what's happening in the early part of the movie and the end of the movie because you see a moment to church you see them moving buildings and that's probably\nTrue to life isn't it for them yeah and in fact in the back of the cover of the book there is one of my favorite pictures are digging graves\nYes and then there is a man uh my son went to church with and Montgomery who was one of the boys that they hired to come and dig up the graves is part of you know hey you want to do this and make some money and they dug up the graves in uh for not Lee and she too\nAnd they moved on to other places that they happen all over the death they moved uh Cooper a Mark Anthony Cooper and portable they moved from his home and at a walk a and they moved into the ... cemetery which he can see his place now you know there's even a plaque there that says us core of army engineers move this Nineteen there for the movie for Altoona\nYou know that was my first book I didn't put a lot about that in there but they had to move all those grace I had to be a district tremendous hundred die\nI Know you have to talk to the families a gift or something that families can do well to families are around us through yet you know the old church cemeteries most people had record jerk and move them but I have a picture of one of them digging it up and then the graves where they put them something I did not ... I don't know what happened I lost the copies of the past but there was this map they had pictures\nAnd they had pictures of just process that's all it was so that's where they found graves that didn't have markings so all those little crosses had to be moved to couldn't possibly have gotten them all too\nI'm sure they didn't and thinking about all the Indian burials are all that stuff you know this under there\nAnd you know what's funny is that they\nThey they call a drawdown and Blue Ridge and I forgot what year it was because I remember going to like Blue Ridge has one of my favorite lakes though I still look at it differently now I Will always look at these likes different ... I wrote in his late ... just one of the most peaceful wonderful places to go on but now I look at different but I talked to um\nA lady her name's Dr Kathleen tops and making her name right 'cause I got her name wrong in the book Dr Kathleen Thompson's written about this and she told me that when the leg was drawn down there he drew it down to fix the day and it was it's an old damp so that affects that Italy and stuff\nThere are people who if they went out in the middle of the lake or they could be arrested because you're not supposed to go out there is a law that stops them from doing that\nAnd that's kinda how I got ... or ... with Georgia because I I just think that's a wonderful law about the things that are under there that we need to preserve whether they under the water or what you know so much probably needs to be uncovered scholar underwater museum is nobody can tell you when people go out there to take things then that's gone it's\nJust fascinated people now are the those likes recreation and the voting and just have no idea what the history of that sort of wind the book is great especially if you go to those lakes or you live\nIn the area or if you're around George I you know I immediately and you don't want to talk to you about this when I read the book I read the weather's great looking back at all the history of the benefits outweigh the cost of it\nYou think you mean like the lakes making the later yeah um I think in the earlier times and for Georgia Power when we needed the ... the power and the VA we needed to power but if there was no power in North Georgia you know pre backwards I guess in the Nineteen early Nineteen hundreds yes I", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bloomberg: First Word", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "06"}
