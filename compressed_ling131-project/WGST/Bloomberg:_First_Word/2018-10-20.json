up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors

cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and not become a pond in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions you

how DNA is changing our lives and the world around I don't feel like I look like anybody else or feel like anybody else we're becoming closer together more empathetic that's what they instilled in me in the very beginning\nIt seems that you know maybe we should just run tests than the if somebody is allergic or not\nAnd we do have skin tests in that we do in the office than blood tests as well\nBut the tests only make sense and people that have had symptoms before\nThese do not work like other kinds of tests and medicine like say a pregnancy test where you get an answer yes or no you are pregnant or you're not pregnant that's not the way allergy tests work so if you run a whole bunch of tests on people you'll find that they can be positive and people who are not allergic\nAnd that that means the history is really a a very crucial Pete I like to tell patients\nEverybody that's allergic to have the positive test\nBut not everybody that has the positive test is allergic and that can get somewhat abusing which is why it's really important to sit down take some time and go through a careful history of the kinds of symptoms that people have had after eating\nYou are the director of the children's health care of Atlanta food allergy center and then I just write you a very very specialized and so you have physicians I'm assuming from all of the state of Georgia referring children to you talk about what you do there at the food allergy center and where you're located\nWell thank you um I was pleased to be recruited to establish the center I started in the end of march this represents and investments on children's part and Emery university is part\nTo establish this new center and recognition of the fact that millions of kids are affected by these problems and there are no approved treatments to use and um\nAnd so this represents a major unmet medical need both around the country and then certainly in Georgia where where no such center previously existed so I'm happy to be here to get this started the center has sort of I Would call it a try apartheid mission of clinical care research and sort of education in advocacy\nWe will be happy to see patients from all over the state and region on a ... basis and provide the highest quality evidence based care that we can for those patients and start to implement new treatments as they become available on the research side of the house will be offering patients the opportunity to participate in studies\nEither as we simply follow them and clinic\nIf they elect to participate or even potentially in clinical trials of new medicines and treatments that are being studied\nA it's a very exciting time right now in food allergy we have not had much to offer patients but through research it seems very likely that pretty soon we'll be able to do that and this is the kind of thing that the center is set up to do\nHow can people find out more information about you and I certainly um I'm sure want physicians to refer people to to your services to\nThat's right so we built a website that that we will continue to keep updated and the address there is show a dot org slash food allergy and that's probably the easiest way to find information about what we do a and reach out to us we have a referral line that everybody can use at the area code\nFor oh four Seventy five kids\nWe obviously wants to be a resource for the state and the region and a big part of what we do is is that outrage and opening our doors to everyone\nThat don't you Brian Vickers ... director of children's health care of Atlanta is food allergy center children's health care sports medicine treats more than the traditional sports like baseball and football but also dancing golf\nZoe shepherd is a dancer who developed a foot injury but has been able to make a comeback with the help of children's physical therapist Colleen Crosby says oh we talk first of all about you know what you experience your dancer what problems are you having\nSeen it happening made seasons now president that towards the end if he or she thought it was an easy 'cause I just gave me a lot I mean they kept going to the point\nI couldn't really roll through my ... are like walk properly 'cause just to live my he'll also for her and I told my mom and then she took her to the doctor\nHow long you been dancing um since I was very hard you know I'm Thirteen to ... so how how long ago was this maybe I hear when you were there was a doctor first of all ... and ...\nUm she told me I had had goose deformity and then also that I had to say affairs which I'm highlands is basically where you have like ... those in your heel\nAnd I'm Sievers has been the growth play in your heel is growing faster than your muscle until your muscles really tightened to pulling on the plate and to then from there I went to physical therapy\nCalling when she gets when she comes to see you take us from there\nWas a very it was interesting because she was more of a high level dancer in her studio she was an up and coming next kind of star and so\nUh she was a performance dancer I'm not a competition dancer which is two totally different kinds of therapy right when I saw her I knew that she had just come on come through a big growth spurt um it happens a lot a critically issues happen a lot with uh the onset of a gross because your body doesn't necessarily\nMove the same way um when it's three inches taller as a dead when it was three inches shorter and so what happens is you start to use the same muscles you used to when you're three inches shorter\nAnd it doesn't doesn't quite work out when you're three inches taller so what'll happen is um you start using muscles more than you should and they start becoming tighter that's pulling on the growth plates and with her was her heels because she was up on point\nAnd so she was constantly rolling your ankles constantly using the calf muscles and so it was constantly pulling on the gross plate of the hill the problem with that is usually what we see is a lot of times\nThe core gluten hips what's supposed to stabilize them and keep them up tends to be a little bit weaker because they're going through this Chris Burton they don't quite know what to do with their bodies and said they rely more on what they need to use at that point in time\nLike the ankle or the foot and uh so we just kind of focused on as always core hips includes and then we started coming down her cats and it started to stop pulling and and the pain started this lately go away\nYour background and dancing yourself\nI Do kind of started like dabbling and as they grow up six years ago because I had a a patient that kind of piqued my curiosity\nAnd so I started later on as an adult dancer and um worked my way up to a point and a and I'm kind of started dabbling in point\nAt all you came to the right person [laughter] on rides you mentioned competition dancing versus ... is that what you mentioned earlier how old is your first\nPerformance several former dancing um they don't necessarily get on stage like uh like the popular show death moms um their competition dancers they they go for the wow factor for the tumbling the stunts the what are what ever make that the audience happy\nI'm performance was more based on the intricate details of like where your hips placed in your feet are appointed and if you're turned out and they do mainly performances during the year and so it's a lot more injure kid a lot more um detail oriented than a competition to answer\nYour performers danced with ... obviously framed for performances butter or the the moves you make geared towards certain performance or a certain way that would be different that would cause part of your shoes or ...\nI don't think that uh like training up for performance is different I mean sometimes you like focusing more things like for the performance to like um my teacher will have like a lesson plan focused on my core\nApps sharing their different things like that because it's what you need for the dances that you're doing but I'm really not that different from like your typical class and you're not getting ready for work\nAnd so they've been calling when she comes to you you assess uh what are some of the ways you tell what the issue you know the issue 'cause it's been diagnosed with ... comes you how do you determine the best way to go about helping her\nUm it's really to watch the way that she moves very was so fluid and um she was very technically a sound which is why she was reading in the ranks of her studio so quickly but the problem was she was just getting kinda Lucy juicy because she had grown so fast um\nAnd so we just had to kind of tune in on where where the muscles just linked in longer than they should have and didn't quite strengthen at the same time and it really came down to like really finding what muscles used in a in a larger body would help her turn out better and use those muscles better and\nAnd kind of split up by her quarter goods in her hips I'm just more so that it could support the lower areas like her heel and her ankle\nHow long the process to lowered before you started feeling better\nI see a couple of weeks although sometimes they would get better and then\nI'd have like a good week and it wouldn't hurt and then it would start hurting you can sell it was kind of off and on again until maybe lash well this whole year's been pretty had like ... heel pain so during that process it was just all\nYou have to continue physical therapy\nLike still going to see the ... for different reasons but I like physical therapy what's the other reason as a um I have a and T any syndrome and and I think it's it can over look is kind of like ... ... for that that I think if I didn't have an inch as still want to\nDiscuss elect calling from those of us for you to be said of calling the I Know there are no typical cases probably but is this a typical case kind\nOf and then not really a kind of based off of just uh the fact that um there is something that should be ongoing and they're kind of slacked", "year": "2018", "show_name":
