know something I don't know\nAnd a there'd be on and I I tell them hey man I'm going to have felt for ten years I didn't sit around worried about how to stop the option so you you you know how does that work and you know where do you start from here so I can help contribute something to my defensive coordinator an officer coordinator but I loved it I Would love to learn and\nI've loved teaching 'em and you know my I'm a family of a of teachers my mom my mother was a teacher my aunt was a teacher and principal my sister's a teacher so I'm In a\nFamily of people who enjoy teaching others and I have I have a love doing it I don't know if I'm good at it yet but I sure love doing it\nI guess this Saturday and just a coaching at the cabinet to Georgia blaming the NFL with the ah ... send the Packers I'm\nHurt Ross who who was a very diverse fingers football coach to system in Georgia had come to Georgia southern once told me that you know\nUh I could leave a big\nTime college football and go to hospital job you're just as happy over to his coach at whatever level you're wrong yes er and I remember John ... former head coach to offer us and\nAnd yeah I did more time in front of it goes back to high school coach and\nYes or if you love to coach it doesn't matter what it doesn't matter and here's here's a cool that Tony ... is a great football coach and he's in the hall of fame but he was my head coach but when you see them in their element and I remember watching Bill Bill or chicken the pro bowl one time\nAnd I watched him coach every position on the field\nAnd I honestly believe bill ... could coach every physician group on the football field any amazed me it is dad\nI'll go to his dad was in Annapolis ideas that goes to high school as well but when you see 'em a coach in their element you know they love what they do because they're going to they're going to stress the details\nAnd that doesn't matter if you're in the NFL doesn't matter if you're in division one college and see if any of those things what matters is you're teaching a detail to help that that that athlete be productive and that's what you love about\nYou're getting a good claiming from Jeff Saturday he ran the gamut acutely\nDue to a final vote\nWas yesterday and [noise]\nIt's ... and if you haven't already you have to check out our radios newest podcast twenty ... this is the show where we sit with musicians and experts to talk about how DNA is changing our lives and the world around us\nThis week we got real with Melissa Etheridge has we discuss what does it mean to be family family's family you can make families families lost you bond with\nRadio six forty WGN Steve Atlantis him telling\nThis is sports conversations with Laurence Smith on G and and now here's Lawrence\nWelcome back I guess it's a Saturday or if he really can be it'd be two in Georgia\nAlso an NFL veteran with two teams would end in Memphis comes from the Green Bay Packers you were talking about ... to philosophy there\nBefore the break in helping kids went to really doing a I don't think people sometimes appreciate the value of having a coach who's a who's really only helping kids and contributes to the community you would you speak to them\nAnd that's you know I tell every one of our kids that every child on our team has a role right and and I still matter where you are in life or if you're in a business if you're in a family um you know when you're when you're married you own your and you I mean you have your own family\nAll of those things that you're an owner of a business everybody's still has a role and you have to understand what that is when\nYou begin to teach a child or an athlete or what that looks like it that you don't really have to bring something to the table you also have to be willing to lay your ego aside for the betterment of others\nAnd I think that's the part that I enjoy the most\nIs then when I can look at at at kids and tell them hey you know you may be more talented than this year but the way that you're conducting yourself\nYou're more fit in your chance to go be that guy 'cause talent doesn't impress me right that's not the port is going to take in deer meet to you or vice versa this is what I'm asking if you if you play your role on this team\nAnd I think we can teach people so much because when they get into a family and they have the right and they're married and they have their own families they have a role to play but everybody else in that family does as well and you have to\nBe able to show them what's really the most important thing and that's again I'm going to bring something I'm gonna bring my absolute best but I Want this whole unit to be better so if I'm the dad I'm the son if I'm how to conduct myself to make sure this is the right way\nYou know I I tell about Peyton Manning it myself I said listen he is you know he's the sticks\nYou know two hundred and thirty five pounds he's skinny as a rail\nLong there and all that but he can whip that football\nYou know God made me sick story to Ninety five\nI could do football but I wouldn't be nearly as good if I tried to play a role that I wasn't made for and I said I guarantee you there and Peyton Manning plate center somebody behind them would die Rikers milk for that show that we all have rules so it's so fun was created for that\nSo that's our job as the teacher is it helped show them and shepherd them into the spot where we're making them the best version\nOf who they can be close to your son and my son is a\nBritish thing I've ever done I've coached all three of my kids are close to my two sons and my daughter um nothing I've had more fun and and I I tell people getting to go through this experience now with him being in high school and almost done and he's looking at colleges in getting offers and all those kinds of things\nMy favorite part as seeing the man he is on the field seeing how he conducts himself around his teammates the way he carries himself\nAway carried himself at school and that's been no different than all my kids were I'm kosher my little guy whose twelve or my daughter who's now sixteen it's not that again I mean I've been around the greatest in the world at whatever they've been in you know whether it's football basketball baseball tracks your race thing I Know all those yeah it's not that's not the oppressive why they support\nIs how they carry themselves and how they how they care about other people it it has been an amazing process for me and my wife a chair and just watching our kids' books on\nUm who got it as as as allowed them and made them made it it's been an incredible feeling nothing\nBetter you have the ultimate ... Super Bowl ring I guess the state championship was revealed to me as a whole\nHeck yeah absolutely I I I'm not going to lose a filibuster with them and we're here to well let's let's let's let's be the best we can be ... were called the ... it's just like a ... there was just like a Super Bowl man you're going to have some luck falls got about sure way you gotta stay injured all the same things matter in a plot matter what level yard\n... will have a shot at it this year made the playoffs for the second time in school history last year so ah also make a little ruin this year to do something special\nThe concussion problem we get around that\nI think it was I've been a huge proponent of health and safety I worked on on the CD a a big NFL done a great job of protecting guys I Know fans don't always loved the rules\nOf but learning how to manage concussions are the biggest thing is that when a kid gets it on my own son had one and you had to sit and ... and he missed the rest of the season he missed sport basketball season but just trusting in their knowledge of war that doctors are and not have an adult woman's how they can go back to the field\nOh to earth acts in the earth day Texas what'd you found it out there once you share a little bit about um your your commercial real estate background because uh you have created or you guys did a lot of projects around the country that people know and one of those projects is right here in Atlanta ah Peachtree Center\n... H Street center and the merchandise Mart and the apparel Mart back in the sixties and seventies I was a kid I remember\nAnd you guys did all that stuff that that is Great Hey you can't come to Atlanta and not see the ... center or you know there's a lot of activity\nOr in that area every day I don't know how many thousands of people passed that area a because there's a martyr station is down there and it's just right there in in the center of a of Atlanta but Mr grow\n'em once you tell us when did you begin how when did you discover your love for the environment and how did you begin your work as a philanthropist\nIt's kind of a funny story but it's not a long story my brother\nWent to military school when I was yeah mhm and when he came home for Thanksgiving he taught me three word\nPolitics environment population Mm it's stuck with me and by much always been the most important thing that my brother got the second to work but he remembered college while\nMr Kerr you are speaking of environment in Atlanta or excuse me in Dallas I'm a ... year based out of I mean you're you're involved in quite a bit of a organizations in the Dallas area and you tell us about some of the some of the environmental work that you've done in the Dallas area\nWell I did ... ... ... and ... too much uh I think a lotta people keeping the back of the mind what they'll do some day uh but over the years helped start a few little things\nBaby the eighties was when the U.S green building council a uh started a chapter downtown the corporation started recycling helped just know some of those things along\nIt believe me there hasn't been too much big business support of it\nAnd then about ten years ago uh finally\nJumped in with both he and uh\nUh haven't stopped running so that\nWould happen ten years ago that you know kind of was a catalyst for you\nWell if this man the founder of the container store and the founder of hotel dot com mhm and to me and said that the utility company was trying to get permits for twelve coal fired last a\nWith a lot of great technology and try to get fast tracked approval for the state\nAnd of course the utility company only dated three more permanent shift that time\nAnd they were going to put thirty minutes of your drawer out in Twenty years so we went about the state of business leaders from the big cities to\nSign a pledge to oppose this and we beat him and it was a remarkable thing because utility company than let these business leaders would oppose that\nA Texas business for clean air and that might have been the first time in our state is the word clean and the word business was that the same title wow yeah\nOnce you share with the ... would do well give us a give us an idea of what was the state of sustainability at that point and bring us up to you don't present day what's what's the state of sustainability like in the state of Texas\nWell it's a big state and see the result from different micro climates and everything mhm uh let me see here major wetland problems\nEspecially now along the coast of Houston is still recuperating from these extreme weather events that people used to say but it's just whether you're right at them they are now saying climate related or the droughts and the wildfires in the panhandle in West Texas has\nBeen far worse than many of the wildfires across the nation better it gets touched publicity a drought on and off that's climate related you know the Rio Grande river\nWell it doesn't always blow to the coast mhm irrigation a for agriculture and industrial with visual for purposes or not to have a river that\nFlows if they do is a big problem that exists in the Colorado River flowing through the Grand Canyon that and get it at the California bay anymore often uh\nThen when we talk about cities you talk about the air quality I'm not sure about that are right now some of the city's big city in Texas not beat this ... uh whether or not you believe on climate change\nAir pollution is a major problem with disease and health or if we can look at it that way even even somebody who doesn't believe in climate\nKnows the clean air caught\nRight and ah you know Austin Austin, Texas or I Know Austin is a pretty progressive city ah they've they've been trying to get a lot of the implement a lot of great programs in the city Boston\nYeah the the leadership and and the marriage there\nA setback replacing trees\nOr a\nWorking homeless springs in the ... runs a you know she was firms and interesting though those big oil companies have been there so long so problematic\nThat\nFifteen Years ago it had to be confronted so Republicans and Democrats life work to improve the air quality in Houston but ... ...\n... it's it's a rough road to hoe a that's why we're right on a friday sales and people's though\nMr grow we need to go to a break but when we come back on the other side of the break we're going to continue
