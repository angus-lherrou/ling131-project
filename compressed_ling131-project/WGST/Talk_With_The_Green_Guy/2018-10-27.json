{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "And we do have we have uh there there are a series of brochures that the George association of realtors puts out the help buyers and sellers\nAnd we rewrite those things every year and we add things too and we added lead based paint this last year because obviously that was like a Detroit thing\nBut um but we also added the alert because every state law can be a little bit different so if you've got to buy her coming in from another state even if they have heavily researched what the surveillance laws are in that state which I don't know what they're doing\nUm you know once you come to once you come to Georgia the the rules maybe a little bit different so in in some states you can\nYou can only you know it's video or audio or vice versa or you have to have you know you have to have a party consent or things like that but George is a very a property right owner rights said we take our rights to ownership extremely seriously in our great state of Georgia\nWhich means that in Georgia if you're in my house um you're no expectation of privacy whatsoever I can use audio and video surveillance I can type it I can watch it live and and I absolutely positively would\nAnd and you know some people feel like that's an invasion of privacy but you're in my house I got to be really honestly\nAnd if something you know if something comes up missing or damaged or there's a fall and side of the house there's all sorts of liability and risk of law that I take on when I allow strangers in my house and I'm not there and I am not one of the sellers who sits there and watches the buyers as they come through the house like I think they should have\nYou know the ability to look at it without a seller staring at them or so\nI Know it'd be difficult to prove but are are there any ramifications if we can be documented that these solar use some of the surveillance to affect their negotiations with the buyer\nNo because they have the right to record it anything that they here it's like over hearing a conversation in public it's the exact same thing so they can use it in their negotiation set of Christians point sometimes you can give away your negotiation position from the standpoint of your overly excited and exuberant and very vocal about it\nBeing also go the other way you can just take a seller off because you've made fun of you know some dated wallpaper that's in one of their rooms or you know how they keep their house or you know at the picture of one of their children that's on the mantle or whatever you say\nI'm into Christians point earlier on that sellers can make emotional decisions and they just decide they don't like you\nSaid poker face it's kind of like you know old school going to buy a car we're used to do these negotiations face to face I guess now with the surveillance you've got to have the book or faces a buyer of houses well\nAgain like I mean definitely complement something when you go and just so the person doesn't think you're [laughter] you're just like in their house like what is your ... walk around with your finger of what I did I can or guard that's what I Do before we walk and just to remind clients again that hey we don't know if there's any surveillance in here like\nKeep a casual say hello you know than like the cabinets or whatever but just don't don't give you a position to weigh interesting what are some of the other thing\nToday the buyers need to be focused on at this point I mean what does it look like for them\n[noise] um I think the great thing is ... are much ... associations are much healthier now but that's still something that people need to be careful be careful up with him mindful of with town homes or condos are there any assessments coming up and that they're really asking the questions about the chilies health\nBecause the last thing you want to do is move into a place and then get assessed with ten years that's meant for however much a month\nWell and you know again you go back to why you need a real estate agent who's actually thinking about that because I I you know I don't think all of them really do quite frankly\nAnd you're more issues with condos in town homes because you've got there were periods of time in er during the the market melt down that we had where everyone in the condominium had no water because it was one ... one water meter in and it was a a an association paid water bill and there were not enough people paying their condo dues\nAnd so every a hundred percent of the people in the building had their water shut off seeing it can get serious\nAnd remember to from the lending side of things you know on a smaller downpayment loans were going to do a ... exam on that homeowners association answer your financing is going to be contingent on the health of the age away as you discuss with larger down payments were going to do with streamline one but it's still going to be you know an investigation into the health of the H away\nSo you know from a wedding perspective if you're talking to them even if they love the absolute you know condo and and and and have to have it no matter what and you talk to them about you know potential pitfalls of the H away will come in right behind that and make sure that it's in good situation or good condition in order to get financing\nOn it and that that's one of those times when when all of the due diligence that you guys are doing are really probably protecting some buyers that may not be protecting themselves with with real due diligence on their part\nAnd I patrol borrowers that all the time that are looking or condos you know they get very upset when we have an issue with the homeowner's association and I'm like listen you everybody works under the natural ... worth protecting ourselves because we're financing the collateral which is ... ... condo where the home or whatever\nBut it's for your protection as well I mean if you've got an H away that as half of the people sixty days behind on their age ...\nA venture we that's going to trickle down to you if nobody pays that so it's for the for the clients protection as well\nYeah yeah and a lot of that a lot of the H always you know had to dig themselves out of a little bit of a whole because I'm the lender doesn't you know if the lender foreclosed on the property they're all of the ... at that point are probably going to get wiped out so that are are going to get wiped out\nAnd probably about it so the condo just took an absolute financial loss and the only thing they can do is go back and track down in Sioux a seller who had just lost their property to foreclosure sets a losing effort for the most part\nUm you know and then the lender would start to pay from the data foreclosure forward\nBut uh but to your point I think that most of the neighborhoods and the condos and all of these areas are probably in pretty good shape I based upon the number of people that are coming to closing and called houses are getting rebuild in pools are getting improved upon I Know they've ripped our stuff to the ground\nUm because it was built in the mid eighties and you know at the pool is not cool enough for a for the kids these days so they need they need a little bit more um what else are you seeing out there that I think ... I think there are a lot of really positive signs even as the rates come up\nOh yeah I mean I think it's one of those things where we're just in such a great market here in Atlanta um you know with having the port\nI'm not too far from us when you think about logistics that airport I'm trying to think of supply chain and and then you think we have sick over sixty colleges and universities here is a lot of talent stays here because it's affordable instead of going to New York or Florida\nUm so I think we have we have so many great things that even though the the market it's cooling down just a little it's it's not an indicator of anything larger than that\nUm than just a little like I said return to\nNormalcy a bit more yeah and even went to slow down a little bit and they still be a little bit difficult to find that the your exact house that you want because I think we still have the problem with the builders are building a little bit and you know they're building in a higher price range and and everyone's been telling them that for a long time and the and it it appears that they are not listening\nI'm you know but in their defense the cost of land has become more expensive and the last few years\nUh the cost of labor is more expensive ... yeah the ... the the all of that other stuff\nBut it is a great city that's why we're all here\nAnd there are more people coming every day but a Christian tell everyone out there how to find you if they want someone who knows exactly what they're doing\nShort or so on all social media I Am Christian sold it and I can reach us at village real T.

this assembling these packages an attempt to trace them back to their fender and so now they're going to try and see whether the constructor of these single pipe bomb whether they left them sort of signature\nWhether they ... some sort of air enemy wiring and maybe that was sort of their trade so there are a lot of players that investigators now have to put together they just have a big puzzle had it then\nAnd we learned a little bit more about the devices themselves they said they were made out of PVC pipe covered with black tape they each have like a small battery some wires maybe some broken glass for maximum damage but is there anything else that they've told us about these devices specifically\nAuthorities have been releasing very new details about the fact that the the fight that they were saying that these are capable of being lied explosive whether or not they are it's still unclear we know that they have taken X rays that the explicit\nThan are examining those and are going through the wiring and the battery and and the overall material that they are constructed from\nIt's hard to ignore who the targets are George Soros the Clintons the Obamas CNN and John Brennan Eric Holder Debbie Wasserman Schultz as you've said is the return address for all of the ten devices\nRepresented Maxine Waters Joe Biden Robert Deniro these are all high profile Democrats and critics of the president in the administration how was the president been responding\nPresident has largely been hunting that blame off of himself and his rhetoric and back onto the media so that we thought different Trump rally from his normal show on Wednesday night it was absent from the lock her up chants while he was speaking are fake news represented as he points\nBack at the end of the realm and criticizing the media and the crowd goes wild it did however at that rally\nCall for the media to unite the country he also tweeted on Thursday again blaming the media for that he said that a very big part of the anger that we've had our society is caused by basically fake\nNews and that it's gotten so bad that it's beyond description of what we see here is something very standard of the president uh these days is that he is not wanting to take the blame for himself I Would imagine that would be\nPretty careful that played impact and in the mid term that works too willing embrace that the blame for that and putting it back to one of his ... targets which is the media\nYeah it's going to be interesting to see how it all shakes out the investigation is ongoing no details are going to be coming in and changing every day and the man hunt is on to see who or what group might have Sundays out\nThank you very much Lauren Meyer reporter fractious thanks for joining us\nThank you so much [laughter]\n[laughter]\nElection season and you know you've been getting all the robo calls you've seen all the ads on TV but the most popular way this year for political campaigns to reach voters is not through these ads on social media it's not ... robocalls if flooding so\nPhones with personalized political text messages and while they might be annoying they don't violate the rules on automated both texting it's called peer to peer messaging so we spoke to David McKay but he's a tech reporter at ... for more on this\nAnd these are what are called peer to peer messages so you you said robo calls they're not quite like a robocall which is often recorded an auto dial meaning they can dial more people because it's a machine that island but to get around federal rules regarding robocalls and robots heck major actually peer to peer so it's another person at the end of the line into becoming more popular with political campaigns\nThere's companies now that have offered computer platforms are mobile apps that these people can use where it'll auto fill whatever message it is the key as you were saying the peer to peer these campaigns need somebody to literally hit send for every single one and they say that these people can sense thousands of them and our\nRight I mean they use these platforms on both the left in the right problems like open fascinate our hustle you know but that's the right hospital or the on the on the left to send these tax benefits actually building a a platform to do that\nAt scale and of course it's not entirely unlike phone banking we all know that people can go and they will call and they have political candidates often a common space with other people as supporters ... entirely unlike that in terms of\nIt being another person on the other other side of the equation\nAnd the reason why these are gaining in popularity is just because they are so effective I think they have an open rate of like about Ninety percent basically if they

is the daily dive we can edition I'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week I don't have the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] for the ongoing stories that has been happening for a few weeks now is that of the\nCentral American migrants caravan that it's making his way from Honduras there's members from Guatemala and El Salvador as well the Trump Administration is planning to dispatch about eight hundred or more active duty troops to the southern border\nTo help stop the flow of migrants into the country defense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending the troops of the border bolstering the national guard forces that are already there\nThe additional troops would provide logistical support to the border patrol the plan is not yet been finalized or formerly announced but it is expected to happen for more on the migrant carbon we spoke to Ted has and he's an immigration reporter for Politico and we started off by talking about the president's reaction to the Caribbean and the implications for the midterm elections\nWe've seen the president talked up on this issue and this is nothing new I mean this goes back to the last time there was a caravan back in April I mean I think\nThe one difference we have here is we're now at the doorstep of November's midterm elections and this was a political issue for him obviously he really wants to make it about his policies and the need for a border wall versus what the Democrats stand for what he characterizes as open borders\nHe's saying that these countries you know under a self Salvador Guatemala\nThey're not doing enough to keep these people there I Know Mexico's National Guard there are so you know some military guys they put up a roadblock ate at one point but then they tore down right away\nI guess maybe there was too many people are they do they weren't going to be able to handle it the countries are doing something maybe just not enough and like I said now he wants to start cutting aid I think last year these three countries had more than a combined five hundred million dollars in funding from the U.S I think so far this year it's been about two hundred million dollars\nIn aid has been shrinking in recent years to begin with back in twenty Seventeen it was somewhere around seven hundred million to mostly to these three Central American countries Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador\nAnd then in twenty Eighteen down to six hundred and Fifteen million and now it's been proposed by both the house and the Senate to bring it down somewhere in the five hundred million dollar range and the and the Trump Administration was actually asking for even lower\nSomewhere and four hundred million so even before all this happened President Trump was already proposing to cut aid to the Central American countries so that in itself is nothing new I mean what is interesting though is that he doesn't have an\nHour to do that on his own and these are bills passed by Congress and Congress will consider what amounts to give in Central American aid when the time comes\nAnd the president being very forceful on this stuff does give some political cover to for Republicans who have to push this through because the Democrats are going to be on the opposite side of it with regards to the terms you know he's saying\nWhenever you see these people come across in these criminals and unknown middle Easterners and everything she the Democrats in mind we have to change our crappy immigration laws so he makes it about the midterms and everything and he provides a little covered by being forceful but\nIs there not much political will on the part of Congress to do something I'm there was some immigration bills that tried to pass this past year and none of them went through even some of the ones that the White House was backing\nI mean I think you really need to consider his words in the context of where we are right now and only being two weeks away from the mid term and I think this was an issue that is really important to Republican voters and it\nSeems like it's going up an interest in recent weeks in less so for Democrats essentially as a way for them to mobilize their base to get them out to the polls now whether any of these proposals you know border wall flashing funding to Central America rewriting asylum laws I mean these are all really big projects and even maybe a year ago a little less than a year ago when\nCongress was working in a bipartisan fashion to address them they\nReally struggled to do so and they weren't able to advance any legislation and the White House would pose the bills that had the most support so it's hard to imagine that after the midterms with Democrats likely to take back some ground in the house is not when it entirely that they'd come back to the table and work out a better deal\nWhat has been the reaction from the leaders of these countries Honduras Guatemala El Salvador I Know the Mexican the incoming Mexican president has suggested that the U.S Canada and Mexico workout some funding development for poor areas of Central America in southern Mexico where are these companies trying to do to reduce the type of migration\nThe president says the the northern triangle countries were up in Washington DC not too long ago for a summit convened by the U.S and Mexico jointly\nTo talk about these very issues\nAnd you know for the most part they're open to cooperating on security issues but there are clearly limitations in some cases those are economic limitations and not having the funding to do it that I mentioned before with us funding is being caught towards these kind of projects in Central America right now and then in other cases it's political and it's because of\nPolitical instability in their home country I mean I'm Doris in particular is an example where I'm the president there want
