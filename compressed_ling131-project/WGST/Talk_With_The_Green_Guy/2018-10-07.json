{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Athens and le Grange and after her first speech the first one in the three of the story in Atlanta uh and they've heard some pretty interesting people including a fringe burn month to rent the electric choice that that's the best speech\nWe have ever heard so\nYou're getting rave reviews lingering happy thank you and nice to have an opportunity to visit with highly\nWe'll have final sauce will talk about her being a cancer survivor\nRight after these messages\nThis is sports conversations with Laurence Smith on jihad and now here's Laura\nWelcome back I guess was highly\nThe FBI is so\nThe person that were announced of the female gender so uh that gives her a\nSpecial a status in the business but I think you're special too but um when you were diagnosed with cancer you never know out of negative thoughts to sleep\nIn and you found a way you knew it was a challenge you knew what was going to be tough\nTo have some bad how fortunate do you feel\nI feel really lucky I you know I I told this story earlier back ten two years ago ... eleven days before the college football season I was having a one biopsy and I found out that I had an a tumor in my line\nBut I was just so determined to work that college football season and not let cancer sideline me\nThat I didn't tell anybody you know just how serious it was and by continuing to go to work it just kept my spirits up you know when I Would say at home by myself on the couch and you you do have some doubt and you do have to fear about cancer\nBut if I could just keep going to the games and getting to the games that really kept me going you know I Would go to um\nI remember WNBA game I went to and they said ... wearing the federally wake you aware and and they encouraged me to just go bald on TV or you know the coaches that would encourage mean Comey and check on me and make sure I Would do not pay you know Nick Saban was so cute she she sent me a box of Apple's with the note that said an apple\nA day keeps the doctor away and just so many um you know every conference commissioner John swap offered bubbles be out all these people in sports that I have covered for so long we're all really there for me and\nIn my recovery and it was important but\nBy continuing to get to the game I never feel sorry for myself and I never really allowed I don't want to say a lot of cancer to not get me because cancer we don't dictate cancer but I never I never quit I guess is what I'm saying and that was important\nThen you have a message as a result of this to those who have an unfortunate gift you know unfortunate news hook bruise your message to those who verify about if you look for\nIs is whatever it is that your passionate about don't let cancer take away that passion you know there were plenty of days that I haven't felt well and I wanted to give up or I just wanted to sleep or not leave my house\nBut every day that I if cancer took things away from me I thought I Would give up I I just didn't want it to even get an inch into my life or else I thought I Would give up\nSo I just refuse to let cancer tell me what I couldn't couldn't do no matter how I felt I got up and went to work and and I think that's an important lesson as you there will be days you don't feel well there will be days you feel alone and discouraged but get up and do something you let it it can be something small and moment of joy\nWhatever it is that brings you joy if you get up and do that every day\nAnd then you're winning ... mine was sport but everybody has their own I got up and went to a game and that's what saved my life\nAnd ... that's a beautiful beautiful story and we appreciate you sharing it with us and as we\nMake our way to the exit of this a recording um\nThe future of sports with future colleagues athletics or at all so rosy is there a concern on your ... are we doing something that we need to be careful about\nYes I think there's a few things that we need to be careful about one we need to continue player safety\nAnd I was just reading an article about a young man here in Georgia a high school player that had a hard hit at the beginning of the game thought he was fine and just collapsed after half time passed away from a head injury\nA kid from Tennessee State is in critical condition right now so we just have to continue making the game as safe as possible that is a concern and then I Do think some of these rules you know the transfer rule that was put in that kids could plan up to four games\nAnd then transfer I think what we thought do at Clemson was a negative thing I've now kids can quit on their team halfway through I think we've had\nFour or five high profile kids quit their teams and the last week that's probably not what the rule intended and so I think we need to continue to look at ways to make it a team sport and not\nAn individual decision for games end of the season the\nArms race we talk about uh I Wonder if this is going to limit the number of teams at colleges that can really have to compete for a championship in ...\nIt's money so everywhere I went and visited six different campuses if pre season before the college season started and every single place had just built or was in the process of building new facility so Georgia have beautiful facilities\nThey've just completely renovated their ... their Letterman's lock room inside the stadium and they're recruiting lounge area Auburn brand new recruiting latch\nOn Alabama brand new nutrition center so you know it's all about money where's that money going in is it better served elsewhere but it it is all about recruiting\nDevoted to recruit more fun it is ... game and I'm hoping we'll managed to be able to protect to as time goes by without playing on the road for joining the east to invite you to join us again next week\nWill visit there was an interesting sports personalities right heroes force conversations on\nThis man sports conversations with Laurence Smith joined us here next week Loren sit down with another legendary name from morning we're over here on\n\nTalk radio six forty WG as the there was a time\nI didn't have the more somebody online\nToo I've found a way to turn it on\nOn our universe you shine brighter than you ever thought possible\nOr were primarily are these projects so they in in the states in Georgia or they're all over the world\nI'm primarily in the southeast and in the U.S um I Do a little bit of work in the Caribbean Puerto Rico shore and um the country that I'm from originally the twin island in public have turned on to a bagel okay so I Do they add some more getting youth into the environmental field and kind of helping them shaped their careers and direct them to this past\nUm but yeah so and I work with a lot of national organizations like um the center for watershed protection for instance and then I work with some local watershed groups ...\nUm well I uh how did you become the chair of this great organization\nShow us what happened was in two thousand five when I came to George I was the only person from North Carolina based center that was in Georgia so there were two people that I direct to ask me to meet with one of them when I met with him said you should apply to this thing called Joe\nSo going back and I Googled Idaho and when I saw the list of alumni I was like no way\nI'm qualified to get to the program all would get in and unfortunately I was right I did apply because I knew I Would see\nThis gentleman again and he would say I gave you one piece of advice to take it so I applied and I didn't get in and then it was on right now it's like the pride things I didn't get in so I gave myself a few years I network to lot\nReally engage mall and became more of a lead in the field and then I replied um and so\nThat's what I was looking for we're looking for leaders in the environmental field and I'm like you mentioned it's times to Institute for Georgian my ma leadership\nAnd we draw from all classes all alumni withdraw our board members and so after doing the class into two thousand eleven I was asked to be on the board a year or two off to and that's how I became involved I don't know\nI Am pretty much I'm pretty skeptical on I can be cynical I Will admit that and everybody kept saying on you know\nI should also greatest the greatest thing and I was like really you have such a different personality from the other person why do you think is so great I Will do that program and I will see what other down falls or the disadvantages or whatever job but it was great it was the best thing and so I became a big proponent than was really happy to sit on the board\nSo this was really a diverse group of sustainability professionals across the state of Georgia\nDefinitely it's a very experiential experiential program in that we actually have five different fashions and we meet in five different locations of the state where we have the the tea also participants experience different parts of Georgia so we start off in me at Emory in Atlanta\nIn July we take the class to southwest Georgia to deal with the heat and the knots of the middle of summer in Georgia we ride around they pick up trucks of the local farmers so it's a very interesting experience in September we go to the island them stop little off the coast of Georgia\nAnd some most extraordinary place that unfortunately many Georgians haven't had a chance to experience in November when the gorgeous no children mountains usually right at peak leaf season um peak color on and then in January we back the following year when back in the Atlanta area at semi\nOkay awesome let me bring a repeat of bill in here

environmental leadership man what a great conversation wherever this morning I'm learning a whole lot about this organization or you guys bring\nYou know kind of a criminal crop of sustainability people in the state of Georgia a together to help solve or issues which is really great but especially before we left don't break you were sharing with this uh uh some of the other things that the word on people and our\nRight so yeah some of our alumni have left the state of Georgia but really the sort of the goal of the program is to develop George elite has field of ...\nAnd to me and you know we are facing this issue now I'll just give a sidebar here the ... and ... it does represent what stands full environment um but we are seeing that it also\nCan stand of equity in some ways and we talk about and buy more justice for instance\nSo um yeah we're exploring different areas and equity definitely comes in to the curriculum ... unlike Andrea mentioned\nOne of the first classes on talks about different lenses different ways that you look at um environmental issues on which he is definitely one of the lenses that the facilities that facilitates sorry I'm stress but\nBesides focusing on George all like I said some of the alumni leave the state and do great things in other parts of the country or even the world um we also if we get the applications we will consider having one member of the class who's not from the state of Georgia just to kind of encourage collaboration with 'em all\nNearby states I'm like I said I ... dot ORG we accepting applications for one more week or two thousand Nineteen class there's only one out in our own\nYou know you are out and we said again don't be discouraged if you didn't get in the first ... first the first or second time that you applied it's a very competitive um so what we look for what we do read the application so like you said it's the who's who so you get a you know you get an application from ... to go\nHe or she has to be and not necessarily we do read them and we we look at the contents if you don't have\nFlashed on on says then you're really hit your chances 'cause we have a lot of good applications every um you know we we target certain people who we feel uh would would really benefit from the class of also\nBenefit the class itself um there's one guy I don't know if you've heard of him he does this green guy show um we think he's a great yeah we think we talked about that we think you'd be a white applicants\nAnd he does have one week lapse the will seem 'em [laughter] but we have\nBesides the radio talk show host and we have applications from nonprofits\nUm industry commercial we have local government members in the class and Andrea it's going to talk a little bit more about that I was in applications in there for a class and that's before all bought afterwards too\nYes they should say the um and I did want to just a quick note I'm that\nOut in terms of the nonprofits there is a scholarship program for grassroots nonprofit small non profit to may not be able to afford I gel er Cox conserved very generously allows a scholarship for for some of those applications so\nDon't let the financial a burden uh inhibit you from from from putting in your application for it\nAs it that is really important and with that I mean it's out of the ideal is also an a nonprofit organization so we are in all of our five sessions look for sponsorship to be able to\nPromote those organizations locally who are doing really great work and exposing them to this amazing network of of ige leaders\nBut in terms of our interaction with and connection to the local including universities and and and local leaders\nI Jill on historically has been very focused on the sessions and as the board has I'm encouraged the organization to continue to put its tentacles out into the university system out into local businesses out into the local community so\nOver the last few years we've done some really amazing work one of the things we're doing right now is with the ... foundation and really focusing on the mystifying\nWater and where it comes from and how it affects local community and
