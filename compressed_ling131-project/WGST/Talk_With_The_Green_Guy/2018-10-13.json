{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Um it it's either done as what's referred to as as is meaning that here's the value of the home the way that it stands now or you get an appraisal that comes back is referred to is subject to meaning that here's the value of the home but it's subject to this this this and this being completed\nSo new construction when you do the initial appraisal you're going to get that subject to\nOf course subject to the rest of the house being built and finish 'em and they'll do multiple appraisals and inspection due out that process to make sure that the value is remaining the same um as well as you know to give the the buyer and the client kind of the warm and fuzzy used to know that everything is still on track so I wanted to kind of give some of that clarification as well\nUm you\nMelissa wanted me to talk a little bit about some of the financing options you know it's kind of a weird dynamic when you do new construction because unless you're buying one of these spec houses that you alluded to before\nYou're buying a place and you don't have a place to live right off the bat right correct yeah yeah so a lot of people own occurring home and they don't want to sell necessarily off off the bat\nLet's just say because they're not going to have a place to live and they don't want to necessarily rent you can tap into that equity of your current home to use that as the down payment for some of this product and then when the homeless completed once we do to take out refinances we talked about before if you're in line to sell your current home\nYou're in a position to kind of even pay down that low in a little bit more and use the remaining equity that you had in your house by the time that you end up selling it\nYes absolutely so that's been great um key\nFactor that really helps the decision making process for some of these fires because like you were saying they don't want to rent a place they don't want to sell their house and be homeless for several months\nAnd with it taking us eight months to build these houses they're just wanting to be educated on the different options that they might have out there so I think you know having some great loan officers uh that I work with you being able to educate them on their different options has been very helpful\nYeah and I think you know people have become kind of more accustomed to that as well you know we're in a real estate market right now where people are selling their houses before they even find a new home to buy\nSo this type of thing might have been a lot more scary for the average everyday homebuyer years and years ago but I think we're experienced it now to where it's actually become part of the norm so I think the comfort level for those people will kind of we are going up some as well\nScott let's talk about red barn real estate in general real quick you know kind of what your plans are what you're thinking about what the company\nYeah no I mean we we've got big plans for sure I mean we we want to grow in you know the Atlanta market Georgia mortgage for sure I mean we're looking at some out of state things as well to 'em again like I said I mean we we built this hybrid and and what we wanted to do was we want to take the good parts of a team\nIn give little pieces of the team to agents that need that so\nLots of agents whether they're big producers or their brand new to real estate you know at times they one leaves they won't consistency they want things that you know we can offer in the brokerage so\nBiggest thing for us is I mean we are a production based brokerage we're looking for agents that want to make a career out of this we're not looking for fantasy agents were not looking for people that just kind of want to do it on the side here and there I'm In one of the things I talk to my agents about all the time is\nYou know we want to come alongside them to make them successful in day dictate what successful is so I've got agents that want to do twenty million a year as successful I've got other agents that are happy at a million or two million for sure so we just want to be able to take our resources everything that we have to offer from\nCoaching been touring to our lead share program I'm In kind of put that out there to help the agents just be successful for sure\nWell and what that means for the the buyers and sellers and the people that you're working with is that you don't have those real estate agents that are doing this sort of side hobby because that it it's extremely difficult\nThere's a lot of moving parts in these transactions and if you've got people that got radio silent for eight hours a day because they're they're in another job uh it it does make it extremely difficult I I feel badly for real estate agents one of my favorite means is thank God it's friday await our real estate [laughter]\nYou know so because it does feel like you have to be available for that eight hours a day and again as we said earlier in the show than at eight pm that's when all of the like urgent stuff starts to happen um but you really do need to give someone the assurance that when they see that\nBrokerage they know that you've got professional fulltime people that are doing this yeah this is their living this is their job is to protect the buyers and sellers\nYeah and and to me I mean it has to be mean or industry as a whole I mean\nWe need to be looked upon as professional and so that's the biggest thing at our brokers that we want to make sure that our agents were being professional to consumers out there um you know it's not a game does I mean it is here it's just the biggest purchasing sale that most people are going to be involved in\nThere is always joke I say you can learn a lot about people when adversity and money is involved\n[laughter] we get into the layoff um yeah\nAnd so I had I mean I came out of the corporate world into real estate\nUm was a sales guy put out a lot of fires and problems and uh I did not realize the time and emotion that went in to each one of these deals so being that I'm not in production anymore and I'm supporting my agents I see it at thirty thousand feet now which is a super cool place to be sitting here watching it\nBut understand emotions I sympathize for the clients I mean you know it is just when somebody's house is on the market a week for us flies by for them it is like so slow and they are going crazy yeah so\nYou know I think emotions it's it's so important to talk about 'cause you're you're talking about from the south side of things and you're exactly right because most people aren't selling\nJust to move in an apartment they're selling for a reason they're going to buy something else they've got to get out of this place and get to a different town there's been\nA life changing event yeah but there's a motion on the other side as well I mean you know if you're buying a new house you're buying would you want to be you know something that you've been visions and something that you you've dreamed up your whole life for a lot of first time homebuyers this was you know this is the American dream I guess in a certain sense\nYou know how do you handle that emotion on the ...\nMan will and you just mentioned first time homebuyers and let me tell you I mean when I was the first time homebuyer life with a lot easier there was lots options out there I can kind of pick and choose I mean I remember called my realtor and going out on a Saturday we could see eight or nine homes and I could be picky to days first time homebuyer I feel horrible for I mean\nIt is such a competitive market and the price range that most of them are looking up against investors they're up against caster ... up against a lot of challenges and you know they get to see one house at a time and it is like as soon as they ... they're calling the age of the agents taken immediately because if they don't\nIt could be off the market and it's starting to slow little bit and it's starting to get a little bit more you know in line with where where it should be but you know for the first time homebuyer man I just I feel sorry for him I mean it is not a fun game that I got to do when I first bought my house\nYeah our ... our months of supply we had new yeah new reporting that came out in the last weekend and it is certainly it is still on the low side even though it's you know we're trying to me than the right direction for this uh but also finding you know the Wright houses in the right price ranges as Ben and an extreme struggle in our city\nMost acclaimed new home sales specialists red barn construction and Scott Martin now managing partner red barred

daily dive weekend edition\nI'm Oscar rumors and raining down some of the top stories of the week don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise\n[laughter]\nOne of the most dramatic stories of the week was the story of the U.S astronaut and the Russian cosmonauts that had to make a dangerous ballistic re entry into the earth's atmosphere after their ... rocket failed and they were on a mission to go to the international space station\nAnd two minutes into the flight or something happened one and the second stage of the boosters something failed and they had to abort mission and returned back\nThe only way we can get to the international space station right now is by using these Russian rockets the soil use rockets to get up there to cramped little thing they're old\nUh we're waiting for these new rockets to be able to take us up there from space X and Boeing um and it's kind of a little below to this troubles Russian space program\nIt's the only thing that gets us up to the international space station so for more on this we turn to rod pile he's a space historian he's a science writer he's an author he knows everything you need to know about space and space exploration you can check out all his stuff it piled books dot com\nAnd we just started off by asking them for more details on this crazy story\nThis was a flight as you said a woman astronaut when us I was not one cause not go up the space station and there and the Soyuz\nSpacecraft which also rides up on a rocket I'm the same name\nThat was going up and they're supposed to swap out for a couple of crew members are already up the space station gr we're going to come back now the space station always has a Soyuz capsule attached up there just in case so that they get out of jail free card if they need to come home at an emergency but the official\nSeal of approval on that are coming home expires in mid December so I really needed this one to come up and\nSwap out the crew or not there's a tour down didn't\nSo apparently what happened is it made it through about two minutes of flight ... staging per se just second stage or what I can tell and if you look at the video of it there's some kind of odd\nTo try this falling off the rocket looks almost like silver glitter from a distance I don't think that normally happens or are they doing but it's been a long time since I've looked at that tells you there might have been something going on with what are the engines but at any rate that's strictly conjecture what we do know is that something happened at staging either an engine failed to ignite or what I've read more recently is that the\nFirst stage to drop pre properly so for one reason or another they had to abort\nNow the rockets designed to be able to do that\nAnd they all have been since the early space age work on our side and the the Soviets except for our space shuttle which really didn't have it aboard option until much later and when you aboard your ground control punch was a big red button and a capsule let's go for the top of the rocket and fires a smaller set of rockets up above the capsule which are extremely\nPowerful and just burn for a few seconds if you're an astronaut inside that thing\nAnd you hit the aboard but it's like getting slammed up a block of concrete right that they\nThey said they were forced to do a ... entry what exactly does that mean and because they said that during that stuff that that that have crewmembers can face a G forces ten times greater than that of what's going on or\nIt's rarely more than eight but it's still a lot and even in a normal rigged tree or you're looking at maybe four or five but each one is significantly more so\nBallistic ridge remains this is what they did in the very early space age days back and mercury and\nThe boss stock on the Soviets I'd normally when a space capsule comes back in\n... glides a little bit it's almost like the space shuttle in a way the field is is either such a way and the and they use guidance rockets to ...\nThemselves so that kind of glide back a little sideways and the heat shield 'cause it's kind of this Shiloh gradual reentry that gives you four to five sometimes\nSix cheese a ballistic originally just means you've got up over the top of the arc that whatever speed you head goes away and then you come back straight down like a bullet in because you're not scrubbing off any of that energy by moving sideways you're generating\nA possibly nine cheese which is a lot\nThe U.S astronaut Nick hey it was his first mission whatever ride and what a crazy turn of events for him\nWhat a rotten that no one huh and they showed some video the fat and at the point that whatever happened happened that started I guess the rock I started to vibrate significantly you could see these two guys and our hands are flap on around like they're trying to learn how to fly over and it's really it's almost comical but realize that it was a top ride this\nNormally that doesn't happen so they're really they said there there were weightless at one point even before they hit the panic buttons so cut out\nNo other way now these are rushing saw you spacecrafts generally they're pretty reliable as one of them said I Know they've had a couple of problems here and there but can you comment on that and then also talk about the new fleet of things that are happening 'cause SpaceX has a capsule getting ready Boeing has another one also what do we know about these\nSo ... has been flying since Nineteen sixty seven and its flown a hundred and forty five times so although that's actually not that many more than the shuttle it's been very successful they only had two crew losses back in the sixties and then after that it's had a few issues but generally it's been extremely reliable and it's been around long times\nRussia has launched an investigation and see what happened and they said that they're going to you know share all the details of with everybody because we still have a partnership with them so we'll see what the true cause of that was but thank you
