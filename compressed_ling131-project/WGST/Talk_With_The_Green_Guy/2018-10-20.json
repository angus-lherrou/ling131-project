big deal\nWell lenders you know ... before closing lenders are going to call and verify your employment usually twenty four to forty eight hours before you close to make sure you added quit your job and you can still qualify and we happened to call the day of and I know he doesn't work here any more why he's sitting at the closing\nTable um and you asked me so well no I got a new job what's the problem\nWell you know Cheryl jobs or I Would say the closing attorney kind of put the pen down\nFederal we'll let you guys discuss and they'll let me know if you need me um you know the the lesson is\nCommunicate with your with your professionals your your real estate partner your your lender or the earlier the better you can have communication we're able to closes loan I wasn't a big deal that just took a couple more days um\nBut it was a big deal for him and his family right because they were planning on moving over the weekend at all those kind of other things and there was one of those where if you just want to let us know a week ahead of time\nNo big deal at All right but here we are at this big moment of your life go oh my God this is this is going to be a big deal so um\nYou know we we've all had these stores in the industry for for years we're going to tell the ones we're allowed to tell all their names with how do we do in order to protect the innocent um but it's still are right so do you what's your dream moment\nAh my latest oh [laughter]\nI'm In LA back again it was on I was representing the seller and buyer and a transaction Andy buyer close to own a home they sold their home and another state we're closing on a Monday at eleven am a ...\nAnd just following up within that morning just a quick hey see a little bit making sure they knew when they were going she just commented I verified the wires and the wife had come initiate but there was a strange little extra five thousand dollars wired\nAs she goes oh yeah that was in a big deal the taxes are messed up we didn't get all the money from closing so which is why it's Lenny from another account\nSo I said okay thank you very much hung up and immediately called my local end we're working with us and my lender was amazing and pulled a rabbit out of the hat 'cause normally that would make a transaction come to a screeching halt for at least a couple of days to verify the funds [noise]\nBut um we were able to come to the closing at eleven AM and know what was the wiser so it really helps to have partners you're working with throughout the transaction um but that is a very big deal funds are always verified\nYeah the the game of hide and see these days does not work well in the lending business right we're not two thousand and four anymore where we didn't verify anything or ask for any documentation and we clearly saw the results of that we nearly\nMelted the economic world so you know things are a little different we verify everything and so that trail that Tracey at all of that has to be verified and as you said usually it's not a problem with the communication the full knowledge and\nIt was their money they didn't do anything wrong it's just an account they had not put down as we're funds were coming from for the closing\nAnd I you know you brought up something and this is really more specific to this time and it just it it came off when you said at wires and show you might be able to even talk about this there's wire fraud out there going on right now the buyers and sellers need to know about where people are going into email accounts\nSending what looks like an email from a closing attorney or maybe a real estate agent saying oh something's changed on your closing Here's New information do and here's where to send the money\nFictitious money's gone disappears to God Knows where um and it's a big deal people are losing get lots and lots of money so sure could you because you've probably seen at the most\nDo um and we will probably do an entire segment on it at that point because there's a lot there\nUm but uh it it happens a lot so with a firm of our size we see one every week or two where someone has tried in a transaction involving are from it's usually the actual parties email or the realtors unfortunately the realtors email\nUsually the closing attorneys and the lenders are dealing with a little bit more secure systems for communication some of them unfortunately are not\nUm but most are I Will say that the one thing that people really need to pay attention to is that they're sending money they need to make sure that the account they're sending it to matches that closing attorney that they're supposed to be using because a lot of times\nBy our money coming to us when it's intercepted the the account they're sending it to makes no sense it it's an individual's name at something crazy\nOr the other thing is that if you're a seller and you want your proceeds wired which a lot of our sellers do if you're getting five six figures and proceeds it's just easier for you to get that wire just come to closing and bring a copier checkbook with you bring a copy of the wire instructions do not email these things around do not\nDo not have the impression that anything in your email account is actually secure because it used to be that when people hacked your account they would spam all of the people in your contacts that's not what they do now they sit in your account and they read all of your communications\nThey know enough about the transaction to pretend to be you and to communicate with the other parties\nAnd and to redirect money so don't bring it for us for our from we have a secure upload that's in the signature line of our emails so that people can just send things to securely\nWe don't want your Social Security numbers going out the e mail we don't want your PIN code for your bank accounts we don't want your banking account we don't want any of those things going through email and also pick up the phone and call people if something doesn't feel right\nCommunicate communicate and get ... I you know I I just thought of it when Kelley was talking about wires out port that's been but I I agree Cheryl maybe next week we we talk about that 'cause it's a big deal absolutely um [noise]\nSo you know we're wanted out our first show a a a blast hopefully our listeners uh enjoyed uh some of the information we're able to show hopefully somebody picked up on a trip or two that makes him a better by or a better seller make better decisions I'm Kelly were working folks fondue what's the best way to track you down\nA best way to go to the Atlanta find homes dot com website and you can just type in Kelly trash and you'll just pop right now will pop right up because you're a pretty big deal I mean you know\nI'm a ... yes [laughter] Cheryl somebody's thinking about the property taxes

somewhere who has my name as well\nUm but feel free to to reach out to us we're there to help and uh also just wanted to to give a little shout out to our veterans I Know it's veterans weekend this weekend so\nI'm thank you for your service you guys do homes for heroes we do do home sort of heroes we we support our first responders out there which includes military but it also includes doctors and nurses and teachers and all of those others that are considered first responder\nSo our friendship has always been strong\nBut on the field were both we're both leaders and I tell me all the time and leadership as lonely you know there's no there's a reason there's only a few but both of us were very demanding\nA of our teammates and the accountability we held a very high standards um but we will compete with each other I mean we would we would hold each other accountable and there are some things out there on YouTube and other places where you'll see he\nHad a fight on the field argued a practice\nAnd and we will go at it but we challenge each other and and you know as as the worst iron sharpens hire we we truly believe that and and we would we would work on each other and and and\nDemand a lot of each other and we work together throughout the week for for pre game the blitz pickups run game and he was always the guy that I think I I respect as so much about him is whatever he would ask you if you he would have already done it himself so he was never going to ask you anything that he wouldn't do or be willing to do\nAnd when we were always prepping\nFor games we would talk about the run game and he asked me what runs I like\nWell you know if he had to check on what what are you won't be a check them into and um and we had those conversation but what I appreciate it so much about that was\nIt didn't have to be his way he just wanted to know what you want it and why and as long as you could stand by it he\nWould he would try to put you into play that he knew was best for the football team\nAnd he put us in our run game and a lot of really good favorable situations\nAnd uh and we wouldn't want to football games because of it and and vice versa end up passing game you know I I was I was a call to make all the offensive line is that that case that involved the tide in the running backs were our protection\nWas anything I wanted to switch us into he was always comfortable with and we made sure that we were on the same page there was very little confusion throughout our career on what we want to get done and I tried to make it as easy as I could on him in the past and the same way you did and the run game and that's why we we work so well together\nI guess just vanity and he was Peyton Manning center with the Indianapolis\nCoats highlight being winning a Super Bowl ring and a half pound point is is that today you can say I have a ring fall I saw some\nI mean you know we we like I said we were we were I think we're the most a winning team a decade 'em by many games we won\nA but but the reality is you get measured so much about those rings you know and you hear about New England patriots that we'll do our nemesis was through those years um and so it was it was really good to get one and I wish I'd gotten too although a lot to do pay wishes he to got three a do or for\nWhatever it was but um you know it was one of those things where\nFor whatever reason we wouldn't match up most of the teams we lost two ended up winning you know we lost to Pittsburgh one year they won the super bowl we lose the New England a couple of times they won the super bowl that year so it was it like we're losing you know just some scrub teams you know we lost some really good football teams and so when you get to the play offs and the NFL\nYeah it there's a ... it's a game of attrition you never know where you're going to be from a health perspective or what it all looks live or what's playing what's what's going well for you and what's not\nUm but man do one on the voice that trophy uh down in Miami beating the bears and and that's the way we did it you know we ran it for a hundred and Ninety or is that night and in the rain and Peyton Heathrow well\nUh but it was one of those things it it it's definitely a crowning achievement and it's one that you everywhere you go that's how you're identified pay way right wrong and different that's a reality and everybody wants to see the rings and\nTalk about that game in particular um but getting there and the journey getting there and having a shock to me that's what it's all about\nToday the where the ring a lot of people just keep it to be bringing in Africa especially with no sir I bring\nIt out for special occasions when I go speak often I'll wear it because I Know when people walk up they want to do pictures or meet and greets they want to see it um yeah I got a I got at Georgia State hall of fame ring is the same way I I just don't wear jewelry other than my wedding\nRing out aware much anyway and uh but I'm very proud of our them and gotten them but like you said most of the time they're sitting in a drawer somewhere or put in a box somewhere and uh\nYou know you don't really think about and and the thing about those rings is their ... their attention getters\nYeah and and are often times I Want to fly under the radar I don't necessarily want everybody to know who I think we're you know I I like that and maybe to a degree especially with my family and so ah I also don't want to bring attention\nTo myself with those things quite interesting

a young men and actually I have a girl on my team as a kicker as well so young men and women and I and I talked to about being the best they can be be the best version of you\nAnd and that's the way

game they survive you would that be a\nBad ... like ... and they're the nicest tailgate or\nYou know in Europe there for the bears a Packers you know the rivalry and all that and it's a night game and you would think those those fans would be rough on each other but they have the most all and they laugh in the parking lot there but you know they it's it's a really cool environment either in Green Bay and and you\nYou know when you everything in that town was built around this\nThis football team and it's right in the middle of town and you know there's not much else around his business and that guy thing but the homes are still there and are being environment that they bring is is a really cool experience and then throw on the frozen tundra you know all the mystique of\nBeing a Packer

is a a it was the one place that had been you know it was funny\nI went to North Carolina which was a big basketball school and even though we're really good at ... or top five in the country and what you would kind of still get overshadowed Indianapolis when I went there they started off as a as a as a race car town at a basketball town\nAnd so we really went array of what wall and\nAnd then it went to a football town so it was cool to watch that experience but when you go to Green Bay made it ain't nothing but pro football and and like you said it had that that college\nAtmosphere everybody knows yeah everybody's around you all the time you know the grocery store 'cause it's a small town but man you or your loved by the community and it's a ton of fun\nNow you're a hunter have about
