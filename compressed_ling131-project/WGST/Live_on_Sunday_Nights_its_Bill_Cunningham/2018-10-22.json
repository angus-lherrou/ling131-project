I just happened to him you know in this country that doesn't\nAh I I don't think too many of us would we leave open the front door to our house on a regular basis that's not the way the world works and so right now a regular army of Honduran migrants streaming through southern Mexico toward America\nHas made it and run this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers of straw to about ten thousand\nAnd every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do\nAnd the F. word all these things are shouted against our president they're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor board to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically\nThe media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth American Central Americans and Mexicans suddenly like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government or welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million when it come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it\nThey will permit that because if you're from other than Mexico too you know the words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of American Wedding for hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled they have enough camps they have enough judicial officers driven up floors are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago\nWe have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms do hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who not been heard yet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious\nIf you're from Mexico here legally you're going to take it right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to hear that goes on and on and on and never stops so ah I I'm interested to see when and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminal societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals\nAnd the rest there is no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California Texas ... New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders the rapes and cetera it does not exist\nRemember that nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border\nSixteen other twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming air in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy\nRight now with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea to Russia believing we're about to bust up every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip here's an economy\nExceeding five percent GDP the unemployment numbers so not just the ... they're the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work and be able to go into their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individuals there\nWas a third grade education\nEighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you went maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them according to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways\nThat the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe\nBecause according to CNN this is the issue of unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan the vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way\nThrough the magic wand\nThat we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans\nCentral Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have we're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through press says these we take in legally one point one million foreigners to come into America take the oath of office\nAnd become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together\nWe already do that one point one million but\nI'll be damned if I'm going to sit here and watch hordes of young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five to ten years from now that will never happen this has fundamentally changed our country that is far and it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen what in two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go\n... or the bridges and roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible that the most violent places on earth is sending its largely young males to come into America\nGot a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out that this is not benefit\nThem at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education doesn't benefit the hospital systems that we have\nThis benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that\nWe are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join the country come in and walk into a country which you don't belong to and not a citizen up men demand rights are you kidding me\nI'd be outrage at is deaths that was ... it should not have died\nSaudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there seven hundred black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year give me the name and your mind think give me the name of one cup right now\nI bet you can't because the media doesn't cover it you mean Jamal could show a Saudi Arabian killed in Turkey is more important to us that a brave police officer who gave his life is that what CNN\nBelieves the answer is yes they want to use ... as a cudgel against Trump and why I have no idea\nIt must have nothing else to talk

don't want ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizens who take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals come and go ... most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nIn ... in Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I

world\nIs regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much but I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia\nI mean when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalist and then I hear about could show again as if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do and why why is his life more valuable than a cubs life\nNPR

rules and regulations based on staff who\nIn many cases a grand rations old [noise] and those rules and regulations are not only planet for all\nIs there are many of them but they have a major effect on our lives and the purpose of the book that I have written is to explain that we have to rain than in in some way\nAnd it was ... when the when you when you say we have to train them in who is we\n[noise] ah well the American people have to train them in and the way to do it is so unfortunately the only way to do it is through uh the court system and that's why your point about a ... a Brett Kavanaugh having been\nA confirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the fifth road of the five of the five member majority who would be interested in raining in the administrative state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the IRS but you're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats about about one point two million strong new everyday made in offices mainly in Washington memorial all over the country\nAnd then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they sort of not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers and then they issue these three thousand new rules a day now must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nWhere I think it's causing a lot of harm in the sense that for a business is of course\nIt creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with compliance activities are very extensive for businesses one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each near it car who ... dollars to comply with government regulations\nThough that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on cruel other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses produce so\nThat's an important factor and in fact a trillion dollars there's more than the government actually tax rates are either from businesses or from individuals each year\nBut this is a very significant thing but it can be turned back town they can be reduced give me hold on\nThe idea here and described in the book is that the courts can step in and began to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nUm the rules are based on laws that were passed years ago sometimes generations ago and they are in ... by the administrative agency to give them the authority to all these new rules\nAnd the court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you've gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority that make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where are you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so\nIf the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called conditional forward it to they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agency [noise] then we can actually beginning to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington", "year":
