said no problem I Believe in what you're doing\nAnd I said this to him I said look either concerning twenty sixteen now when you got elected you were going to be like in New York Republican kind of a

at the bottom\nAnd then later on we have a Bill O'Reilly coming up and also a diamond in silk or I think fabulous and diamond in silk reminded me\nHit 'em on two or three months ago about how dangerous it is for an African American to step out of line and not to be a liberal Democrat there is no more loyal partisan voting bloc in America than African Americans especially African American women\nThey both like Ninety six percent democratic African American men vote about Ninety percent but there's no more loyal part isn't good for the Democratic party than African Americans\nEspecially for American women some as diamond in silk about that but what happened Tuesday and Wednesday I think a ... was in the White House I might have been Tuesday or Wednesday\nAnd CNN hundreds Jeff Zucker viciously in racially using pejorative racial terms racism attacked Kanye West\nBut courage sellers\nIs a former Democratic office holder and South Carolina now he's a paid contributor to CNN said about Kanye West quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nSo he's you know he said he's illiterate stupid he went on to say quote Donald Trump is going to use it in pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures but then it gets worse CNN said terrorists ...\nWho's a coins herself as a former Republican said quote this ... this is an African American woman talking quote black folks are about to trade Kanye and the racial draft they've had it with him he's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro\nOf the Trump Administration unquote\nSo you have an African American paid commentator saying number\nOne she is speaking for all black Americans black folks are about to trade Tanya the racial draft they had it with him as she spoken to thirty five million blacks and that's what they tell her and and it really couldn't it got much worse so racism was used by CNN\nShe went on to say quote no one should take ... seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized unquote Jimmy Kimble\nSaid that he's irrational and the madman snoop doggy dog a doggy citizen Uncle Tom and so entertainers comics late night\nAnd Mike's have gone after in the past Clarence Thomas and Jesse ... Peterson and Colin Powell and Benjamin Carson in ... and others for being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have\n... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest\nThe Democrats have consistently opposed go choice trapping kids and failing public schools for generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which is destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro after policies\nWhich have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats or crippled a black families by embracing welfare writes the penalized married couples who get married it goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all said in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon who laughed with venomous ... and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they wouldn't be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such clean and you know when you think back in history\nWhich CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and\nThe pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly punished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners head to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist arm of the Democratic party to intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy any political activities\nOf the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten a democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard later on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats\nCodify into law the idea of literacy test and other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause the ... media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control weight while I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low\nCriminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter\nOf black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party and he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so what happened and Kanye West\nIs the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese are rice to any black who steps out of line they're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill\nBy Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN debate employed against a black man if he does and express\nThe right political viewpoints that is why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them\nThe truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional that black families completely broken\nThere's no job creation the average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line and begins to express support\nFor a different political outlook he has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book\nBecause it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in line they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm can you think a worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime\nAnd poverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nMedia want you to think the president's not responding directly to the murder maybe of a Saudi Arabian and his damn bowl\nIt as if the six or seven hundred blacks killed in Chicago every year can't be used at all by the mainstream media against Trump's they ignored or the four thousand shot they can't be used\nIn Chicago to attack the president so they ignore it but whatever the media can find some ... some club to hit the president what they're going to do it\nLet's continue with more coming up next as my interview with the president doesn't know the top of the last to our Web Bill O'Reilly their rally factor is on tonight also in about an hour or so\nWe have diamonds Silverman are going to call in from the Carolinas to talk about how to black women support someone like Donald Trump when the media attacks blacks who get jump out of one but it's like a southern slave owners would keep blacks are dumb down and illiterate that's the goal of the modern\nDemocratic Party to keep them in line\nWith continue thirty minutes after they are still counting of the great American live with you [noise] every something [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nNBC News radio I'm deem you two former CIA director John Brennan is suggesting that Saudi Arabia is likely behind the disappearance of Washington Post journalist ...\nPrepared when there is video evidence of him being at the conflict the Saudi costs let a diplomatic mission of the full control of Saudi Arabia so they're denials like ring hollow\nBrennan made the comments on NBC's Meet the press any if Washington Post journalist you mall 'cause show gay disappeared in Turkey then there would be plausible deniability on the part of the Saudi Government\nHe says it's up to the Saudis to explain now what actually happened air force personnel feeling courage despite the devastating damage to handle Airforce base in Florida following hurricane Michael\nIn a news conference today us secretary of air force Heather Wilson said recovery efforts are underway at the base and progress is being made\nShe said civilians who work on the base or an administrative leave for now so they'll still be getting pay and benefits\nMichael tour through the base as a category for hurricane tearing roofs off hangers and decimated surrounding facilities California's four oh five freeway closed in the San Fernando valley near Los Angeles because of a bad bus crash\nCalifornia how patrol says the bus crashed in several vehicles reports slam right through the center divider medium LA fire department tweeted that forty people checked out for injuries twenty five of those were sent to the hospital five people in serious condition\nFor Phoenix mayor and current congressional candidate Greg Stanton is safe after men armed with the hatchet robbed him outside of a restaurant than was approached by a man yielding a hatch it outside of tire rama restaurant\nThe suspect demanded stands wallet who then threw it at the man and ran back inside representatives stand says he's in good spirits after the incident police search for the suspect were unable to locate him you're listening to the latest from NBC News radio U.

great for us we fixed it\nAnd sold it for more money and er it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city\nLet's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and who was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do but we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like just seems like all the time we're bringing back people\nAnd uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion and

wants to go to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there\nTalk about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa well she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go\nAnd see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise] but uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty\nA it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful\nThey loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just it's one of the human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on me\nAnd the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we'll with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they would say so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our

remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt

million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out

up we uh eleven hundred and sixty four you underserved remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick of it by a garden that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there no\nAnd knocked it down about six months ago a really yellow and gone the whole thing including the garbage and everything's on what's going to happen with the back of the housing development oh okay\nGood but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city\nLet's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was that it gets back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do but we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people\nAnd uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion and uh we got him back and he's going to be safer shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll be at the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted a back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure as very happy right now about your wife who go to Africa sure which is unbelievable\nWhat happened there talk about what was the goal and what was accomplished with\nMaloney in Africa well she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good stuff but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful\nThey loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just it's one of the human basis they needed and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade deal\nAnd we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out [noise]\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and its works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make and I said we're going to tax you cars coming in then what happened and they made a deal made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton to remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with southwest surprised\nHow many jobs and talking to my every time I can or Mexico we're talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff to make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they are they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in the audience and we charge him essentially no tax to sort of ... percent but for the most part they don't even on elected", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Live on Sunday Nights its Bill Cunningham", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "15"}
