gun Democrats use\n'em if I'm sure it's the same and other states but okay there's a [noise] a woman running against our income incumbent a congressman are are the income and is a a Republican very pro gun guy\nAnd this woman Kathleen Williams is a Democrat that says oh I'm a gun owner and I'm a hunter and she says I own a a twelve ... twelve gauge whatever its or semi auto shotgun\nImagine she uh you know use it to hunt bird with or something but she also wants to ban a our fifth kings\nYeah and and I remember even\nWhere you know here's the anytime couldn't politician says well I I Believe in the second I support to Sacramento\nBut [noise] yeah well it means forget everything I said before because I really don't believe in more do I want to support the second amendment because I Do want to take your guns away in this case and that's an old boys have been on a hunter\nOr you know what every time I hear politicians are off with that I Know that he or she is\nTrying to ... because it has nothing to do with hunting I don't care if you're a hunter show me your concealed carry permit\nI Want to see that show me you're a are Fifteen show me when we're gone shooting because the rest of it means nothing to me the fact that you're a hunter that's just pretend that probably doesn't even I won't tell you probably just not even have a hunting license\nI uh by the way I also called my Republican senators office\nAnd uh [noise] old tried to kill him you know through his employees to uh to prosecute these people that were the wires in in the um the cabinet case you know take the take all the Democrats to task\nAnd and uh you know lock\nThem I I yeah I Would love to have an investigation say okay how did this a confidential information get leaked who didn't who had copies of who had copies of\nA doctor Ford's letter who released that a track him down hold him responsible because here's the deal if the Republicans won't do that they don't know how to lead they don't know how to win now will say I will\nGive them credit and appreciate the call they did win this one and they played the politics the way it had to be played and it was driving this through Craig's list those of us who are watching to go help my God you guys are driving me crazy you know kids who just well they did where they had to do okay and\nThey are playing a game that has a set of rules some of us don't really understand if you're not there you can't quite understand it All right hey if you're on hold right now don't go anywhere okay 'cause I'm going to get you straight into the afro jokes there's I take this next break if you're going to have to leave us now here's what I Want to say\nLet your centers no if they voted for judge Kavanaugh that you appreciate let them know that you're going to support them and their reelection campaign because that's where it is and it's time to figure out what your level of commitment is is if we're not committed\nLose lose litter the he said the money money right it is you know what human volunteer he is all your friends are allowed to six people register to vote for those probably laces mostly\nIn fact even our best girlfriend said it didn't happen unbelievable every one of her witnesses either refuted her story I had no memory of the gathering question also the therapists notes never really came out accepted the Washington Post the Washington Post said that for originally claimed or for boys\nWho tried tried to rape her\nNot one but for boy she said she said she was in her late teens\nAnd then she switched it back to Fifteen Years old she said it happened in the mid Nineteen eighties then you switch that back to Nineteen eighty two practical everything she said turn out to be false now you got to be kind to the woman because she's a allegedly a survivor of sexual assault\nBut part of the deal is when you make certain assertions and if they're refuted as they were by Brett Kavanaugh you got to prove it supposedly she was terrified of small spaces\nTerrified of airplanes then find out from a boyfriend that they want on John's together basically all over the globe she went to Costa Rica\nShe went to Hawaii she went to ah the south Pacific Island she went to a French Polynesia she went to Israel she went to Central America as you went to Europe all by being terrified of airplanes\nThe board front also said during the six years that he dated her in a sworn statement to the Senate committee she never mentioned a sexual assault never mentioned the name Brett Kavanaugh will shed no fear of flying in fact the flu around islands on single propeller airplanes sitting next to each other\nLet's see uh the the second door theory was a bunch of crap because he came out that they wanted to second door in their home in twenty eight four years before the therapy session because she wanted to provide an entrance to\nHer therapist to conduct their business as a psychologist inside of her home\nShe also coached a friend about how to take a polygraph test she lied about that\nShe also a stole money from the boyfriend so all these things that she said Dr Christina forward simply fell apart and now yesterday or today her lawyer Deborah attach came out to say that she doesn't want to pursue the Kavanaugh thing anymore really she's done with it so\nMedia turned out to be liars and thieves and crooks and miscreants every every description\nThe second accuser Debbie ...\nA dusting off the memories polling of Bill Clinton on her as a freshman in college no one supported horror story either she gave for names the FBI they checked out the stories of ... Ramirez shaking his junk and her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer Michael Evan Eddie boy he did a great job for the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous\nAntithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact the cast light away from\nAway from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... put it on sweat Nick nobody believed in fact here's a quote from Senator Collins on Saturday quote some of the allegations Lebanon against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important I'm\nThinking in particular\nOf the allegations raised by professor forward but at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple of girls and use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape\nThis outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parrot it public statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote\nSo said Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael Evan Eddie is doing a great job representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it plus uh as far as\nSupporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ...\n... I read some way of a experts and independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on wood 'cause it's been on my show many times wrote a column a ... this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin ... she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe the survivors of sexual assault it it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting at a rate matter\nMy sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure they're correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rapist to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns\nAnd Van Dyke Perry who spent a combined thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted she lied or how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty or not\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock of American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process and fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward they completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down to Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that his wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans\nAnd show you where we are Steven cold there of the Late Show has a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this or the Drudge Report this evening\nAerial doom is aerial do much to say writer on Stephen ... bears the Late Show on CBS she wrote\nAt six thirty six pm on Saturday quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote you see this was never about finding the truth about professor forward she was used like a three dollar steak\nBy a Senator Feinstein and others to make public private information that she wanted to keep private because she fit their diatribe it is unbelievable ... and this writer for the CBS Evening show\nStephen Colbert Errol Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad re ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life\nThey want it to ruin am for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now to try to dig out from their own rubble for coming midterms suddenly they very well can the Republican conservative majority and now we're more energized the vote than we've ever been because of the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue to take your calls we have thousands on hold millions or lessening the heroes of this fight didn't think I'd ever say this Senator Susan Collins is a hero\nLindsey Graham is a hero Mitch McConnell is a hero unbelievable the losers the mainstream media pedaling in lives in irrelevant sees Senate Democrats demon crashes demon rats and some of them call them the Senate demon rats\nAnd Michael ... who's a loser in a sense but I Want that got to continue appearing with Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon every night you can put 'em on ...\n[noise] [noise] forty below the [noise]\nNBC News radio special report the Kavanaugh vote the Republican Party boss believes justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation will help GOP candidates in November\n... across the board and house and Senate race or fourth phone it back to their ballot Park Maryland it was ... they ... they run around\nMe McDaniel tells Fox News Sunday Kavanaugh's confirmation will help Republican candidates in the Senate races and hurt house candidates in swing districts and the Kavanaugh hearing just highlighted how important this election is for them Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the confirmation of Supreme Court justice breaks\nHaving on his his proudest moment as a senator the Kentucky Republican said he believes the most important thing to send it is involved in is lifetime appointments to the court Senator McConnell refused to rule out pushing through another Supreme Court nomination and Trump's final\nYear of his term if a vacancy arose steam you Tio NBC News radio weather on TALK radio six forty double duty as tea\nFor CBS forty six year old and just knowing how I look for in recent ... overnight temperatures warm only influence Saturday by Monday morning Monday afternoon the crowds will continue to live and keeping temperatures slightly cooler ties were top out early in the\nMid eighties will see a few scattered showers across the area on Monday watch for an increase in the rain this week thanks to tropical storm Michael expected to arrive later this week for CBS forty six different meteorologist smelling the column\nOr radio is the ease of use that for music and\nDownload the free I hard radio ... today [noise]\nReally counting as the great American I'm not I'm not felt this good in so many years I Can't stand them\nTo rely upon Susan Collins and Lindsey\nGraham to be the key voices United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold bacon in the night she was brilliant going over for forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I tried to listen to Lisa Murkowski you made no sense at all\nIt seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not have listened to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees in the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of ah Brett Kavanaugh as his wife his mom and dad is girls\nAnd what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness and title nine that's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl\nOf some sexual assault the most likely did not happen to get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accuser is all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was the title nine case in which the allegation was made\nAnd therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything forward said fell apart\nIncluding the four eyeball witnesses including her river version of the facts from her twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years but she ought to\nBut now a clowns and fools to come out of the woodwork to light Valerie Jarrett open ... fame to run against or in Maine have asked\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThank bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party pornography industry if you don't mind sure yeah do you know the Democrats claim to care about women\nBut uh over the years or one of their largest supporters has been the pornography industry and I'm just wondering if they really cared about women why did they take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael ever noted the porn lawyer and I I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael Lebanon is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky my having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they they didn't have one criminal prosecution against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff this pilot stuff you see out there\nTurn a porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars that the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in subjugate any women\nTo lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women than their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate and Minnesota and they're really cared about women and sexual assault\nBill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and joining sixteen if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to these people because uh you know the fact of the boy who cried wolf now nobody is going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nWell or if a woman comes forward with a probably eight or nine times out of ten it is correct\nBut every now and then you have Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UVA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor Ford I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow did you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses\nTell me about that second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things Lewis turned out to be a lie or misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen when she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth\nAnd she said in twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist that she was a attempted rape by four boys in her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kavanaugh is because he was one boy\nAnd by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore it moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fair but that it was Kevin Oh but they but the notes of the therapists clearly indicated it could not have been Brett Kavanaugh you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth you're not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when Israeli or left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist and twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she sat in twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\n[noise] if you're a business owner using a local phone

calls let's go to a Bob and the great state\nOf Maryland Bob in Maryland Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Bob how are you\nA great bill great to be with you and I have three things that I think we all my keep in mind as we go to the polls in November one is that just like you mentioned this woman who says that the junk care what happened she is glad she room Brett Kavanaugh's lights went off of what\nThe left and the Democrats have indeed done to others they try to do to Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh will they will try and do to us if they can the second thing is is that all of mine this entirely destructive behavior of attacking institutions people the people of constructive in ten of these things about our society\nIt really to the bill is nothing less than the continued some version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties [laughter]\nWith the communist and their attempt to undermine us from within and I don't think we see that but I think if we do it will provide a great context for the situation that we're in your Catholic as my or are you aware of this terrible a present state of revelations in the\nSex abuse is and the official cover up\nThat that was actually very much started by the communists\nWell whatever it was it's all those laws and well she'll be able to do and now let me\nTell you this Joseph Stalin the mass murder and Soviet dictator wanted the church undermined from within to neutralize the\nCemeteries and to eliminate the healing power of the church that have the freedom power of the church\nIn this country a woman named ... died who was a member of the Communist Party starting in the Nineteen twenties but late twenties and for Twenty years I introduced into the seminary placed in the American Catholics seminaries\nOne thousand one hundred men who were communists ended up or no overload faith or morals and according to the plot many who was a sexually deviant one that was established then successive waves bought it more of these people and they work their way into the priest to it and ultimately into the higher or\nI may say this if the devil themselves\nWant it to destroy the Roman Catholic faith he would have done exactly what many praised had been doing that past forty or fifty years and I want to go to deep and it is but if the devil himself wanted to destroy Catholicism the devil could not done done a better job than what I see going on\nLet's continue now with Patricia and the great state of Florida Patricia go ahead you're on the bill Cunningham show Patricia go ahead\nOn wind up to the kind of thing I think you want to kind of thing I could get hit by time going fine people on it they name comes kept throwing sabotage it Lynn\nI think that they want an adopted Clinton thing and I had\nA pretty interesting isn't it wonderful that the Republican Party\nWhich has become conservative of late and the president has individuals like Dianne Feinstein Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin to run against\nAnd Blumenthal of Connecticut the war hero isn't it wonderful to have someone like Elizabeth Warren to run against I mean you couldn't pick these caricatures any better\nIt ... you know I don't come in and got caught in the game and crack the demon rats\nAnd why they have mental problems and a lot of rain it they take their personal background alive and that they can get anything anything they want to people and I really hope they come up with the women I haven't minding my own health like yet they\nCan you can limelight like any thing and I pray for them on this one yet though is when the wind up for\nHow 'bout how 'bout how 'bout senator Collins me well what she did what Susan Collins about three o'clock yesterday afternoon was fabulous and watch\nAnd Lindsey Graham played golf the president today and and to watch and Mitch McConnell I mean this guy has bought my loyalty for the next two or three years I Love ...
