I mean\n... amazing oh yeah it it it's all so much better than it was Twenty years ago if you weren't there then you can appreciate how good everything is that indeed ... absolutely the case it is\nAll right I I tell you what you got a range report we still have room for you we can get you had eight six six talked\nGun something that you have purchased even if it's something you had it for a long time you take it out to arrange for having some fun with it or\nIt's had the experience of introducing somebody to shoot [noise] we always like to hear about those how does it go how'd you set it up and guns do you put into their hands\nAgain he's six six talk down brushes [noise]\nAtlanta jingle bomb twenty Eighteen presented by capital what happened on December ...\nKilling men do we

technician we are the aviation Institute a maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trained tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight bad the [noise]\n\nHere with a re Elgin where's looks that are looking at some stories lose one of them is this a Hurricane Florence is about the hammer or North Carolina is one of those deals where uh people see what's\nHappening with guns where you know what we got to watch it it er during Hurricane Katrina when everything stops there's no support network has no police ... says nobody there to help your ... your on your own and\nA lot of people looked at that when he honey I think maybe we ought to buy a gun you think absolutely you know it's like okay what are we going to do and I was asked people what your point where are you going to do well you will will call for help well first of all the cell phones are not going to work because all the towers are down\nThere's no electricity and oh yeah it's like Katrina the police are not there anymore either right you're just there so so you know if you and I'm not saying you have to arm you know to your take on the world\nBut it's probably not a bad idea to think about things like that and it's a multi level preparedness you know you got your water you got your food you got to know your firearms ... toilet paper\nAnd emergency style serious but I got to have that so yeah if you're if you're in the past there take it seriously\nOr get ready right now like as in today before the sun goes down ... serious about it because uh twenty four hours before it hits there's nothing left on a trend in stores that's backed by right you know it just just that way trust me as a Louisiana resident I can attest to all that and I can also tell you how to get rid of hurricanes\nOf that about four years ago I bought a big hole house generator ha we've not had hurricane since I got all prepared\nBefore the power goes out were there but in a hunker down at my house that makes them it's like every number Elena never rain a good match it is magic bail 'em right we're talking one of the things about the quality of guns and try to explain to people you don't understand\nThere may be seeing the machinery that's got a lot to do with oh of course it does yes because you don't rely on hand people\nWe used to have an artist and then it got hard to get artisans because you couldn't find anybody who's willing to apprentice for ten years straight to learn how to make stuff like that right 'cause I Want it right now which might break ha ha you know and so a with a CNC machines that make parts that are absolutely interchangeable I mean they're\nCharged perfect but they're pretty close to\nPerfect well it some more so than others but at the the overall average of quality has gone up so exponentially it's ... it's just insane and um yeah no you're you're you're going to find one this maybe not this perfect better odds are so much better today than they were\nWell and if you do have a problem if you do have something that's not working right there I think that's happened is the phone or your days loophole I've been dead for an hour guarantee but that's pretty much true across the board now if you are for gun maker has product and it happens they get out and go hey this is not working\nHours tell people don't complain to everybody called the company because they want to fix it exactly and if you're if you're on your factors you want to know\nHa ha or the worst thing in the world is for somebody to tell all of his friends for the next two months about how bad this was one single phone call go solve the problem\nAnd they had on the the the doctor who understands saved his life from the emergency room in Pittsburgh Allegheny General Hospital and not a doctor is Jewish\nAnd the two nurses who first arrived at the same to save the rotten filthy life for Robert powers are Jewish\nHow serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers\nAnd if I was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first and deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor my\nGod and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know\nWhere are the people he communicated with\nWas he on friend that was ... who else knew what he was saying the things he was saying\nAnd and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great\nFriend of Israel and Bowers also headed Trump because Trump is the only American president in history that Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka has become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah\nOrthodox Jew the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions as I have\nAnd so this guy who\nAh hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post will not exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo oh one headline Saturday yesterday and the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post\nThat are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they are not in fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from the ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help it's unbelievable on that day\nAnd in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know was a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that stimulated the stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama I Want to know\nThe media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor said Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson\nAttempt at the masses assassination of Republican members of Congress resulting in a motor wounds to Stephen ...\nThe Washington Post the next day\nRan a story\nAbout stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow so instead of focusing on\nFact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and he was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people there have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or ... sending envelopes filled with white powder so many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like sex or a defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it\nBecause all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an ID cruise chased out to restaurants and also when Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant\nA Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Brett Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote an word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nAnd sell them on the right committing acts of violence that is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion is Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up his trumpet he stabbed to death and people plug\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam on big in the anti Semite set a large rally that Jews are termites and thousands in attendance applauded and cheered calling juice termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to ed pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight not to allow the public to know that he was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago\nAnd that that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgust me\nI Hope soon very soon but a few hours is killed either a by lethal injection ... heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way it Timothy McVeigh for violence and Bowers\nWas a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh\nThe whole thing is disgusting when you get your reaction plus we're gonna have later on David re a fair to talk about what's happening on the southern border is anyone thought about the public health crisis caused\nWear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments\nOn the other side where those protesting he was not referring to the white nationalist carrying tiki torches shouting racial and ethnic slurs at night in Charlottesville there's no good people among that group you cannot be a good man or a good woman shouting racial or Jewish lawyers\nAnd the southern city at night carrying torches there's no good coming from that that is blatant racism and that's wrong\nWas continuing we'll get your calls from the coast in Wisconsin Ohio Indiana Illinois Nevada Florida New York and California by the way the\nBoston Red Sox are bought 'em in the seventh inning of four to one [noise]\nBecause Andrew bent attendees a friend of mine who was left field\nFor the red Sox I'm rooting for the red Sox\nThose continuous more [noise] still counting and the great American your calls her next live with you\n\n\nTalk radio six forty billion G.
