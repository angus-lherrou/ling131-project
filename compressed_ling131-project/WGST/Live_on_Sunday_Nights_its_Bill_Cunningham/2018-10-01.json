I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kinda look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to get conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after ah a doctor forwarded testified the the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForce testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listener delivery delivery of those words and talk about the assault on the impact that at our life\nAnd not have your heart go out to her this is a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ended up ... generally I'll respect said I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible Karl Rove\nThe great political theorist it forward as a credible unbelievable\nSo when when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and they're still in as the Democrats showed toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely ... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo Tono and Karl Rove saying that a woman who's credible\nWho provided witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhen you have ah Christine Ford\nStraight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman who wants to anonymity to testify\nTurn down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out or lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all\nSo every time I Try to test her credibility Megan bars it turns out to be great grossly lacking so when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way\nRight I think we were paying to Colorado yeah completely lost our way because he went on telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nUh the people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to your testimony that the women and men I sound Brett Kavanaugh people even though there was such a notion from both the accused in a man who in the end the call\nThe public opinion and they aren't days leading up to this quote unquote hearing I his life with completely turned upside down his wife was getting death threats\nAnd that his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed as well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her or she obviously has been in therapy for decades or she sat herself she has two front doors you know anybody that has to climb\nDoorbell no there's no snow so obviously\nShe hadn't issues\nNow just because she says something happened doesn't happen\nAnd we have plenty of examples that or just because she says Brett Kavanaugh rate there it maybe not but all the evidence that she's present itself are all sort of being evidence\nIn fact if you present innocent of Cornwall in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girl friendly when guys or\nWho have no motivation align are allied all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the ... with Brett Kavanaugh and Christine forward he said it did now they'll get discount Marts judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did in wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president being twenty sixteen what the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court one of his name wasn't on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Rock Karl Rove and all the time is up I don't know because\n... ... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case that fell short of being an assault case however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility in order to present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to be the Post's let me tell you something\nI wasn't given lawyers from the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves okay it was a very uncomfortable and hearing song it talks about equal rights and gender equality what do you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a man as a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person so to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily colds and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly us that we find out she was all over the world ah and also just the holes in our story said thank thank God for people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh", "show_name":
