is lonely you know there's no there's a reason there's only a few but both of us were very demanding a of our teammates and the accountability we held a very\nA standard um but we were compete with each other I mean we would we would hold each other accountable and there are some things out there on YouTube and other places where you'll see he had a fight on the field arguing a practice\nAnd and we will go at it but we challenge each other and and you know as as the worst I earned sharpens I or we we truly believe that and and we would we would work on each other and and and demand a lot of each other we work together throughout the week for for pre game the blitz pickups\nRun game and he was always the guy the guy I respect as so much\nAbout him is whatever he would ask you if you he would have already done it himself so he was never going to ask you anything that he wouldn't do or be willing to do and when we were always prepping\nFor games would talk about the run game and he asked me what runs I like\nWell you know if he had to check on what what do you want me to check them into and um and we had those conversation but what I appreciate it so much about that was\nIt didn't have to be his way he just wanted to know what you want it and why and as long as you could stand by it\nHe would he would try to put you into play that he knew was best for the football team\nAnd he put us in our run game and a lot of really good favorable situations\nAnd uh and we want a lot of football games because of it and and vice versa I end up passing game you know I I was I

to get one and I wish I'd gotten to all the\nUh but I Do pay wishes he the guy in three or four\nOr whatever it was but um you know it was one of those things where\nFor whatever reason we wouldn't match up most of the teams we lost two ended up winning them you know we lost to Pittsburgh one year they won the super bowl we lose the New England a couple of times they won the super bowl that year so it was it like we're losing you know as soon as you grow up teams you know we've lost some really good football teams and so\nWhen you get to the play offs and the NFL\nYeah it there's a ... it's a

everything in that town was built around this\nThis football team and it's right in the middle of town and you know there's not much else around other businesses that guy thing but the homes are still there and uh be environment that they bring is is a really cool experience and then throw on the frozen tundra\nBut you know all of the mystique of being a Packer and the snow when the nasty weather

overshadowed\nIndianapolis when I went there it started off as a as a as a race car town at a basketball town\nAnd so we really went a re a with wall and and then it ... to ... all town so it was cool to watch that experience but when you go to Green Bay made it ain't nothing but pro football and and like you said has that that child edge atmosphere everybody knows yet everybody is around you all the time you know the grocery store because it's a small town\nBut man you are you are a lot by the community and it's a ton of fun\nNow your hunger have about living in Green Bay for a guy who's
