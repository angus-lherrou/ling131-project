{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Following advertisements I Dream products he's not an evaluating by the FDA not intend to design those trees to over any diseases\nWelcome once again to help line by purity products\nOn your host mark Simone so glad you could joined us today it's a power pack program in fact our story originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated\nAudiences around North America with a special segment of the French paradox\nYou remember the French paradox this is the counter intuitive concept that says\nRed wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes to control our weight or energy healthy aging and even longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find\nOut of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was was the ritual yes was we were told the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field to help the age you\nKnow our guest today says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce Robert Twenty years Dr precedent is an institutional New York radio host in his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a longtime products formulated and high level advisor for purity products that your freshman welcome aboard\nMark always great speaking to you\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's touch and this was very tall phenomenon those people out there who just to vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... and why is it all over the news today well\nFirst of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals a weekend every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically resveratrol is what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine that's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found and peanuts\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when ... was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish well anything that extends the life of anything is going to pick the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well\nBy two thousand six Italian scientist discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and it even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex and here's what really got them interested\nA Harvard researcher David Sinclair report about resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet in mice by thirty percent now given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and even seem to protect the intestines and the colon it definitely supported normal ... activity in the body it improved indoor ends\nThere was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring storing aerobic activity and it even proved to support brain function great\nStudy from Weill Cornell Medical school in New York I was just reading that an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived threat like not eating enough caloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they called the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the tape according to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard now this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWow this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years of their co Q. formulas but now that feature co enzyme Q. ten would you say is just as important as residents role especially for your heart health and you'll see in some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs co Q. ten and what exactly is a good four\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak of water co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects\nWell co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's a while ago well I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point and that this is Nineteen sixty three\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin\nWhere they were looking for what makes the heartbeat they were literally looking at hearts and saying what is making this darn thing beat well they found out that was co Q. ten and that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell\nWins himself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nSo we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of co Q. ten and your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten you're living in what we call an energy deficient state your heart and eats co Q. ten\nIn fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right in your heart muscle\nYour brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system it supplies energy to your lungs to your liver\nSo needless to say we all of this energy that case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty you got less than fifty\nPercent of the co Q. ten in your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I ...\nThat's summarized co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential I mean you could eat sardines and mackerel and peanuts we're co Q. ten comes from but it's not going to be enough just from your diet\nWell Dr person I understand that you told purity actually quite a bit of research that it was time to combine these two groups to co Q. ten and the ... you know why he's proud of is cutting edge combination purity calls it their co Q. super boost formula what can actually do for people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact one of my students called it the advantage I like that\nSo I adopted the term it's combining to amazing nutrients unto themselves which a spectacular but when you combine them indeed this spectacular this if we can call it that this is enhance it vantage this cardiovascular advantage\nThe cardiovascular benefits benefits to your brain function and cognitive performance it even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function it's great for your skin it's great for energy and endurance and aerobic capacity and as we said before\nIt supports normal ... activity throughout your body\nAnd I think this is the ultimate combination not remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on the boat and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nBut it's interesting we're talking with Dr Allen precedent now that you present tell me more about the consequences of being co Q. ten deficient\nYeah well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class awhile ago\nWas to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire in other words if you're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine whether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions would be on the questionnaire well the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run\nDown feeling for tea you know I hear I'm running out of gas\nI got an energy crunch my batteries are law you know like that so basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is that Cain nutrient involved in energy production\nMore with our guest Dr Alan ... minute but right now already products recognize leader in the field of evidence based nutritional solutions has an incredible free bottle offered today for the first thousand color so don't miss this chance up the phone call now operators are standing by\nThe college free one eight hundred seven three six three three three

once again we're talking with Dr Alan ... now that the person we talked about the co Q. ten we talked about the ...\nBut you've added vitamin D to this and I knew there was a meeting with Dr canal from the vitamin D council and it's made me a believer would you added vitamin D and you've added vitamin D twelve yeah now many people go through life not knowing that they've got to co Q. ten deficiency with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine well I mean that's a lot of people\nAnd we found out some pretty amazing things with all of this research now listen to this when most people think of vitamin D day I think a bone on bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health and immune system activity quite dramatically in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy colon on top of all of that and a great new study out of the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and cold and health\nI mean who thinks of those things right\nYeah that's amazing so I think it's a welcome addition to this amazing formula the co Q. super boosts formula in addition to that I said\nTo channel look we should put some B. twelve and here as well let's call ... and I say that because the twelve converts the carbohydrates and proteins and fat that you're eating convert them right into energy\nAnd this is all about energy and well being so when you're sitting down to eat your breakfast or your lunch or your dinner if you don't have
