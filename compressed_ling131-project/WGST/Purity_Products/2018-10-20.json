pleasure to have a great conversation with you\nNow most of us are super busy these days we want to stay healthy but quite frankly to be ...\nYou know with all the different supplements out there now Chris you've traveled all over the world learning about different natural remedies so you really know which ingredients to look for so tell me this decides to good multi vitamin it's a visual medium you want to do things go into the street super high nutrients you've been so jazzed about we\nWill I'm happy to do that pat the three super nutrients as we like to say are a green tea extract a tumor Rick extract called Kirk human and an extract from red wine called ...\nApropos of what you said about my traveling around the world I've extensively investigated they use in their host countries so I've been in the green tea plantations of China and India and worked with top researchers of this ingredient in those countries\nWith tumor Rick I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza Vera trial I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California in ... in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that\nGreen tea Kirk human from to recruit and ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from the very very substantial way\nChristmas to talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're found in our diet in all are considered super food the green tea human human spiritual why did you want to combine does read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect do you make each other worst when you go in a real game changer well you\nKnow when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason pat to\nPut them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables\nYou don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems so they maintain\nA healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting Brezhnev era trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nLet's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing I Know when he shouldn't have been using it for thousands of years for ...\nBut what you've seen recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July ... revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti oxygen activity in whole blood unify on you recap\nSome of these headlines and show me while you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity\nIs really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume ... don't actually wind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount\nThe green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration of antioxidants substances\nWhich a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells\nOf your body your organs every part of your body from premature destruction\nDue to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue the thigh bone\nSo you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue the thigh on so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplementing gradients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nLet's switch gears and talk about this for human which is number two on us by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula would be offering free bought on a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human what'd you smelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it\nBut scientists and researchers know which one of the most\nPowerful supersedes on the planet you can positively influence our D. N. A. maintain joint comfort\nChelsea inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible headlines on human and tell us why you use this we talked about this off here a few minutes ago just patented B. C. M.

C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned\nOffers about seven times the absorption of any other ... human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion\nIs one of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just\nDecades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I Know that we turn to already bought the green tea in the human your new green T.
