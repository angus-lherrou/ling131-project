{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Hello and welcome to the show I'm your host pat Campbell we've got a fascinating program for you today or yesterday says that there is a molecule in the human body and he says this\nMolecule abuse happens to be concentrated in our skin hair eyes and joins he says this substance not only dramatically influences are appearance and their words how young are how healthy we look but more importantly our physical strength are flexibility and mobility\nThis is our ability to do things ... things get around be physical today we're going to learn more about this once mysterious substance and how new breakthroughs are allowing us to get it back and keep it\nAs we get older [noise] All right here's our gas to health a journalist a bill ... bill is an author a researcher in the field of health and wellness he's traveled around the world in search of information about\n... acid or H. A. as it's sometimes referred to back from his recent trip to a small village in Japan where people maintain high levels of EJ and are famous for their ability to defy the aging process bill welcome to the program\nGreat to be with your pet and all your statements to introduce the show today are certainly not overstatements after years of people using oral highly ironic gas\nThe supplements well of course we're going to give your audience a report today an update\nAnd an improvement how things are going as thousands of people have discovered how this supports in particular their joints but also their skin and their eyes and of course their hair and so on these are the areas where\nThe body actually is highly concentrated in ha but I Want to tell all your listeners to please stay tuned to because there's going to be an F. R. E. E. offer I said\nFree offered today from purity products no strings attached this is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people don't know this word highly ironic asset and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it\nOrally replace it in our body but more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby H ... it it makes the well is babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smoothing skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls have more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do and you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there is a way to get it back\nAnd of course purity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints to people are looking for alternative we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space\nBetween the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age age is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones we lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief the more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically used pain relievers are going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint\nAnd that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... fluid they actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but\nIt may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well you need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement\nPurity products was the first to introduce it now it's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's in molecular weight think of six million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means\nThat you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but we proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down\nIn molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we are going to talk about one here in just a moment but purity products\nIs introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives for their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou're just tuning in we're talking with Bill ... acid or Eighteen bill you said to him recently the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells\nThere's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha\nThe body is Seventy two percent water and as we lose this the connective tissue that connects olive ourselves\nThat connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding that the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we've been getting to wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height we we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know ... daily on was looking\nFor a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it\nAnd of course I Want everyone to think of having something like a jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello\nBecause it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies or even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of the how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking glue costs the main supplements you took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue casa means sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement non drug stores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about ... gas it well it took Thirteen Years for the consummate\nIt'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time and it'll get there because patients are going to take this to the doctors and pointed out as they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts\nWith patients and people that have issues and want to have healthy joints and skin and hair and eyes and want to see some of these useful levels of ha restored in their body\nNow you've written a great deal about the role of highly want a gas it in the bodies connective tissue sound as each a work in the joints and the connective tissue\nIt's a natural cushioning agent and pat we're talking about between the bones it also surround the nerves there's a ... addict nerve there's an owner nerve there's a carpal tunnel nerve all of these are going to need the special cushioning\nThat ha can give them there are people that tell us this stuff works here's Bernie writing to me who's actually teaches and plays golf in Dover, Delaware he found this purity joint formula\nAnd we're telling you it worked miracles for him why because purity
