help line I'm your host pat Campbell and boy we've got a truly fascinating report for you today in fact it's not an overstatement to say that high doses of an overlooked vitamin or in the process of revolutionizing western medicine as we know what in fact the promises to promote our health\nMore than anyone ever imagine support our immune system like nothing else can turn up our heart muscles in leg muscles make bones stronger keep our arteries clear impact our mood and emotional state support metabolism and essentially serve as a master switch\nFor two thousand genes in your body believe it or not we're talking about vitamin D\nWell our guest today is Dr John canal a practicing medical doctor in a sorority on vitamin D\nHe's the founder of the widely respected vitamin D council author of numerous scientific papers that outlined the tragedy of this vitamin D deficiency epidemic an author of an upcoming book on the topic he's the man the media increasingly turns due for answers when a new vitamin D study is published in his Thirty years in medicine\nDoctor canal has never endorsed to supplement for any company but that's all changing\nYour not only doors is pure these advanced vitamin D formula he's put his name on it joining us live from California doctor can now welcome back to the program thank my doctor I Know that you're plump to extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the\nPast year or two on vitamin D you're seeing the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact is going to be\nUnprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you it's just a little bit about how I got into this 'cause I think it would give them information about how the people\nAbout eight years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we follow doctor's advice in our government's advice and we started putting on the phone blocking staying out of the sun it had\nTremendous effect on the vitamin D levels in our blood so I started a nonprofit the vitamin D helpful on there you can read more information than you can possibly remember all about vitamin D\nAnd I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then within the last year or so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coke factors\nIt needs vitamin K to a vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to\nIt needs for on it needs magnesium it need sink and we'll talk about all these secondly I realize there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it\nFor getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it or taking the role in preparation can learn about it\nAnd that's a big difference choice approached a number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I said I'm by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\nSo what we're gonna talk about today is ... offer about up complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can't buy it in the store you can't buy it on on the Internet is this is the only such formula that exist together with the ultra pure molecularly distilled the shore\nAnd let me ask you a question here 'cause I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin in this case Monday it'd be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with vitamin D yeah\nA good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered it and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's some headlines from major publications in the last couple\nHere's about vitamin D I'm just gonna read off a list of headlines when you think about it is truly amazing and they these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamins Newsweek or Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D London time neglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price\nYour PI lack of vitamin D can affect thirty six Oregon Washington Post vitamin D deficiency called major health risk I Am a news that's American Medical association or listen to this that vitamin D deficiency maybe the root\nOf numerous health problem that's the American Medical Association the you know it's just truly amazing\nThe reason that it's involved in prostate health breast health bone health cognition blood pressure health immune health all these different things as because vitamin D pat it's not a vitamin it\nIs truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet because it's not a vitamin mhm it's made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight and what's eventually made is a steroid hormone now they're worried hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid hormone and the way they work at is the key\nThere are key to your genetic code\nAnd some steroid hormones are key to only a few genes but vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene that is it\nTwo thousand gene is the key that two thousand one tenth of your genome by the when one tenth of your genome is waiting for the key to unlock it and the\nOnly thing that can unlock it is vitamin D that's why it's involved in so many different health conditions your body knows what it needs it just needs the heat on lock the right gene\nNo doctor you say we need five thousand I use pretty now here's here's the problem I went through the health food store the other day and I'm looking at most multi vitamins and I'm even looking at vitamin D sold separately\nYou know as a supplement itself is most of them have two hundred four hundred I use I saw a couple of brands they had a thousand nobody even comes close to what purity is offering your I Want you to talk about why we need five thousand per day and there's really only three ways to get it I could either go out and the the noontime sun\nWhich really isn't practical for a lot of us and there's you know these the skin concerns you talked about before I go to a tanning bed again not an optimal choice where I can supplement the right way was purity products why the importance of this five thousand number why is that the magic bullet\nYeah because of a single factor in this sex change my life seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed\nThat if you put on your bathing suit and go outside in the summertime and ... for about twenty minutes ten minutes on each side you make between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now\nThat's incredible I thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that made that much vitamin D that quickly and if you look at levels that people like lifeguards were roofers gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's the natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood levels to be fifty or sixty\nYou have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that you'll get some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefits\nHow do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering tests\nThe problem with getting a blood test this first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research right then you have to go and have the blood test done and then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way are the symptoms I could look for they wouldn't show me pat you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but other symptoms that can look for yes\nNot having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only and another is your muscular skeletal system out kind of ready\nYou feel even your performance on the athletic field will talk about that later than I have a paper coming out and about a week talking about vitamin D is effect on athletic performance how sharp you feel mentally whether\nWhether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain how those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it\nBecause they'd been deficient for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think and then we move is normal\nYeah so you can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health how can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S\n[noise] well more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient of course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nAnd about half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking that ideal level is forty and many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and\nIf you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\nSo let me ask you this when when people start supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D was the product like purity products getting that five thousand I use per day what kind of a difference they gonna knows he's going to make them feel better\nLook what their risk versus what the benefits it looks like from the studies there's a tremendous risk associated with vitamin D deficiency we don't have all the studies we need and we're doing the study is now but it would be unethical to let people remain vitamin D deficient\nWhile we're conducting all the studies we need to\nAbout heart health or bone health or breast held or prostate health or immune system it would be unethical to let them white vitamin D deficient\nThe problem is that many doctors use antiquated reference ranges and so if you're a level of thirty five they'll tell you that's okay it's not okay level needs to be fifty or higher and get that adults need five thousand units a day\nAgainst those just tuned in I mentioned earlier you know I go through the health food store looking multi vitamins most of them at best have four hundred I use\nI mean when you're looking at the the vitamin D that you can buy by itself is a standalone vitamin most or four hundred I use I saw a couple that were a thousand IU tablets but again that falls far short of that five thousand number and that's what you get with purity here why is that so important\nThere's recently been a study by professor Hany at Creighton University that shows that when you get your level to fifty\nYour body has enough for all the things that need to do and it begins the door a little bit of the vitamin D\nJust like your ancestors your story ... ... so if your level is less than fifty your body is basically using up all the vitamin D as fast as you take it for all the things that need to think of vitamin D as a mountain spring with a pool at the top right the pool we've always known about its calcium and bone\nAnd we've taken enough vitamin D to halfway fill up that calcium and bone pool but all the other pools below it the breath pool the colon pool the immune system poll all the other polls that are blow it had been basically dry since we've been out of the sun right if you take five thousand units of vitamin D\nThe upper pull over flows and starts filling in all the pools at the bottom the teeth and gum the mood the cognition the pancreas out all these pool\nAnd there's enough left over to store a little bit for a rainy day\nAnd a little bit of a surplus yet but you don't do that unless you're levels around fifty if your level of less than around fifty you use up almost all of it immediately and that's called chronic substrate starvation wow and that's not a good thing\nBy the way ... vitamin D super formula is not available in stores only directly through purity products you get it in conjunction with their omega three fish oil the free bottle fish or both of these are thirty days supplies\nAnd all you pay for shipping four Ninety five you can't beat it the phone number one eight hundred six five zero six eight to zero that's one eight hundred six five zero six eight\nTo zero now doctors you know talk to me about the link between vitamin D and body weight what's the research showing\nWell this may be fifty studies out there that show a real simple association the lower your vitamin D the more you weigh the higher your vitamin D the less you with but that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect\nBut there were clues includes that we know about mood that is people who live closer to the equator way less than people who live far away from the people who live at higher altitude closer the fun way less than people who live at lower altitudes most people experience with people way less than the summer\nThan they do in the winter so those were clue but we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D levels so what we call inversely\nAssociated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ... that's become clear just recently for example there's a paper in the British Journal of nutrition August of last year they studied women who were dieting\nAnd the women who had the highest vitamin D and take lost more weight than the women really had the lower vitamin D and take yes and then just a couple of months ago\nA randomized double blind placebo controlled trial is the highest standard of proof we have in medicine and this was thirty six thousand people and they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D day so we don't have any idea what the full effect is\nBut the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D were less likely to gain weight than the women who were not\nTake while adamant day so that's another reason plot\nSince purity is giving away a month's supply of the formula vitamin D formula plus the fish will ... you know of course that there's research that shows the fish or in a self help with weight control so there's reason to believe the two things together will help now it's not a diet till it's not dramatic you won't just stop eating\nPart of that that is you just feel better you're more active you're under doing something\n[noise] now don't you know we're sort of run out of time here but I I Want to give you a few minutes tell people why you believe is so vitally important did they give this formula try [noise] well\nYou know we've had time to talk about the heart body weight mood but you know we haven't had time really to talk about brain health coal in health breast health prostate health pancreatic hell bone hill the immune system I could go on and on the main reason that\nPeople will continue to take this if you just give it a try for a month is how you steal your get up and go you're feeling of wellbeing that's what you notice that if you take it for several months or

each a levels in this village where did you find when you met the people is this is a genetic he's a dietary what did you see\nI went there again this summer for the second time with translators photographers and it was easy to understand without studies without even though the town doctor there Dr ... has identified ... gas it\nIs the very reason why these people in ... Hara exhibits such usefulness and by the way they have a lady there in her nineties without any aging spots in her skin perfect skin no wrinkles whatsoever\nPeople living in their eighties and nineties look a lot younger ... all became clear when we were there now they grow a lot of their own vegetables\nAnd foods right there near their homes and they have a lot of fresh foods and sometimes they have a little extra so they come down\nTo the vegetable market and bring their goods there to be sold\nSo we were there taking pictures and interviewing people when eighty three year old Mr ... she came driving and on his motorcycle to deliver\nHis vegetables to the fruit market pat\nWhere do we have in the United states eighty three year olds\nDriving their motorcycle down to the vegetable market we don't have it we followed him to his home or use up on a thirty foot ladder trimming a tree he works in the fields\nAbout four to six hours a day and he introduced us to his neighbor who was nine years old without a wrinkle on his face neither of them use reading glasses\nAnd of course ah he works about six to eight hours out in the fields every day this was remarkable I almost felt at I was in some sort of a place where the dinosaurs are still living or something that was so remarkable these people just exhibit\nA youthful this a a flexibility in their joints certainly a healthful mess\nThat we just don't see everywhere else in fact it was so remarkable that the emperor of Japan actually has visited this village pictures were taken there you could see them all over the village there as they had posted them so\nThis had stood out and of course Connie Chung or ABC News twenty twenty had gone to visit there in the year two thousand and this was originally on television\nYou

Hawaii\nThis past year Seventy years old he said this new ha formula for the joint did a great job not certainly a pharmacist with no here's John writing to me and saying you know at age fifty five boy when I tried ha I'm now back to playing full court basketball but the twenty year old\nAnd I've even begun to jog again these are the kind of report that we here\nLet me ask you a question here you mentioned the glucose I mean and there's another one that is pretty popular MSN how does this eighty stack up against those other ones the other ones you have to take them for a while before you even see any results do\nAnd most of these are very positive dietary supplements they certainly have lots of benefits glue costs may take quite a while to kick in MSN is a wonderful sulfur compound and again it's an anti inflammatory as are many things like fish oil ... these are all wonderful\nBut they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joy and if we can just replaced it\nIf we can find a way to get that cushioning back that's what we call youthful this that's what we had when we were young here's David right into me from New York twenty five years looking for something that would help support his lower back\nAnd of course he said I Can't believe it now he says I Can't thank you enough for this product people

year he says I'm In and says I'm doing very well\nCampbell glad you could join us today now there's some startling information years ago the EPA conducted a study and listen to this they sampled tens of thousands of people checking for impurities in there to issue do you know what they\nFound virtually every single person was contaminated with pesticides turbines solar ovens and chemicals\nSo it's a pervasive issue bottom line it's a toxic world we're living in the big question is\nWhat are you going to do about it but stay tuned Dr Levin has some nutritional inside you're going to want to hear right let me introduce Dr Neil loving Dr Lebanese a wellness consultant he's a chiropractor a nutritionist a long time product formulating er and spokesperson for purity products dodge eleven welcome back to the program\nOh it's great to be here with you today ...\n... you know I just mentioned is a toxic rural we're living in the environment is absolutely polluted\nAnd I got to tell you I'm so shocked by what you sent me this ETA fat tissue survey that basically shows that we're all contaminated by plastics insolvency virtually one hundred percent of us in our tissue it's downright scary stuff right\nOh absolutely this is a scary subject and as you mentioned that EPA tracked issue survey and that was done on thirty three thousand us residents they found her beans plastics chemical solvent in a hundred percent of the samples so basically pat\nWe're all contaminated then the environmental working group back in two thousand six found that tap water\nIn forty two states is in Hammond aided by more than a hundred and forty on regulated chemicals pat\nThis is the craziest thing of all they do studies of them below cord blood they find dozens of chemicals in ... bill local toward blood so I mean what are we going to do about this what are we going to do about this toxic environment the Clintons\nAnd the talks are systems on a daily basis that's the question so how do we do that it will batch where this next generation organic juice Clinton's with our special\nLiver support blend comes in handy because it has over\nThirty different super foods they nourish all the
