to diagnose treating your will prevent anything\nOn at once again to help line I'm\nYour host pat Campbell boy we've got a truly fascinating report for you today in fact it's not an overstatement just said that high doses of an overlooked vitamin or in the process of revolutionizing western medicine as we know what in fact it promises to promote our health\nMore than anyone ever imagine support our immune system like nothing else can turn up our heart muscles in like muscles make bones stronger keep our arteries clear impact our mood and emotional state support metabolism and essentially serve as a master switch\nFor two thousand genes in your body believe it or not we're talking about vitamin D well our guest today is Dr John canal a practicing medical doctor an authority on vitamin D he's the founder of the widely respected vitamin D council\nAuthor of numerous scientific papers that outlined the tragedy of this vitamin D deficiency epidemic an author of an upcoming book on the top accused demand the media increasingly turns to for answers when a new vitamin D study is published should use Thirty years in medicine\nDoctor can now has never indoors to supplement for any company but that's all changing\nYour not only ... advanced by the de formula he's put his name on it joining us live from California doctor canal welcome back to the program thanks mad doctor now I Know that you're plump you're extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the\nPast year or two on vitamin D you're seeing the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is fish we started in the impact is going to be unprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you it's just a little bit about how I got into this 'cause I think it would give some information about how the the ball\nAbout ... years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we follow doctor's advice in our government's advice and we started putting on the sun block and staying out of the sun it had\nTremendous effect on the vitamin D levels in our blood so I started a nonprofit the vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information than you can possibly remember\nAll about vitamin D and I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then within the last year so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coke factors\nIt needs vitamin K to a vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to\nIt needs for on it needs magnesium it need sink and we'll talk about all these secondly I realize there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it for getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it\nOr taking the wrong preparation can learn about it and that's a big difference so I approached a number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I said by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\nSo what we're gonna talk about today is purity offer about up complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can't buy it in the store you can't put it on on the Internet it this was the only such formula that exist\nTogether with their ultra pure molecularly distilled fish or\nYou know let me ask you a question here 'cause I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin industries Mindy can be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with vitamin D\nYeah that's a good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered it and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's some headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just going to read off a list of headlines when you think about it is truly amazing\nThey these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamins Newsweek or Americans dying from lack of vitamin D\nLondon time neglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price\nYour PI lack of vitamin D can affect thirty six Oregon Washington Post vitamin D deficiency called major health risk am a news that the American Medical Association or listen to this that vitamin D deficiency maybe the root\nOf numerous health problem that's the American Medical Association the you know it's just truly amazing\nThe reason that it's involved in prostate health rest 'til bone health cognition blood pressure hell immune health all these different things as because vitamin D pet it's not a vitamin\nIt is truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet because it's not a vitamin ... it's made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight and what's eventually made is a there are worried hormone now they're worried hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid hormones and the way they work at is the key\nThere are key to your genetic code and some\nSteroid hormones are key to only a few genes but vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene that is it unlocks two thousand gene is the key that\nTwo thousand one tenth of your genome by the one one tenth of your genome is waiting for the key to unlock it and the only thing that can unlock it is vitamin D that's why it's involved in so many different health conditions your body knows what it needs it just needs the key one lock the right gene\nNow Dr you say we need five thousand I use per day now here's here's the problem I went through the health food store the other day and I'm looking at most multi vitamins and I'm even looking at vitamin D sold separately\nYou know as a supplement itself most of them have two hundred and four hundred I use I saw a couple of brands they had a thousand nobody even comes close to what purity is offering your I Want you to talk about why we need five thousand per day and there's really only three ways to get it I could either go out in the the new time sun\nWhich really isn't practical for a lot of us and there's you know these the skin concerns you talked about before I go to a tanning bed again not an optimal choice where I can supplement the right way with purity products widely important to this five thousand number why is that the magic bullet\nYeah because of the single fact and this that changed my life seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed that if you put on your bathing suit and go outside in the summertime\nAnd Sunday for about twenty minutes ten minutes on each side you make between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now\nThat's incredible I thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that made that much vitamin D that quickly and if you look at levels that people like lifeguards or roofers gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's a natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to the ideal your blood levels to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to them maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood ... up to fifty and if you take less than that\nYou'll get some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefits\nHow do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering tests the problem with getting a blood test is first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research right\nThen you have to go and have the blood test done and then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way are their symptoms I could look for that when you tell me pat you probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but other symptoms I can look for\nYes not having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only in another is your muscular skeletal system out kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic field will talk about that later that I have a paper coming out and\nA week talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance how sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're\nJust not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain how those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it because they've been to fishing for so long they think that way they feel and the way they think and the way they move is normal yeah so it can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health how can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S\n[noise] well more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nThen about a half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking that ideal level is forty and many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and if you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\n... let me ask you this when when people start supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D was a product like purity products getting that five thousand I use per day what kind of a difference they gonna knows he's going to make them feel better\nYeah that's probably the first thing that they'll notice as an effect on their feelings of wellbeing and moved by wellbeing I just mean this feeling that\nYou know you want to live in some ways what's the point of going on for a month to month to month where you you know you get up and go is gone and you're you just don't really feel like doing anything you know you're not excited about anything anymore you your mood level is low in and that's one of the first thing that\nOf that five thousand number and that's what you get with purity or why is that so important\nThere's recently been a study by professor Hany at Creighton University that shows that when you get your level to fifty\nYour body has enough for all the things that needs to do and it begins to store a little bit of the vitamin D\nJust like your ancestors used to store ... so if you're a level is less than fifty your body is basically using up all the vitamin D as fast as you take it for all the things that need to to think of vitamin D as a mountain spring with a pool at the top right the pool we've always known about its calcium and bone\nAnd we've taken enough vitamin D to halfway fill up that calcium and bone pool\nBut all the other pools below with the breath pool the cold and pull the immune system pull all the other polls that are below it had been basically dry since we've been out of the sun right if you take five thousand units of vitamin D\nThe upper pull over flows and starts filling in all the pools at the bottom teeth and gum the mood the cognition the pancreas out all these pools\nAnd there's enough left over to store a little bit for\nA rainy day and a little bit of a surplus yet but you don't do that\nUnless you're levels around fifty if you're levels less than around fifty you use up\nAlmost all of it immediately and that's called chronic substrate starvation wow and that's not a good thing\nBy the way down to ... vitamin D super formula is not available in stores only directly through purity products you get it in conjunction with their omega three fish oil the free bottled fish oil both of these are thirty days supplies\nAnd all you pay for shipping four Ninety five you can't beat in the phone number one eight hundred six five zero six eight to zero that's one eight hundred six five zero six eight\nTo zero now doctors you know talk to me about the link between vitamin D in body weight what's the research showing\nWell at this maybe fifty studies out there that show real simple association the lower your vitamin D the more you weigh the higher your vitamin D the less you with but that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect but\nThere were clues think lose that we know what about ... ...\nPeople who live closer to the equator way less than people who live far away from the people who live at higher altitude closer to the sun way less than people who live at lower altitudes most people experience as people way less than the summer\nThan they do in the winter so those were clues but we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D level is so what we call inversely associated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ... that's become clear just recently for example there's a paper in the British Journal of nutrition August of last year\nThey studied women who were dieting\nAnd the women who had the highest vitamin D and take lost more weight than the women really had the lower vitamin D and take yes and then just a couple of months ago a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial is the highest standard of proof we have and that is and this was thirty six thousand people\nAnd they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D day so we don't have any idea what the full effect is but the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D were less likely to gain weight than the women who were not take while at a Monday so that's another reason plus\nSince purity is giving away a month's supply of this formula vitamin D formula plus the official ... you know of course that there's research that shows that fish or in a self help with weight control so there's reason to believe the two things together will help now it's not a diet till it's not dramatic you won't just stop eating\nPart of that that is you just feel better you're more and if you're under doing something\nNow don't you know we're sort of run out of time here but I I Want to give you a few minutes tell people why you believe that so vitally important did they give this formula try\n[noise] well you know we've had time to talk about the heart body weight mood but you know we haven't had time really to talk about brain health colon hill press till prostate health pancreatic hell own health the immune system\nI could go on and on the main reason that people will continue to take this if he just give it a try for a month is how you feel you're get up and go you're feeling of wellbeing that's what you noticed that if you take it for several months or a year\nYou'll notice a lot of different changes in your doctor will notice a lot of different changes and you're Dennis will notice a lot of different
