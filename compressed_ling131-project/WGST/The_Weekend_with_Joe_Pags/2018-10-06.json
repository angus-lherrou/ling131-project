your shows and now it says it's their ears no exclusion on value\nThat so I that's why I wanted also at our insurance what year was here because someone I heard recently that someone says where it's all your receipts\nYou might on some Thirty years and I've never seen around it I find it hard to believe\nRight no I don't know the nobody's going to be looking for a receipt uh but you know what I Would here's the thing\nAnd I think people lose sight of the fact that when you buy insurance you aren't entertaining and we're contracted it will cover whatever it is you pay for them to cover that is the time when you buy it to ask\nAre you going to require a receipt how do you establish a value what exactly is going to happen though that's the time to answer those questions not lay drawn to you know to say hey I bought something I have no idea what I bought but why don't you tell me find oh I didn't buy one I thought about\nSharing the other thing that your previous caller who said he had a picture of everything I cried for big running small insurance numbers and his current license next threat that sounds like a few more minutes that's an idea\nI hearing the thing is nice about fans now you can just do it with your phone and you know save it to the cloud and make a folder and it's got all your gun information in one of the things I was thinking you could do see this makes sense and just kinda spit balling this\nYou take a picture over the the whole gun and then you take your phone and zoom in go real close and get a picture of the serial number\nAnd then you take a little pen and paper and you're right on it you know a ranting seven hundred simulate meter on six or whatever it is a purchase ... you know this time or about this time for about this much money from such and such whether or not you have the receipt\nAt least you got a record that you had this gun on this day will you took the picture\nAnd then you found a way and it listed that we can say hey back five years ago when I took his picture I own a gun that tells you I owned a gun it's pretty simple and\nIt's been my experience that insurance companies if you're paying for the church they don't really mess with you a whole lot on this they generally just go ahead and pay up if you've not been fraudulent yet what she claimed as the value because they don't want people going around telling the world these guys don't pay off\nI mean that's that's the business end is ensuring and then paying off so that that's my experience anyway\nThanks for the call appreciate that you had any experience with an insurance company a after a loss on their guns\nHow did they go eight six six talked gun I'm just curious about the obviously we have a a safe for gun safe\nIt would make sense to get one that has fire protection because think about what are the the main risk I think ...\nPretty much yet ... really so he said well those are expensive well okay yeah but how much again it might frighten you [laughter] know you may not want to let your wife know this uh all your husband in some cases\nUh what'd you told her that you go when\nI got a lot of money tied up in the midst of yeah and don't forget the binoculars and the spotting scopes end a rifle scopes NBA accessories you know you know what I'm Talking about in the two hundred dollar triggers you put in there and and and so you list all that stuff too many foods that have you ever have lost somebody\nKnows [noise] eight six six talking hoping ever\nUm [noise]\n\n\nAll right you got some guys you know a hopeless house was was answers but after new fast a son with Ernie Ernie is on line three out of West Virginia [noise] PBS league NBA already help yeah [noise]\nYeah sure why I wanted to say was sure absolutely cracking your comment that you have to be a Jew dictated\nBy in charge and not be able to men on the fact that do not form\nOn your car usually on no one veteran a retiree walk in and see that and that it doesn't say it can't be on the farm and they they said that you've been adjudicated et cetera et cetera\nThe answer is no and when you go back to the Social Security administration and then of course your benefits\nAnd the handling of your money if if the court ... court or the Social Security administration dictate your money has to be handling handled\nThey found them to have a mental defect which in fact you should probably be blaming it on your ability to own a lot so it's two different things and the veteran has to understand\nThat when he looked at the four\nSo if I tell them look I don't feel comfortable having my own money I Would really like for somebody else to handle that for me that makes\nMe mentally deficient\nIn the eyes of the day or so well you you mentioned to the previous administration that Social Security if they if if you go man and you tell somebody that you want somebody else to add all your money and for some reason in there I mean this is kind of conjecture but for some reason you been to the doctor\nAnd you've seen a psychiatrist all that stuff I don't stick it it gets into the inter Korean attitude occasion\nAnd they will share mentally deficient in and I want you to lose your right to handle firearms on\nOkay well I appreciate Ernie I think that's something that we're going to have to work on to get changed my life for a ... Colorado Hey Mike insurance on firearms talk to me\nI was just on the radio ask buddy an addict claimed and I I had a claim on fires tonight I got flooded a couple of years back\nNow why do they deny it\nFine what can I and my wife and I live at a fifth wheel side my faith and shop and I just to save that ... at any kind of waterproof action that was just a standard say\nRight now what what\nI mean if they were damaged when was it because they don't cover flood\nNow we have flood insurance 'cause we live in a flood plain\nI take any steps to provide any waterproof protection so\nSame one you might claim on farms they covered so many other stuff but not on the fire\nYeah 'cause it better or what I Want to say was I didn't provide any uh additional protection for my refrigerator or anything else and you're covering that Weiner guns different\n[noise] yep I agree that that was one of those\nAre not read anything I guess up on the policy in because route folks out there they can try when they go through it\nYeah it did you appeal their decision\nI made her main office but we we just never got anywhere I seemed to help a little bit and just we never got anywhere\nAll right well I appreciate that Mike it's a it's a reminder all of us to check out policy scarcely also and the good point the whole online insurance I Want an agent I Want somebody who's going to be fighting for me and then the other thing is if it's a lot of money\nYour first call needs to be to a lawyer if you get a lawyer shrugs\nI don't think we can do that and he's right he's like they can't do that to get what it says oh yeah I'm going to go kick their butts waves you just let the Adam I'm going to go get these guys go cool and let's go let's mocking room because the idea of them say well you didn't take steps to protect your guns\nIn of different ... coverage covers or not it's not going to\nLook somebody safe out there to check your sister take somebody with you this week\nWhen she was fifty seven gene that Brett Kavanaugh\nBush on the bed laid on top of her ... her clothes off put his hand over her mouth and she she got away than him left she says regarding more judge was in the room was playing the music loud lead wanting interference for having a more judge shows wasn't barren no idea what you're talking about\nHer very good friend late somebody a girl should I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that bad party has refuted the claim\nWell Christie lousy Ford testified in front of this panel the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody sergeant credible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually given a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\n\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand has everybody corroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\n\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets built CDs and help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that's a appointed delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then a report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez\nWho says that at a party\nThey were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or is it was ... ... they were playing something to where if you lost you had a drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk she's going to remember anything and then uh she's told\nBrett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out and put it near her face\nNow she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on the panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed something happened to me\nYou remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six days you decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it\nBut I remember people telling me that he did it too much Kavanaugh said you know there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity this Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers\nOf parties where there would be trains are boys partake in gang rape cabinet and judge she said would spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happen between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party joints ten of them and activity to she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued going to the parties for another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the bunch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once NBC\nNews instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable they ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story is changed a bunch of times and her history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible but\nThat didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lady that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to ... didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because the calls all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover what are your Fifteen he wrote the girl he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanize this as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these\nWomen has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resists lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's given\nAnd Christine Ford\nOnly vase say something happened everybody else's named and the FBI spent five days six days interviewing many more people in Canada who didn't come to because you've offered up evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today going Twitter read your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls\nThere ... people which means they're putting out their information their their phone numbers their addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots that are still just completely disconnected from the rest of us Melissa mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh they're still attempting they're still exempting these days are rapist serial rapists yet about her rapist on the court is it's a disgusting display\nTheir trying their best to change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to be in Saudi Arabia or something\nOr China come on man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do a show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen\nBetween now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska who is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nAnd she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now with what\nCome home and so I Need your thoughts on this I I'm guaranteeing that you would have never been this engaged in a Supreme Court nominee every in your life I guarantee that is true but let's break it down and where are you on this even if you're on the left even a politically\nYou're a Democrat or a liberal and somebody who generally speaking doesn't agree with me or doesn't agree with Trump\nYou have to be sick and by what what the less done here right\nLet's talk about it it's a eight one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty

I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have\nConsequences we won were in charge of it can be I Will clear there's room and be given interrupting than it would probably would proper protocol is\nWhere they were breaking it on purpose us they really thought they're putting on a show which somehow window for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to that they are Clyde in Lexington, Kentucky iCloud what's going on\nA job back thank you very much for taking my call really you're not a I think the\nDemocrats are dead so now they're [laughter] they're getting worse ...

man makes being guilty\nAnd you got to live for the most out if that's true but that's why the court case\nAnd I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of classic that very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill but\nAnd you think to yourself what's the objective why would he possibly give

top of the hour right here on the weekend with Joe pads we go back to the phone lines and say hello and welcome to a Christian you Carson City Nevada Christie what's going on\nOh lots of stuff going on [laughter] on ought to be just\nFind it very very hypocritical that here were interviewing this man to be a um fair and fair and honest person to decide that ... court cases\nRight we find it very strange when he gets extremely angry when he's accused of these baseless crime I'm both a a survivor I Will never have victim survivor of sexual assault more than one [noise]\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we lack\nAuthentication like the um Dr Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing to credit with Kavanaugh right if we let women like to come forward and do this kind of damage to manage reputation it's actually going to set back women past defined by decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked\nAnd it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBickering women have notoriously gun at when they've been scorned or that or or many other things and the fact that we would want to do that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh\nWho surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now it it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they're becoming more socialist\nI have a friend that was actually grew up in Argentina and came here and became that if she is a hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what it's truly like to live in a socialist country we don't want to go that way that I just find it so hypocritical that here we're\nThe person for a job in a court where he's supposed to be fair right we get it that when he showed his emotions when he's being attacked unjustly\n... you couldn't be more correct or ... something one of the most dogs there are things I've ever seen and then be junior Jews know going to be fair and liberal ended about this I'm Sorry I'm Sorry that happened to you and I'm Glad that you're a survivor and you know look there's always a victim no I I Wonder\nDo you remember the details of what happened to you because this was was he doesn't remember anything\nDoes that mean you just all the victims the survivors that I've ever spoken with have remembered every ...\nWhere she lives with me one of my I had a a less traumatic incident when I was fourteen and where she completely lost me I'd written single parent household with that there were six cats when\nI was fourteen I had something like that happened to me I didn't tell my mom right away\nBut I wouldn't leave her side for men right that when she first started to live with when she said that they went to the grocery store and she wanted to go on a separate entrance just weeks later when after she almost died than the fact that she had the physical composure cafe high\nThat someone that was in that room when I found my attacker when I was Eighteen and was it was a home invasion I was raped and my home at gunpoint front of my family when I saw him in court I think you physically ill I couldn't look in the eye and tell us and I kinda find him\nBut I became physically ill and I had a horrible memory my family laugh about it all the time they'll say to me mom don't you remember an off a that was your first day\nBut I can remember what I was wearing every single detail and both times every single detail there's nothing that isn't completely clear and invented in my memory\nAnd I guess I'd found hurting not credible with regard to cabinet and I honestly I hate to say that but I find her not credible I'm trying to be as open minded as possible because I was in law enforcement and I know what the standards are back right my got on her as now she's\nIn a ... but but you you and I both know that the the left said well here's what we're going to do with was before no matter what she says\nThe word we are going to use as credible to everybody that we talked to and we're going to force them to all repeat credible 'cause of the the watching and listening public will will agree\nBut she was credible but around with you and I\nSaid there's really on me I Believe that maybe she was a victim of something or survivor or something\nI don't think anything she said about Brett Kavanaugh was in fact credible in fact that was the wrong usage of words and that's where I was I mean and I was attacked because I showed up but so what I mean I saw when I saw or heard what I heard and even her best friend doesn't corroborate that tells me something\nWell and and I was in a way of how much I have personally been attacked\nBy either survivors probably all the victims\nBecause they've allowed it to victimize that like ... me away as I had a guy friend that I grew up with that I Can't\nBelieve that your history Dr ...

I'm probably going to really do this you're initial reaction was well of course you should do it or no way that\nI I wanted him to do it I you know it it it made so Bogle he'd been so tough on it and and it was time you know you you see the nonsense that is going on you say that the reality of that there's no one that could have accomplished what he's been able to do that no one that you know so few that ever signed the front of a paycheck\nSo few that had ever you know in our whole political system that had ever had it there someone family some of the livelihood their safety and wellbeing of their kids and grandkids dependent on their success he'd actually done it I mean that was the big laugh I had last week when you know Obama's running around claiming that's like on a mayor you know\nI remember when Obama say hey you didn't build that it's like\nNow now now he owns it right because his policies of oppressive taxation insane regulation they general hatred towards business we went oh you didn't do that I mean Obama himself when my father I don't know why we couldn't have three three and a half four percent even even better right GDP Growth Obama goes and like well there's no magic wand for that\nRight now we have to New York times back him up no no no because you know of course he can do no wrong\nThere this is the new normal what Africa Deborah yeah of course we expect Obama to be able to fix anything you've never done anything\nIt it turns your data far scissors I you're never\nAnything you'd never had any experience there was no way we should expect him to be able to fix anything economically guess what my father has done that he has built a business he did bill that\nAnd so it shouldn't be a shock to people that were able to turn that around and now the Democrats won a reversal of that they want to take everything into one eighty why because we've all time historic lows for blacks and unemployment for Hispanics\nFor women you you want to reverse all that I mean if the Democrats the ... as far as Donald Trump came out today in favor of oxygen that'll credibly be against it I mean that's their policies just hate but we have to show up we have to stay on the fight to get people's Don I Love your dad doing it so great it's amazing it's\nYou know but they say well how we vote for who is your congressman they are voting for November what do you mean it

again Donald Trump is on that\nIt in six weeks so we got to get out we got to mobilize if you like what's going on\nMakeshift fight for it because the other side I don't know what they're motivated by I don't even know what their platform there's other than like you know hate and outrage I mean you know what they are outraged or they should be outraged about their platform and their failures over the last few decades but there are outraged about something else but they are turning up\nWe got to turn up I said all the time they're like no no no the same fake news media that said Donald Trump can't win as saying that he's going to lose now\nBelieve it I see the numbers you got to get out you gotta stay we can't just be fat how being lazy and expect their stuff to continue he needs he needs guys like Ted Cruz he needs guys like ... to all of the congressional people in Texas that are up he need those guys helping him he can't do it by himself he imagined giving the house Nancy Pelosi\nBigger series like is there a\nQuestion I think about it I mean that would be a disaster for this\nCountry but then we got to turn around and we've got to bring our friend\nIt's trending on drugs today to you blows you saying I'm going to be the speaker again it's Donald Trump junior and do we we always appreciate the time a couple of things they didn't realize that your dad had the magic wand the whole time and one\nWas common sense and experience right is it an a magic wand it's just you know you can't expect a community organizer to ... understand let alone it actually affects you wait real change when it comes to economic our fiscal policy on fiscal well I think about it we we've discussed the economy I Know him what about foreign policy\nI look at the end you look at the Israeli embassy you look at what's going on in North Korea that took guts fine you know we don't just draw red line in Syria like Obama did when they cross it they slap you in the face where they tried doing that at least fifty seven Tomahawk missiles and I guess what the rest of the world was watching\nOkay we were not going to let people take advantage of something whether it's trade deals get NAFTA it can't be renegotiated can be done\nAgainst what congratulations Mexico and Canada now on board done like ... what ... what what you have a real leader\nI Wish that we had somebody in journalism in journalism was dead known ... shows us all the time too but it didn't go on one person steps up and says\nFormer President Obama just told me one thing you did that caused this to happen because how do you take credit for it if you look your dad when one eighty on everything Obama dude and fix the ... how can Obama even for a second even think to themselves you I did that because we're not\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and that's why we all have to get out because we're fighting with one arm to arms to arms and a leg it feels like at times because the media walk like I said oh no this is the new normal one point ... percent that doesn't have to be why why would the New York times back him up on that front because they needed to make him a success because they all believe in the asinine policies you see that\nI mean look at what's going on in fact that in bed or August putting up a challenge I mean Beto O'Rourke and run for mayor of New York city and be on the left side of a ticket\nAnd that's really the only way you know if\nMoney's coming from all places other than Texas\nBecause you know those are our tax at the values that he espoused or you know the attacks on law enforcement want to eliminate ice and the ... I mean ice only save nine hundred kids last year from you know a sex trafficking but they're terrible we should get rid of them I mean these people are insane\nAnd so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends and you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your business is look at what's going on your place of work looking your paycheck I mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America's getting respect again\nBecause we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around\nYou know I have to go in and\nWe have to remember that because they can all go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the extras let's talk about Texas I as you don't based in San Antonio Fifteen stations in Texas we've got a hundred and twelve around the country but we focus now on taxes because there's been a real challenge Robert Francis awoke as what I call news somehow called appropriating Hispanic but he's\nNot he's not at all Hispanics and he'll pretend he is for the road but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic coming but if granted something like that they would destroy ... absolutely you you you were an every day for better or\nIt's not a problem when he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem that only one day story of Ted Cruz did that it would be you know he shouldn't be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ...\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing has been great for taxes he's done he's fought for those values I look at the ... platform and like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate running for senator in Texas\nWell he's getting big support from Ellen so you know that's good ... ... it's Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who I've known for ... wait longer than he's been a senator\nAnd he's always made promises that he's always done exactly what he said he would do what you're doing is you're dead and went out in the primaries but there are very very similar politically in that they're not doing it politically they say I'm going to do this this this ... and you're dead and Ted actually believe I should do those things I promise\nBeat it was just given us you know a rainbows and puppy dogs it's weird well of\nCourse listen I I really respect that I mean unless it was a brutal primary and a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly but ... you know a couple of weeks after that and it was a brutal primary there was a big ... a a dinner in DC you know the usual you know this stuff [laughter] I I went\nUh and you know I was all my friends are from tax on there all the time hunting fishing or raise a lot of money during a campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and added a couple of friends tests at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation at the end of the dinner and we say hey you know we're going back to the Trump Hotel\nRight in the middle of the sea on Pennsylvania Avenue or they'll have a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along it came with us and that and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours nice that's a guts yeah but you know when he showed me beyond the guts if\nHe understood Donald Trump's going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good for ... and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituencies and that was impressive to me that was a great\nA testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told a story before but I think it's actually relevant\nOr because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean they can look at where\nBagel rocks money is probably coming from writing that probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that probably represents the average guy in the Hollywood studios so that's the difference and I don't want Texas to become California\nTexas I mean just look at the economic success if it had to look at all this debt but you want to become California give me a ...\nAnd the people who you're bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior\nYou have an opinion as to why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut ...

mountain right I'm sure that great time to be alive the\nPresident is doing a fantastic job in keeping us peaceful and prosperous some you can ... you can't argue with the jobs numbers which I think is why the mainstream media refused to cover them they've never seen a positive data point that they have it ignored enough and I guess I'll start they'll start down ever\nCovering this economy Joe if God Forbid it ever starts to go down but even all the numbers you already know the low unemployment numbers among\nAfrican Americans and Asian Americans in Hispanic Americans and women and teenagers and veterans and and the growth rate is up but even today but\nIt was very little coverage anywhere\nBut there was an accident have one hundred and eighty five thousand new private sector jobs created

Gorsuch and\nAnd perhaps soon followed by justice Kavanaugh\nIt's Kellyanne Conway a closer to the president I got to tell you you know and by the way she was also the woman that the president says

those who have said that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominee joy Supreme Court are certainly not going to find their way to supporting judge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen and so they should just be honest about what this is this is about destroyed\nDestroying a man's life because he's he's was\nNominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping the seat open pass in terms of not three twenty twenty and Americans had it Americans are smart and they're watching this process people are disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford\nHas Dianne Feinstein the Democrats due to blame that she is now a household name a recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it and after the twelve hour had told and\nBut for the Republicans bloody Ford may not have ever had a forum\nTo testify under oath it's the Senate Sherry committee and the majority of the other Republicans they gave her that I bet you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed his last July which is on the desk of every senator so\nWe'll see what happens but if you're the severe a few of those red state
