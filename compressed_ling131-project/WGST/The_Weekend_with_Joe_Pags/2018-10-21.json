what he is good at\nAnd he did come in and and led tendency in the second quarter there to scoring dropped on two consecutive plays or excuse me a nice job there in the second quarter and kind of gave

took all the air out of the sale [noise]\nWere you surprised that the two are in the game as much as we saw him and we knew he had that that need issue from last week at a at a bigger brace on today

have been shocked or surprise had we think Julian hurts come in and had in the second quarter early on when album was up twenty eight to nothing but obviously that just is a testament to show that\n... billion good it wasn't bothering him there was no threat of injury at least the the coaches didn't feel so and and and he made a couple of throws the random ... a couple of times he took the

that that does that make any difference\n[noise]\nIt definitely does not hurt and I think whenever you're able to go out on your first repossessions input scoring touchdowns on the board I think that makes everyone relax a little bit that that kind of a fear also as from the coaching standpoint is you don't want your team to relax you wanted to stay hungry throughout the anti\nAre four quarters and that's kind of event of a of ... I don't know if it's a challenge of this year not just keeping the foot only accelerator but this is the football team that knows they're stealing is extremely high on if you're truly playing towards the standard of football and not just the score and the scoreboard and that's exactly what your motivation is go out and do it better the next town\nAnd we talked about this new Tyler ... impasse games the fact that the officer corps so fast that ... get right back on the field\nIs there a conversation between the ... the defense as far as I look you do your job we're going to do our job um will you take care of business would take of our business is there more pressure and did situational defense the fact that the office for so fast is there do you think are the conversations between the office and the defense on that type of thing\nWhere I think there's a couple of things that you can take from that that thought process and it depends on the makeup of your football team\nOr does those conversations actually take place no it's understood everybody does their job each individual out there in the field does their job and when everyone does that mean good things happen so the defense knows that\nIt is a an explosive all that they love to see the points on the board that love to see them quick their job immediately or their attention rather immediately turns and focuses on our job is to get three and now a regardless of how fast the Austin scores if we can force three announced we're going to get our will deserve rest on the sideline now if the coaching staff however\nFeels that the game as back and forth and need to protect that deep and they're going to slow it down with the play calling on the opposite is thought and really burned more clock when they have possession of the football so there's a couple of different things that are going on simultaneously but it's always understood on any football team every individual out there on the field when you walk across that that strike\nYou do your job and good things happen and you don't worry about what what someone else is there is not doing\nIt for my fans point of view as we watch the game as we did today uh my girlfriend and I I'm fifty when you when when tendency scored a touchdown\nYou kinda like man I I was hoping for a shut out and I think the defenses that same scenario they they don't obviously like it when when the opponent scored a touchdown as as a fan perspective does not as well but this this is the events in the past couple of weeks that have challenge themselves [noise]\nUm you know stepping their their game of because this has been a an album a team that has been focused on that that was the focus on the defense but has had pride in the defense has really one game for them\nOr they don't like it when team score on them and and they like the fact that surely would love a shutout obviously but getting Twenty one points today I'm sure they challenge themselves I look we can do better next week so to say\nWell ... and the other thing that you can take about that is if you give up the score and drive because sometimes the the opposing team has some some will scheme plays that just work against the defense that you're running they can put a tremendous amount of pressure on an individual in the ... and you know what tip your hat you did a good job\nThe adjustment that has made on the sideline though and the next position is where you mark a true good for\nA really good football team are they going to allow it to continue to happen or do they make the changes in the adjustments and dig their heels in and prevent it from happening over and over and over and all those tendencies scored on on a couple of a position there and the second quarter\nIt wasn't like the floodgates open adjustments were made players got back into ... sort of folks and a little bit more and they kept a Timothy ... offensively at least [noise]\nAbsolutely carry appreciate the phone

especially the ... because they've been tested this year they they test the challenges but they've stepped up to every challenging every week and did a great job defending their defense especially in the defense evacuation\nWilling to make life so much simpler when the front six front for do such a good job of stopping and eliminating the run threat that the opposing often says that that keeps us take these backs and allow them\nTo kind of play centerfield and and really prevent the big play from happening and then when when you when you couple that along with the corners and the job that they're doing on the perimeter with the demand demand\nJust eliminating the big place once again it's a it's something that there is room for improvement but it's it's nice and refreshing and to realize that that those guys out there on the field understand that and that's the standard that they're trying to play to\nEnd the relationship between these players and their coaches made John I'm In touch the boy at the defensive coordinator he's earned that position as a coach he possess should say\nBut cars Scott ... this is a relationship that new but these ... between the players and coaches is special to see those relationships grow each week and if these players to want to play by play hard for their coaches to\nPut in the first and foremost thing is is you want players that are out there that are that are coach ... that are that people listen to what you're trying to implement and give their best effort to try to perform that\nOn every single day and and this is that it continues to improve it was a big question mark coming into the year was houses secondary gun gonna perform lost a lot now in out of that that back field and then had a lot of guys to replace but the
