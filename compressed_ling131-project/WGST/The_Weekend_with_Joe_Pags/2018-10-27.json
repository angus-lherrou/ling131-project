people have your religion should all die\nIt's nuts man\nYou know you've got so many unhinged people out there how do you protect yourself you got the alleged bomber under arrest as well\nThe are ridiculous legacy disgusting media reporting that it's still McGrath bomber the make America great again bomber which is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no\nNot the case would you have is a bad guy who did something very bad and calling him the log a bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all those of us on the political opposite side\nNot calling the shooter at the congressional baseball game the Sanders shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do that's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news\nAs as it is in reality so we've got more violence today\nWe don't know why other than this person allegedly\nShouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard\n\nAnd ... also was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American as first name is Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well and also a report that he's a talented Filipino\nThe media always the quick to say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon Martin\nBecause Martin went back and was beating the hell out of women in self defense he shot and killed them they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was this panic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is\nSo the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\n\nAnd that's where we have a Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself you you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected and even years ago where they are a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there weren't really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people replaced return addresses on means when fake addresses on the actual saying to our area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\n\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about Trump did this\nI guess there was some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact that sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump\nYou if you were a make America great again hat you're a target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist than it was ... minutes okay the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for\nFor ... that's okay that's perfectly fine fake news incessantly that's just the way it is well correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example after example of that\nBut the media again playing the victim in fact general concept from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or hangs over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind this is a\nGuy whose job is supposed to be the gold and report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a costume and and his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be enjoying the president you don't get to tell the president ... mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrate violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy who was the shooter was in at that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who've committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nBut the selective reporting and is the desired by the media to pretend like\nOne side is inciting violence and the other side is that it's just a crazy person that was an aged\nVats irresponsible that's responsible\nOr by the way that the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian is family or a family friend or a lawyer somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he is in one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded\nYou first they've certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is what we do know is some promoter for chipping bills and some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the the left is trying to glean from him and put it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing them tell us what you saw is not go gr observant and tell us why from caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated know what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly got a bunch of interviews coming your way\nA bunch

in I guess my frustration is\nAll the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine wandering Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama in ... we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens they made it happen I mean we we'd like to see them camp down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guys sends out bombs\nI I'm not
