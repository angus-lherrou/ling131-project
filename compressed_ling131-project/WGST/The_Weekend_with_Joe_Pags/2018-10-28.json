Islamic focus just not true\nOf the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people are very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a a very loud debate debate an emotional debate there are very are there are bad people on both sides there are very fine people on both sides\nThat it'd be we're talking about isn't whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues to Confederate war heroes or soldiers\nOr leaders that's what it was about cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments cause they feel like they can and they really can't it's against the law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yeah\nOr they're good people on the side of terror tear it down sure or they're bad people inside absolutely so he's been he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and and the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on you actually believe\nThat he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not\nHe's never said anything that would that would suggest that he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disabled a reporter is also ally\nYes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms where I I guess I don't know what to do with the ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this\nAnd when he talks is huge deal like that that if he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands that his in his forms as as most people do\nAnd the president went ... I guess the guy wrote something bad or reported something bad about were negative about the president and he said oh look at me any sort of did his hands at a similar fashion and made you know you just spoke at a at a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't ... mimicking them that way\nAnd be very good just go to you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even consider running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same he had the most should exactly\nSo is he ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh before he was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when a reporter didn't do a report until two veteran sixteen or maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not\nSometimes he acts like a dark that way the president and he does is he was that way and he speaks that way I Do agree with Donald Trump um stupid ... you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're going to do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant would hand motion to do and if you ever done that before one not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker\nWith the fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong and don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you you may in fact the unity no more than I Do but you failed but any debate when you walk in speaking your superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level of anybody at any time\nBut not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not gonna help you I've got Thirty years in this business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what by politics work so bring it next time I get a little but you better bring it better than that\nAll right let me go to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan pursued the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate jour you\nI'm just great to be with\nYou I really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind just got my attention or ... years there'd be a plaintiff some shorting some beautiful flags waving the breeze ... what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that's a A R at fourteen at the jet is one of the famous jets that flew off the carrier that a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots are when they came after our fleet at one point to Nineteen eighty six", "show_name": "The Weekend with Joe Pags", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "28"}
