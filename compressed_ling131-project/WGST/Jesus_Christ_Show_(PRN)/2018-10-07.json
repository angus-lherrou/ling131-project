Christ show dot com find out about our country club all that stuff to check out the Jesus Christ show dot com or that last call\n'em brings up a lot of thoughts about family and connection and I know that\nI'm a life is built on relationships it really is and I've said many many times that scripture\nIs all about relationships uh-huh it doesn't seem and that's not to be some new waging modern thought of wiggling everything down to relationships it's the truth if you go through the beginning uh an Adam and Eve she's a book of revelation\nIt's all about the interaction with one another and interaction with God\nAnd getting\nTo the the focus is to the center of relationships is the key to everything in life everything your job your well being a\nOr home the peace at home all of those things really center on\nHow you interact with others and can relate and that means and by relating means not only are you know if you think one sided late that you deal well with relationships that's not a relationship\nIf you understand people take time to understand them and in a case of being a parent and leaving money to your children are putting in it and we will I Know that there's a lot of factors that you're thinking about I'm dealing with\nUm well this person took care of me or this person took time with me but there's also things that you have to think about when you're gone and the relationship that that leaves 'em the rest of the family members and and the siblings and how that could build\nBribery or a book that rivalry or a interaction cause problems in the interaction of those those siblings\nAnd so your relationships never stop isn't that fascinating that even when someone passes on\nThat really the spirit of what they bring to the family unit whatever continues to be a part of that family and often times there are parents that mistreated children or a favored one or did something\nThat that continues to last how many times that we had to phone calls on this very program of people calling in and saying something happened a long time ago that parents are even past instill permeates\nOr has a driving force\nIn relationships to this very day\n\nInterestingly enough a friend of the program he was talking about generation\nTalking about this particular generation of young people who\nYou know attach themselves to their electronics and their ... and their gadgets and they're texting and they lose a good chunk of their heritage speaking their ability to use proper grammar all these things because of the um\nConvincing properties of technology and by condensing I mean that you don't need to expand yourself in any way shape or form you don't have to have contacts think about all the different things the traditions that are removed from life because of the convenience of technology\nYou don't have to talk to somebody when you go to the bank you\nCan go to the machine outside you don't have to talk to somebody when you fill up your tank 'cause you can fill it up\nRight there at the gas pump slide your card\nEven the greetings or a communication that take place when you go through a grocery store are limited because of like trucks have you swipe and now in addition to that they have the little areas the kiosks where you can check yourself out\nHere here's a here's a here's a a a station where you don't have to talk to another living soul\n\nBut those traditions were not just the lack of technology they were the importance built upon the importance of merchant ship and interacting with one another and being citizens\n\nAnd when it comes to God when it comes to scripture and the things of God\nThe traditions that are passed down and I know that there's some of you the butt heads with one another on the different traditions that there are that are out there and some are good and some are bad some can actually be like a mill stone and weights you down your faith because you forget that the purpose\nOf the tradition Easter propel and to remind you from where you came but it should never ... supersede or impede progress\n\nMy producer Neal recalls\nA time when he was in a church they had no musical instruments that were amplified\n\nHe told me that he spoke with the pastor of the church and he said uh I I noticed that you didn't have any you know any instruments that were amplified Romney electric guitars or anything and he said that's not how it was the original church\nSo I don't want to hear at my church\nSo in effect he was saying that is not the tradition therefore I don't want that year\n\nMy producer tells me that he looked at the Pasteur and replied then why do you use the microphone\n\nYou see there is some traditions that that you may hold onto that may not have a purpose you think they might what'd you hold on to him for the mere fact their tradition and that is of no benefit to anyone and it certainly is not a benefit to the church\n\nIf you're new to this program you must know one thing the importance and the purpose of this program is ... Palin perpetuate the ideas\nOf Christianity however\nAre desires to do it in a way that's different\n\nBecause the traditions don't always work\nThe traditional way of doing things don't always compel and sometimes get look archaic and get left behind and that's not to say that you take scissors to scripture and take out what you don't like or just say well that was them this is now that's not what I'm saying\nWhat I'm saying is understand the purpose of traditions\nIf you remember and you can read this in March seven I was constantly being poked at prodded tested by the religious leaders of my day\nTwo thousand years go everywhere I went somebody was trying to corner me\nTo get me to to to make some statements some contradictory statements something that we've caused an uproar either in the Roman community or in the Jewish community\n\nAnd a lot of the things that were asked of me and a lot of lot of the opportunities that were taken were really\nBased on tradition what do you think of this tradition what do you think of that tradition and in March seven you can read in the first one that the fairest sees and also at the time some of the scribes were coming together and they were focused on me as they started to gather around me\n\nThey had some questions as their wants to do and one of these questions and to do with why might disciples were eating their bread with impure hands\nNo ... not to get totally into what impure hands deal with I mean there was a ceremonial washing that would take place with a handful of water\nEspecially if you just came from the marketplace and that you might be mixing with things unclean\nMaybe gentile things money pencils\nAny of those things the tradition was to wash your hands now are Jewish brothers and sisters if you go back into a lot of their ceremonial in traditional was you'll find that they were way ahead of their time\nAs far as hygiene and a ... intellectually being able to understand the importance of cleanliness\nSeparating where you eat versus uh where you could waste\n\nVery smart the ... and the situation however we're not seeing if you could imagine the balance named port east and the difference between the tradition of cleaning your hands and the important the necessity of eating\nAnd sometimes unfortunately I find that to be the same in the body of Christ\n\nYou you focus on these traditions and sometimes you're so focused on the tradition you're still lost in those those things of all that you can't move forward that you'd rather not eat at all and die\nSpiritually because of the tradition of the cleansing of the hands\n\nAnd you don't understand the way the importance and the balance between the two\nYou know easy way out\nJesus Christ and show will return in a moment to be a part of a show\nLeno was right\nGood just\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\nTalk radio six forty WG as the\nNBC News radio I'm John Jeffries Brett Kavanaugh is now a member of the U.S Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts administered the oath of office to make him an all but one Hubbard fourteenth Supreme Court justice with retiring associate justice Anthony Kennedy president\nConservatives are celebrating his confirmation as amending originalist views on the highest court for decades many women were protesting is Kevin was inside taking himself because he was accused of sexual assault including severe Roberts\nWe don't believe there all the people who have a heart attack\nThe Supreme Court opens its term on Monday by listening to arguments in two cases President Trump celebrated his Supreme Court nominee joining the nation's highest court at a campaign rally in Topeka, Kansas use the tough confirmation battle over Kavanaugh's to argue for voters to elect more Republicans\nHe told the crowd that you don't have matches to an arsonist and you don't have power over to an angry mob which is what he called the Democrat John Jeffries NBC News radio\nHigh it's anti here for cats deal I check against catches small problems before things get painful and\nSee how low root canal fifty nine dollar electric or gas\nHeater came up with Kathy Steele helps you avoid that winter cold they're expert tax issues before they become you got that painful pricey and uncomfortable issues don't wait for a painful emergency schedule your fifty nine dollar tune up today just dial\nPound to fifty and use the code cast deal whether on\nTalk radio six forty ...

whole witnesses but would that be that um\nI think my parents church my mother's eighty three my dad's eighty six and so I have to take a boat every Sunday which I don't mind\nUm but one day I Would put your whole witness church and the elder at the podium just all of a sudden said after he finished with this tournament and whatever he said I'm\n... or so and so it's no longer Jehovah witness and everybody was just like what just happened\nWhat's your thought on this fellow shipping people\nI I certainly don't speak to the theology or the structure of the job is witness belief system is not the belief system of uh this radio program uh orange producers\nSo I'm not one that this program or it's radio producers would\nUm\n[noise] recommend so having said that they have their own system in which they adhere to their own system in which uh they teach and they control the structure of their church body\nIt doesn't mean that others don't or even ... solar system you can be excommunicated from ...\nAnd uh there are other church Protestants or in nature that would ask somebody to leave the church it's contingent upon what the structure and the rules of that particular church are\nAnd um how they feel ... you know execute them in the the process of teaching so it's up to them it's it's their world\nAnd a war there new world is the case may be but it's their world\nAnd they can make their a structure any way they they wish there is a time and there is scriptural references when people were ostracized or allowed to go or asked to go um to get clarity in their life before they come back and bring\n'em doubt or ugliness or bitterness into the church and I think it's\nA although I may not agree with the reasons they're doing it for or the way they're doing it I think sometimes you\nThere's wounds that you mend and there's ones that you amputate in life otherwise known amputate them they make the whole body sick and I think that the uh ... you and I may not agree with the reasons they did it but the premise is still a legitimate one that is sometimes you have to protect the many from the one\nI understand by the way my mother loves your show too [laughter]\nWell that's nice to hear the show is the ... if\nWe all you ... the or every time I have I have to raise it to do it in that first got upset Jesus oh you have a mom it's just it's just\nIt's just a radio station the guy very knowledgeable and she loved to show my dad live your shared my mom we do see it when he said well All right thank you for your question I mean for your answer\nMy pleasure I'm honored when anybody takes the time to listen I'm but we're also very honest as to the point of view and where we come from so that people don't get confused\nAnd there is a we try and focus on the things that we agree on than the things we disagree on 'em but the truth of the matter is that ah\nWhen someone is excommunicated from a church the church has that right based on whatever their structure is as long as everybody knows that going into it than they're signing off on that saying okay I won't do that or I won't partake in those things where I won't be a part of that or\nBring the end of the

I'm\nSure that made her into my fate I went on like what a couple years ago but now I'm having the dream a a I mean most traumatic stress disorder\n... my dreams are not by on your route and all of it have already\nSo real\nI I you know I I hear everything they now they want and I'm just wondering is there any place in the Bible where I can go to get some guy tried to kill\nWell sure specifically no there's nothing specific about pi TST now I Would say what what is it that you're a physician or why do these things that you have this because this was because of an illness\nOh I Am because I was like I Am a lark\nThrough [laughter] I Know ... for me I'm just waiting for him to tell me what that is [noise] but I don't know I guess I don't know why am I think that dreams and why it would be like you'll go\nWell dreams ah dreams play many parts in scripture and sometimes a dream is a dream and most\nOften people trains see dreams as liberal but the most common theory and and one of the best theory is if you imagined a mirror a big mirror that ah was reflecting when you're bedrooms let's say in your home\nAnd you could see everything to note states your bedroom it's got the clock on the table lamp that beautiful lamp that you love so much you can see your bed the window and\nAh kids playing on the outside and the tree and the birds and all these things in the mirror and then if you went and you broke that mirror\nAnd twisted pieces now would shift their perspective\nAnd now a there'd be a maybe you would just see the bird instead of the kids playing outside the window\nAnd now the lamp would be just above the bird so it would look as if the the lamppost on top of the bird's head and all these things are a distorted view of something that you already know or things that are in your life on a day to day basis or or in your heart or your head\nSo a a dream often is is very disjointed\nAnd that's why when you wake up and you try to piece it together\nUm you're saying well I was in my house but it wasn't my house but I knew it was my house but it didn't look anything like my house and you start doing those things 'cause you're starting to try and reconstruct something that is torn apart it is it's all piecemeal and and it can be confusing\nSo I wouldn't take that that dream per se\nUm as liberal as much as it is that yes you had a traumatic experience and you thought probably a lot about death and what that would have been like\nAnd what being absent from the body or being absent from this world would be like it also made you think about those that you cared about it and or knew that had moved on before you and that comes together in a dream um that can be a little creepy\nAnd sad and those types of things so I don't know that you're going to pull direct meaning out of it but I Will say this throughout scriptural though it doesn't speak specifically\nTo Pete TST and keep in mind PATS use thrown around a lot there's very different forms and for different reasons um there's those that come back from combat in the military and that's a very specific and different kinds of but there's those that they get it from watching someone they care about passing away or\nIn your case you going through something physically um draining that was scary and potentially life threatening\nAnd you go through all those things and they cause you to wonder about your stability it's like\nYou live every day with the stability it's it's like if you could feel the urge to move how unsettling that would be um you don't think about it so it it's not it's moving all the time and there's things like that that you\nKind of ignore to get through life and when you're faced with them it can shake your foundation and make you quite nervous I Will say that there are scriptures that talk about comfort\nAnd talk about the process of comfort second Corinthians won three through five and it's a little interesting the way it's worded so I asked you to hear it in its fullness it says praise be to God and father and father of our Lord Jesus Christ\nThe father of compassion and the God of all comfort\nCome for us in our troubles so that we can come for those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves received from God for justice we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ\nSo also our comfort of bounds through Christ now the word comfort\nIs you so much there it gets kind of tied up in all of it but when you see it laid out it's talking about the compassion of the father and the the God of all comfort every comfort comes from God\nThe piece of life that you enjoy the things the stability in your life Debbie come from God\nSo it talks about God being the author of all of that comfort goes on to say not only is the author of comfort but God actively comfort you and your troubles why so that you all\nSo Pete comfort\nOthers in trouble with what with the comfort that you received from God but first five is interesting because it doesn't say if\nThere is no ifs here there's no maybe it says for just as we share a bundle late in the sufferings of Christ\nNot if you have sufferings like Christ or any of that it's\nFor just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ so also our comfort a bounce through Christ\nAnd really focusing on God and letting God be your stability because the world is not stable\nThere are sharp corners to it there are scary things that happen they're scary people scary circumstances and they're ugly things are accidents ugly things that happen and if you focus on those things if you find yourself by that moment\nIf you find yourself but the things that have happened to you\nThen yes that will build up\nInside you and that will become your focus if you focus on God the unchanging creator of all creation and the author and distributor of comfort and you use what comfort you received comfort of others do the best of your ability\nThat's what you're called to do right now that's
