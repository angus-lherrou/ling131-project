I Believe in his seventies or\nThomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point is obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be um the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts of the time and um you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff\nAnd you know FDR not quite that much for sure but um there's this new information in the book is is pretty compelling I Will check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Martha good morning welcome to coast\nThank Richard thank you for taking my call my play the idea that the pawn originally made their money to the science trade that for a day a wet I'm more a humane way to make money and a rocket ...\nI'm\nSorry it out lighting novels with kerosene but boy that combat stumble engine that kind of a ... like a byproduct then that can End Days ran that now nice guy that I never have no idea how the relatives out well I can be\nYou have a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\n[noise] well I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the stock market was not as big as it is today\nAnd there are only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back when it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly\nAnd Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the actually see the security Exchange Commission\nAnd FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to actually are quote unquote ... to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting stuff\nSo that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I'd love to hear it but there are there with him when he came from timber\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family uh probably it's old money so you know just kind of a ... of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but that that um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars are well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston brame and so it was very well the east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be saw that as well [noise]\n[noise] yeah I heard that about the donor family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging and he never written a book let me tell you what\nIf I was paid a penny an hour that'd be ...

I mean fire archive of thirty for thirty dollars\nYeah and and if I may just real quick the analogy that I've come up with that is if if on friday morning I give somebody all the money that I have uh my name and I gave them give it to them\nKnowing full well on Sunday night I'm going to walk into the California lottery office with my hundred million dollar winning ticket and I I Know that full well in advance what I got this money coming to me than what am I really ... what am I really given up myself knowing full well but I'm going to really make out you know like gangbusters\nTruly an in would that analogy you're absolutely right\nSo so so what did Jesus really give up a what a God really give up because if you died but then you came back two days later nobody else is able to do that\nWell here's the thing um and there's not going to be an analogy is using you know joking logic that all of allergies breakdown not very funny joke but to ... they think it's hilarious though all analogies breakdown that means that if you extrapolate extrapolating extrapolate eventually every now and she's going to fall apart because\nThey're just analogous they're not truly the exact same thing so um I understand is that\nThe the biggest problem with the man is it as it deals with God is that man continues to make God a bigger him\nRather than got so when you try and answer more strictly attach Mike attributes to God there's always going to be a translation problem\nNow you have God that cramps deity into a a human vessel and puts it on earth for thirty three some odd years\nAnd ah there was a great purpose behind that and there's going to be some that you know here and some that you'll know later I'm a depending on where you stand with God\nBut if you were to think of it this way Mike um have you ever done any jail time never would you ever want to know OK course not\nGood answer now if you were to\nGo to jail when you were guilty it would stink when sure but imagine going to jail if you were innocent\nWould there not be a greater a sacrifice if you were innocent and in jail versus being guilty and in jail they both have the sacrifice of not having freedom and all of that but there's an extra element\nThat if you were truly innocent Mike to be sitting in that jail cell cell would be a a something greater than just somebody who's guilty correct correct okay now if you take that and you extrapolate the fact that God he's innocent and perfectly just\nAnd took taking on the sins of the world is the sacrifice everybody gets caught up in the death the death and the resurrection was about the payment for you\nThat's so you have the opportunity or to a reunite and be bridged with God but the pain or what took place is something you will never understand because you can never be innocent\nNever people refer to children as being innocent children or even in a sense there was never a point where you and your life ever have been truly innocent my I have\nNow that the the sacrifice it's taking place you see is the physical this is the answer ... language that I was talking about humans tend to look at that and go wow that's great I Would love to be able to die and then resurrect because then I could do whatever I Want it it's not that way\nIt's not like a superhero type situation this is God taking on the sins that other people did\nInto his body which is now flash\nAnd consuming that it's nothing you could ever compared to you because you're going hey it's a magic trick and that's not that's not a sacrifice Mike you give money every month to your landlord\nWhether that be a ... a person or whether that'd be a bank\nAnd that's a sacrifice even though you will make that money up the next month standing on your analogy you do make that money back\nNow you don't make the same money back but you make the money back because you work for it it's still going to be a sacrifice beat the potency of what took place won't ever be understood by man because they'll always look at it as well you got your life back no\nThat's not what took place in that sense\nThrough physically taking on an spiritually taking on the debt in the sins of the entire world\nThere is nothing that you could ever analogize nothing that you could ever compare or truly understand the loss which is why you use money as a reference or being able to get the life back\nCan I can I jump in here absolutely\nUm I mean I grew up in the Christian faith and I mean I I hurt me these statements and sentiments in various various degrees but I still keep coming back to it it's\nI understand the preaching but I don't understand how that anything and I explained it this way God could have looked around and said okay I made all these people that I Love and they said they're not going to get into and\nUm so I Need to create this way that they can get to heaven you know he could do it all powerful he could have just said I forgive you still have your free well\nNo no no no no no no no no Mike because once again you're looking for the quick way out that's a human way out in just ... I mean there was an option and no no no but it's not a God it's Mike option it's not a gun option and the reason why it's not a God option is because it's not just it just clears the plate\nThere is a balance of justice that he's here that people don't understand it is the ability to sin that causes the distance God doesn't just one closeness it's not like oh gosh you just want you to come home at any cost you know it's that it's gotta be through this balance of justice might\nDie out and how did you dying do anything that's what I don't understand people say well Jesus died for me well okay well what the\nPay the price it made it just you couldn't just get in because ah well we'll just it's not waving a debt ceiling debt still hangs this is the human mentality the human mentality is if I gamble all my money\nAnd someone else pays for on good but in the world of truth justice that balance is still not paid because it wasn't paid by you so in this particular case God takes in on\nThem and ask you to hang on tight or Mike as we come across this break 'cause I Want to talk to you some more but you can't just pay for it like that it's not about wiping it clean it's that it has to be wiped clean justly\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOh no [laughter] [noise]\n... will return a moment to be a part of the show he's seven so [noise]\nThe backyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on

in my church really wrong with me and the congregation that church with restructuring after is an ... and now some of those writers are returning back to the church and my question is how do I have fellowship at these people I I can forgive him and I called to do but I don't trust them and I feel so protective of my church\nOK rightly so I'm ... ... they're running your church in in what way I'm going to give names and super specifics but\nJust that the pastor was just not to put it in a way it should've been and um it was found to be that they really did wrong and and that we had to we had to restructure because people were willing to step down to the the church and to keep the congregation I'm intact\nOkay so this was a big deal it's changed the ... the entire structure of the church was changed what horrible and the people that have the problem or they\nThey left and created their own church OK\nAnd many of them left that and now it's kind of cutting back almost two years okay so there's a lot of it that is still there and they'll feel that okay\nBut the but this is the beauty of of this type of relationship if people can make mistakes I guarantee if you look down on the pencils in your house Tracy they ever racers as well right um everybody's gonna make mistakes the\nThe purpose of the buddy Christ is not to this is you know there's\nYou've got the reformation and you've got this split of the church and you've got to know Catholics and Protestants and they butt heads on occasion and then the Protestants are making little factions of Protestantism and they've got groups yearn groups there and now they start butting heads it continues to go on and it's the most frustrating part\nA of Christianity\nWhen you were you looking at it the the purpose of it all is for you to all remain tied to be central\nAnd those are central ... who do you see that I Am a mother the trinity all of these things the resurrection these are the essential or the fate the rest is peripheral garbage it's just\nIt's stuff that the that that you're gonna have to get through it's like in a marriage or any relationship um the essential are important that you love and that you trust each other and that you are are focused on the same purpose of happiness and a gross\nSo in the church you have to be single minded in those things about God not just the church\nAnd if somebody makes a mistake and there's a huge division in our wounds and there are scars and then they come back you have to at least allow that you're going to take place you have too\nMany many account to effort to a church and if you ask for forgiveness or have I'm going for it and acknowledged good at what they've done but I'm asking about those not\nEnd well then you confront them and and that's my question I have absolutely you up to them and\nSay listen but you put it on you know that it's not about them this is about you wanting to heal through it um and don't put it like they're doing well usually listen I I'm having a real issue with this and we were here and we stood sheer and don't feel that you're better than them 'cause you stood\nBecause everybody will make a mistake right but it's that you're there and you had to watch it and in your pain to buy it\nAnd and each talked it out with them and so you feel like\nYou know the church needs an apology or something like that but talk it out there be brothers and sisters in this fake and and not be pushing against each other so much that the division that happened before could have been the logical now it's emotional political get over

as evidence means truly proof or proving\n\nAnd what kind of face I call you to have is one of reason of understanding that doesn't mean that there are things that you can't know scripture says the secret things belong to the lord but there are things that you can now should know and should pass on\n\nSo he is a wonderful thing it is that which comes at the end of reason\n\nJohn Stott right same here so that faith is a reasoning trust\n\nA trust which reckons thoughtfully confidently upon the trustworthiness of God\n\nThere's nowhere and scripture where you will find God calling you to a blind face\nTo an unreasonable faith\n\nAs Christians you've been bullied you've been ... in the air it's been a straw man set up and your name\n\nAnd continually burned with the idea that your faith lax reason that your belief system is archaic outdated without intellectual any\nI'm passe\nI assure you it is not Archie Bunker\n\nSet on a on the family many many years ago that face you know face that's when you believe in something you know downright is not true\n\nAnd unfortunately the world tends to see Christianity is that way\nIt's not that there aren't people with that have been gifted with a simple face\n\nTo face that can move mountains that does not need all the articulation and all the understanding\n\nBut isn't it wonderful how your God sees fit to provide that for those who do need it the intellectual aspect\nIt doesn't replace faith faith will always be there that is that trust that the information is true that is that trust that God is there when you can't see him\nWhen you can't hear him when you can't feel him how many times have you heard on this very program people calling and saying I just can't feel God today\n\nWell God can feel you\n\nGod Knows that you're there\nTo get in that mindset that it's okay to want answers to not want to know\n\nWhy and how things work\nIs okay as long as you know there are going to be some things that you can't now\nOr wouldn't help you if you didn't know\n\nHow many times have you gone through it trying experience\nAnd you said God why\nAnd you push through it in the face and he trusted and the circumstances changed\n\nAnd more of what I was going to pass that you were going down now unfolding before you\nThat you looked up and said oh okay I get it now\nThat face at that place of strength when most people see chaos is what separates you having that understanding\n\nThat there is someone that transcended didn't they cares that seems control\n\nThat face as powerful and it's real but it's not ignorant it's not stupid or foolish\n\nScripture says that you love your God with all of your head all of your heart\nAnd all of your spirit\nThe entirety of who you are your physical nature your spiritual nature your intellectual nature all of that\n\nIs how you love God and faith plays a part in the entirety of all that is\nBut when you apply face your life you don't feel that it's out of ignorance still feel that it's out of the lack of knowing that face is based on your trust and understanding you the knowledge of who ... in your life\n\nAnd knowing that I Will never leave you nor for ... sake you\n\nThat is the beauty of face there's\nT shirts that read ignorance is bliss faith is not ignorance\n\nIs not running around not understanding\n\nIt's truly burst from knowledge from knowing who got is knowing who God is in your life\n\nHow much better would it be for you to have faith Justin yourself the way others do how would that help you how would you benefit it's not that you don't have confidence in your abilities and your gifts\nThings that God has given you\n\nBut those have faith only themselves stopped short\nHaving facing the creator\nThat one the one that knows

that the babies are born with with disabilities and this and Pete's on his face\nPardon this impede in faith for food but does he have faith is Sara yes okay yeah so he wrestles with it doesn't keep him from having face but it it he wrestles with it\nRight in ... it and bring him down and that brings up the hurt somehow I I don't know [noise] well I Want to help and that I I've gotten so I kept on\nIt is normal and it is healthy for him to question these things because it shows compassion on his part and and that's a good thing yeah so the question becomes you know I guess academically it becomes will know why does God allow these things right and not just reach in well it sounds simple\nBut it's kind of like when you start looking at things that you don't like in the United states and you start going I you know I don't like the way that person thinks\nOh I don't like the way they act I wish we could just ban that right then what ends up happening is what in the United states or the constitution says once you start banning that than the things you can vote you believe in can be banned as well\nAnd it starts this whole cycle right the breaks down the entirety of the system so you have to let people be who they are um within reason as long as it doesn't cause danger harmed anyone else you have to allow people to be they are even if you disagree now you stretch that\nOr to God looking over the universe and everything in it and saying what I Want are creatures that can love and the only way creatures can truly love is to allow them the option not to love so uh the\nThe way you can allow creatures truly to love God or anything else the the only reason your husband knows that you love him is because you come home to him every night by choice that you eat if you had a gun to your head it wouldn't be love right you'd just be doing it because he was forcing you so if God force people to do right\nIt's no longer doing right it's like the uh\nUh you know putting a murderer in solitary confinement he doesn't murder anymore right he's not good because if you had the opportunity you would murder right so just because uh you know it just because you took\nA the morality out of it or you assume that you know uh keep or this prisoner I'm so we can't kill that he now he's a better person no it just means he doesn't have the opportunity or the choice that is not better that's without any morality so\nGod in order to to create a a creature that has that can truly love has to give them an option not to laugh so what these creatures do some of them go towards gone\nSeeking God seeking God's will in God's love and love and God and therefore trying to abide by the rules of God which are the rules of the universe truly\nAnd I'm a when it comes to pollution or drugs or things like that um they would uh shun them but then there are those that look to cut corners to make more money to build a their empire to do all kinds of things are to get high to do whatever that\nAh pollutes the genetic line\nAnd then what ends up happening is you have mutations now not seeing the parents of some of a of a disabled child have done something there's themselves you're talking about it could be generations and generations generations of a a a go of people that they don't know\nI'm the purpose of that is to understand that everybody is responsible for one another and in in doing that you know it keeping in mind that there is the percentage\nOf of Americans that are disabled is approximately about Seventeen percent and of that percentage of disabled people about fifty percent of them are born that way so it it it it makes you one say does it is a disabled person worth less than you\nOf course not of course not so what he looks at is the quality well why does this happen at all and why would you know why we got allow this it has to be allowed in the process of things because in order to eliminate that I'm very boy that possibility would be to have to take away\nThe consequences of anything that people did wrong and you have to allow consequences in life because that that helps build character it's like um if you think about all the

fan and\nHi Lisa what a sweet greeting how can help you this morning\nWell in the middle and every time travel if I Do ask right now the case that they get they 'cause that's my question\n[laughter] okay I have a nervous here I don't know yeah\nYou know the hearts and the bottom of the penny there [noise] um well I Can't hear a year ago and I felt that it's hard in case and I imagine that question now a year later I'm like get laid home for a month and I came back and um [noise] I just wonder where I draw the line I'm going ahead and [noise]\nOh hey uh I like and have for Helena [noise]\nUm he professes to last name says it happy that he really is it a fall and they self destructive and doesn't really respect my opinion [noise] and it's really just kind of a written that situation I I just had such difficulty a loving hand in a way that that you would\nAnd where to draw the line\nHow long have you guys been together for a long time and when did you start drinking from the beginning was was he a drunk when you guys met\nMy girlfriend recognized it early on 'em that I never knew what alcohol does in life I never saw it as a\nOkay well I'm not talking about just the the academics of it all you did you see him drunk\nMhm yeah did you see him do stupid things when he was drunk\nI'm OK yeah\nAnd you you you needed a formal definition that wasn't good enough for you\nKnow I just didn't I just thought too and yeah I thought he grow out of it really well\nYou go out\nYou know twenty five years that's a long time and I you know made excuses I I did a majority of the work at home including the financial thing keeping thanks for falling into disrepair [noise] uh you know I just said I thought all this effort like please and make it much apart it can they not apart at\nThe moment it doesn't sound like he's not even a partner in terms of you know not even a whole human being he's broken\nIt right a hit broken and\nHe needs help and he doesn't need the help of you're turning your head and pretending like it doesn't exist ie he needs to be put in to um a system of structure that will help them remove this uh from his life\nI'm as a daily practice yeah is he willing to do then is he willing to go to a or [noise]\nIf you think that's what I should do I can I can watch it again and we have to counseling and that but he takes what's so bad they don't try this letter that said that\nYou have a job or steadily and ... and that just that it's like no no and ... and you know it's only been that's everything else it enough to me to carry carry the lead such okay well\nWhat do what it comes down to Lisa is I always prefer reconciliation however if he gets me and he gets hurtful towards you in any way I don't want you to staying in the position of being harmed\nGet it to the point that not even be able to describe and I I just don't know what's going to happen if people were conscious and not care realize what they do not only take a life of an innocent child but but the whole family when it\nKnows I don't care\nWhat happened to them is the possibility of them being saved I mean I I I I'm so confused in my mind that I'll never lose my faith but I can understand why that anybody can go up and killing innocent child with a guy in\nOne of the the acts of people Murray there's going to be horrendous things that get that to to our and acted by people are without without any sort of rule of law in their heart there's no God in which the answer to there's no [noise]\nNo sort of rules they're going to exist they're going to continue to exist or the purpose of of preaching the gospel and teaching about the good news is in hopes of changing the hearts of man\nBut until that happens until everyone comes to that conclusion you're going to have people that reject me that reject the word of God I reject the rules and the will of God and that's going to affect everyone\nThe worst thing about it is that uh it wasn't an accident and it wasn't like you know get dying of a disease or an accident or something this was a deliberate murder\nI've been in the in fact he had just gone to the bank a few days before it started college fund it was only Seventeen\nAny that hurt anybody any what uh so we don't know if it was some kind of an initiation at these gang do or what we don't know anything\nAbout it and you and you may never I mean the law enforcement will do the best they can find the answers but when you have when you have someone like your grandson there and then another group of people they may be the only witness as\nWell I don't know if somebody had to call nine one one yet bullet holes in his chest ... you know I mean just riding a bike\nAnd and being ambush like that for no reason at all ... ... ... ... nobody can realize how devastating that is I'm an old lady I'm eighty two years old but I I my my health is I'll never be the same again and neither will his mom\nYou know it it's just so devastating and these people don't they know that they kill off everybody along with it\nNo they're not thinking like that for me they're not thinking the way you think\nYou know 'cause I could never heard anybody know of course not\nI wouldn't even put my hand on a gun or even get me one and they go round carrying guns I don't I don't I mean I'm so confused and so injured I and I keep thinking that the child I Hope it goes right to heaven\n... of your grandson yes\nThere is there any reason for you to believe otherwise now than there you go\nNo you you must be confident in a way that in all this chaos um the the father has a plan\nAnd it says then in scripture that God turns all things to his glory and will reach an even into the ugliest times and there will be more there will be good that comes from this not because that's a good bumper sticker well that's a pat answer but because that's the truth of the matter that's so says scripture\nAnd that that there will be something to come from this but\nThat doesn't excuse what was done they know it's ridiculous to think that there are people\nThat have no sort of moral compass to understand the direction they shouldn't be going and you're not going to understand I'm Glad you don't understand that Marie ... hit them but so you're looking for vengeance Marie you're looking for some sort of a\nImmediate justice but I'll tell you something and this is where humans often look to me and get frustrated is that I didn't just die for your grandson I didn't just die for you I died for those guys would that gun to\n\nNow at this point they have not received that's completely obvious\n\nBut if if you think that the only people that can receive salvation or the people that are exactly like you that's not the troops but now you're you're mixing\nAcademics geology with emotion none of this is this is going to make sense not can be something you really care about when you're in pain because the theology of it all is\nThat I came in I died to anyone that receives me and repentance and truly turns away from the that lifestyle\nThat is your goal marine you can't bring your grandson back your hope should at least be that these people that did such a heinous and horrible act would be converted into human beings that are worthwhile\n\nThat can be productive and giving rather than destructive and taking\n\nBut to wish tell on them as a normal reaction emotionally a reasonably you should desire that they change\nFirst and foremost so they don't do this again so that no one else will have to go through the agony or the pain that you're going through Murray or\nThe family as a whole\nThat should be the goal not just vengeance scripture says vengeance is mine says God\nBecause he was only right just when I applied\n\nTo just sit in that place and be embittered over it won't help and it won't bring your grandson back from the fact is there a very ugly parts of this world world that continues to\nDying at the table of the enemy thinking\nUh well it doesn't matter and I'm not into all that religious stuff anyways and I'm tired I don't like all the rules and being found and tied down to\nThe scriptures say I'm going to do what I Want and even in that small brass of saying you will do what you want you a partner in yourself you're married yourself to the same evil\nAs these gang members that would take the life of a Seventeen year old boy it's no different\n\nThan the eyes of God you're rejecting the will of God\n\nAnd people have to understand the marriage between those things and I'm Sorry that you're going through the pain you are and your family's going through the pain they are\nBut not everything in this world is pretty\n\nI mean people have to speak up for one another and protect one another and and keep an eye out for these things and not just turn the other way are being different because it didn't pertain to you because it might pertain to you down the line as it did marine\nI Want you to think about that and what role you play\nCommunity why because it all comes together it's only until somebody truly is taking down way too young for most people even pay any attention\nOf Jesus Christ
