so it's a ...\nThe church it was like back them up but they kind of\nMake a statement the family's forever you know a lot of their teaching about family forever and eat out of the good part of the church for many years and and I haven't had any contact with these people and I eat I Try to go back a couple of ... just I just didn't feel like I Want it kinda bang out so ...\nSo I kinda feel bad about that my wife and my youngest daughter still go but\nYeah see and the whole aspect of this too I mean a couple of years ago I I uh I got a double the audience swine flu and I have died a couple of times in my life support\nOr ... yeah I think uh\nMy goodness so you died a couple of times and better and and this yeah this is did we speak before no I don't think ... are you you don't hear that often the whole died a couple of times now when\nWhen this occurred uh ... when this occurred ...\nThis is a clinical death rate that they're just stopping in a heartbeat is what you're talking about\nRight yeah first time it stopped for failing to that man that's a couple of days later the three that but\nMy goodness so when I'm On my ...\nAnd everything all that stuff [laughter]\nSo you've had your share of some some ugly times some very rough times and you're trying to work yourself through them now\nYeah that's that's exactly what that well\nYou're ... the thing that is about churches is their their community and\nUnfortunately sometimes in that community\nUm they don't always know how to deal with everything we can just been running seen throughout the show and started with the concept of Halloween in paganism all these things and what you cut out of your life what you don't sometimes the church\nReally doesn't know how to respond to certain\nUgly parts of life or the divorce and things like that or even the death of someone or strange circumstances or whatever it is\nAnd they just\nThey they don't run to the aid of and this is an all churches but some do and this may or may not be the church that you were attending a in the case but in that case as well but really um the important thing is for you to find\nA church to grow and to be rooted in regardless of whether it's that church you were originally in or not is there a\n... what is your goal\nWhen all of this what are you trying to trying to get the family back together or are you trying to make yourself whole again what is your goal\nI think that the primary thing would be to to make myself all again so I can get the family back together we are for children to so so we're ... we didn't do screw up their lives you know their friends all of our friends all over relatively liberal thirty one years building up\nSo it's a lot it's a lot of you know ... the crazy thing is that you know if a\nIf you take the subway it could be a method I just don't know how to get it all back together and\nYou know it it gets along with I think the long term plan but they're not and I just don't feel comfortable going back to that church right now and then they have it and even like if you reached out one diamond said hey you know how you doing you know it's like\nReally is it a large church very larger yeah that happens\nAt the very light and many many of them you know\nSo they are and it's like I said there's a there's you know there is a factor the churches that I've always been turned off about a hypocritical ... some people like it's okay you shouldn't do that than I should do this and listening to you ... you're saying that\nTo find a middle road because everything you do not always so that's a terrible thing you know just by watching you know yeah you know Halloween movie or something you know that's not like a year the devil worship or you're you're enjoying a movie or something you\nKnow I find that the church uh likes the pendulum to swing hard left or hard right and\nAnd that doesn't mean to be mediocre eh I say in scripture for your lukewarm ... out of my mouth it's not not to be warm it's a matter of finding that balance gym it's a matter of saying okay well\nUh uh where is a place of health for me and something that will not distracted take me away from the gospel or my face and\nIn your circumstances a\nIn going through pain or a a divorce or any of these things can be quite distracting and God's desire is always for reconciliation possible if your wife's not here to talk um and speak for herself but I'd be I'd be curious to see\nA gym if your wife was on the phone and I asked her why you guys got a divorce what\nDo you think the top three reasons she would give\nA she would probably start off with a weed I don't have to have to have a steady income during you know because ah yeah I had you know a lot of it yeah I was in the hospital for two weeks but you know a couple of years ago that they took me two or three months that we could break from that\nSo okay what would be the second\nOut there so that would be the financial aspect that I Would think it would be any ... any type of\nDrinking of alcohol whatsoever that but at the same time she she has a martyr either that there too and I'm not on the casual drinker but you know she thinks that that you know and I've never ever get on that a person that gets abusive or whatever you know but you know\nOkay I'll I'll let you go by these point by point in your book and then the third\nI Would say the relationship that I had with the uh for kids you know though all four kids\nAre pretty much like ... and I hate to say this but on my side you know they take their mom you know their their mother with is gone through a ... you know for after doing all that that a positive stuff and everything\nShe did like a one eighty at one point when I was you know I Would find that to try to help her and her ... her things that she was doing and she got to be kind of a drain on the valley money then\nOkay ... yeah we we ... about the money and her sister ever paid it back OK well we have a bike issue there you\nKnow a lot of issues there and those going in a couple of different directions gym so I Would say the financial one me deal with something just a beyond finances have you always been kind of in and out of work I\nKnow that they're not you know there are actually I have a couple of businesses and badly and I made it you know tons of money and they\nAnd their self employed mostly or\nA ... I worked for companies for you know uh for five six seven years and made a deal with the general manager make tons of money and then we've always lived in the you know and south county it's always like it though I like the fame elementary school the same middle school\nThat shows a bicycle now like all these you know they weren't sports wrestling softball you know\nWhatever I'm going to a gym just because the sake of time and and the opportunity we have is that um you need to take those three answers that you gave me that you think your wife would say and you need to make a list for yourself\nOr is to uh what part you played in them and how you can change them or where you need to work\nOn them you know sickness and things like that it will come and go um but you have to look at those things I Want you to go through each one of them\nAnd decide what your part in them in each of them is and I want you to call me back next week for at least you can uh if not the phone we can

right has your wife prior um\nHad any medical issues at all or changed medications or anything like that\nWell yeah I mean she's she's got some medications that comes to the things that just five or ...\nThings of that nature which which could be contributing that she has some hormone issues and sleep a night or\nA fish is and stuff but um but she's never been a you know real sexual type of a

that\nWhy well oh okay [laughter] okay to cut\nThat I that might be filed under a TMI that may be but I appreciate the inside um ... ... the reason why ask these things is not a medical show of course we look at the spiritual aspects of things in from biblical in mainstream Christian a perspective but\nI asked those things because all of that kind of points to the direction of um you know where one might look for answers in something like this now when it first started to say three or four years ago what would be the excuse or the response to um\nUh you becoming amorous and I'm approaching her sexually\nUh for her for her you know when she just shut you down cold I have a headache I've got to rearrange my sock drawer what what kind of risk I mean\nIt it it would just be just about anything

and go oh that's pretty Spanish no no no a French ... and I tell him if you say those three things the force choice should be Portuguese and you'll be right\nJust a little tip for me to you know\nWe started earlier today talking about the concept of paganism and how it permeates really everything the vet if as a believer you are trying to run from\nAnything dealing with paganism that you will have an easier time trying to pick an actor who hasn't been in a film\nWith who Tony Kevin Bacon\nAnd that is to say that they're there in life or any culture the cultures are built upon really uh somebody living in a place looking to the left and looking to the right and seeing what the natural resources are to make clothing\nOr to make food and this becomes the culture\nSo if you know you see the uh Mexican culture to\nCulture or um you see you know to decide you see a Native American culture or you keep looking around and seeing oh well this is the German culture and if you pull them apart you'll start seeing that they intertwined quite a bit\nAnd the Mexican culture the use of certain instruments including a\nYou know are playing a certain types of songs that sound like they're ... pa when you when you hear them to go war did that come when that comes from Germany\nSo when you see these things out or hear them and you go well where did this come from where you'll find that they melt together or American Indians are no longer living in the peace will culture changes and grows and uh\nIt's not that the accordion was native to Mexico it's that it brought there and then it gets used in\nAh the foods if you look at the region\nUh I'm I'm always humored by people that go into different parts\nOf Central America and all I can start looking for a thirty is thinking well right they they've got beans\nGot rice they've got no they don't and that there's different even though there's going to be similarities in certain places are going to be differences and others and this is the same with religion or face you have the word of God which is in ... in scripture\nAnd pointing to things both culturally that were going on in the time both with pagan Z and with\nA are Jewish brothers and sisters and these things are all taking part and going in different directions for serving a particular purposes\nAnd still are intertwined with their immediate cultures as well the food of the day and the you know that the you think of Passover you think of the things that are taking place with the breaking of bread that's all because of that was the culture of the time so some things around religion will change as well\nIf you want to read your self of all pagan concepts it's not about Halloween Halloween really although it's a derivative or if you trace it all the way back to sow in\nWhich was a Celtic festival yes where you can say well that's pagan but then you have a pope Gregory this third\nDesignating November first is all saints day\nIn the day prior automatically became all Hallows eve and that becomes Halloween so it has a Christian twist throughout the centuries as well\nAnd you start looking at these things and seeing that it's more than just the obvious and that's what I Want from you when you're using discernment\nDiscern not just based on the obvious but about a true understanding about what's going on there are things in Christianity that uh our our ... our direct result of paganism across most certainly the fish\nAnd the application of the fish fish most certainly\nYou look or you know at the uh the symbol for Virgo you can look it up on line and you'll see the fish imbedded in that very simple\nAlong with the Hebrew character for ... you'll you'll see these things there's there's more to it than just a clean lineage and

December fourteen at a State Farm arena starring Sean Mendez\nYo Ma\nWrong everyone right now I get your ... presented by Capitol line\n\nEvery seat news radio I'm John Jeffries investigators looking into the social media background or at least suspected Pittsburgh synagogue shooter\n\nLike many things that surround your life in this world in your face when it comes to Halloween there's some controversy\nBut is this controversy\nThis particular day this particular celebration\nIs it in fact necessary\nOr the roots of all we found in paganism yep absolutely no doubt about it does this automatically mean Christian that a Christian can't partake\nAny part of a Halloween celebration of course not\n\nI Know there will continue to be disagreements but what is based on fear of\nAnd ignorance versus the reality\nWhat's important because the more you do something just based on fear and ignorance\nThe the less substantive your face looks like to others\n\nAnd you may feel well I don't care what it looks like to them\n\nAnd if so you should be ashamed of yourself it's him important for those around you that are non believers to it for you when they are around you to give them the best idea you can of what you believe in why you believe it\n\nTo give them that hope or maybe understanding in a way that they all want to ask questions or investigate on their own\n\nMost historians believe Halloween originated with the ancient\nCeltic festival of selling its also pronounced ... van or champagne and it means the end of summer\nDuring this festival people would like these huge communal bonfires and yeah they were costumes mostly comprised of animal heads and for hours and they did this to ward off roaming spirits and\nGhosts that's kind of the basic element of what Halloween was in one sense or another it's kind of the roots\nWhen\nThey when the ... century finally rolled around pope Gregory the third designated November first as something called all saints day this was a was a time to honor saints and martyrs that had passed on\nYou can't look at that as a bad thing centrally honoring those in the Christian family that had done good\nAnd we're no longer on this earth\n\nWell as often is the case this particular this new holiday incorporated many of the traditions of the ... festival so a lot of the things that\nKind of the ... that were already are being used to celebrate and sound when\nWe're now kind of attached to this all saints day you can kind of\nThink of it this way it's much easier to paint an old building and put up a new sign and it is to to tear down the whole building and start from scratch right and this was nothing new and have been done many times before for instance many pagan customs were combined with Christianity when Constantine\nWent through the big conversion his was a slow conversion but when he latched onto it sometime around his forties\n\nHe converted the official pagan religion of the Roman empire to Christianity as was between three twenty and three thirty da da Silva ... little things came in and found their way home to Christianity that had a beginning in paganism\n\nSo back to a all saints day the evening before all saints day was a known is all Hallows eve\nAnd this is you can figure out later became Halloween\nBut over the centuries\nThis this data is Halloween has evolved and continues to evolve and continues to change and\nNow it's moved into this is secular and incredibly commercial\nI mean right behind Christmas commercial\nGo go out to a market or something today and you'll see just how commercial it is\nAnd it continues to get larger and larger each year and this Halloween becomes massive so over the centuries it continues to evolve it becomes secular incredibly commercial and really it's the celebration that is embraced by communities many communities\nAs more of a you know child centric holiday because of its activities like trick or treating or decorating your home look spooky really focuses on children and their desire to be creative or play make believe we're dress up for these types of things\n\nAnd I know that this becomes controversial because of its origin and there's a battle within the church is to what to do now the first and foremost thing that should be thought of is safety\nAlways if you're if you don't feel safe in your neighborhood or you don't feel safe certain things there's all kinds of alternative things to do your community community does other things that are are more controlled that's great even churches do\n\nBut just shy away from

mistake or this is not and apologetic for Halloween or pagan activities\nIt's a defense of reason and discernment\nAnd as a Christian using those tools or to find a balanced approach to the things that surround you in this life you are in this world\nYou were in it by choice of God\nAnd there was a lot a lot of Christians who won from every thing because of origins and I'm going to show you why that might not be as easy as you think\nAnd every year I get calls in tweets and emails about Halloween and yes it is a Halloween is rooted in paganism but that doesn't automatically mean that a Christian camp partake in it in some way or some fashion\n\nSo this Celtic festival of Sao in a later or through a pope Gregory the third designated November first it's all saints day so it's all around the same time this is to honor a saints and martyrs\nBut a lot of the traditions and ideas and certain other practices in from the ... festival made its way into that as well\n\nThe evening before\nOr this became a known as a all Hallows eve that became Halloween\nNow you've got this great commercial secular non pagan religiously anyways event and\nIt's important to just realized that God's problem\nWith paganism or other belief systems is not necessarily their practices\nBut that they do those practices while worshipping another God altogether exodus twenty first three you shall have no other jobs before me just say if the lord that is God's word that's the concern\nGod wants you to celebrate in glorify him and every thing you do\n...\nAnd has to understand this a little better just keep in mind two thousand years ago pagan sacrificed animals\nBut so did our Jewish brothers and sisters under God's command the same act with different intent was now a pleasing aroma to God as it says in genesis eight twenty and Twenty one and I'll read that the NOAA built an altered to the lord\nAnd taking some of the clean animals and clean birds he sacrificed burnt offerings on it\nThe lord smelled the pleasing aroma and set in his heart never again like curse the ground because of humans even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood\nAnd never again will lie destroy all living creatures as I have done\nSo it's not just the act itself it is the intent is the purpose of\nThat act that matters to God sacrifice to idols or a false God not good

so [noise] just knowing the root of it\nAnd ... that went together those taken ritual [noise] it was really really anti Christian\nDo you ... do you ah refrain from celebrating anything do you celebrate any festivals at all you celebrate your birthday or anything like that\nUh\nYeah so the earth day\nOkay a lot of those have a pagan roots as well\nThe celebration of life and fertility\n'em all goes back are you married\nYet you were reading wedding ring\nYeah are you going to get rid of that\nNo okay but that ... that has its background in both paganism a pre dating Christianity and also witchcraft\nSo are you going to get rid of those symbols because of where they came or you going to uh bring them into your face\nAnd sanctify them set them apart from where they started just like you were sanctify\nBut by the blood products but gee a man\nI mean the\nThe son who came back to his father the first thing that would have renal\nYes but the but but pre dating that very story yes and that's that's my point that you have feasts\nThat are Jewish and brother are brothers and sisters part took in around same times as they were pagan fees and the Jews\nDid not want to appear to be pagan elliptical laws as a matter of fact uh the majority of them or to a a separate themselves from the even the appearance of being pig and yet they did things that pagan did as well so it wasn't about the things that they did it was about how they applied down\nRight and I understand\nI understand but the difference between what I'm Talking about the the ring or that situation is that Jesus or the ladder ... thanks to find out what Wayne\n... there are things that are being sent to fight every day by the use of a Christianity I mean do you celebrate Christmas of course the earth K. right yeah but that's not sanctify by God in any stretch any way shape or form and scripture there's never a celebration about that nor is there a celebration of Easter\nOr those were the only question on that day ... ... ... ...\nNo that's not the day of his birth that's about two years later the purpose of all of this is that those things that you're talking about have become comfortable to you because they've been passed down do you not because of their origins\nThere is not a matter of fact the early church didn't celebrate it in that sense and those are in those land on pagan holidays and were\nUsurped did both Easter and Christmas\nAnd a lot the ties into those things and the things that you celebrate really tightened a pagan beliefs the tree in the house the eggs and the bunny all of those things but it's what you do with him that matters not with from where they came from you came\nFrom a dark place in God's sanctify you and through the blood on the cross he can sing to find the things you do as long as they're done to the glory of God\n[noise]\nYour own\nPerson oh jeez\nSome on to hear your prayer and someone who cares\nYou know her son oh jeez\nSomeone to hear your birthday or someone who's a\nJohn you here now but ... I think you're a collection of well that's\nTrue and I saw the light green ... or ... among black training on\nRandy miles from John Turner nothing now\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there's whole midlife\nAnd home advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews the check their bail ability even book appointments online and what my wife love most is that home advisor is completely free to you go to ... dot com boy download the ...\nWell it's almost six degrees of paganism because no matter where you go or what direction you run and\nYou can be brought back to paganism even in the things you're comfortable with as we're limited on time we can only talk so much you know during um during phone calls and stuff like that but as we're talking a in the mention of Christmas and goes well that's Christmas they celebrated in the in the wise men\nAre unfortunately we had to go to a break but you think about the concept Weissman the wise men were the ...\nThey were pagan astrologers\nAnd yet people have those on cards and everything like that ...\nDuring the holidays and you see shirts said wise men still follow him today with a picture of me on it to you know either on the cross or something like that and things like this ... you'd be surprised how much it is it has infiltrated not on edge\nOn but willingly by different groups or a leader's life Constantine in the like\nUm that had shaved off as much of it as they could and then apply the others so that there was comfort level in its growth as a matter of fact Christianity can be argued by historians at least\nUm I might have a different thought but um that a lot of that is what propelled Christianity\nYou know Rome Constantine changing Roman and their national religion and belief system at first it was opening it up to all beliefs and it was more of a okay listen a you're not going to be persecuted for being Christian anymore that's the first day\nAnd then slowly\nOr he started opening that up and then he started saying well no paganism problem or going to start not just allowing everything but now putting paganism down and through the process of the years and so on chained to a point where he says now Christianity is mandatory\n\nIn ways and then you've got people going okay well then I'm just can take this with me or this with me or this with me doesn't always work absolutely not\nOr their systems that ... are polluted in perverted because they brought things into Christianity absolutely\nBut that's where discernment comes from\nAnd my purpose for bringing these things up in pointing them out is or even the word holy day um has been muted to holiday and there are things like blessings and the term holy itself that really date very far back\nPre dating Christianity and the if you start just throwing the baby out with the bath water you have problems the bath water is dirty the baby babies clean and you need to look around and see how these things\nAre are interacting in your life if they are neutral or can be neutralized then that's fine\nIf they're infiltrating by way of someone with an agenda or something or these types of things than yes you are to defend yourself and your faith or against those kinds of interruptions but many of these things from thousands of years of filtering\nHave become benign\n\nYou know uh you know the the the practices that these things once held have nothing to do with it a child is not running around in a costume of their favorite superhero thinking that they are already enough demons and spirits in ghosts as they dance around a bonfire\n\nIt's simply them trying to get candy and dressing up\nWhen it says in scripture that you were created in the image of God some argue that that is uh that you have intellect will and emotion others would say that you're very creativity of a desire to be creative or create and build in any way shape or form is antithetical\nTo the devil himself who wishes to destroy so when\nYou find children having a desire to create or be creative and it's something that should be encouraged\nOthers will look at to Halloween and the concept of death and mayhem and say oh well it deals with the death or death or a skeletons and I've always appreciated the the the look of our brothers and sisters that\nHave cultures rooted in a in Mexico and their uh their understanding or they're at peace with the concept of death and they celebrate the day of the dead not it's something that worships the dad\nBut as something it's kind of like all saints day where it's a time to look back on the those from your family that have passed on and to celebrate their life\nBut it's done with him injuries are the imagery is goals and you know people get confused what is this about and it's it looks I'm dark and sinister and really it's not it's a it's about life\nEven the place where I died ... is the place of the skull Christians are taught not just here he who can kill the flash but he can kill the spirit or both\n\nAnd so that that the concept of combating a the fear of death\nIs a scriptural one though I Walk through the valley of the shadow of death I sure fear no evil\n\nAnd that kind of attitude is can be healthy and productive now as an adult you need to have discernment in all things and apply it to your life in the life of your children absolutely\nAnd find where that line is for you and how you would want to practice or something like this but I Will tell you that when you\nWhen you\nKind of sequester a child from something that's going on in the world and it's not explained properly or it's just well that has demonic roots a kid doesn't even know what a pagan is or any of those things\nThen you end up cutting off a much more than you think you are because an environmentalist I'm yes on one side you can say I'm being a good Stuart with the world the God has given but on the other side\nEarly pagan Z\nAnd taking care of the world\nSo is it about taking care of the world that's good or bad or is it about while you're taking care of the world and to who that chlorine goes these are the things that I think our last in these battles of well it's just bad or it's just good God is just as good\nAnd there are a lot of Christian liberties and a lot of battling that went on and and the church of ... and ... should I eat this if it was the given the idols or a\nSacrifice to idle should do this and in many cases it's like eat what you want if a glorified God you're fine and then on some cases if there's somebody who's going to stumble by the very fact that you're doing that you don't want to cause the less reminded as scripture says are those that no less um to fall\nBut you also want to educate them in educating them then they won't stumble on the smaller stones\nThey'll see the big picture\nAnd that's my only hope here it's not to champion a particular holiday or to tear another holiday down it's to be reasonable\nOr partially because if when you're reasonable others will see you're reasonable and they'll believe what you say about your faith and about God if they're non believers if you're unreasonable they will reject what you say and what you do and your belief in God [noise]\n\nPatterns oh Mm\nI'm\n\nHow", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jesus Christ Show (PRN)", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "28"}
