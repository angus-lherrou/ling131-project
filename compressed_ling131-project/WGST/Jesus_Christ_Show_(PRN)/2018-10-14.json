these are attacks\nThat strangely enough are often brought on by you when you invite the enemy in your life it's like inviting the the devil for dinner for whatever it is in your life that you're doing there are times where you do things where you welcome the enemy in\n\nAny Christian any Christian family can take on attacks from the enemy\nBut as a believer you must remember that the the knob of your spiritual door\nIs on the inside and it's only open by you the devil can't truly get in your life unless you open the door and give him opportunity\nThis opportunity comes from you rejecting things have gone straying from the things have gone looking for that opportunity that you know is not godly looking for that relationship that you know was not godly rejecting things that you know our godly\nYou've opportunities in your life become your way and you think well just because they came your way they must be of God not always there are relationships that are not good for you\n\nThere's jobs that you shouldn't be it or maybe there's another one that is coming your way that would be a better for you there are things that you do to manipulate at times so bad\n\nYou welcome the enemy and you get to that place where it doesn't matter what the consequences are you just want what you want\nYou're giving the dead one opportunity when you ignore the warning signs the red flags in your life how many times in this very program have a we open the phone lines in and talk to people that I've called up and\nThey have warning signs in relationships or situations and they ignore them when you go through something like this when you ignore\nThose\nRed flags those warning signs the alarms that are going off in your life\nYour giving the enemy and opportunity\nIf ... for twenty seven says and do not give the devil an opportunity\nPointing out that you play a part and as you play a part in the dance in the interaction with the enemy the devil himself to play a part in your life\nNow you may make excuses for it you may look for a reason and say well I was doing this because well I was lonely and I wanted someone in my life but when doing that when the loneliness\nOr your situation supersedes what you know to be right\nOr good or the will of God then you open up that door and say come on and devil and you invite the devil dinner because that seems like a better plan\nThan waiting on God\nThe enemy profiles around you looking for this opening\nEven masquerading to look more pleasant to you trying to fool you to look like an opportunity for a relationship to look like a job opportunity to look like an opportunity to get something easier less stress\nMaking something more Tina bull to satisfy that that quick fix\nFirst Peter five eight says be of sober spirit beyond the alert your adversary the devil\nProfiles around like a roaring line seeking someone to devour\n\nDon't let that someone but you don't give the enemy the opportunity to consume you second Corinthians ... fourteen says no wonder for even Satan disguise themself as an angel of light if you get caught up in that that appearance way things appear to you\nAnd it looks like hey here's that opportunity have wanted\nNot always is that the right way to go\n\n... says to test all things hold fast to that which is true\nIf you're constantly running after whatever opportunity comes your way you'll set yourself up\nIf you allow people in your life that you know aren't good for you you set yourself up you open yourself up if you disregard the things of God you treat people poorly you don't follow the rules in life changing them always to suit your needs\nYou open it up for the enemy\nYou surround yourself self with the things in life that are of vulgar or contrary to God or ugly\nYou open up the opportunity and each of these opportunities\nAre an opening a crack a possibility for the enemy to enter a ... for twenty seven again and do not give the devil and opportunity\nAny crack any Fisher\nAny little opening in your life it's an opportunity for the enemy\nIs not the devil is behind every bad thing that happens to you as I said you live in this life you are human being you go through things that human beings\nGo through sometimes that's sickness sometimes it's a flat tire sometimes it's a a a leak that is wrong and your bathroom all of these things I understand may seem like trials but they aren't necessarily of the devil\nThere of the world the\nWorld is a place with many many sharp edges\nBut the special type of trial\nThis this spiritual trial\nFrom the enemy\nOften as a relationship between you and the enemy you're giving permission you're opening the door to your world to your life by rejecting things have gone by ... or getting too close to the creek that you fall in\nThink of that visual for a moment of getting so close always trying to tempt fate and see how close you can get to doing the things that are\nCounter to what you know to be good and right and in\nDoing so creeping ever so closely to that line just a little bit each time that sooner or later you stand at the door of your spirit of your heart\nAnd you hear a knock and you open and it's not me but the enemy looking for an opportunity\nTo come in to devour and destroy\n[noise]\nOoh\n[noise]\n\nOoh\n[noise]\n\n\n\nOoh\nOh [noise]\n\nNo no she's this crisis show will

if temperate twenty ... that are that it isn't there and then I think about it and think about it and I did research and things and um\nYou know like for example a lot of these cards are greeting card or they'll fight like Mother's Day Father's Day grandparents a secretary day and I it in and um\nAnd uh you know in in scripture Lee I kinda take a Roman a Fifteen five\nI'm On work till the end of the subject but really the heart\nThat we don't live for cover well we observe it to the lord we there whatever day we answer to God and that we do it and get things and we shouldn't be\nChecking our our brother that that we should just not do the things that are blatantly um\nSo are you worried about celebrating holidays\nBecause I I I'm I'm not so much worried about it I personally am a ... totally and break it up laughing and and and did it that you can with it and you know 'cause everybody knew how they were you know in the Bible\nI won't tell you this there's nothing wrong with holidays are they the holy days of the past no I'm are a lot of them a ... at a bare minimum embellished by the greeting card companies absolutely but that doesn't mean that you can't celebrate a mother or someone's birth or\nAny of these things I think that uh\nThere are some groups or some may consider them fringe groups\nOr is it a take this to a degree where they don't celebrate anything and it's a it's to me that is more militant and\nOn Christian and the the attitude of celebrating all things I mean for the ... of five sixteen and Eighteen rejoice always pray without ceasing give things and all circumstance where this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you there's\nThere's ... do you need a special day no but then you could say the same about the Sabbath you don't need a special day for that either it's just a matter of taking the time and and rejoicing and celebrating people and sometimes it's easier\nTo put something on the calendar or than it is because people put it off all the time\nYou do it with relationships of any kind you do it with friendships\nWith getting together for coffee or tea or lunch or dinner or whatever it might be you put them off constantly and sometimes it's easier just to get something on the calendar and say this is the day that we're going to celebrate mothers or fathers or family or friends or whatever it might be\nAnd some of them may feel silly and you don't have to celebrate them and yes you can go back to the origins of Christmas and Easter and you can look that they weren't celebrated by the early church and of course I wasn't born in December\nUm it wouldn't make sense typically based on what was taking place during the time on my birth all those things absolutely true however there's nothing wrong with taking a time\nPutting it on the calendar and the case of things like Christmas and Easter there were pagan holiday is during that time or the early church wanted to try and root those big on holidays out so they kind of plopped\nMy birth and my resurrection into those slots to try and squelch or squash\nThe pagan a religious ceremonies or uh festivals for things like that and that was the way the early church trying to\nKind of get their way I get all that but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't even matter there's pagan uh ties in\n... when it comes to Christmas and it comes to Easter the the bunny rabbits the eggs all that stuff comes from pagan roots a big Christmas tree itself I'm is tied to pagan roots but it doesn't matter because that's not what people are celebrating\nAnd so to take a time of celebration to enjoy any more than people are celebrating you know pay guns\nOn Halloween they're just not no kid is looking into the logical significance\nOf Halloween they're thinking

as it says\nIn scripture says and that very scripture revelation twelve seven through nine talks about or that he was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him\nThat in that process that there there wasn't counterfeit and destruction and things that went along with it so I get the big picture of where you're going and how you look at it looks like here you had a face\nAnd then how you have the those that would be motivated to destroy that face\nCausing pollution and\nCounter fits in all these things that would twist it around and that you say that you can kind of traced that back but I think there's you're dealing with other things that are outside the timeline of history\nAnd then within the timeline of history in that post is kind of a problem to figure out is to what took place when and where man stands in in that whole equation as well\n\n[noise]\nYour own\nPerson oh jeez\nSomeone to hear your prayer and someone who can\nYou know her son oh jeez\nI'm On the rare will return on who's there was a show called him seven dollars and [noise]\nYou know and you're all alone\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms much space it

ways inland\nAnd then number two [noise] reading a lot of maybe I don't know a George ... a special people talking but I heard a lot [laughter] gosh why we go into a spiritual where I'm Margaret go for\nA learning process to carry the time\nI heard some say that it's up to the solar spirit\nWe want to come back and you can go this whole again or we can just stay up but it shows that most people prefer to come back [laughter] and then they have to come back you'll remember what you report it all around\nIt off this life right now I'm ready and I'm Don I Want to go for the scout even though I don't remember oh your your view on both of those are you\nOkay first of all there's room for ten more people in heaven I'm just kidding that would be horrible you know there's plenty of room\nI haven't does not have the walls and the uh restrictions of time and space the way you think of them here there is no limitation or didn't make it in in say oh my gosh I invited all these people I didn't think they were all going to make it\nIt's not a situation like that so no worries there there is there is no a limit to where somebody will be left out the beliefs\nBut isn't it I mean there are all these people are safe but Holden perish just going around and have and I know this sounds like many go as far as a white horse or whatever but\nIt does not just not take up space you're applying a human restrictions and attributes of this world the next in there is none\nAt the time there is no time continuum there's no special concerns is not the same way in the same sense at all you know where\nThey're coming out of six hundred billion kick it wouldn't matter right\nOh and cry and God would still be in control\nOver all of that you wouldn't matter what was going on on\nYet doesn't it doesn't matter\nAnd there is no uh limitations there now as far as the second question and it's\nJust like coach I personally do they have a question about the practices and very strapped to answer the question [noise]\nSure sure or ...\nOr ... or not being able to remember going through\n... ... but that's not\nThat's not Christianity that day you you'd quoted some versus earlier in Corinthians and ah in Hebrew is a loosely paraphrase them about a ... in Corinthians about a is there to be up she from the body has to be present with lord\nBut it also says in Hebrew is that your um it's appointed for men to die once and then the judgment\nSo there is no there's no place for what is referred to as to some sorrow that cycle of life there is no place for reincarnation reincarnation was never in scripture a there is no place for it it doesn't fit\nAnd uh and and so that doesn't make sense with Christianity a\nChurch you know I Know so little not out there it goes to\nA lady ... beyond [noise] basically toward that George\n... is a lovely man a very smart man and he does have very interesting guests on\nCoast to coast I Am a but but his his job and his focus is not the same as the focus on the show\nSo so ... he's looking at things from a broader spectrum than this this program as we're very focused on the Christian Judeo Christian priest opposition and the Christian theology and specifics\nSo uh we obviously have a different point in when it comes to that so in this particular case\nThere is nothing in scripture that allows for that\nReincarnation and there's no need for it now there can be those that argue or Catholic brothers and sisters argue that there is a purgatory but there's different but there's different beliefs in that that has changed throughout the years as well as to what that means what's taking place\nUm but as far as mainstream uh Christianity or Protestantism um they differ so mainstream Christianity deeply Catholicism and Protestant in that same basket they're going to they're going to defer\nI'm Still keep that in mind there's differences are very quickly so we can make sure that we're fair to everyone else you had one more question you want to do a ask\nJust quick answer call and probably the most part we know eventually it for hours I went to Catholic Church going up on everything I mean it anyway [noise]\nI tell people my wife other friends that I mean I just under this is why I went up actually\nAnd it's just I mean like why does that manifest and or Israeli true when I got on the president's only under what they call here I don't get\nThat I I mean I get it and they got to make\nIt depends because and this is nuts or specifically speaking about anyone who refers to himself as a faith healer a lot of that is garbage a lot of it ties in to theatrics and whatnot and psychology that takes place during\nA a group experience like that that doesn't mean that it can't take place horse\nTheir gifts to the spirit that do take place never ceilings that could take place to this day but that is God's will ... will up an individual or um their ability God will speak through somebody like a profit and got ... ... somebody like a healer\nBut it's not done in the theatrical way the way it often is portrayed in Christianity across the board there are many of those that um you know act as if they are face healers and really it's amount of the anthrax and people get caught up\nIn something the same way you can watch a movie that you know was absolutely fake the that it is factors that you've seen many times before you you could start to cry or get angry or a be thrilled by the outcome\nBecause emotionally you're having an experience with those uh other people in the theater while watching something so you have to be careful as to what your experience is your experience should always be lining up with scripture and things of God and it should never be to the glory of an individual other than God\nI'm you shouldn't have to pay for such a thing these types of things\nI should be thought of a before you you go and experience and things because they can be\nA quite emotional and um yeah I mean you can catch you up in that kind of overall attitude and and excitement and you can think that it's spiritual ones just psychological something to think about a brother and not be lost in that\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThis show will\nTo be a part of the show host [noise]\nTrue power in this world comes from your economic independence nobody can give it to you you must gain it for
