{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "But here's a tweet I just feel like I have to share with you I'm\nFrom about three hours ago this is from Donald J tramp at real Donald Trump on Twitter quote federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels by the way Daniels is spelled wrong lawsuit versus Trump\nTrump is entitled to full legal fees and that's a quote he put that in quotes from at Fox News then he follows with his own words great now I can go after horse space and her third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total con\nHuh here's what I got out of this ah\nI'm bored I'm frustrated and I feel like insulting a woman right\nNow so I'm going to call her horse face I don't get it um this is where the filter would really be helpful\nLike horse races like a freshman in high school level insult right like usually the seniors and juniors even or could have passed that\nAnd like when my brother was learning French in in a high school he used to come home and call me like animal names but in French [laughter] like he used to say I had a big dog face I think in French\nYeah um well whatever I had a weird childhood what can we went to high school it was or maybe it was even middle school I don't know\nI'm right Trump first of all I at first I thought he was talking about himself in the third\nPerson but it was a quote so I feel better about that although there is a spelling error and so I don't know if you cut cut and paste the spelling error from Fox News or if he just typed a spelling air guessing you typed it and uh and and by the way it is true it a federal judge did throw out one\nOf the Stormy Daniels lawsuits not all just one and this was the one in which\nUm I think it was the one where she said he um slandered her by saying she was lying or something like that it wasn't it wasn't the one about the actual nondisclosure so this was sort of a separate not one that they probably had a big expectation of winning any way of course Michael ... the um quote\nThird rate lawyer that Trump is referring to has already himself I think either Twitter said somewhere that the legal fees that Trump is entitled to in this scenario will pale in comparison to the amount they expect to get a and the other cases but who knows we shall see but also again\nSoon as the president\nOf the United states of America a Laker or not like him or not like either of them Michael have an ID or Stormy Daniels are not insulting let me just be clear American citizens calling one of them horse face somebody by the way slept with\nAllegedly and Michael ...\nCalling them and the third rate where her horse face\nOkay\nI mean it's like I'm just I'm just dumbfounded\nI'm just can you put those words in any other presidents mouse in history\nIt would not happen\nHere's my biggest issue with it is if any average person were to put something like that on their social media talking about someone else and your employer happens to come across said tweet\nYou might probably get in trouble for that now maybe not if you're like you know Joe the construction site but if you have an office job with an HR department and you call someone else in your office space on social media you're probably going to get in trouble at work for that\nI'm yeah I'm also just go back in time a full six hours to some earlier ... to share a with you know six hours ago here as a quote directly from Donald J tramp at real Donald Trump on Twitter\nContests in parentheses the bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth far less than the average American\nNow Cherokee Nation denies her quote DNA tests as useless unquote even they don't want her phony\nPhone by a second tweet right after that\nNow that her claims of being of Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and a lie\nThe lump sum and roll it into the gross stock mutual funds in a good you know I'm\nYou know in a good IRA just a direct transfer roll over Iraq is what I Would do thanks for calling

Internet\nUse the promo co Ramsey when you're there the question comes from Josh in Illinois I own a small CPA for our mind brace the higher slow mindset part of which is getting to know the spouse and\nFamily dynamic I'm interviewing a lady she's great we had dinner with her husband really liked him as well then we found out that her ex husband lives in the basement of the house that she and her current husband share seems weird how should I approached that is that a deal breaker well yeah it's weird\nUm\nAnd we've got a real around here but we never ever said something like this when you look back on something falls apart we have a team member that goes off the off the rails I go crazy and we go yeah well you know kind of felt where\nBefore that you know and you know watch something feels weird it's it's weird that's why something feels weird\nAnd you know yeah ex husband living in the basement qualifies that sort of the weird column\nYeah I'm with you and and so you know what I Would do is and what I Do in situations like this is I just lay it on the table and let everybody look at it\nAnd so I'm all set back down with her and her husband for our hurt and I go okay I don't want to be rude and I'm not trying to be tacky or anything but we're is a small business so we're gonna we're pretty close together and um and I got to know because ex husband in the basement that's just weird in most people's minds do you think that's where\nAnd it's like oh no we think he's awesome than than there where\nYou know that's where\nThat's where I forgive him that's great getting my house is the ex husband Gees that's OK okay because in the basement characters locked between just strange [noise] so yeah I mean really normal people would look at that and go\nYou know hit 'til like the German shepherds ... you know of it right that look right\nAnd and so yeah you just call it out then you have to be as bombastic is I'm being right now I'm being funny on the radio okay I Would be kind and gentle when but I'm Still going to put the question on the table and go okay guys and they go yeah it's weird and you know what we've been thinking it's weird and he's moving next month okay cool that's a higher\nNo we think it's good and it's part of a Christian walk to forgive him and give him a place to live no you're strange I'm not hiring you you know\nAnd that's what's coming up an ant problem problem problem you know\nAnd so you can find out about about these people as to how they feel about that now if you don't think it's weird and they don't think it's weird than you would probably work well together\nBut it I think it's weird and they wouldn't work well here so that's kind of how you look at it and you just\nUsed to call stuff out and go strange that's strange that we're you know my husband and I had been separated for sixteen years but we've not managed to get the divorce done for me that's weird you know that's strange or something dysfunctional as crap and that statement\nAnd you don't think I haven't had that question of time or two on the air yes I have\nAnd if you're listening and you've been separated for sixteen years and having gotten\nDivorced that strange okay you're going to change your ... weird you got some dysfunction going on there so when something just kinda seems weird it's like we're afraid to say it anymore that you don't want to be mean I'm not suggesting hurt somebody's feelings I'm not trying to slap somebody around\nI'm again I'm being bombastic this was a radio discussion okay if you are sitting in person will be very low key very calm\nI Would be very kind\nBut I'm going to save very similar words to\nWhat I just said I mean you you know if you change your tone and you go on and that's just a ...\nShe when you change the tone is not quite as offensive [noise]\nBut you can still say the exact same thing 'cause that's where\nYou know when you're in a small business and you get when you're building you got a lot of weird because there's not a lot of people there the percentage of weird is really high ratio your were ratio is way way up\nSomething about ... small business that I rented the show [noise]\nA lot of

story goes back I'm ashamed to have further than that [laughter] so I made a series of bad decisions after college and got myself into a lot of debt\nAnd was turned on to your show by a coworker mhm so I was about halfway between it was about a three year journey for me I was living Amish what my friends told me and my sister lost her husband\nAnd the state was insolvent and so she had two little babies and there was nothing that I can do to help her\nYeah so um I wrote to you and you've sent her to have you oh wow and I have to go as her family unit meat so\nUm we both got out of it she knew what to do after that and I finished up my debt mhm the problem was once I got out of debt I\nI didn't get into more debt [laughter] I tell people I fell off the wagon Iran along behind it [laughter]\nWhat did you go yeah I see what you're saying exactly how she doing she's doing great good how many years ago was that a well her daughter's in college now and they were babies they were babies smoke it was like Fifteen Twenty years ago\n... to ... while it's a good so uh we got married several years after that and I have a long commute to work so I started listening to your ... and sort of began to say to see where I went wrong\nMhm and we watched one of your um about something here and I've got a free download so we watched it one night I was a little apprehensive about that because my first marriage had some issues in this area mhm and\nI at the end of that he looked at me and he said how long would it take\nI fell in love with him all over again [laughter] so we gave up everything that was once an essential\nFor sixteen home or sixteen homeland but now it's all done I mean ... you guys are an awesome straight yeah it's a it's a way better feeling you sit there with

gets so what do you tell people to key was 'cause there's a lot of heart in your story ...\nA motion in your throat when you're telling the story for sure\nIt's hard to get it out actually um [noise] you know life is about choices that gave us free will and and which you choose to do what what you want to do and so it's a choice it's we we chose to do this mhm and we sometimes chose it more than once a day [laughter]\nI'm Sorry ... you're going to end up selling it anyway you're saying I was not and that's about that's about the emergency fund that's about something else ... what are you talking about you do that\nIf they're not that so that's something else we we we have a car at all I Know I'm an opera place so that the car I'm thinking about sounds kind of a toy car I've had for two years and you know as much as I like and I'm thinking oh\nWhat's the what's the what's the car that you need to replace\n[noise] so the the car and need that I Will need or a player's or the the ... it's a good reliable car but I Know that no actually the miles are getting up there and\nOne of the normal normal but why can't you just save up between now and the time you replace the car how much longer you gonna grab the hunt for you replace it\nAll depends on how long it lasted about a hundred and Eighteen thousand miles\nBottle how long were you grab the Hyundai before you replace it\nProbably three to five years catch you save up a car price between now and then I think I could yes\nOkay then you don't have to sell the toy car for that the only question is do you want to keep the toy car or do you want to keep the brokerage account 'cause one of them needs to go so you can have an emergency fund\nYeah yeah which one do you want to um\n[noise] I don't know I guess the the second clip on a brokerage account most with long term so I think a shell and it's just a matter of you know it'd be additional income to my salad the year that\n\nYou're going to do that we don't have any basis in that stock\nAgain no I don't know why\nYou didn't pay anything no\nNo I'm Sorry yes I have a basis in there so there's there's that ... as far as taxes go it on the the capital gains\nTerm exactly which one would you rather have a car or the brokerage account just one of them needs to sell when you decide that you'll know which one to sell and you'll know how to find your emergency fund and keep the other one will now so it was with us in San Diego Hi Vanessa how are you\nGave him gain great how are you know\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um I just wanted to do that a bit of help I'm ready to start um I'm looking to START I did and it's like a full time business\nI down the line and I can to try to um I had been fish mean I think you're right a cheap gray hairs and I'm already I'm already done a copy of the book\nYeah I had that that child works wandered in the car yeah and I and I'm looking to move forward on my idea I have a business plan then had about a few years back now I'm trying to move forward should on my plan and a sports camp\nUm my question is how do I start where do I do\nMy problem in my knee permit or local park um I have ideas that act in a theater ... it's basically I practice in a baseball or basketball player need location it's not just a plain park out Neal\nMhm mhm well I guess you could talk to the Y. and asked them if you could split revenues with them or something like that in order to use their stuff\nUm a lot of ... do that with personal trainers and in a sense this was a a type of personal training I mean I guess if you're holding up I I Would suspect some of the yoga teachers or where the aerobics teachers or whatever at the Y. probably just do a split revenue deal don't they\nOkay I I Would I don't I just want to be contract or I didn't want to be owned by the why aren't you know\nThere that you're just you're just a teacher right now and what you get in there and you work out all the kinks out of your system and you learn how to do it any developer reputation with people\nI but I and they may not let you necessarily have a business name on this they may just pay you as a teacher there to live for right now but that'll get some income coming in and get you in the field actually doing this and then the next step would be that you could actually rent\nPart time someone else's gym to do this with or part time someone else's ball fields to do this\nAnd you know you could you could start there if you want if you got the money if you got a little bit of cash\nNow I Don starting from scratch I Am a clear plan that I had gotten in that dream right age for the longest time and now that I've had can I can hear our cats I'm empowered I'm Josh Rogers died you know where to go hat in art\nI think I might make some money kind of almost as a side job doing this exact thing at the Y. or at some place like a why\nFirst and as I said then you get the kinks out of your teaching methods and all that kind of stepped in the next step is you take that cash and that gives you the ability to rent the gym or rent the ball field on a per day basis\nBut right now let's say you go rent a ball field and and you can't get anybody to sign up for your course\nOh my gosh you just lost all that money oh wait a minute you don't have any money oh my gosh you just got into that no we don't do that\nSee that's that's what I'm trying to avoid so let's create a little bit of money while learning a few things about how to talk to people how to teach people how to coach people and prove out some of your ah dreams and your theories that you've got here by just poking around on under somebody else's roof a little bit and then\nThen when we got a little bit of cash we can go rent the ball field or rent the gym by the day\nFor a little while and then um you know that way will break you if you don't get clients a write off the bat ah when I started financial ... hour a office building allowed us the people that were tenants in the office building they had a common conference room that you could book\nDoesn't cost anything but you had the book and you couldn't just keep it book to just look at you know for a meeting you can you know other people go in there you see it as a meeting and it held like a hundred and thirty people is a nice size little conference room and all of meeting room kind of thing tables that moved round and all of that that's where a financial peace university started\nIs in that little conference room\nAnd I'm pretty cool if you think about\nIt and so but I had to just look at as a part of renting the little office that I was in and so but it wasn't really my meeting room it was the office buildings meeting room and you could just use it and so I booked it in the evening and then I looked at in another evening and I looked at her another evening and\nThen I was looking at so much they asked me to start paying a little bit and then I start paying a little bit but I had a lot of classes going by that but I just the first night I did that are for people came\nThank goodness I didn't rent that thing for the month and therefore people come\nGoes we would have probably gone out of business that month [laughter] so that's what I'm saying it's OK to start it on a very piecemeal basis and started on the cheap\nThere's nothing wrong with that at all I'm really proud of you can do this when I said go do it go do it it's time to do it it's time to get off the dream and move into the actual action go do it you can do this a promise you you can do this very well done good good good\nLaura follows me on Facebook dot com slash Dave Ramsey is it worth it to refinance a student loan to save on interest if you're saving on interest\nYou can get a better interest rate it's okay to do that make sure\nThat the loan is a fixed rate\nAnd make sure that it is a lower fix straight\nSometimes people refinance student loans or there's throw 'em all in one pile and end up paying a net rate that is higher because they'll mixture of four or five or six and seven in there and get it all at six but the foreign the five wouldn't cheaper and they don't end up

that's a ridiculous you can't spend seven thousand I mean you're better off to just turn into just hours I Would think the caller I think the car would probably bring a couple of ground even with the
