{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Back to the Dina beret show here on double you just see have you ever just taking a moment I'm\nWhatever it is you're doing it and decided to you\nSay something nice to have\nOf taking a moment of what you're doing to go on Facebook or Charles somebody ... I'm just saying\nMaybe to something opposites take a minute right now and say\nI really appreciate you knew that Nick\nWell thank you because you know I Do off on the brakes and they have to remind me that we have to finish the show [laughter] so I'm appreciative of that because otherwise I Would not even know that makes Ron and who knows what I Would say\nUm these are the things that could happen in my world is talk radio so\nAnd [laughter] ah I Want to share a\nCouple of things that he before we run out of time\nOn the today show at first of all just to a sort of finish up some of the Trump be the Trump of your stories of of the day or just a little Side Story and a lot of presidents have have dealt with this kind of thing\nBut um for Williams is now threatening to sue President Trump over the use of his song happy I'm at one of the president's rallies right after the Pittsburgh shooting so I'm the Pittsburgh shooting happened that President Trump went to his rally\nThat night I Believe um and he first of all used as an excuse for going to that rally that the stock market opened the day after nine eleven which is not true but he didn't use it\nAs an excuse that actually took I Believe a week before the stock market was back open again I'm In New York after nine eleven but in any case he went to his rally and he played that song happy and uh\nAs I said he's not the first president to have been challenged for using music\nOr that the artist did not want used because they did not support that particular president uh and did not want to be affiliated it's happened to other presidents in the past it's also happened several times already to this president a ... a Williams in particular said\nUm you know that I'm\n... and here's what he said I'll just read you the caller is going to try to paraphrase it but I'll just read it he said on the day of the mass murder of eleven human beings at the hands of a deranged nationalist you played his song you played the song happy to a crowd at a political event in Indiana I'm Sorry this is not from paralysis from somebody else Ari [noise]\nUm but for el has said uh I did not writing permission to publicly performer otherwise broadcast or disseminate any of the music this was I think coming from his attorney so my apologies I'm trying to read and talk at the same time you try it\nI'm ... that said Trump has also had a some angry musicians after using their music in the past including the Rolling Stones the OJ's Adele queen and several\nOthers so I almost think there is a niche here if you are a small business person perhaps and a musician perhaps you could create music just four candidates\nAnd you know license to them for a fee and then it stairs and they don't have to get anybody's permission or make anybody mad and maybe you become a hit because all of that politicians fans then will love your music just the thought if you're you know I'm just saying outside the box thinking\nYou know maybe it's a way to be\nThe star of whichever side you're on you know a good point but either way you're going to millions of fans right yeah ...\nOkay I'm a brand new ah alert coming in I don't know anything about this except the headline but I Love you all so much that I just like to share things when I won't bears myself and get it wrong but I'm seeing a breaking news coming in right now that the infamous mob boss a James Whitey Bolger\nWas killed in West Virginia for them saw that just popped into my new speed so um yeah apparently Whitey Bolger is that\nMa'am\nOkay yeah ah more details on that tomorrow obviously 'cause we're getting close to being out of time on our show but uh in any case that's going on to something crazy going on yesterday about an hour after we finished the show bring it all home to some Georgia politics because\nAbout an after an hour after we got off the air yesterday about three o'clock in the afternoon yesterday Jimmy Carter\nActually a made a statement calling for Brian Kemp to resign as secretary of state\nFor Georgia given his a role overseeing elections here so this again happened it about three o'clock a yesterday and of course went out to ... and once again we made the national news 'cause of course whenever Jimmy Carter says it's going to be covered by everybody\nSo he sent a letter this was not a video or anything like that it was a a letter that he sent directly to a brand camp asking him to step down and hand off oversight of the state's elections to someone else\nI Wonder if Jimmy listens to my show do you think because I've been saying that for a while now or maybe I'll just take credit even if credit is not to have a President Jimmy Carter and his letter said I'm In Georgia's upcoming\nGiven Israel action popular confidence is threatened not only by the undeniable racial discrimination of the past and the serious questions that the federal courts have raised about the security of Georgia's voting machines but also because you are now overseeing the election in which you are a\nCandidate that is a direct quote from Carter's a letter to camp\nUh\nI don't believe that ... respond to that or um\nYou know or do what he's being asked to a gym so\nA a camp in fact instead released a statement saying while outside agitator disparage this office and falsely attack us we have kept our head down and remain focused on ensuring secure accessible and fair elections for all voters [noise] uh\nHe goes on to say the fact that it has never been easier to register to vote and get engaged in the electoral process in Georgia and we are incredibly proud to report a this new record\nBlah blah blah and yet\nNational news outlets around the country are reporting that camp and his department are striking voters off of the Georgia voter rolls at an alarming\nRate uh sell the debate\nRages on of course Carter is a Democrat so I'm sure he's being discounted as are any other critics the only way to um resolve this to go vote\nAnd the early polls of the early polling sites are open today through friday I Believe through friday than closed until election day on Tuesday that's my understanding and most of them check your a check yours before you go but most are open until seven PM\nSo there's still time today to get your votes in\n'em but interesting that Jimmy Carter felt like he would he needed to say something\nI just I'm not quite sure how the letter became public I don't know if he did it as an open letter or that's not something that I'm clear on because you would think that why would ... put that out if\nThis was a problem with her own think yeah because he had to know from the start banning a Democrat but that was going to get this mousse SARS\nRight but uh important I think that he I cannot remember and again this is not a this may have happened and other times and I don't recall but I cannot remember the time at\nA time in the recent past where Jimmy Carter has uh other than perhaps get endorsing someone or you know being at a rally for someone has actually made a statement like that and local politics\nYou know he's made national statement certainly um but\nObviously he thought it was important enough to\nTo make a statement and I still question and I know uh you're gonna you know just go on to your teams here and think whatever you want to think but I don't really understand why Brian Kemp wouldn't step away\nJust you know I at the beginning of the show which bringing all back full circle I said I'm tired of the word optics but in this case the optics alone are bad so if I'm Brian Kemp\nI Would step away just so that it's clear that I Won fair and square if I win right\nI mean maybe he's more anticipating a loss and having to say it wasn't fair I don't know but there again if he loses and he was in charge of voting you can't say it wasn't fair and because he was in charge of it I don't\nTo me if I'm him I step away I just step away and then the optics are better although at this point it's way too late because he's been in charge of it until now um but no that's not true because if he stepped\nAway the the counting of votes hasn't happened yet he should not be overseeing the way the votes tally shouldn't be there [noise] oh Georgia, Georgia you're on my mind I'm telling ya ah not not were officially out of time but we'll be back tomorrow we'll see that have a good one\n[laughter] [noise]\nFalls in on Facebook and Twitter ashes buried Dina vary from here on TALK radio says forty and streaming live only five or ...\n[noise]\nWould be seen

compensation ad because of health care [noise] are worth the position um compensation from insurance companies and whatnot has gone down considerably and we um [noise] we built a dream home and moved here about\nSix and a half years ago\nAnd so it's a wonderful place Byrd we\nAre becoming a house for because of the you know walk of income so what was your household income before and what is it now\nThere was about four eighty and this year was about two Seventy five\nOkay and most of that is her\nCorrect I work two part time jobs and and care for three children doctrine and how much do you own your home\n[noise] about eight forty and what is the payment on that are\nJust it's like thirty nine Ninety five is shorter four thousand a month gotcha okay\nNow it's it's um uh it's on the coast of waterways where you have your church support insurance taxes ... a truce or or monthly you know when your factoring types of insurance just consider would harm\nYeah and you know cook for and you have no other dead or is it\nOr do we have about a hundred and fifty which shows are mostly credit cards and student loan okay\nWe've kind of accumulated those credit cards over the last few years of trying to figure out you know whether we were going to\nWear the compensation was going to return to previous levels and we just don't want to wear house for a longer in our house was probably worth about a million and a half [noise] mhm\n[noise] so we're looking at um [noise] getting house back in town um we actually found one ... that um [noise] for you purchase it it'll be on a Fifteen year and it'll be a little under twenty five ... okay well\nThen we're we're the world looking at was with the amount of equity in our current home we can pay off every bit of a ... for what we will have on a new house which\nAnd still be there and still be at that number the Fifteen Percent number or the twenty five percent a number of Fifteen year\nThere will be a little bit under actually okay\nThat's yeah that clears the debt and everything okay here's all the young I'm doubtful about doing that and um the ... that all sounds like it's very wise uh especially to the extent that you um feel like that this is permanent this change the income is what our minute and there's nothing you can do to\nFix it um you know a change in direction with the way he way she practices or what she does or you know what what you know is there a whole new business model that she can go out or practice with the changes it but even then if that worked and she got her income back up to half a million you can buy another house\nExactly that's where I come over for dinner if we if we do the corporate culture the numbers are going to be\nFired six thousand a month to the good at minimum yeah yeah and we have a sixteen Thirteen and ten year olds who are looking at more cars to purchase more insurance for cars college is coming up but we we have about three quarters of a million and retirement savings we have five twenty Knoxville through to choke we've been on a chip or you know we have proper\nInsurance you know and I you know and we do need to go crazy on kids cars here ... is the thing is I don't want you to move down and\nRelax the pressure to figure out is there a way to get the income backup I Want you to us down and keep the pressure on is there a way to get the income back up just for the fun of it because you know ... million ensure fun to make it again\nExactly in the house we're moving into me there's not a step down to ... I mean it\nIt's a house that everyone would love to live and it's you know Obama going to be able to see the sun come up with the Atlantic every morning but I can live without that\nYeah and ... and again it doesn't have to be permanent and it's not like oh it's a great house so we're just going to relax I that's the thing I don't want to do here I don't want to just accept defeat\nI don't mind moving down you know pulling back to get back behind the wall and but now we're going to fight again we're back behind the wall you know we we can you know we're not taking fire were not you know we've got we're back undercover again okay would retreat enough to get undercover in the battle but we're not gonna ... we're not going to surrender\nThat I've never heard of it I was ... I kept the pain is unbelievable how much are you still over white then as an associate it with obesity\nWell it's not the only [laughter] so ... how I had him in high school and I didn't have 'em for Nineteen years and the only thing that happened after Nineteen years where they gain weight you know and that's when I started again so I'm I'm trying not to open up that might be\nYou know a crush on what do you why now so I weigh about two sixty now okay and you lost forty pounds she said for what\nThe up about forty three pound them and I'm Still going I'm Still doing going strong laugh\n... okay good news is good for you well done thank you yeah I mean with that kind of pain no you can learn to do a lot of different things that we found out there um so I you know 'cause I I'm I'm not only mildly curious about this um in terms of bless your heart the pain you've got but the uh\nThe truth is is that the financial troubles are going to continue as long as you continue having a ten thousand dollar bill every three months right\nExactly and um I assume you've got health insurance I Do so when you have a kidney stone event what is your out of pocket\nCost between two and six thousand dollars per yeah okay and what is your household income\nOr about sixty sixty sixty five eight\nYou know and so if you budget twelve thousand a year for medical\nOn out of that it does make it hard to get some traction\nRight well especially with our credit card debt that were that we [noise] we we paid off twenty five thousand we thought about thirty left so we're we're making headway but you know the the hospital bills are going up at the same time\nYou know why I Would just give you permission to look let's win this medical battle and not expect huge headway until you do yeah\nYou take sixty thousand miles twelve thousand you don't and then by the way you want to eat out of that too I'm a you're not going to make mega ...\nThe headway on this debt until you solve this medical problem but if you can stay even not going to hold or and or make some progress while you solve this bigger issue then as soon as that's\nGone um you\nKnow you're going to be a new man in so many ways right\nSo I mean I I just cannot see this being something that you go oh twice a year I have a kidney stone for the next forty years out of I just that that just is not a that's not a tenable scenario to me so I I think something is figure it out here along the way\nIn the process I I just can't ... maybe there are people that do that I don't know I've never heard of that but that doesn't mean that doesn't exist I'm not a medical professional by any stretch\nSo um but let's say that it takes two years to solve this and you know that's twenty four thousand dollars out of pocket that ... coming up you know well that's just going to be\nThat is what you're fighting you know you just got this thing you're fighting in and it's going to slow down your progress it's not going to keep you from making progress but it's going to slow it down and just give yourself permission to do that and let's let's win the battle that you're fighting and that's the the battle for your health\nTo get your health back on Bush or wow ouch ow Brooke is with us in Tampa, Florida Hi broke how are you\nIn that category but I think I already know the answer to that [laughter] [laughter] but I was actually calling I was wondering I'm only mention while you were\nA lot of school and I had crashed into the marsh now I'm back ... aspect that you know like I tried it for a little bit of well aren't there yet but I tried one out and getting like\nA lot more in grants I'd probably won't out it will not work at home again until it happens I won't be really I didn't really\nKnow what I'm trying to work at much at all I Know yeah but you have any advice for time magazine like trying to both Tony how and trying to get like a little off the ball out when your child that they have all that will ever get\nA little while not cool you know\nWell the first thing you do is your budget obviously your time for your classes\nAnd a new budget your time for your study around her clashes and in the new budget work I'm social comes after that um you know what I most people if they throw a brick through their television they found about thirty hours a week\nAnd um that's pretty amazing right there I mean people ask me how I read so many books a year I just don't watch a lot of TV anymore\nAnd I'm not mad about television I don't think the devils and they're all though where he was having a pretty good time there but um it's not like it's something like that it's not like a spiritual thing it's just a matter of what do I want to spend my time on that gives me my best life I spend my time on grandbabies\nChildren wife\nReading\nThese or do you know a long time before I spend my time so just being intentional with your time you'll be amazed how much time I mean you know how many ...\nYou'd be amazed how many people spend two hours a day on Facebook\nAnd you talk about a colossal freaking waste of time there's one so um if you just stayed off social media completely or virtually almost completely and he turned off your television you can make a pretty good living with that time\nThe second thing I Would do other than that as other than getting away from time wasters in budgeting my time is\nYour best income production things at your age wall in school when you need to control your time are typically some kind of self employed or straight commission slash self employed idea\nAt twenty four years old you can make more money nanny ing and\nBabysitting you make Fifteen twenty bucks an hour doing that\nYou can make more money cleaning people's houses you can make twenty five or thirty dollars an hour doing math and neither one of these things require extremes levels of skill\nI mean yes you obviously know something about children and it would be good if you had CPR at the Y. you taking the class and got certified and so All right but and\nYou know those those sorts of things but you can make really good money and control your time or book the times that you're willing to do those things around your classroom time\nDoing that so do away with the time oysters intentionally budget your time and look for self employed and or straight commission ideas where when you work you get paid very well and you control when you work\nAnd work a lot\nI was selling real estate in college now that's a very unusual college activity but I grew up in a real estate household mom and dad on the company when I was growing up so I got my real estate license three weeks after I turned Eighteen years old and I worked forty to sixty hours a week

great Dave how are you better than I deserve or how can I help you know that sure\nIt's not in the past few weeks or I've been thinking about my personal lives my personal professional wise and I'm I'm also in the process of building a defense contractor and building up a business you know within that\nMy question is are the same personal professor professional wise I'm able to be forklift it over to business wise is that it is that a good way to make a foundation for business um mission statement\nYes um it directly or indirectly your your business your career mission statement as a subset of you\nRight back and so you've got a personal reasons for a living on why\nWhat is it um what's my no but what caused me to nobility right what what am I doing this for one ultimately and we know it's not just power money okay the reason with on that money is why you know and what are we going to do with it what is that we're trying to accomplish that your personal thing and then a subset of that is your\nYour why in the different areas of your life the reason for your your mission statement so you'd have a a personal mission statement so to speak um that that attaches to who you are and then your career your marriage or your parents doing your\nPhysical activity or your intellectual growth your spiritual growth are all subsets of that than\nA answer you create a holistic look at things but no they're not compartmentalized or department of laws like you don't count at work saying you know it definitely for class a over a ... in other words my personal\nDrive is underneath of this one this organization's mission statement and wise and reasons for doing things you know um and so\nYeah it's a question I don't ... Noreen by asked that but that's that's my view on it um and of course my opinion is always worth what you pay for it but uh it just seems to me if you had a\nBusiness reasons for being that was different than your personal reasons for being\nOr was not somehow connected it would be in can really really does that make sense absolutely I mean it would be at cross purposes with each other if they weren't somehow running can ruin a parallel or subset or something but in ... the way I visualize what the easiest for me as a subset that\nMakes sense it does thank you very much for stopping by

was there in the lobby and we did a debt free screen and ah and then I feel like we've really been blessed uh you know a clear out ... opened up for our income is double and a lot of really positive spiritual or you know directions that opened up to us [noise]\nUm and those are you know that those things but we really thought it was sort of a recall the building things up because we are starting to do things right Mm [noise] really what I see now is that he was preparing us through what was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh right now we're actually coordinating the like the future and in class a church\nAnd we're just getting to the part where we are working on whales and so because we have the special needs a issue we we get older attorney and getting her will together through it and that conversation we are\nUm [noise] uh we discussing a special needs trust on world I'd have to play yes planning for a future yeah\nSure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of function the same way with a a college fund and babies got five [noise]\nI'm ending up with a you know fix a square foot home I'm going to only four twenty happy and and also the value of the home at that time what would be somewhere in the upper nine hundred to a million dollars [noise]\nUh what is the ah if I go home so for ... and within a two or three block area of your house\nAbout the typical home and there's not really a typical home in our area it's all over the place because of tourist properly there's you know Fifteen hundred square foot home and then there's also a three million dollar homes across the street so I come from my home is about four four ten or twenty\nYeah that one when I was asking are trying to determine if you're trying to over build the neighborhood it doesn't sound like a no causes scenario\nAn area that's got this wide diverse a price range that doesn't mean 'cause I don't want you get building nine hundred thousand dollar home on a six hundred thousand dollar street\nRight yeah and I couldn't get out there who do have a to point three million dollar home just throw it around the corner and then there's an eight hundred and Seventy catty corner to where I Am at you know when does the baby ... baby will do in the end of January\nOkay well I'm sure when it started before them\n[laughter] no no we're or um have you go and play have you got some plans for our own yet\n[laughter] yeah I I've been working on that with an architect um were were you know running around or or we want to do but or just um [noise] you know I've never spoken with any expert about this and I'm not sure if\nThat's where the building you know I mean there's two or three factors one is um you don't want to build the neighborhood we've addressed that too is you want to seek in your family handle you know construction noise\nFor a whatever time it takes you to put this thing up it shouldn't be Nineteen day project may be so two or three months can they put up with that well they ought to be able to refer by just set so that's what we're going to do 'cause moving is more disruptive\nThan that by and this project that we are considering doing just because of the the industry that I man we're thinking of going to be more like a fix one project so I mean we're we're considering adding almost four thousand square feet to the home\nOh wow you're just almost rebuilding another home\nWe had to basically tripling the size of the home now now\nUh so you're going to end up mortgage when you're done then\nWhy a bigger mortgage or maybe I think we're going to end up somewhere in the four twenty four thirty\nAnd what's your house I am\nHousehold income my my wife makes about ... says about fifty\nFive to six grand a month and I'm self employed so very that can go from ... last year last year we were I was somewhere in the two twenty area\nOkay what are you going to worry about for income and you can afford a mortgage on a Fifteen year fixed when you're done but basically what you're going to be doing here is getting a construction loan\nAnd then you're going to um\nReset the construction alone in a permanent mortgage just almost like you're building a house\nCorrect and you can email you when you're done you need a fully you need a regular\nFifteen year fixed rate mortgage or the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay and if that's where you're going to end up and you've got a process to get there then yes I Would do that I'm On the same problem with it it's just a massive project on your living next door to it um yeah that probably is going to take six months um\nMost of the time when I think of an addition I don't think about four thousand ... the four thousand square foot addition to a Nineteen hundred square foot house gender is one of those ... cannot Hi ginger how are you\nI'm doing right good how can I Know\nI don't want to know in my husband and I we have work constantly are quite a while mhm and we have finally paid off our market share all of our cars everything everything we own high are great you know we have so much I'm\nStill working that way we have been trying I thought OK charity ... are a ... a year and me almost all year and next month mhm and I've been out\nWe have them play well now last night we had been getting all that and it died\nLast march and I should say we had been putting our\nIncome that we weren't at inciting living off of the security okay my question to you and with our retirement or our wetlands are fighting\nA that we eat out mhm and what are what they are and how you hear what our income on security\nWhy when he got much retiring at the end up next year\nAnd how old are you ... how old are you\nI'm sixty six seven\nOkay and how much do you have in your ...\nOkay in or out one we don't have a hundred and twenty out there and our next eggs we have a lot at another hundred out mhm\nOkay that's two hundred and twenty thousand and I'm just round numbers I mean if you made 'em ten percent or there'll be twenty two thousand dollars a year\nOkay okay I figured\nYou know and so if you invest and we did that if you invested in it did that and then you add your Social Security too\nThat um I mean you're not going to be living lavishly uh I mean you you you'd have\nA few thousand dollars a month to political but I mean you've got Fifteen hundred Eighteen hundred bucks a month coming up this money is we're talking about here and um and plus your Social Security and if you can live on those numbers then you can retire if you want to\nBut a ... that's not going to be an easy I mean it's not going to be retiring and luxury uh but you should have fairly low expenses because everything's paid off that's good\nUm I Love for you to have another hundred in there anyway but if you work a little bit more to knock it out that might be up not be a bad thing but if you guys are just you know you're done and you want to you want to live on that that's fine but I Would not set up a thing where um draining down\nThat two hundred and twenty systematically just to retire now because that's there's an end to that game called hunger and I don't want to get there\nYou don't want to destroy this ... so you just live off the good golden eggs on like so whatever you know you sit down with your investment professionals you don't have one sit down with\nOne of our smart buster pros and talk about investing there's two hundred and twenty thousand in a way that you do that creates an income that you can live off of that plus your Social Security and if you could do that then you're in a position to\nDo it and um but again it's not going to be um\nA a a a luxurious retirement you're not traveling the world and uh you know and that kinda stuff on this income um but but but I think you can do it it just a matter are you willing to live that frugally\nTend to put your budget together and say these are the numbers and I'm going to live on less than this and that's the only way we can retire and then\nAgain sit down with us from our best are pro clicks Mart best Hervey Ramsey dot com and listen to people in your area we recommend them more than
