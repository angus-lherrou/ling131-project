little bit here and the um come towards the end of our cue because I Do want to talk about uh the times\nOf course we are just a week away from tomorrow of course I'm from\nElection day and give me a story election here in the state of Georgia has been making national news is pretty much right from the gecko [noise] and we had Stacey Abrams\nWhen the Democratic primary and then of course the run off on the Republican side is that um\nBubbled up to a national attention level and um it's all about the audiotapes man you know when a Cagle wise um outages for having made some comments that were\nNot okay on an audiotape talking about uh taking you know a change voting on a particular law that had to do with education um because he didn't want one of his competitors to get and I think it was a million dollar ad campaign donation um\nAnd he was blunt about it\nAnd uh so he without Kemp won the runoff really because of that I I Believe and\nBurned count is I mean look I think Cagle was going to win until all of that happened um\nTrump would like you to believe otherwise he's trying to tell you that he endorsed camp and that's why one that's not true I I think I mean that may be part of it that may have helped put them over the edge but I think really um cable you know did himself and so to speak or\nAs it related to losing that that battle a now fast forward of course this Abrams made national news right away because the first black woman a potential black woman governor in the country if she were to win and ah not only that but the first woman governor for Georgia if she were to win and so that sort of brought her to the national\nStage right away as well\nAnd that could have been at that could have been good enough and\nWe continue to be on the national stage for a variety of reasons including the fact that Brian Kemp who is the Republican gubernatorial candidate is also the current Georgia secretary of state and\nHas been accused of voter suppression and the first story we heard well there were several also there was there were some problems with some\nVoting booths and the type of voting system we have and and some data breaches kind of stuff that happened a while back that was under his um\nPurview if you well then we heard about fifty three thousand people being stricken from the voter records because of this exact match rule that is legal but\nAdversely impacts the um lower income black community ... predominantly um and the racial community in general because not just blacks but people with a you know names that are not Joe Smith you know what I mean\nI'm with misspellings but also addresses if things are not an exact match and they try to tell us that it's no big deal\nThat if you just show up with your ID and prove that you're you you can about the problem has if it's not an exact match I'm not quite sure how you do that and everybody has to show id to vote that's sort of a thing isn't it so I'm confused about that too I'm never really got a straight answer on that but now\nA over the last few days the story has gotten even bigger I'm a news story that came out on October twenty seventh in the afternoon a suggests that a brand camp incorrectly cancelled some three hundred and forty thousand voter registrations\nThis isn't based on a recent investigation uh kept claimed the voters left the state of Georgia are moved to another country but they haven't\nThis is coming from Greg palace you filed law a lawsuit against Frank Camp and wrote about this so\nUm yeah what uh what apparently three\nForty thousand of the voters were checked into um remain that their original address\nHadn't even moved at all I never should never have been removed from the voter registration polls there's actually even a website um where you can go uh this guy Greg palace actually got the full list of purged voters and you can go and check and see if you're on it\nYou can go to his website a and check\nBrian Kemp should have\nOfficially stepped away from the secretary of state role at the very least he should have stepped away from the of overseeing voting\n... maybe keep the rest of the job because there's other things that secretaries of state do 'em for Georgia but at the very least he should've relegated those tasks to someone else I'm but really he should've just\nAllowed an interim secretary of state to take over and he should have stepped away because the parents of impropriety is strong with that one as they say so just the parents and that is very important in this world that we live in because if\nHe wins it's not going to look right no matter what it's going to look like he cheated on his way there he suppressed his way there so if I met him and I'm\nI'm not suppressing votes I'm stepping away\nAt least temporarily there has to be a way to be able to do that\nUm\nAnd the fact that he's not willing to do that is sketchy to me\nIt's like well then maybe you really are suppressing oh but wait didn't say it's all about audio well indeed it is all about audio in fact there is audio of Brian camp that was recorded I'm at a private meeting where he is talking about and granted I Will admit he doesn't say anything incriminating\nIn the ... and the audio but he certainly does say\nThat he is very concerned about the number of uh absentee ballots that Stacey Abrams campaign is I'm trying to get to come in and that if they are successful and everyone who is registered and likely to vote does that they will have to work very hard to beat that\n[noise] and the fact that he's thinking about that and talking about that to his supporters\nJust lens more fuel to the fire that he might be willing to suppress somebody wants to make sure that\nDoesn't happen that she doesn't when using all of those ... absentee ballots that she's getting legitimately by the way so just again the optics are so bad I mean literally have Rolling Stone magazine referring to Brian Kemp as notorious\nMen you know\nNorth Korea that's who we really want governing the state of Georgia\nI'm\nI'm just tossing that's out there and I I was not really going to pick but I'm picking don't vote for him it's just bad is going to make our state look bad for however many years how much business are we going to lose you know how much economic development are we going to lose in a state based on all of that\nYou know he may you may not like Stacey Abrams but he's worse so you got to do your homework\nHere and if you must vote for him and vote for him but at the very least vote I'm I'm not voting for him to say you know I'm not in our officially out of time we'll be back tomorrow to see it on [noise]\n\nTelevision on Facebook and Twitter Ashley dino beret Dina vary from right here on TALK reviews forty to stream live only by our review um\n[noise]\nVc radio I'm told Robert accused of this weekend's mass shooting out of Pittsburgh synagogue is due in federal court this afternoon more families are Carter\nNobody sits down and goes hey the smartest thing on the planet as let's very intentionally set out to thirty thousand dollars in credit card that nobody does that so I Know you didn't do that\nWell I must say that I'm I'm One of our kids are he has Down syndrome had um the Kenya\nMm and uh we\nDuring that time is when that went on there\nNow so you had all kinds of expenses that you weren't prepared to cover\n[noise] correct OK okay and how's he doing now\nThey're doing really well he's in remission and there were four years out so that way they are very optimistic\nAnd good good well that's a tough thing to fight through and congratulations well if you're going to have credit card debt I'm and you're going to make a mess of your finances that are really good reason to do it okay [laughter]\nTaking care of your baby that's how that's higher on the lives can be on the spoiled princess and buying crap you can't afford right\nRight right well then we had two other kinds of blew out their knees and we had to pay for them and how\nIt turns out kids break and so we need some kids break funds called the emergency fund\nAnd lay homeless and we make and you haven't been doing that and so when life happen you didn't have any ... when it rains that's what my router okay so now we know we need an emergency fund and you know we need to cut up police credit cards and clean 'em up the good news is you can pay off thirty four thousand dollars is what you're making one year\nOkay\nWhat you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans or know vacations and you're not going to see the inside of a restaurant unless you're working there\nMhm but it's time to get serious you get this mess cleaned up the mess is there for a valid reason or not which it is a valid reason obviously we're going to care for our babies right\nBut even the ... the invalid part of the reason was you weren't ready when life happened and we all know life's going to happen so now it's time to get this cleaned up and get your emergency fund them places will pay a price to win let's get rid of it and it doesn't\nGo away by moving it on their mortgage so I'm going to cut up the credit cards on a list them smallest to largest I'm going to get on a budget that works out really tight budget\nWhere I live way less than Americans are put in two thousand three thousand dollars a month on these credit cards and published them smaller still are just by minimum payments on everything but the little one of the attack the little one there push away right through it\nI'm Sorry for how you got here the thing to do is still learn the lesson and that is how do I never get back here again ever\nAnd because some some some things are always going to come up it always comes up in all our lives she lives that costs money and uh uh sometimes it's a responsible spending but sometimes it's just life\nAnd that's what you've been facing so we're going to get you out of that have a big emergency fund because if you're at thirty thousand dollars in the bank and no debt when this happened you wouldn't have ever called in because you wouldn't have gotten a credit

that kind of stuff but if you've got to free spirits you don't have one that naturally goes there is what we're saying nerds like the control of a budget\nFree spirits down so if you have to free

not sure if you put it off a hundred and eighty thousand to look at you that's awesome how long does that take six and a half years\nSix and a half years and your range of income during that time\nAnd starting out around Seventy five thousand and ending around the hundred and sixty thousand\nGood for you you guys are killing at what he will do for a living I'm a licensed clinical social worker mhm I'm a construction project manager for a interstate retailer oh okay very good well you guys are killing it way to go man like you saw what kind of was this one hundred and eighty thousand dollars\nOr what eight thousand was my car and a hundred and Seventy thousand with our wonderful student loans\nFrom a private Christian university\nKnow we were expensive spouses to each other oh\nOkay so this you drop some coin man yeah All right and I'm six and a half years that's a long time to play all the student loans I was thinking maybe it was the house when you don't respect them after you're still there has to be a good story tell me your story\nUm I got a really funny story actually um when we went through financial piece at our church at the time I'm One of the things that you mentioned in your video\nWas a take cash with you when you when we were we were newlyweds when we first went through and we used to take cash would you when you go to a furniture store to buy a car and and and flash the cash and talk to them that way so\nWe were at a furniture store and I'm a very non confrontational kind of a kind of a free spirit and she was told me hey let's do this let's put this to practice so\nWe took cash in and I'm Talking to the sales guy about a bad that we were trying to buy for our apartment at the time and a flash in the cash and saying hey I'm I'm gonna walk as if we can't make this happen right now and he's like I'm I'm Sorry that that's just the price\nAnd uh so I just went out in the car that set down because I couldn't swallow my pride and buy it but then my wife ended up buying them [laughter]\n[laughter] that that's just to show that there is a lot of negotiation from the beginning we were really um when we were dating and engaged at the time we were sitting down with their finances and we were actually writing out the numbers and it was just this\nFeeling in our stomachs of where just indebted to these mining companies and we're going to be in our fifties before we pay 'em off and\nUm so and so he started the class we now down a budget and did the ... and we were really um ... with the envelope sits down and it was just really got serious about it and\nI think the big part and for us for as far as deciding to really I'm trying to work on baby step too as\nWe paid by car off I'm relatively quickly and then he had gotten his first pretty big bonus and from work and so we were like okay we haven't really gotten to travel before kids let's take a really great trip to Europe with the money we deserve it\nAnd we were sitting there on time or like where we just their budget you know if you went scale and said that was the first step we use that bonus money instead of a trip to Europe which who knows if we'll be able to take that ever and that's okay but we\nWouldn't be like a hundred and sixty thousand years old and our first staff member after its just makes it a lot of kids and you're right [laughter]\nIn some country [laughter] so\nYeah that that was the big you know turning point for us when we put that big lump sum of money and our first a student loan payment and it was an awful feeling that hurt but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you move closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year or so last year the incomes doubled down right Israel guy and so that's a relatively new figure correct them and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right so you really have been doing this for a crowded and then the last year or kicked in about the time you saw the light of all the income comes up ... yeah yeah what what was the hardest part of this for your cars six and\nA half or so good\nUm\nI guess you just told the truth I mean it depends on who you're interviewing with as to what they want to hear on something like that but\nI I think you just say I'm\nYou know I don't\nDo well at this this and this and so I'm Better for that that bad\nAnd um\nIt yeah I when I come over here to your organization will be break I Want to be a game I Want to be bringing you a hundred percent competency and when I'm outside of my competency it it doesn't indicate a lack of ambition it indicates a lack of self awareness on my part and I'm self aware enough to know that I'm not good at that\nAnd um so that's why I Want to step down not good at this and if that's the truth anyway I just tell the truth it's amazing when you do that how it just kind of releases you Eric with us in Afghanistan are don't get a lot of calls from Afghanistan Eric how are you\n[laughter] pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve your military\nAnd a former military I'm a contractor announcer okay well thank you for your service how can I help today\nYes sir I'm I have a rental property or it isn't your primary home that I also run into 'em but I was just mortified by my property manager that the house came up on the market or the house so um\nIm my at my kind of threw it out the or the or the inquiry or someone they actually wanted to buy the house and now my question was whether I should just sell the house or continue renting it out\nWhere is the house a sin El Paso Texas where's your home it's southern Arizona\nOkay so when you finish contracting in Afghanistan and you live in southern Arizona if you did not on a rental property in El Paso Texas would you go by one\n\nOf what I go by another property if I\nDidn't have the opportunity you know I was in your lead in southern Arizona and you did not have any rental property and you got it ready to buy a rental property I suspect you buy it and southern Arizona NATO Paso\nI'm absolutely yeah\nBecause you'd probably have this house left over from being stationed there right\n[noise] um yeah well I bought the house right out I was a right after I got done being stationed in Fort Bliss or I bought a home there then um I moved I ah because it was it was a good deal together they're down VA loan so I took advantage of it which is stupid in hindsight\nYou know ... ... after\nThe reason I Want to sell it is because you wouldn't buy it again\n\nIt's also for the same reasons you wouldn't buy it again you wouldn't keep it by the way you can apply that decision making people do almost anything if you got a boat sitting in the yard that you never used and you look over and go you're not never buy another boat then so that one\nBecause we don't use you know for the same reasons you wouldn't buy another one you saw that one and that is true of investments that is true of rental properties true of a lot of stuff if you wouldn't buy it again\nThen don't keep it a cause by keeping it tomorrow you bought it again in a sense so I think you take the offer or get a really sweet offer up they offer or whatever but uh dumping a definitely do but not only is in Little Rock Arkansas honestly welcome to the Ramsey show\nDave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm evening situation here I'm really not sure what you're going to tell me to do but we're working through your plans for the baby steps one baby step to I'm paying off that so we only have no one dollar emergency pot and and the only thing that we have to pay off in my car\nWhich I just discovered you recently and six months ago and it was I really needed a new vehicle we did the damn thing and buying a brand new car\nSo I owe a lot on my car about thirty five thousand dollars good lord yeah\nWell I'm about ...\nLess than a week ago I was involved in a pretty big car accident and that cars now total okay um luckily we actually bought the GAP insurance to cover the difference between um\nAwesome when you're out awesome but we are that free and yeah the yeah hey\nBut we only have the one thousand dollar emergency pond and I need a new car like yesterday gotcha\nAnd so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and fifty\nOkay and um and you have one car right yes okay what does it\nHit the two thousand eight yeah I don't know a GMC dry ... strike\nGood good okay since they were on good [noise] wow uh\nI'll tell you what I did when I was in the same situation one time I rented a car for a month while I saved up the money to buy a car I'll bet you could say five thousand dollars a month\nYeah probably so\nAnd then by a five thousand dollar car and drive it for six months or four months while you save up a bunch more money and get you a Fifteen or twenty thousand dollar car and pay cash for it OK so rent for one month by five thousand\nThen then drop it for four or five months and by your Fifteen or twenty thousand all with cash okay because I don't borrow money anymore\nRight well we also we consider the armchair and talked about it or super thrilled about it but we we have a four O. one K.\nBut no no no money anymore okay we don't borrow money well okay if you borrow money on four oh one K. it so that you borrow money is that\nBorrowing it er yeah it was borrowing casting\nYou if you guys you know less even worse if you catch it out they're gonna charge you a ten percent penalty plus thirty five percent on your taxes that's a that's borrow money a forty five percent interest effective way to ... by a car\nAnd I know yeah I ... I didn't know that those were the faith yeah it's OK horrible [noise] no they\nAre ... in what she got something even sell rot faster gaining ...\nNo not not valuable enough to buy a car with\nThe rent the cheapest thing you can rent a are you you're working on some\n[noise] uh no I'm not you're not and I I stay home with my kids okay I've got three kids so\nOkay how long can you make it without a car\nI Can't make it a day with that [laughter] I really can't get my husband and his hours like where he works and me being home with three kids and having to do all of them to and from school that I Can't be without a car and I'm In a rental right now oh\nGood okay what are your what what rental costing\n[laughter] well with my my insurance is covering it right now but I don't really know how long recovery\nUm for probably about another week maybe\nGood good just milk that all the way out right okay and then find you the least expensive rent or you can get for one month okay that'll get the job done please don't rent something super nice\nYeah yeah no [laughter] I'm not in a non ... um partly just trying to keep it up guy 'cause it works\nOK if it's not if it's not super because the more you spend on the real the less you can start to buy a better car right right but you just need a little five thousand dollar get around that I Am a little mini van just something that runs yeah for just a little walk 'cause you make a ton of money\nYeah and you've been broke for long enough for you to be an broke and broke this is how to fix it but if you go back and start doing normal people stuff you're going to be broke\nAgain you know normal people do\nYeah they go into the thirty five thousand dollar car prove that they were stupid the first time that's what normal people to do but don't don't borrow money you are not that desperate and you are not that needy and you are not that entitled you're none of those things\nIf you are you're going to be broke again you're going to be normal people says oh people were broke meeting and entitlement and you're not entitled you're Mobley robbed something into your ... and then move up and pay cash for what I did when I was in your ...\nMeaning use good\nRamsey [noise]\nUm\nChief production officer for the ... show that was up you'll find more\n\n[noise] ... twenty Eighteen presented by capital what happens on December ... starring Sean Mendez\nWould you see the\nRuns everyone right now on\nAnd I ... I had the the money and put down on the house but I didn't I wasn't able to show income for the house was actually project at my father's name ... once I had developed the income to be able to get the loan or the mortgage and my name and before I was getting married I had purchased a home from my dad\nNow for me to have that mortgage and not ... pm I\nAh there had to be a certain amount of equity which I didn't have any cash at the time so my father essentially give it\nMeans so what's your question\nThe question is do I pay back the uh the the money to my father because I'm paying him ... I'm saying and be sure\nYou have a second mortgage on your house to her that you're going to stay on the house you're paid off ... absolutely and then your parents are first mortgage and then hopefully by then the rental wall of come up to its ... worth at least what you owe on it and you can get rid of it and get rid of brother out of the house\nAnd on your debt for uh yeah yeah\nI Would not only a rental property that I break even on dude\nBut my goal I saw that rental property up as soon as brother could move if you weren't forty thousand dollars upside down but you're forty dollars upside down the toilet wait on that market to recover a little bit because most real estate in the U.S has now recovered you're in a weird situation there that if it hasn't\nBut I'll give it to another year or two or whatever and let's get it recovers wanted to write a large checked to get rid of it I'd rather I'd a hundred and thirty six dollar check than it would have forty thousand our checks all do that for a little while but this idea of buying property to subsidize relatives that we're losing money on and calling that a tax write off this is not good\nWith money but you didn't set out to do that is just where you ended up marrying into it so when it comes up in value dump it and in the meantime pay off your second and then pay off your first there we go think\nKevin's with us in Denver Hi Kevin how are you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up they took my call or two part question or they get out of the first part need help on the second part um\nMy dad came to me a couple of years ago and um he was getting ready to retire and want to take a or offered for me to take over a whole life insurance policy for him [laughter] I think he just kind of looking to get rid of the premium before he retired [laughter] I Would like to get rid of it now knowing a little bit more about whole life insurance [laughter]\nBut he keeps telling me I Need to hang onto it mhm and keep it so that when he retired\nWhen he passes I have money to pay the taxes on uh the inheritance money that will be coming to me and so how large assistant state [noise] uh I Would said quote the million there's no taxes on his\nShow you the noise because I\nKnow you don't have times like there's no tax federal there's no federal or state tax on stage over a ... unless they're over five points for nine million this year\n[laughter] okay so everything like Phil ... who he's he is can you can pretty much like his raw than it is for only pay and all those things

solutions Hi how are you\nDoing things Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help [noise]\nAh well I had an unusual question and I've been pondering it for a while I'm after my divorce I may tickets to started working and I moved in with friends and ran in their garage apartment mhm so I use a kitchen restroom and laundry on normally think renting a room is um\nBut I came across a condo that I'm going down the realtors and I had an opportunity to buy it\nFor about fifty two thousand and its values anywhere from sixty five Seventy with us and it ... and was rented [noise] when I bought it for a couple of years ago [noise] and it makes them out Thirteen hundred dollars a month and this is um Iran where I Am is only five hundred [noise]\nAnd this one's going to be available for the in the year and I've been pondering do I want to move into it make it my own home now that it's like it is ... ... right okay and what's your how income a average about thirty five thousand a year commissions\nUh-huh okay well I the way I answer questions one always ends up happening with me on stuff like you're describing is um what feels good and the short ... might not be taking me to my long time ago\nAnd a show or when I'm always asking myself as warm where am I going to be in ten years in which released decision strikes me but OK Now obviously you can live in a garage barb how old are you\nI'm not fifty five okay then you could live in a garage apartment or your sixty five and you could make the transactional spread here I'm like an extra some extra money doing that is what we're saying and then you're the question you ask yourself is is that worth it to you\nDoes that get you some place that you couldn't get otherwise um my tendency personally would be to do everything I can increase my income during the next ten years and be living in a condo\nOr I mean you landed in the garage apartment as a a a place to heal and and get reset after a divorce right\nBut that really wasn't a it's kind of camping well when you know college too [laughter] I mean it's just camp right that's right you know and so this is just like your destiny it's not where you want to be long term but ... and so my point is just because the numbers work on something doesn't mean it's right\nSo if you feel and you've settled you've got your found footing under your again which I'm guessing you do that you bought a condo um probably moving into that condo but the cabbage is\nWhat am I going to be doing ten years from now like Seventy thousand there's still a thirty five and one track 'em on there what am I going to get my support a healing is believing in yourself again out a way ... our air oblivion yourself in a way maybe you never have to where you put yourself on a career track to get those in comes up long term\nBut a ... if that's where you are that's where your head is I think I'm going to move into the condo now if your hands is saying you know I see on probably gone this all I'm ever going to do I'm just going to route thirty five thousand into retirement\nYou might want to know garage department for the money in your pocket but I don't think that's true I'm not really like to purchase a house yeah keeps a condo is rental income now well let's get it paid off it's paid off oh good that'd be awesome man well by if you get an extra money to about ... miles\nI'm saving not at the moment now than living in a condo with no problem at all you know you can do that and again getting your income up get you in the back go faster\nSo I'm a I'm going to be working on the income so the equation and I'm probably going to go in and joined that paid for condo it's a it's kind of like saying uh on back\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay you're back yeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in a condo but it's all my white or house of them will pay cash for 'cause my incomes going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm ... I'm not a camp anymore fifty five\nIt was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but but you're you know you got past that stage now your back is that okay cool thanks for dropping by things open\nArms a AAA eight to five five two to five Claire is with us on that land to Georgia Claire our you\nKnow good how can I help\nIf it was paid for in order to have three hundred and savings and the answer real quickly in my mind would be no right right right and because all we're doing is doing that in reverse our way Yes sir and so that's how I kind of get there but the thing the reason I was asking some of the questions I'm trying to think you know two hundred thousand is not a huge mistake it's a good one\nBut it's not a huge one I mean it's going to produce Fifteen twenty thousand dollars a year in income and um then they've got the other\nUh Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars a year coming in from Social Security give or take and they got to live on that otherwise they burn through this big and they end up having to sell the farm in their old age right and I don't want to do that so as long as they'll keep\nA spending less than the income that is produced by the two hundred\nAnd their Social Security stay on a ... household budget that's below that then the game plan you and I just talked about will run in perpetuation no matter how long they live okay is that is that logical to you you say as long as they do that then yes I Would do it in a heartbeat or because I Love the idea of going into your\nYou know your latter years with everything paid for especially your home folks on your home is paid for and you're sixty\nSeven\nYou stabilized\nFor the next Thirty years till you're Ninety seven your ... your your housing costs and your housing costs as the largest cost in your budget\nIf you're renting your rent goes up every year for the next Thirty years if you're sixty seven and and that sounds like homelessness to me later unless you've got a huge mistake\nAnd so by owning and by owning with no debt you've completely stabilized your golden years Tyler\nIs with us in Oklahoma City Hi Tyler our you\nHey Dave I appreciate you taking my call sure man what's up [noise]\nWell my uh wife and I did our debt prescribing last year in July so we're on steps four or five and six of them when I got back to the Oklahoma City area scream [noise]\nCouple of months later started to change my job an employer and I are gay or what appeared to be a better job of it for us and our family at the time and it produced nothing but a year worth of turmoil and so now I just lost my job on friday last week [laughter]\nI'm working through the debt snowball and all my student loans [laughter]\nI think I pretty much a barn myself out of my career path and so\nI'm a pharmacist and light training as skilled in such that I'm at this point I don't see myself as as marketable for other areas and so that's what I'm trying to figure out I've been reading books like crazy this last year [noise]\nBecause I'm passionate about um small business I have an entrepreneur heart and I still like working with people that work on the health care sector has just\nAte my watch this past year and so I'm trying to figure out what to\nDo now so I'm not actually doing pharmacy\nOr dealing with the customers a chew up it's the bureaucracy and so how is there another way we apply your existing education skills to the market that rather than just work in a CBS\nMhm correct um\nKnow but I I Would think that there's got to be some kind of ... a pasta carry idea out there kind of old school mhm high end delivery or something that is not all insurance based in revenue crazy\nRight you know like I said in the doctor's got some of the doctors box go to the ... air model right mhm correct where they lower the number of patients that they see and you pay a flat fee and you've got like they'll do house calls and everything and they actually know their patience now\nRight that kind of thing where they lower the different kind of practice management is the I Wonder if there's that kind of application to your world I have no idea I'm making this up right now so I'm flu pharmacist\nJob market is saturated um they've they've been dumping pharmacist more and more pharmacists and ever since I graduated\nWeighing a CBS in Walgreens is just they're just stamping it out that's the ... world so right or not\nThe world I came from a smaller smaller sector and you know here I Am I lost a hundred and forty five thousand dollar income and I'm thinking well you know what next door [laughter] obviously I Can't pull the Lee I'm so to the doctor the doctor longer than I\nWell I mean there's there's two things one is I'm trying to think through if I'm you a business model 'cause you got an entrepreneurial\nIt's to scratch that is some kind of high service ... low insurance no insurance ... model where you use your licensing and your knowledge is you're very specialized in very valuable knowledge\nRight and that's not what's your burn out on your burn out of the corporate crap right and uh and so\nIs there another way to be a pharmacist in today's world that you invent even if it's on a small scale I don't care a right I'm going to begin to investigate business model ideas like that around the country and see who's doing\nLike an old school of public area I'm almost thinking like a soda fountain and the thing like the old days you know kind of thing we're stuff but I don't know I I'm just making this up in my head sitting here I Know that ... ... here's the thing I Do know about the marketplace\nThe very very high end high service a luxury markets are booming in every sector\nThe uh low end the bottom end which is all price based is booming middle grade product lines and services are not booming in any space\nThose are people I mean in other words sheep hotels enriches or doing good the ones in the middle are struggling right and so\nGet off on one end to those spaces you figure it out the bottom into the ... space as killing you so we're probably going to some kind of high end thing is they're the ... to rich people model some way I don't know I'm making this up\nI'm just asking questions out loud now while we're discovering that I might go back in under another year or two of the grind to put away two hundred thousand bucks to go live my dream with\nOkay but I'm not going to submit myself to Thirty years of this grind right okay but I put up with all kinds of crap for a little while to get to where I Want to go\nThis last year has been so brutal and my wife and family that you know they they now see what I saw um you know a year and a half ago it's brutal\nOn their wife and family just your time you're ...\n... my my morale\nOkay what's your morale has everything to do with what you're looking towards you thought you were stuck there I can ... I don't want my Morales bat if I'm standing and poked my knees okay but not bad of understanding put money is because I'm walking through that shoveling it to use it as part allows her to grow a crop\nTrue\nOkay you see the difference if I can look past it I can walk to anything but you couldn't like passed it in the last year and a destroyed your emotion germ your gas tanks empty\nRight I'm kinda glad that I said that chapter you know and I turned a new page yeah\nMy point is you could walk back into a similar situation if you knew your only doing it for two years because at the end of two years we're going to do X Y and Z\nRight okay but you got to have your X Y and Z defined and I'm I'm not capable of doing that in this setting in you know a minute and forty five seconds on the radio but I mean at least get you started there so\nYou got the right stuff do you just got to believe in you again and not completely give up on the idea that you can surf people to apply to carry through pharmacy 'cause you can surf\nPeople that way I just don't know how to do it business model 'cause I don't know your world well enough I mean I'm a consumer see the CVS model I see the ... model out there\nAnd see the ... year model in the high end on the medical care side that's working really well I'm a customer [noise] but uh of that for for convenience thing on the high inside so I don't know I I don't I don't know who\nThat is and how that works but I think it's ... you're on the right track [noise]\nYou've got to have you gotten this this Ramsey chef [noise]\nGuys child producer of the day randomly show\nI'm excited to announce the we're now hearing the hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you had to debut done but [noise]\n\n... twenty Eighteen presented by capital what happens on December ... and ...
