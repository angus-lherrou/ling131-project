it's a woman just adds the most optimistic angle but the child is name calling angle would exist no matter whether it was male or female so this could just be a man on Monday story right it doesn't\nTo be a women on Wednesday story it could just be a story of the president name calling like he's in the playground\n... achieve a porn star so it makes it okay right\n[noise] yeah that'd be a no and also like again if I could curse why not just call somebody out like a ... like if I'm going to call somebody a name it's probably more like a ... bag or an ass head not a horse race you know [laughter]\nUm it's it's like it's not even creative name calling you know like it's not even ... it's like not even creative\nUh in any case the president called her horse race of course the ... immediately went crazy um but for Daniels herself\nI think no pun intended but the whole thing to bed she ah but I bumped she responded with this\nQuote ladies and gentlemen may I present your president in addition to his um shortcomings he has demonstrated his incompetence hatred of women of self control on Twitter again\nAnd perhaps a penchant for ...\nGame on tiny\nNow if I were Stormy Daniels I Would immediately print up game on tiny merchandise immediately she may have done so because I'm going to be saying game on tiny pretty much for the rest of his presidency must just be clear about that it's too good\nTo good she followed up uh about an hour later apparently in reference to ah someone reading her book the president perhaps and said ah\nI see someone finally made it to chapter three also can someone please teach tiny\nAbout correct punctuation we already know you're a con though and that is because again in the president's tweet he said she will confirm the letter she signed she knows nothing about me comma a total con\nShe knows nothing about me I'm a total con that's the way she he wrote that sentence so lack of creativity this you know if I'm a first grade teacher because this was a first grade\nSentence you've got a misspelling affirming Daniel name so that's one point off\nYou've got a a non creative name\nCalling or space and third rate lawyer you've capitalized great state of Texas all caps\nWhy is the first letters of great state and that would be incorrect Grammer ah and then you have bad punctuation at the ... so that's pretty much enough on that tweet from my English teacher standpoint\nHe misspelled a single red on top of old on when I had that first I took you just don't listen to me like oh no no I'm kidding just ... it was a totally just kidding [laughter] just kidding don't everybody get on me I was just getting\nA in any case that with Stormy Daniels response and\nLet me just say the obvious the late night comics had a ball but this one um seem ... started by explaining why stormy lost a destination Lafayette listen\nTrump cold stormy ally or on Twitter but judge asking James Oh tarot rule the Trump speech was protected by the first amendment because he said it was the kind of rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics and public discourse in the United states\nNormal because from Maine to normal like now it's normal to be buddies with Kim Jong own fear the cruel and devious Canadians [noise] yeah let's\nCanadians are rough bunch look out for the Canadians uh Kobe or continued uh discussing our life with the new normal\nTrump took immediate advantage of the new normal tweeting ... federal\nShows ...\nFrom Trump is entitled to the eagles bees and\nQuote at fast news great now I can go after horse phase [noise] course face you heard it straight from the horses that [noise] the president of United States Senate porn star are exchanging ad hominem attacks on Twitter\nOr as judge oh terrible would call it normal [laughter]\nSo I got on normal a Jimmy Kimmel also weighed in because he how could you not listen\nThat's not a very nice thing to say about a lady you made brief buttering loved to have for being\nWith your face on it isn't\nAll kidding aside or we hundred percent sure he knows he's the president of the United states [noise]\nThe reason Stormy Daniels reminds him of a horse is because after they had set to pony up all the thirty thousand dollars [noise]\nOh yeah\n[noise] yeah [noise] yep game on tiny it's never going to get old never going to get old listen I in all seriousness part of the reason I I wanted to talk about the story is just because it's entertaining as all get out but in part because um\nIt just goes to show you that when you're in a position of power and I mean all the people who are not Trump who have been insulted by Trump for years\nIf you are somebody doing business with him in the past before he was president and then now if you're somebody in the in the world of politics who is sparring with him for any reason and he picks on you you have very limited choices and your response because you have to worry about voters on all sides\nYou have to worry about what the press is going to say oh this could impact your future career\nEt cetera et cetera does not\nHave to worry about any of that in fact the more aggressive she is in going back after him the better it is for her so you know what she used the wrong person to pick on which is all the more reason it's hilarious that he chose to go down that road\nJust unbelievable I mean he's going after Elizabeth Warren and she has to take the quote unquote high road you\nKnow and he's calling her Pocahontas at every turn you can't come back and call him you know orange man in a diaper like what you're going to do you know what I mean\nShe can't but you know\nThe Stormy Daniels can and has in great detail amazing ah\nRight I Want to move on from that story because there are other women on Wednesday stories I Want to at least briefly mention um more trouble at the uh USA Gymnastics organization a Mary Bono who had stepped in um ... as the interim CEO they're interim chief\nHas already stepped away after just four days and this is after a variety of criticisms were a lobbed at her from a couple of the gymnast who\nUm were victimized by Larry Nassar and here's here's the short version of the story because we're almost out of time but essentially a two problems with Mary Bono one Simone Biles pointed out on Twitter ah I I think this is about a\nMaybe not quite a week ago but\nBack in September Mary Bono a tweet at a picture of herself a blacking out the Nike logo on her sneakers after the whole cow calling ... ad campaign was brought to light\nAnd Simone Biles or maybe had just gotten word of it last week and so she tweeted this mouth drops\nDon't worry it's not like we needed a smarter USA Gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything uh and she tweeted a picture of said Nike a you know scratching outpost by Mary Bono and then just shortly after that a couple of days later Alexandra raise men tweeted\nAbout another issue with Mary Bono and that is that she used to work at the law firm Fager Baker Daniels\nThat defended the usa gee in twenty Fifteen you know\nAnd tried to cover up the whole Larry Nassar thing so even though Mary Bono wasn't directly involved it was her farm\nAnd so with those two things happening and all of the online brief about that Mary Bono has a stepped away and had this to say on her own Twitter\nI regret the post and respect everyone's views and fundamental right to express them this doesn't reflect how I Will approach my position now that was before she stepped down and says I I'll do everything I can to help build the community\nShe then did step down with essentially not really an apology\nJust said there's a lot of stepping lobbed at me and it's going to make us say gee look bad so I'm going to step away I'm going to say that's two thumbs down to Mary Bono ... bad apology lady and that that were officially added time but a game on tiny semi [noise]\n\nFollow gene on Facebook

that's a good way to lose all your money\nSo you need to look at the business aspect of this where does this turn into money and what how many steps does it take to turn it in the money and how much money does it turn into and how likely is it to turn into money and because it scares crap out of me you're in a really narrow market a fad like market\nAnd it sounds like you've got a guy from

of all the thing about you know three weeks ago when I was driving her you're on the radio but my first baby ... with my mother put or nine years I Need money\nTo go to work [laughter] but I have five between me and my wife we have five or ... and have our age and I was\nWondering shakes you know you might consider consolidating those cars that last former employees employers and so is she but and we were all their stuff over and go right so I just want to watch\nEvery different four O. one K. will be a different IRA when you roll it but you could have five I our age that we're all rollovers from previous for a one case or previous IRAs and they could all be at one investment broker and one person won't watching over it with you um and that's a viable\nUh so uh yeah I I Would get with one of those smart Mr burrows I was just talking about right before I picked up a call\n... ... dot com and they can show you how to do those rollovers there shouldn't be any taxes involved if he'd roll over a traditional i._r._a. to a tradition or traditional four O. one K. to a traditional i._r._a. there's no taxes on that if you do a direct transfer a roll over\nAnd I'm Don we're always recommend and I personally invest\nWith recommendations that I use oddly enough a too that we put your in retirement and my retirement in four types of growth stocks mutual funds gross growth in income\nAggressive growth and international and spread the total of their nest egg across those four and a evenly twenty five percentage Kathy is with us in Wisconsin I Cathy how're you\nI'm good how are you there aren't any better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm my husband and I are looking to retire within the next two to three beers um hadn't been for sure [noise] now we have a third of our income or with our retirement savings\nWhere a financial advisor to current night and I'm Wondering like your opinion they're having more than my financial advisor\nWhy would you need more than one [noise]\nUm the only reason that I'm I I worry a little bit is that you'd have all of you or your retirement savings went windy moors\nIt's not with them they're just advising you know you are and where to put it mhm you're not with them on their their the I mean it it's like saying I'm\nYou know I've got four different cars\nAnd so I'm worried about the mechanic already own cars and the mechanic is just helping me manage all before cars\n\nIt doesn't change the mix that'd be a two of the cars one mechanic and do the guards with the other McKenna you've still got the same for cars and you still have to manage all four of them so it makes sense\nYeah I Do I don't I don't know now I'd be Clinton [laughter]\nOkay well it's not connecting them 'cause it's perfect but uh the ... the idea is this the investments that you\nHave are not owned and operated by your financial adviser you owned them your advisor is just telling you what to do with what things you own\nAnd so you could own mutual funds in three different mutual for different mutual funds\nAnd a half two of them was one advisor and two of them were than other advisor or you could have all four of them was won advisor in either case you're still own for mutual funds the exact same for by the way\nBecause you're you should be making the decision about where your money goes\nThe advisor teaches you and advisors you but you should be making the money the decision about where your money go you're not blindly turning over a block of money and go just doing whatever you want\nYou know no that's just dangerous just cried you need to know everything about where this money is going and understand everything about it and so if that's the case then the financial advisors simply the conduit and an information source\nAnd if you don't trust the information source they shouldn't be your advisor\nThat's why you don't need to any one\nThat their information aligns with your value system and what you are planning to do with your investments and then they walk you through that\nI have one\nAnd there's twenty five accounts with this one guy in my case\nAnd and so but the twenty five accounts or mine or not his and he just advisors me on whether I Want to put more and more and more than\nOne open another one more than I Want them to them together\nWe just talk through what these funds are doing with these investments are doing I understand what they're doing based on his advice and based on that then I make the decision of what's going to happen with my money and that's what I Want you're doing and if you do it that way then there's no benefit whatsoever to having to financial advisors\nAnd the only reason you would do that is if you didn't trust one of them which means you shouldn't even have them\nAnd so that that's the idea that's what the analogy was trying to get to I guess I missed it sorry about that Sean is with us in\nTucson, Arizona Hi Shaun how are you\nThere God how can I help ...\nOh I'm open to give you some numbers here real quick um ... ... ... ... cash about forty monitor rub her\nAnd I'm starting to bounce here I'm I'm traveling nurse and I thought at all ...

a student loan and we were under the impression there are attorney that it you know what matter whether we put it down or not I mean we've got that include everything that I'm\nOkay how does it matter if you're attorney thought it was a Sallie Mae your attorney was telling you that Sallie Mae's or not bankrupt ... that survives the bankruptcy if it's a private loan it's just like a personal line of credit is what it is and it completely was bankrupted\nOkay so do you put down chase student loans some amount on your matrix\nI'm not worried about it it was a banker right it was my corrupted address your bankruptcy was discharged yeah\nOK then if someone comes up you go and says we your sister alone is I Know that was bankrupted a stun originally chase and that was what was left on the bankruptcy matrix and nobody could find you people but you know it's clear there should be clear it I don't know why your attorney would think that's not bankrupt it I think they must have thought it was a Sallie Mae loan\nPossibly I mean like I said my husband's not very organized by [noise] um I mean we did say it was a private loan I Know that\nI don't know or the or a private student loan is basically an secured one\nIt's just the one that was used for college okay you just use like a personal I'm ready for college is the same thing a government insured Sallie Mae alone is not bankrupt

several times you do some other NFL work as well so some of the other teams have called and you and Chris organ in both been available to them and and helping them when you're meeting with those guys I'm\n... and they're asking you money questions what's coming up\nYou know day this is the main thing that's coming up hey I'm young I'm twenty two years old I was only making maybe five thousand dollars a year my first check was Fifteen thousand and I'm gonna get another one next week it what do I do\n... how ... how do you keep from being overwhelmed overwhelmed money\nWith the pressure with

the opportunity to to mentor and they're you know they they they're going out there and buy some big things and other rookies are seeing that are saying well wait should I Do that and I'm like no no no do not do that and save your money live on a plan live on a budget\nAnd with the coolest thing was with the ravens I can say this was all of them sign up for every dollar a couple of weeks ago um and all of them did every dollar plus and so there was like ... how do we do this and it was surprising to see that a lot of kids did not know how to budget\nEither twenty two year old Twenty one euros making nearly\nUm on average sucking the low end is about Fifteen thousand dollars a game so it's about sixty thousand dollars a month\nTo about two hundred thousand dollars a month and they

skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key uh yeah [laughter]\nBut that doesn't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kind of weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet I'm In his physical acumen his physical\nUh IQ the things you can do with this body in mid error or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do\nWell I have but I I I Would think an unusual question but maybe not I have a twenty year old granddaughter she is living on her own now um she was working fulltime ... more than a full time she had two jobs when she lived in a war\nBut um [noise] had to move and so she's renting a room for hours away from the Denver area and she was only able to get

making that she you know has room rental room she's making it\nUm but just barely yes you can imagine I'm working at a rally it's part time [laughter] so uh the problem is that she is making it but now she just found out she has five not for it but I went to the teeth in her mouth all of which have to come out and we'll be willing to the thousands\nWhy our ... why did she move away from her income\nBecause um it was a dangerous area her house with being shot up her father's truck with blown up at ... at the house I'm it with a life threatening situation um she walked into the house twice and it was a meeting and people were in\nThere and I got that burger I had jobs right\nShe had a job\nAnd she ... she moved so far away that she couldn't do that job when you can move out of the hood and move into a decent area and keep the job\nWell he couldn't find a rental in the Denver area that which within her range she felt yeah I don't yeah I mean do do do that in\nDenver at the very very expensive rental area and so she moved somebody offered her room over in a\nState run ... shows so she got into a mess 'cause she overreacted and I'm jumped away from her income with our income set up on the other end and now she's dolled up up up\nShe said I didn't have to tell you that the company she was working for promised her they were transferred to fulltime even there oh so when she when they had told her yeah well we'll give you a full time day or two we understand\nAnd so she got there and all of a sudden it with them right now it's part time it will working fulltime but now it's
