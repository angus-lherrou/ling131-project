{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Should probably go check it out anyway because they just revamp the whole stadium so it's a photo album this it's going to be sweet\nState Farm arena not Philips Arena don't put that in your GPS we're a state\nFarm arena I Know I drove a around downtown the other day I was down there and I saw all the signage now says date for marine and as it did freak me out a little bit of weight minor it place what's going on\nA but yet okay speaking of downtown and uh that whole area CNN Center and all of that some big news ah actually coming out of CNN and a corporate that is it's sort of ... not good for New York but good for Atlanta for a change CNN uh\nYou know used to do everything from Atlanta this was headquarters and this is where it all happened but then you know as times changed they moved a lot of their operation to New York so they're big shows of CNN there's still a lot of CNN stuff that happens here but the bulk of the the main CNN shows happened out of New York\nAnd um H. O. N. headline news was sort of split so Robin made in is here um for her morning express on a chat line but the rest of the shows were elsewhere most of most of them in New York but also in California everywhere\nOr they're changing all of that so CNN announcing that they are moving all of the headline news live programming back to Atlanta and they are actually cancelling a bunch of the current shows so they're revamping what's going on on headline news now robbing me and mornings Russell status and in fact she gets an extra hour\nBut they're canceling some of the shows a including across America with Carol Costello that's gone a McCalla which is a McCalla press that's gone and also crime and justice with Ashley ban failed gone so I guess those just weren't holding up\nAnd other women in about five Fifteen jobs I Believe out of New York as they consolidated things here in Atlanta and they are also I I think I'd go with some more uh some let you know they're going to less live\nActual live programming they're going to add some more hopeful hopefully it's not just like the forensic files twenty four seven [laughter]\nBut I just thought I'd mention it because it is here and it does you know potentially you know you never know it took me some more opportunities here ah for some news folk so we'll keep our fingers crossed 'cause we're sort of in that in that game so you never know you never know what I'm trying to say\nHey well we're talking about things that are local and downtown I Want to also mentioned uh the Gulch that project that a development project has been pretty controversial uh in particular over the last three or four weeks uh the mayor wants to go forward\nWith it um the uh central and a progress which is the downtown improvement district organization\nThey want to go forward with it but there are some of the city council that are ... it is an expensive deal and there are some neighbors and some are residents who are on shore raising concerns et cetera et cetera\nI mentioned all of this only to let you know that the Atlanta city council is now expecting to hold a special meeting next week to reconsider again this public financing package for this Gulch project a that is a project being put together by I Believe the developers called see I Am\nAnd it is a a package that is like a five billion dollar package and so apparently what's been happening behind the scenes\nAre among other things as a lot of renegotiation\nWheeling and dealing on certain of the um\nClauses and and you know things that were controversial so they're trying to get\nTo a place where everybody can be happy and sign off on this deal as well go ahead and post a link to that article on our shown its page a it's a it's an article out of the AJC in case you're interested in want to go a check out that Atlanta city council meeting next week away and you know with an email or any of those kinda things\nWeighing in with emails I wanted to mention this back in the I'm In the weeks of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation or right I think within a couple of days after or the day after maybe uh\nTestimony of Christine Blasey Ford and a bright cabinet or maybe that was on a friday I think if I remember correctly so maybe somewhere after that are working on a Thursday anyway it doesn't matter somewhere in there which is now at least one is that three weeks ago Nick\nI sent emails to our two state senators I'm Sorry I didn't say that the way it made sense are two senators the two senators that represent our state and they put it that way for more clear a Johnny Isaacson and David Perdue\nAnd I sent them both emails they were short emails but I basically just said it was after the hearings I basically just say listen I Am a you know a resident of the state and I just want to let you know that regardless of whether he did or did not uh\nCommit any crimes and whether or he did or their interests not any corroborating evidence it is my opinion is that a Brett Kavanaugh did not display the proper demeanor to be a Supreme Court justice and I would appreciate it if you would not vote to confirm him\nAnd it was short I didn't think that and I basically cut and paste into two separate emails and sent it to the two of them\nAnd I got no response until two days ago so three weeks later coincidentally or not I got responses from both on the same day October seventeenth several weeks after the vote in question\nAnd neither one of them said anything about what I actually said about his demeanor but rather explained their reasons for going ahead and confirming\nSo I'm just going to put this out their senator Johnny Isaacson and Senator David Perdue I don't feel heard just now I Am a constituent of this state and I spoke to you and I didn't get a valid answer\nI Do not feel hurt 'em if this is the best you can do\nYou are up for reelection I Will not be voting for you I\nReally want opposed to anyone listening right now if you've ever sent something to your senator representative on the federal level ... representatives and senators are usually a little bit better there as far west constituents to deal with but\nHave you ever get any real response that's not a form letter and it was a time we response let us know because I've sent multiple emails all those especially for the neutrality I sent them as well to both of them and I got the same thing it was like four weeks late and then after they'd already made the decision I got a form letter responses yeah this is why I support them\nOkay I Know it's from my question right I mean here's the thing\nEither hire someone who can answer your emails because it's not that expensive they make plenty of money and they have plenty of money put somebody on yourself who can actually respond to your constituents in a meaningful way and in a timely way\nAnd if you want to do is to answer questions and you didn't do this how about this how about an ethic you\nSo let's say that hundreds of thousands of people are writing to the centers and saying the same thing and you don't want to have somebody answering those emails one by one I can respect that do have but they put an ethic you on your website frequently asked questions and say this is one of the comments we've gone from a lot of our constituents discussing you're asking\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh's demeanor for example are asking about net neutrality for example and here is my response to that\nQuestion specifically and then send me an email with a link to that response I'm okay with that but to send me a form letter that doesn't answer my question and to send it or ignore my concern and doesn't answer it for three weeks to long after the fact\nDoes not give me confidence that I've been hurt\n'em at all because what what I'm Wondering is did they just not even get to my email until three weeks later so they don't even know what I wanted to say they didn't even hear it nobody even told them there there it didn't get to them it's fake and the fact that I got the ... I got a response from both of them\nOn the same day three weeks later leads me to believe that they both subscribe to the same response service\nBecause I got the response of what is the likelihood that I got the response on the same day unless there's some service that is handling that and it's the same on for both and I am giving out of two thumbs down [noise]\nAnd a raspberry ah you you look this is the digital age you got to do better than that\nThat's not nice and forget it I thought that's just me feeling like I got my feelings hurt them apple and Lindsey Graham for a second my feelings are hurt 'em but you know I should be heard at least I I understand that you also have constituents that really wanted you to confirm Brett Kavanaugh and that's fine but then maybe say that say listen we\nReally appreciate your feedback and we we represent you as a member of the state but we did here for more people in the state who wanted him confirmed and that's the way we went that's a different story\n[noise] that's not what they said\nAh I don't feel heard people but I Do buy all of you to thank you for listening as always we're officially out of time on this Friday to thank you for listening today and all week and we will see it back here on Monday I have a good one [noise]\n\nFollow gene on Facebook and Twitter ash dino beret tune into the dean of marriage weekdays for news the white here on TALK radio six forty and streaming live only find hard radiolab\n[noise]\nAnd I get when they send you one of those teen entrepreneur two boxers it'll help you with that process but I wouldn't I wouldn't fool with I'm doing all of those things unless you were doing something that where you really thought you were going to get sued or something and you're you're not you're not you're she she's fine\nHey thanks for the call Katie is with us in Maryland Hi Katie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nOkay so um I have bullet points here I'll go through them quickly I ... I only by Claire for Twenty years I relocated to Maryland closer because the card or other ... and um I make Seventy five thousand a year my husband really\nForty I'm thirty five forty to forty I claimed after you do what I'm at climbing auto claims adjuster claims adjuster okay good\n[laughter] and we have forty five thousand dollars in debt\nOr we purchased a house fires there were two hundred and Twenty one thousand left on that mhm I'm here with the ethical back mixture and kicked out and then ... ... ... ... I had a hundred and kind of home about ... or ...\nOr so my question that first\nOf all I could relocate to a different city but I don't want him I really like it here in ... why or why would you need to do that I'm I'm afraid that I Will make as much\nIf I look for another job why are you leaving your company\nOh I'm Sorry they're closing here next ... oh well yeah OK mentioned that I spoke to a fellow I we we want to stay here mhm not the other part today is that if I stayed on that okay\nI'll get back into it to the equivalent of about thirty three weeks [laughter] I'm I'm thinking after it get hit with taxes\nAnd because I currently have the health benefits that it's probably not going to come out\nTo enough that court waiting for\nOh yeah I'm Wondering well it depends on it depends on what kind of a job you get I mean if you get a job like an eighty grand that\nMight not be worth waiting for because you might trade out the service for the stability\nBut um I mean we're talking about thirty five thousand bucks or minus taxes and that's not you know there's no chump change\nBut I'd be a nice thing to have a room particularly how deeply indebted you guys are so um you know your tax rate is twenty three percent and so it's not gonna get only be talks about five six seven thousand bucks so now after taxes the taxes are not going to eat it all up\nSo what what has happening here is um\nWe you've been hit\nAnd got the wind knocked out have you with this announcement and um I think you're immediately assuming negative things why don't we look around and like for ... like we might get a job making instead of Seventy five maybe we'll get a job making eighty five\nWhen you lose a job it is not a federal law that you have to take a job making lash sometimes it's a blessing that you lose the job especially with these people they moved you because they were going broke and now they've gone broke I mean my gosh wow so my guess is they're not over paying people\nIncluding you\nSo I don't know that you you know I don't know that you're overpaid or you're over compensated such claims adjuster generally can make good money you may have to do a little traveling or something like that and um you know follows from hurricanes around or something or\nWhatever but you generally can make pretty good money and in that world and I've talked to him that it might twice what you're making now again that sometimes involves travel when I'm Talking about that but um\nYou know I think you guys work your way out of debt get as far out of that as you can and I'd be looking for jobs post taste and if you get a job that\nCan land in the above what you're making now you might punt severance but the ideal world would be that you would start the next week

I can call and thank you so much rain ministry thank you how can I help him along the line like by default three months ago I put my town home on the market and like my ... I Hope\nI'm found her own place her currently sitting on the entire complex static and has gone down in value from my unit is very shifting from LA class than I had bought it for five years ago right now I'm sure there are the units have the same dialing land mine and my other lower\nPrice added like a thousand dollars good\nUh yesterday Himalayan it came on the market I live in the last one hundred Ninety I asked him\nStarting to feel a bit of akin to Peter out because it sitting empty and when it's coming you know I was thinking of Catholic my price one Ninety four and adding tentative that out over pay my way of kind of got\nOut this week I Would pay five to ... out of pocket on the market is [noise] but my question is how\nWould you how much we shoot padded pocket to get rid of that thing how long would you go\nHobbies you'd have obviously you'd have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one limiting factor in higher I don't I don't know it when I'm going to judge the situation and how quickly are these things dropping\nOverall and uh you know that's going to give me my urgency um I don't I don't want to just get emotional about it I'm going to judge the future and say these things are going down in value there is already five of them on the market\nI've got to be the lowest one on the market um this is not looking good you know so I'm without dropping another fifty thousand no I wouldn't you know so you know so at some point you do you laugh right in and that's that's\nSo uh but the but five thousand out of pocket to be done with this two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty dollar mortgage yeah yeah I'll be done with that in a heartbeat I'd do that 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation is what I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and worse sinking kind and when the pay is not a place to live in the wintertime\nWell but I mean not only this winter but in general this complex is not going to heal and become worse three hundred thousand two years from now\nExactly is going the wrong way and so it's starting to get out of town you know and uh yeah I'm with you I I think you're right I I don't think you were panicking with the numbers you're giving me now if you start telling me somebody wants to offer you a low ball offering you have to come out of pocket with thirty grand probably gonna wait the winter out you know\nMy put a tenet ... spring and see what happens but there's some point that I'm not willing to be that far\nBelow the other properties that are on the market but uh but overall yeah let's get rid of this thing\nGood question I'm Sorry you're facing this open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five thanks for joining us Andrea is on Instagram I've never got over a million people on Instagram wow and I'm just now figuring out how to do it myself\nUm the guys at work here to do it and when I actually put a picture of their people freak out

um don't have a real identity or whatever so Instagram like nice people ... by and large not all but\nUh other block one woman that was being a\nTest pilot from a broom factory the other day but\nUm anyway Instagram Andrea by the end of the month will have four months of expenses saved\nDo we save up for a down payment on a home or we start investing or both at the same time we'd love to buy by the end of next year\nI think it's fine to wait for one year to start your baby step for we call that baby step three baby if you postpone your retirement savings for a short period of time to save up a big juicy fat down payment\nAnd if you can do that in a year and I think you can sounds like you've got this thing on the run you're out of debt you've got your emergency funding thing you've done this the right way you move into the house to house is going to be a blessing not a curse\nDream not a nightmare so yeah save up till the end of the year and then a buy a house next spring sometime in ... in starch or a or restart either one of your\nRetirement savings at that point\nAnd thanks for following us on Instagram Andrea way free shaded that puts this hour that Iran's you show in the book

very low the market and the and we didn't have any debt so we could afford that was the only you know debt that we had we bought a house and then we paid it off I don't know\nIt was incredible journey it took full two years to pay it off and that was our gazelle intense so it was um it was hard it was hard um I Would just want to say what you do makes it different all through your marriage like we've grown so much\nAs a couple of going through this process this is not just to get out of debt show it's not just money it's your whole life in your marriage you know so I just wanted to mention that I mean it's been a fantastic journey credible I'm so proud of you know who are your biggest cheerleaders yeah so my dad was a huge cheer leader\nAverage say my older brother down\nYeah a couple of family members on the good side yeah not on the dark so the ... [laughter] love us right way to go you're ... yeah that's so cool so what started you're doing this what made you say we can actually pay off our house 'cause most people never bother\nYeah well because the journey happened so long ago the beginning of the journey he had come home from work one day and he just said hey I heard this guy on the radio talking about money I was always reading books about finances and he said take a look at this guy and see what you think\nSo the next weekend your CDs came the ... the very first set of CDs came from that you had created I'll listen to those CDs and literally that day my life what from off something\nThat we had everything we could ever dreamed up our big house in our jet skis and boat it was awesome until it was an awesome\nBecause we didn't own anything ... nothing and it was just so\nRude awakening and it was so scary to sit there thinking we don't own anything and so that started the journey so lots of life happened in between the removed about five times before we finally settled in cave creek Arizona\nErica hurt a on a construction job he was builder um and when that happened that changed our life because he chose to go to college you said you know we need to go to college and that's what took the income down because I had to work and we cash flow to it yeah and then once that was all done\nI printed the amortization scheduled for the house and I brought it to him and I said I think we can pay the house off in two years and I said you're crazy yeah [laughter] but I really thought we could but this last two years has sucked it was hard to to\nYou so you'd have the three Ninety four really two years or how much of the three Ninety four was the house [noise]\nElse was two hundred and forty thousand okay we did that who you're already in two years yeah whoa that was the gazelle intense where we ate the gazelle 'cause we were so tired and rice and beans yeah\nYeah he cleaned up all the jet skis and the other stuff in the previous seven years yeah so then when you look down and go okay game on now we're going to do the house and you leaned into it with wild good that's\nI'm we our number one we owe a hundred and seven or eight or what about when I went to an end rental property number two\nUm we owe one sixty five and it's worth about Ninety five and\nYou're making a little profit you know it may get a lot\nNow it's about a thousand in mind I mean it's definitely not and all that that's you know at our do know that your gross ...\nThat's before you cannot lake and see and major repairs that come up that that's the gross cash flow the different ... and the payment so twelve thousand dollars a year minus vacancy mine is a an occasional heating and air system or a roof occasionally you're you're making a little bit of money\nBut yet you know yeah fire five ... five grand for around something like that I'm a ... a year from like that over our air raid remains from years will be better than others and that time I owned a bunch of rental property shark and trying to do these things are my\nDutch um the uh uh ... and what your household income\n[noise] um so we bring about a hundred and ten grows\nTo try and what do you own your home our primary\nUh we just heard to stay on ten months ago we owe to eighty worth about three hundred\nAnd ... ... ... and so he's saying um you've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so so you had a hundred and eighty if you saw both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at your two eighty\nAnd that's right he's thing to do you're saying\nGetting a little money um I like rental property these are good runners I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion I'm All right\n[noise] yeah 'cause I thought it on I think we have about ten thousand dollars and ... and that and you're saying the layout of hated that um we combined probably crop out they can they took a we had a lot but we took a bite out of your act out where it might help\nYou know this is like baby steps are very clearly defined that you do one before you do the other you can't sort of do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them baby steps I won't let you are going to do your plan okay if you're going to be my plan you'd write a check today and be debt free\n[noise] yeah the only reason I I had to pick on our 'cause you're doing airplane and you know at the end of the year and only very hot and I fail\nYou now have Iran fairly they get there in the event that on my Kindle it don't come through for the next three nine I'm afraid liquidated Atlanta I don't think an actor and I have five so I figure I'm pregnant at every loud and I would try to track\nMhm okay let's you're playing poker or any of the\nUh uh you know ... ...\nYou're not making a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them\nSo they can slip on your pretty quick if a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two every I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate and I want to try and keep 'em if you want to keep them in the big one that got more margin in and more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThat's where the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five one and so a migraine one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand or equity you know hardly making anything on that and that you're in a gash bread on that at all in which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the year and I lose money on that house if you're a three month vacancy ... market softened up so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is as it is an asset in your situation even though technically forty\nSo I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise between the two of them and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one the new guys just got a you know we'll start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following them through in getting the emergency fund on and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility to separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to\nAnd build your some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth when you're making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway\nAnd that and that's that's the cycle you're trying to break some good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco Hi Mike\nHow are you Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my that's what I got my starter said so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred my emergency fund from Amman baby step on the first time I'm doing a budget and and it's a mess it just seems like a just dial it in\n... and you're on every dollar um every dollar okay ebb and they're all going in\nA while I just feel like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cough and then I just either it seems like it it goes over and then there's things that I think we're gonna have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just dorm it\nYou've been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah\nWell that you're just takes a little while to get things are just at the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're\nWrong put more in there but you're always people are always spend moral foods and they think they are I mean people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going to hold it was just no way you know what I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nReally quick I wanted to ask what should I invested in the financial peace university um I should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their first\nAnd that's up to you I mean you you can decide what you wanted out on one of mine just give it to you and then we'll have to worry about it\nOh okay All right\nNow where you can get signed up and get the every dollar plus going and that's one of your membership for that thing and then you get in the class you know you go to the non non lessons and you've got the online\nExperience and that's going to answer a bunch of these questions as well but basically if you just visualize a yellow pay us forget every dollar forget a budgeting and all that and just go okay here's what I make\nAt the top of the page mhm and then every dollar of my at every one of those dollars needs an assignment going down the page or most been Exxon food and why on utilities and Z own rent and so on down the page until every single dollar has an assignment you don't have any leftover money in your budget\nIt is a great out by made it it definitely the easiest one I've I've done other ones before in the past than this one is definitely the easiest as far as\nThe Harlem the problem is is you're facing your reality it's not the app and it's not the system even it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it\nYou know and it just takes a month and then the next months you'll get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate\nIt'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go\nOh I'm not forgetting all soccer pictures and in our houses lumbar all day on you know and we know what the food really cost and we know what the utilities really are and\nGet a few things that are fixed that are predictable and you'll rent or your mortgage payment that fix thing we know what that is but some of these other things you're just you're taking your best guess and and it just takes a little while to get the trial and error get the course\nOf course corrections done and get adjusted so you'll get it on I'll have to like pick up will get you signed up\nFor central\nBanks to Dr Charles or ... or ... or associate producer ...
