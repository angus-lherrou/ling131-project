{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Is the disrespect\nThe name calling um the blame the constant finger pointing and blaming um\nYou know you it is important yes did you find a definition\nSo the definition is the art of affective or persuasive speaking or writing essentially is why would you designed to be persuasive or impressive effect on its audience but often regarded as lacking in sincerity or meaningful content\nThat's interesting I like that um it's not rhetoric itself but that's the problem it's a certain kind of rhetoric it is when it's factual is a and it is when it is as I said you know one of his name calling when it is um chanting lock her up\nUm when it is in NATO just to to be fair to Joe calling the Democrats to you know one of his suggesting that you go out and getting people's faces you know those kinds of things are not positive um they don't help and I agree with Governor Cuomo that we need to dial it down and a lot of people are saying that um that without\nDial it down you can still say what you want to say you can still think we want to thank you don't have to be on the attack\nUm even verbally because words do matter they do um and\nThe president tosses words around\nWithout any concern for the impact that they have the the fact that they have on people um\nAnd and by the way part of the reason he's able to get away with that is because the Republican Party not just his base but all of the Republican Party um that continues to defend him I'm sure there are Republicans who are not but those that are\nAre accepting that they're allowing that and they are saying oh don't listen they're sort of apologizing in a way oh don't listen to that just look at what he does don't listen to the words just look at what he does\nDon't worry about all that silly nonsense just just look at the results we've had tax reform\nYeah we have a new NAFTA the economy's at an all time high rate unemployment's at an all time low just look at the results but the thing is that's not all there is there is more than that and\nIt does matter the words do matter and the word of the week um before bomb became the word of the week was nationalist the president two nights ago decided that he could embrace that word he had avoided it\nUm even though he sort of like the idea of it but now\nUm he decided it was time to embrace that word fully and that happened at the rally he did I think it was the Houston rally and uh he he said you know I Know I should we shouldn't use that were told not to use that word we shouldn't use that word but I'm I'm an easier anyway I'm a nationalist and\nPeople were upset because for many\nIf not all a nationalist has it ... it does not mean the same thing as as patriot a nationalist is not the same as a patriot\nAnd he I think I think he meant patriot I think he meant America First I'm\nNot American no matter what I'm not sure that he really knew what he meant by\nUm but he was asked because the inter webs went crazy over his use of that word and I'm going to say rightfully so because it is a word\nThat is now affiliated with 'em and and really always has been affiliated with some pretty bad stuff and so he was asked about this uh by\nA reporter uh yesterday pickle isn't\nBy love our country and our country has taken says second fiddle if you look as a trade deals and nobody knows are better than me [noise] I'm knocking out some of the worst deals I've ever seen when giving all of our wealth or money to other countries and then they don't treat us properly when I say a nationalist\nI don't like it when Germany Spain one percent of GDP for NATO and we're paying for point three percent but uh like this\nSo he's saying\nThat his definition of nationalism means I Love is a I Love this country that was the first part of his response and be I don't like it when someone else doesn't have to pay as much as we do so I don't like it when we're financially treated unfairly by someone else in the world\nThat is my definition of nationalism in by the way his his comments were far longer than that we narrowed it down to just the shortest version\nAnd I I it just sort of feel like he doesn't really understand what the word means even from a simple you know Google the definition of the word perspective\nUm so you've asked again I'm by the same reporter who I think just sort of kept to sort of you know doggedly trying to get them to to answer\nI'm about sort of the way Americans many Americans took it um any and so we asked them you know if he was sending a coded message or a dog whistle of sorts that he is a white nationalist when he uses that term here's what he said\nI've never even heard that I cannot imagine that you may have actually I'm a nurse list or never heard of the theory about big on national severed I'm all for it I'm somebody that loves our country when I say a nationalist\nI don't like it was [noise]\nGermany's being one percent\nOf GDP\nFor NATO and we're paying for point three percent and\nAre right back to the money he goes because that's in his mind somehow those are connected if I defend us financially I'm\nThen I'm a national is I'm showing my love for the country and that love that I show by trying to make us wealthy is what nationalism is which is\nAccurate so I Want to get to the definition quickly are there are several different definitions of the word if you look it up and there's a lot of historical context for the use of the word nationalism in lots of other countries beyond America there's Chinese nationalism there's nationalism and various European uh parts of history and\nEtcetera etcetera there's different parts of American history where nationalism\nWas the case many people blame World War one on nationalist choices by the countries involved\nRight so there's a lot of different background and history that word\nBut one of the clear a dictionary definitions that I found was this a devotion nationalism is devotion weight especially excessive or on discriminating devotion to the interests or culture of a particular nation state\nUh it is also a belief that nations will benefit from acting independently rather than collectively emphasizing national rather than international goals\n[noise] um some of that is okay some of it not so much on discriminating devotion that is what we have a lot of in this country right now we've got a lot of on discriminating devotion in particular to the president but that's a whole other subject and we'll get to that on another day\nUm I also found this and I like it so I thought I'd share at the difference between patriotism and nationalism is that the Patriot is proud of his country for what it does the nationalist is proud of his country no matter what it does\nAnd the difference prompt for what it does proud no matter what it does the first one patriotism gives you a sense of responsibility that you do the right thing that is where America has always stood in the past\nNationalist gives you a feeling of blind arrogance that we can do no wrong and it is that kind of blind arrogance that has in the past and could again lead to war\nSo just\nPut that in your pipe and smoke it as they say a Steven ...\nI think kind of nailed it on and why the president should not be using the word nationalism\nYou know why you're not supposed to use that word because it's the second half of white nationalist [noise]\nCoughing off\nThe first one doesn't change what it means in our minds look I'm Klux Klan I have\nNo idea what [noise] [laughter]\n\nKlux Klan who [noise]\n... right I mean you don't have to say anything beyond Cox clan temporary want to know and everyone knows what white nationalism is the president saying that he's never heard of that was\nKind of bizarre but that's the world we're living in a obviously we're going to continue to follow the story of a\nAnd

Washington DC Hi Lisa how are you\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nA quick question um I I have a plan I'm from I'm I'm a\nRetirement I'm from a job that I had ten years ago and I let the money in their arm is about twenty seven thousand dollars and it's I'm growing at an interest rate on five percent annual and\nI wasn't going to leave it there until I retired but I can retire\nAt sixty two which is I can I'm Seventeen years [laughter]\nBut I did the math and it's only gonna be sixty three thousand dollars out of the time I turn to the tune\nShould I take that money out and um I I guess part of the house the two Seventy five when they tell you loan so the model a note on that it's like Eighteen hundred should I take that money out and refinance so I can get a lower mortgage and then same them difference from the mortgage went down um no\nNo I Would roll it to an IRA and pick out some good growth stock mutual funds that have long track records of ten years or more you should be able to make twice what you're making all this money okay like north of ten percent most of my mutual funds have averaged over twelve percent\nAnd you can pick mutual funds that have done that a by getting with a good investment advisor that the teachers you\nYou have to get someone with the heart of a teacher you don't just do something because Dave said do it or because somebody in the suit said do it\nWhich you sit down with them you to learn how that works and you put it in good mutual funds and do what I already roll over from the money the way to find somebody to help you do that I'm not in that business but we have a group of people we recommend you can click on smart investor\nAt Dave Ramsey dot com and you put in your information that drops down a list of the smart vest her prose\nThe people that we recommend in your area and then you can select from among them and I'm a sit down with one of them and they'll talk to you and teach you and take your time learn about this get comfortable with the idea\nBut I think you can make a lot more on this money than you're making all that now and if you just pull it out you're going to get hammered on taxes and penalties for that matter [noise]\nEm Ali is with us in Detroit Hi Emily welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDay thanks so much for taking my call sure how can I help\nSo I have a question not as much for myself but for my parents my husband and I were introduced to a few and absolutely love it and we are just because they'll intense and\nWe have a longer plan with a whole bunch of student loans that were just trying to Waylon and it's probably going to take a few years and\nI did see my parents thinking in that horrible kind of this fair\nI'm being completely broken overwhelmed and just war thing their habits and so I just calling for advice on how how I can influence them because they really getting like advice from their kid and even though I in my thirties now it doesn't matter it's like I'm Still a little kid\nAnd it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder but they don't really want your opinion about right about money or sex okay and so the only time that reverses when they get really really really old\nAnd as I pointed out oh yeah yeah but um that you generally doesn't happen and so it you know it's like a friend that's being obstinate\nBecause you're both grown people you're grown your parents are grown\nAnd out of there being obstinate about something and you just have to watch somebody that you would love to do self destructive stupid things like I've got a friend is an alcoholic and he's going to kill himself if he doesn't go drink and\nI mean ... ... and I've talked to him people to talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nYeah and it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff that kills themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's any one that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak in their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility to probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\n... mom we were ... mom we were freaked out mom we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe Manchester is getting tight and you know what we did was we got on this budget and we cut up our credit cards and we're not there yet and put man I feel so much better and\nHere's what happened and if you do have to go heavy on somebody a little bit uh just blame it on me during the day ... you just say Dave said OK and just go you know you can argue with David if you want argue a day but you know he got so many people out of that I don't think you did sure\nSo um you know whatever it may not be that abrasive but you don't want to talk of right what's the point is you can go got bad guy they call it off on me a and lean on that and so\nLike when ritual cruise first start speaking um I mean she was twenty four years old and I'm like her what she thought sure [laughter] now she's twenty eight and had three ... three ... national bestsellers and now a few people cares what your race but she just blamed it on me\nIf we're in a Christian setting we blame it on the Bible okay you know this is what the Bible says right [laughter] the Bible says the borrower slave with the lender and you want to argue with that how I get a cat yeah and the Bible you know Jesus said don't build a power without first counting the costs less to get halfway up and ... obviously you begin to mock you and say this man began to build and was unable to finish\nSo you should be on a written plan is what Jesus was saying so\nReally I mean I get up on him they I mean you know or that kind of stuff now again I'm being kind of sarcastic and bombastic he would be\nI Would even be more gentle than that in a setting in a smaller setting okay the bigger the setting the more wild I Am the uh but you know when you're one on one you're just gentle and you just go I guess I'm only thirty one I don't have all the answers\nBut here's what we did know and you know if you want to have those same results I suspect it'd be the same thing we did you'd have the same results we didn't have those results because of our age we had those results because we applied proven principles right you know I mean let's let's say that you are leading up let's say you were a personal trainer\nAnd the guy you were training uh was four hundred pounds\nAnd he was a forty five years old but he doesn't like you're telling him anything 'cause you're thirty one and you have abs I mean come on\n[laughter] you know yeah it was a personal trainer you got ... got abs yeah so I mean he may have he's got to ... or something you know you just you just kind of like this is what you're doing my point is you approve but but you just approach it with the same spirit you approach this question wealth okay and that's just a a level of humility\nUh but you can be\nForceful on the principles\nAnd on the scripture as the backup for the principles and even on the day Ramsey or Dave Ramsey organization or brand or whatever as proof of the principles and your personal life is proof of the principles\nAnd if they don't get it through all of that because you're thirty one they're just using that as an excuse but again you don't want to be abrasive but you're not going to be you wouldn't even asked this question if you were going to be a brace right and it's just not your style it's who you guys are okay but do really you've got a great story\nThank you and you tell your story you ask this what we did I mean you do what you want to but this is what we did right and and look what happened you know I lost three hundred pounds of if you do to set up and donate the food this is what happens you know\nAnd it's applied the principals and as I say thank you so much for teaching a class no thank you so cool that you're doing that yeah I'm excited and you know what's what you'll find is interesting is\nThat people don't look down on age when there are results mhm okay it's when you have no proof\nIn your life or you know that that you know that they look down and they go look I got socks older than you you know and they you know that they will but but that's what you got us or Europe they wish they had been when they were thirty right you know and and so they can still be that when they're sixty if they'll go do it the right question man thanks for joining us thanks for coming by and thanks for teaching a class\nHaley is with us in Seattle, Washington Hi Hailey how are you\nToday I'm I I'm a question concerning aid come come clan\n[noise] so um I have I'm twenty five thousand previous player in a retirement plan and I know you talk about pulling it out and playing it or not pulling it out but transferring from Utah fine good high rent correct guy in our church\nWho worked for private financial and he does say that he college jail\nAnd and I and I let me read I I Need the ... at a meet up on you but I think that we put money into variable annuity rather than mutual fund mhm and I wasn't sure why earth outlets do care about what you're following\nA ... I did not following no what is not following what I teach\nI'm Glad I didn't think how to answer that part of the question variable Newt mutual fund or variable annuities are mutual funds inside of an annuity if you pretend like the mutual fund as an investment and the annuity is a coat that goes around the investment to keep it warm from taxes\nOkay okay and you pay extra for the annuity portion of this discussion now\nWould you could buy those exact same mutual funds with less fees without the new to cope wrapping around them okay so what is the uh nudey coke do for you the coat wrapping around it to keep it warm it does the same thing\nThe fact that it's an an IRA already ... so you're buying to coach for the same kid\nOkay okay you see what I'm saying you know it's already going to be kept out of the cold of taxes by the fact that you're rolling it into an IRA okay and then you move it into it and nobody inside of an IRA it's redundant\nBecause you've already got the protection now the\nOnly thing the annuity we'll give you is they'll give you some guarantees a along the lines of you know if it goes down in value you know they protect you on principle and it will give you at least a four percent or five percent of income but if you're invested in good mutual funds and you're young you don't need those guarantees\nSo I'm okay and truthfully not not trashing thrive in I mean driving her friends of ours are good people um but I Would not use that product there and the thing you need to remember about variable annuities versus a direct mutual funds sale\nIs there's two things going on usually usually if someone's trying to sell you that's because they don't have a securities license they only have a life insurance license\nOh okay and that it's a way they can making its way in insurance person can get you into mutual funds is through the variable annuity they cannot sell mutual funds directly unless they have a securities license\nThe second thing that you run into that region you run into this and it's less often for this and I don't think that would be the case with thriving is that they're actually doing this because the commissions on a variable annuity are about four times what they are are on a regular mutual fund\nOkay so some people sell very well known is just so 'cause they make more on them\nAnd I would not accused the ticket our guy of that and the situation I mean knowing his from knowing the setting that you did this my guess is he's probably not security ... that's my guess okay and and really isn't anything you still giving you a bad recommendation\nHe did say that I can do that and you're trying to find exactly as you recommend them her new thing hand he didn't really pushing the variable annuity and asked me to go home like all the members have my husband review and think about it but I wanted to call you immediate rage and I knew enough they already\nYou know so now we've got another problem OK okay if this piece of advice was bad and you knew it what about the next ... by that you don't know is bad\nI hereby that can go and I I\nLike that right away I just felt that because he goes through our church and that you know network yeah\nAnd that's okay I mean it's that that you don't have to do business with people at church is not necessary so and so I I I don't think I'm going to do business with this guy\nA because I mean I I I don't like his advice and I might not like it next time and I might not understand next time so\nI just get a smart restaurant row and\nMove the money that way series of gross goes on in Iraq and\nThat is thanks for the call says is that Iran's you\nLike Tom's in production officer for the day random show\nAnd so you could do either or both of those depending on what you want to fool with\nBut a hundred Seventy five thousand uh by you're pretty good rental house in the St Louis market and if you don't mind the idea of that and working with a renter and making\nSure that you know they don't tear up stuff and\nUh that you're you know you do a good job of a screening them vetting them before you come in and you know you're kind to them but you're from with them they're going to pay your you have to move them out you do all that kinda stuff\nReal estate and making good money uh especially paid for real estate it's very very nice I got a bunch of it [laughter] but if you don't know if it was all that and I just get I Would pick some good mutual funds and go that way but at the point is there's no shame and your game by keeping it simple\nSomehow people have the idea that primitive or simple is bad and the contrary to the contrary is it the truth is the contrary to that the truth is is that the typical person who builds on net worth of\nUp to about ten million dollars a does keep it very very clean and very very simple Sarah is with us in all uh Seattle, Washington Hi Sarah how are you\n[noise] I'm doing well thank you Kelly is taking my call\nWe'll we'll let Kelly answer your question if you want [laughter] what's something Sarah [laughter]\nUm I'm trying to get a little bit of advice and how to advise my parents to get long term care insurance [noise] mhm\n[noise] um my dad is sixty seven and doesn't qualify him out this year for my mom just turned sixty a couple of months ago and the last couple of months ago and we're talking and my dad said\nWell I'm now for the insurance doesn't fit nearby jak and to my mom says that short term thinking mhm and I think they need at the budget what's her income\n[noise] um [noise] well that's a good question they are retired missionary so they made it on and my dad now are tired and my mom works at the reception is I don't know exactly what he\nMight not fit in their budget okay\nI mean there may have to buy very very limited policy if they don't have hardly any income\nWhy what's wrong with your dad that he doesn't qualify\n[noise] um yeah I mean ... had a kidney transplant\nAnd so he's

she was telling us about budgeting and hang out credit card and I kinda just pass it off at the time because we already followed a budget and then I catch it on the radio show a few weeks after that and\nUm I really like your no excuse advocate for paying off that came home and suggested they tell me that at least that go to a ton of money make on her one day and that\nAnd so we did that and we decided to give it a try and Sally where it was that have been held\nCity okay very cool very cool and I got you guys going you\nKnow we started to do that nearly finished babysat Caitlin three ... and we had just finished baby steps three in October two thousand and twelve and then just a few short weeks after that\nOur entire world kind of fell apart and when you tell me he was diagnosed with for brain tumors whoa\nSo at that time we went into survival mode for years though while he was in and out of the hospital having surgery\nUm during that time we also passionate about Fifteen to twenty thousand dollars mhm and medical debt and medical bills mhm and we also made the difficult decision to sell the family business or pose that at the time and so we liquidated that\nAnd we got about fifty thousand dollars and that sale\nAfter he was back in good health and working full time we sat down and looked at our budget\nAnd how much we had to pay off on the house and we just knew we had to finish it with his health history so we just made the commitment and\nKept moving forward while she'll go ahead and just be brain tumors in the process yeah\nGood for you and thank you well on

are very proud of even congratulations on beating the rain to every man that's an incredible story thank you very cool and I hear you say the pay for a house yeah what's that thing worse\nI it's probably three fifty to three eighty\nBearing not union and insurers so [laughter] it's years by the way nobody's going to get that one no it sure is I Love it that that's a different feeling folks

bad as to what we're going for next and outrageously generous along the way so congratulations you guys thinking like you don't have the girls been practicing the debt prescribing they have the younger to anyway I okay teenagers or took ... yeah yeah yeah All right\nRon okay and so your questions what\nUh what\nCan I Do they try to help him get on the right track as well as making sure I'm preparing myself for my financial future so I don't end up and and what he does yeah he's in\nWhether you're already preparing yourself for your financial futures Seventeen years old you actually know that Iran's you show exist go figure\nSo I mean that that alone is is um put your way ahead of the game or most people say you know what to do and and and you're obviously observe some things you don't want to replicate from your dad even though there's probably some things that he does that are good\nThings not necessarily win money but but and he's probably got some good traits that you didn't really Kate and carry forward [noise]\nUm so uh um\nWell the first thing is is that you learn to stay on a budget you learn to stay out of that you learn to save money for emergencies and invest for the long term\nYou don't spend more than you make 'em you don't get credit cards and carry him around so that's how you prepare for your future and obviously you're gonna have to handle your own a school\nA ... and you know and so you have a lot of work ahead of you but that's okay you'll be fine as far as you've got now as far as him um there's not many men on the planet\nThat will take financial advice from their Seventeen year old middle son [laughter] absolutely you have the powder bud syndrome once someone has powder but they really don't want your opinion about money or sex [laughter] and so he's\nNot looking for your advice even though he knows he's probably wrong uh so you're probably not the man to speak up and caused this to happen that's my guess\nNone of them are what are we going to do well there's a couple of things you could do um one is is there a person in his life uh particularly another man that he respects is their\nBusiness ability their money ability or even they're just they're spiritual walk\nA well definitely our pastor in the past there have tried helping them in the past but it seems like no matter who's talking to 'em or what or how they're trying to help him he just doesn't seem to either comprehend any of it or want to replicate any of that and the very stubborn and being his own man\nMhm okay well I think if I were you ever talk to your pastor again\nYou know I I find people every day I've been doing this for a lot of years and I found people every day who\nTwo years ago weren't wouldn't listen but now they listen or five years ago they wouldn't listen but now that listen so all of us you know the stubbornness comes and goes with all of us and be in our own man comes and goes but\nIf the past or you know just a leans in and and I think I'm most pastors or if they're going to make an error it would be on the side of being too soft not too hard\nAnd so I might if I were you ask her past her to turn up the heat is just a little bit more\nAnd just spending time with your dad and push on your data on this subject\nAnd not mentioned that you are involved because you're not involved you can't fix it and you keep your mouth shut down you're not gonna do anything but make things worse very true yeah 'cause he's gonna he's gonna do whatever he wants to do\nAnd then you know at the end of having done everything you can do I mean you know if you wanted to give him a total money make over book or something you can do that but you're on the ... I was\nThinking about doing that probably Christmas or I don't think I Would\nJust say this summer and I read that I liked I thought you might enjoy it because you like business\nOr something like that not like a hey you're really fat here's a book on how to not be fat\n[laughter] that doesn't work right that's insulting yeah fall on me\nAnd so you know instead you would just say I'm just kind of blow it off and make it not might not make it a big deal that it would change my life I Would feel so good if you would read there's no don't do any of that crap\nJust kind of keep it nonchalant just go hey I read this I thought you might like it 'cause you like business stuff or something like ...\nAnd and just see if he picks it up he may throw it away he may put it on the coffee table as a coaster for the next two years and then open it we don't know how this was going to work but at least on the outside expert your pastor is an outside influence\nThat does have or could potentially have the credibility for him to listen to\nSome people aren't listening to anybody and so you have to be willing to go I Love my dad in spite of his um\nIncompetence and this one area of his life and I'm just gonna love him where he is it's all I can do and are you made that you may do that your whole life ... you know he may go to his grave doing this\nAnd ... and so your love is not conditional upon you know whether he handles money well or not your respect for him it's not even conditional on that\nBut you're not gonna take financial advice from somebody that's misbehaving with money so he's not gonna speak into your life on money issues\nBut that's all that's all you know I don't speak into people's lives on growing hair because I Can't seem to do it on top of my head so I don't tell people how to grow here so if you can't do something you shouldn't tell people how to do it right\nOr you shouldn't have even have an opinion that's loud about it but people try all the time so just kind of keep that in the back of your mind their joy hey thanks for calling in men's open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Jay is in Jackson, Tennessee Hi Jay how are you\nI Am doing slightly better than other and working on getting better good how can I help [laughter] oh I just wanted to say I'm a lifelong ... or ... thank you my mother and my grandmother always playing you in the car when I was a kid wow at I now have you as an adult\nNot always practice as good as I should have but I'm working on that got you how can I help today\n[noise] ah well I'm calling to ask about that but I'm working on hang\n'em up like Maggie I started it totally okay maybe weren't that many hours a week and actually deliver pizza ugly\nOkay I have called the office to make an offer on it that they have given me a counter offer mhm it is Seventy five percent of the balance which I Know is a little high that never had anybody hurt anybody asked you about\nA debt over a judgment on an addiction which is what this is over mhm no I understand that might be a little different yeah it is but they have we're used to give me a written agreement on them I mean\nOkay um so even if he were to brown them a check they will not Andrew in agreement\nA he said if I come in to their office I Will get a receipt but they will not give me I have an agreement beforehand\nAnd that's fun that's fun but it's a and get a receipt I get a a a statement that says this judgment ... this or this or fiction debt is one hundred percent clear it upon this payment\nNot I received as you pay the money a receipt to says you pay money doesn't mean that you paid Seventy five percent you're still owe twenty five percent\nMore you know that's all she had a lot of people look at you like a babysitter you know but the wind you know yeah but but\nThere's no shame and work all workers honorable so I think Rachel really hit the nail on the head if you didn't have the a fear of peers and you weren't worried about the money will see the money was there and you could take care of kids and make the money you need to make you'd be pretty darn happy when you\n... you know you're over thinking it I think you are clear and I don't think you need to justify you in your mind\nA bit that being a nanny is okay I think you need to say it's awesome I mean uh you know again maybe one day she opens up her own daycare I Would dream with in this passion writes dream what could\nBe one of an even say because we had help with our two girls so that I can work and travel and all that and so to have someone in your life that is walking with you and your kids that you trust your and valuable to family like that role is not just a babysitter like that and if the if the family you're working for traits are like that like\nThen that's that's a cause I can tell you they're going to help us we were like we are all the time like we could not do this life without you like she helps us so much and so figuring out a family that fits you in that in that vein and trying to find the money for it so like\nMaybe you say hey here's my ears max like if you want me as a nanny and I'm the best nanny are going to find I've been doing it for twelve years I Know exactly what to do this is what I cost you know what I mean it kind of have that gumption to your pin it\nIn Columbia South Carolina I can tell you actually that if you stay with it and look long enough and hard enough with twelve years meaning experience there some wealthy families that would need you to do maybe a little bit more than just nanny that's right where maybe you're just doing some light cleaning laundry hoping\n... life assistant white meant\nThen are you on me and you can make more than forty yeah ... more than forty yeah I think you've got to own that this is what you will have to do and find the best place to do it that's a game changer\nAnd having the confidence right\nYou just you just detect a little shame I'm thirty one and get him Rachel\nAnd I'm a nanny mhm wait a second I mean this is he does the shift yeah and you know think about oh pears you and I have a mutual friend will show her name so yeah remain nameless yes who is very wealthy and has a new pair pay that lady big dollars ship\nSo again you know that there are some limits to what you can do they're really really ...\nAnd even like for families that are looking for that kinda thing not to drag goes on but but it is such a vitamin I care dot com for instance it's exploded because people are in need of that so even if you started a service where you had been working for you that you helped train that's right I mean let's say that the the options are ... it's great creative\nAll right let's go to a social media question from Facebook Angie types and I'm not sure what to do on plugging away and my first snowball which is third which has thirty eight hundred dollars left on a loan and then some smaller medical bills are coming in and do I put those smaller bills in front of the thirty hundred dollar loan on the debt snowball list\nYes as as more loans are coming in and just go ahead and reevaluate dozens of new comes in say okay where's this with the thirty eight hundred and put it in its place say you can keep knocking it out\nFor and why is that why because I think the question is very common they okay I'm working on the snowball nuggets associates a four hundred dollar medical bill yeah well I Do that\nTo go out and get it out of the way it's still momentum yeah you're still building the idea of okay I can do this and if that thing is tagged along at the end you know what I mean like there's no purpose for it you know if you have the money you're going to have the money 'cause that point you're got snowball especially if you're almost done with it you're going to have some cash to be able to throw at it and pay it off and then probably still put money on to pay off the other day that\nOkay this is a little bit shocking Baltimore put this out there next segment we're going to talk about this are you ready for this Rachel the current total of us consumer debt as of June this year was three

your values and I understand you're having to sell something that you don't believe in\nBut in in the temporary or you know don't take on this massive guilt what you want to put your energy on right now is how quickly can replace that eighty thousand dollars so that I can step over into the uh financial coaching space or ah like one of our smart investor pros\nYour Dave Ramsey fan you're part of the tried you know about are smart Mr prose and I think one of the first piece of advice I Would give\nIt to go sit down with one of those folks locally in uh Miami area of all those folks are listed on the website I'd find two or three of them tell them you're Dave Ramsey fan tell me your situation just the way you laid it out to us\nAnd and say can I take it a lunch or take it a coffee and learn\nThe best path to get where you're at to do something similar they're gonna give you some very very practical or knowledge and some next steps then you need to do your own homework how much training how much qualification certification or whatever that is that you need to be able to do that that's something you can do\nAnd then once you know that you say OK how much is that going to cost me from a financial standpoint and then from a time standpoint these are basic\nResearch questions\nAnd so once you get the answer to that you've got the formulation of a plant and so you take that wisdom and knowledge from somebody who's actually doing what you want to do\nAnd then go do your own homework on what is going to take and you've got yourself a timeline an action plan and and then to to the extent that you can go work for one of those people\nAre and go work in space like that and get in proximity and learned the process and get good at it uh and when maybe you're doing your own thing one day is that something you'd ultimately like to do is have your own business\nThat I think twenty eight I Would do it for somebody else for a while and work your way up right now you can be a financial planner or a financial cups\nA graduate coach ... okay 'cause I ain't a planet you'll have got to get your CSP and like there's a lot of it\nThat stuff down the ... so that started going to go down totally agree but the financial coach it's more almost like a counseling you know type of situation\nA cause you'll have to get referrals and all of that so I Would definitely say we have a lot of those that have gone through our financial training or financial um master coach training here Arabs decisions I Would say that's a great first step to uh to come here go through that training
