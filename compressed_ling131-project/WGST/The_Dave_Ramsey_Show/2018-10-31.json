{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Do you do you tell me something where they are going to do extra\nSo apparently in in lieu of the toys R Us toy catalog but usually goes out every year if you have kids they somehow no and they send it to your house 'cause right\nNow that data\nApparently Amazon is going to do that they're going to actually send out a toy catalog fears\nFascinating you know Amazon actually has been just very interesting with where they're going old school you know like they do some TV commercials hear an Arab for different things you know they do some brick and mortar here and there and then buying whole foods\nAnd now it's sending out a paper catalog yeah it's crazy to think about that you know we thought we were that all digital men all digital who doesn't like it or not we are still human beings living in an actual world is it like to see touch smell feel things you know with our actual physical selves [laughter]\nSo uh Amazon tapping into that I guess but also Wal Mart wants to be the place you go for toys target wants to be the place you go for a choice and wait for a best buy\nAlso wants to be the place you go for ... says hey we've always sold toys at some level because we've had sort of electronic toys well now we're just\nUp that uh I Believe uh Toys R us I'm Sorry I Believe Best Buy is going to be carrying\nNinety percent more toys and they have carried in the past um it's actually really smart\nRight because you're going to be going in there anyway for right TV or some kind of get to do\nA hundred percent and honestly it's kind of dumb if they didn't think of it last year or the year before or the year before his Best Buy has been on their own struggle bus to we don't know what to do town um because you know so much of that kind of purchasing a isn't is Don line now people were going in to Best Buy and still are I'm sure to some extent and using it as a showroom\nAh for Amazon right so you go in there you look around the best buy and you say this TV seemed like the one I Want now let me see where I can get it the best price or\nAnd so you would think that they would have been it would've been brilliant all along\nI mean ... if you've ever walk into a best buy there's always like the dark corner which seems to be for whatever reason where they still some of them have appliances and stuff which is weird but the third quarter the sword no one goes there but the point where any utilize all but\nThere is a right well then what plants are those are big money if you just saw one now\nThat's a tougher call I don't know I Want to see those somewhere too though got to see those somewhere so a okay in any case all weather where they put it I'm not going to worry about but I feel like Best Buy in their heyday was a when\nYou know DVD sales were and I guess CD but really DVD sales were all the rage that is when you were going to Best Buy on a regular basis because you are going up and down those DVD aisles getting your movies for the week seeing what was on sale by and the TV series that you wanted to ...\nHad so many DVDs at one point having somebody um but that was it became a regular I was in Best Buy all the time and nobody else can really compare to their selection target had some DVDs but you\nThe most were at Best Buy and so if they bring in toys\nThat is a reason to bring families back into the store\nA and if they were really smart they would actually create and I don't think they're going to do this but that's because they didn't call me that would create like a kid's zone\nThat was fun for the kids were the kids could play with some like you know demo toys a kind of like Barnes and noble does where they have the kids' section for reading where the kids can just sit and read books all day create that a lot you put your kids over there while you go look at the TVs\nAnd then kill a bunch of birds with one stone\nIs genius I they don't you go in and\nPlay with the phones and with the computers and the TVs all that\nTo have some demo you know toys literally the Barbies and whatever the GI Joe whatever it is and have him out there so that the kids can actually play and also mom and dad can have a chance to go shop for the more expensive stuff\nInstead of having to have the screaming kids into you know what I mean I Know they don't ask me these thanks so brilliant sometimes anyway\nUh if I Do say so myself a said look that is something to look forward to that doesn't mean they're all going to be competing for the business I don't necessarily think it means you're going to get a better deal on any one toy over the other but uh the good news is there is going to be plenty of opportunities and plenty of places to take the place of toys\nR Us I still wonder if there is an opportunity um for somebody to figure out a boutique he\nYou know ... experience filled that toy store that parents would just love and the kids would beg to go to that was you know in shopping centers where parents had other things to do or I don't know some or there's something for the moms and dads and for the kids\nYou know always remember growing up I didn't grow up as a Toys R us kid and the nineties and early ... I grew up as a KB Toys kid I Would have been that it was a smaller store there wasn't as big of a selection but yeah you can play with everything in the store and the whole lot of different things with different kind of experience the toys R Us ... didn't work\nI don't know why I Can't pick for you is any things like for people who have never seen the guy next he's kind of a\nGiant big yeah he's a bit of it I Can't picture it was like a little tiny can just picture like a giant neck only with like younger [laughter] you know interests in the toy store like there is no small version of you in my mind uh in any case well we're talking business stories or\nI Want to mention something else he may not have been aware of but those ride sharing companies that we love so much left and now we were both offering subscription services lift announced they're a little while back a Hooper just announcing bears within the last twenty four forty eight hours or so\nUm they're very different the two programs but interesting I think I mean obviously\nIf you've done any thinking about entrepreneurship and being in business everybody loves the subscription model 'cause you get somebody's credit card one time and you just charge a month after month after month and the best thing you can hope for is the companies that they don't actually use your service that much but they use it enough that they keep that subscription going\nOr they buy they forget or even have it on our credit card and it just is what it is a so smart I think for both of them to introduce that but I Want to talk about these two programs 'cause I think they're interesting so lift announced their subscription service almost as a substitution for having a car\nSo there is two hundred and Ninety nine dollars essentially a month two hundred Ninety nine dollars every thirty days you can cancel anytime and with that you get thirty writes\nUp to Fifteen dollars apiece so you can't if it's a forty dollar lift ride to the airport you pay the difference um the pros want now to Ninety nine dollars if you are substituting if you decide to get rid of your car and do this three hundred dollars a month that's a good deal\nWhen you think about what you're probably paying for your car payment a plus gas um plus a insurance and repairs and whatever else a car washes et cetera\nThirty right there's not enough like I was just trying to do the simple math and you guys know how bad I\nBut I figured it like this you gotta least forty working days in a month so if you work full time you need to override to and from work\nRight now is our twenty working days I Apologize but I'm at forty rides twenty working days forty rides and you only get thirty so like you can't even get back and forth to work let alone go out to dinner so\nI don't really think it's enough now I guess if you live in a city where there's also good public transit and you can mix and match what you're doing then fine or the other thing by the way that you get with lifts option is um I think something like only five percent discount on rides a over and above\nYour thirty that's not enough she seemed like it should be a bigger discount to me [noise]\nProgram very different theirs is a more like Amazon Prime and that you pay to essentially be a member for all intents and purposes and then you get flat heavily discounted fairs um see pay only fourteen Ninety nine a month which is a lot less than three hundred a month\nBut you don't get any free rides for that you just get a discount and you don't have to pay some of those peak time fees and things like that you can it's a little more reasonable to take over at that price\nThat seems may be better if you take it more frequently 'cause I can partly Fifteen bucks at Starbucks let's be honest so partying with Fifteen bucks for membership much more job on my mind it'll be interesting to follow both of these programs\nAnd see how they do the ah\nAmazon I'm Sorry the rubber program is only in five cities right now ah and we're not one of them yet so we uh we'll just wait and see if it comes here right now they're LA uh Austin Orlando Denver and Miami so we shall see how that goes there but it seems like a good idea to me\nAh the question for you I guess is would you pay that extra money do you does Atlanta do we ride enough in Atlanta\nTo pay for memberships like that\nWe shall see some probably do some probably don't think it's the bar people yeah uh and they should pass safe driving people safe driving and be safe and I were out of time it is Halloween have fun with the kids get lots of candy see 'em off [noise]\n\nFollows in on Facebook and Twitter asks you know Barry ... days from New life here on TALK reviews the forties\nOr only for mortgages

idea to Chris in your range of income and business and marketing a career or your washer and your best year\nAre never really made a whole lot of money on I don't feel like I ever really put my degree to work um I Would say like the last year this is my wife and I can find gross income was probably eighty thousand uh-huh I'm currently currently we make a point\nTo it but it's a grocer sixty thousand so we don't make a whole lot of money so well in your worst year when you started out probably\nAre just you know when I was Twenty one I'm making ... an hour I think I may twenty thousand a year\nTo try to hunker and your degree is in\nA same business of marketing um I work at a at a grocery store for thirty seven years or worked my way up\nAnd that was a butcher actually and uh I was forced out about three years ago because they thought I was too expensive and uh that point in time I kinda\nThought I had enough money to retire but\nI didn't want to pay health insurance so I just am a courier now and I don't make a whole lot of money I make fourteen dollars an hour ... but so I make enough to cover to cover our living expenses are retirement money is just said the girl and so I'm just kinda hold back\nOkay so you never mind over eighty but you're saying on a one point eight million dollar network a tell me oh how you did that once the key to that\nAre the key is the uh one thing I did it was kinda neat that first car I bought it take a loan out for\nA um a ever since I take that first car I just kept money going into the bank so I every car after that I just paid cash for a um a lot to live within my game I'm working at the grocery store I used to see people that would come in and\nThey would like peanut butter and bail bread and that's what\nThey would try to live on and I did not want to see myself doing that so I never uh I've never I Do I carry a credit card and I know that's against your teaching but I pay off the balance every month and a never paid any credit card cheese at my entire life\nOkay so how do you end up with one point four or five million a mutual funds\nUh when I did work a grocery chain every time I got to raise the retirement\nUm like

door open that put my foot in I'm\nIn and that's the way I kind of scratch and called and got my way from two thousand do harm Nineteen thousand\nHow old were you when you started investing in mutual funds\nI was a twenty seven years old\nWhat made you do that\n[laughter] [noise] that was the year I think I heard you mentioned this on the show a ... stocks went on sale mhm\nAnd uh our company at

they are only two college graduates out of the whole bunch today that's exactly right most of the millionaires we studied in the millionaire study from your book the everyday millionaires\nDid graduate from College of them did not graduate from prestige college that's right Seventy three percent I Believe it wasn't didn't not graduate from a ... college went to a state school but most of them did I have a four year degree today\nOn the today show most of them did not cause right I mean or or a couple of associate's degrees and a couple of a high school graduates one with a GED at age thirty\nYeah it's amazing a ... at the age is that we're looking at we got from forty three fifty sixty fifty seven forty to sixty three that was today yeah all today you know so we're average\nAge we found in the study was fifty two years old and that is the average of all of them that's right of the ten thousand that we talk to\nBut they are amazing thing is is we've got also two to three of them started investing in their twenties so they got that first job got intentional early\nThey recognize the match chefs wearing orange scared of the mutual funds orange scared of the stock market and had a matter of fact Paul was the opposite he jumped in when the market was down that's where I figured out hey that's down this time to get in well\nBecause he's he listened to you explain it but it's on sale and now he hadn't back then [laughter] he said that's that's the way it sounds like when I that right yeah you know the other one we have been one lady bed learn what not to do from watching her parents who ended up having to go down the path of bankruptcy\nSo this wisdom Dave this awareness is gaining the right kinds of information used in the right tools that are out there for one k.'s and

are less than one percent of the millionaires\nAre that are out there um and ... you know the words you don't have to be rich and famous so you know when we hear people say the only way out of my neighborhood is\nA a basketball it that's not true that is right\nIt is a way out right but it's not the only way out as a matter of fact it's not the typical way out if you want to be a typical everyday millionaire and that kind of comes down to what kind of laser I said I Know you've quoted or an off color because we both just fell in love with a lady but they're saying it doesn't matter where you come from it matters where you're going that's right\nAnd you make the decision to ... you know do they use for one case stay out of debt live on less than you may and several of them today talked about work ethic\nYeah I mean I'm sitting here thinking about Carlos who is with KFC for over forty years one job starting out washing dishes Dave one company no one county washing dishes so here he is with us back of this problem in their scrubbing\nHaving no idea his work ethic his focus was going to put him on a path three million dollars three million dollar dot dot dot ... net worth

might as well decide which one you want to write you want to write a check for a gate that broke that wasn't your fault or do you want to write a check for justice me I like a good fight I'm a hillbilly so I'd rather just fight\nI really would I mean I'll spend I'll spend a million dollars completely destroying something rather spend ten dollars to keep from doing the wrong thing it just drives me bananas I Can't stand it Josh is with us in Chicago hey Josh how are you\nDavid I'm doing great how are you better\nThan I deserve what's up\n[noise] um well my wife and I have been struggling for a few years to figure out how we should educate our kids um we'd love for them to be taught from a Christian perspective\nBut at the same time we love to pay off our house and I'm not sure what the best movers and financially responsible to do one or the other and I wanted to get your opinion [noise]\nUm well I mean typically a Christian school is a private school and it's going to be more expensive and then the question you've got to say is if we go that route it pays off our home in\nSeven years if we go the other route it pays off our home and three years is it worth four more years or whatever the number is you just run your numbers out I just made those up okay but in other words this is going to delay the mortgage being paid off if you go the more expensive school route in order to get that world view\nWhich is fine and um now I I Will tell you having educated a paid for the education for three kids that are now adults\nAnd having participated in this discussion a multitude of times with friends that are Christians and and we are obviously to 'em that you need to be very careful if you're going to invest in a a a a private Christian school that they are actually implementing that belief system\nThere are some that have a Christian heritage that are no more matching with my value system that fly to the moon\n[laughter] I just ... they once had something that was Christian and and sometimes they are still holding themselves out as Christian schools but the values that they're tenured professors are bringing into the classroom at nothing to do with the values of miles hold\nAnd show if I'm going to do that I might if I won't be on the enemy territory I might as well know that I'm On enemy territory\nInstead of a wolf in sheep's clothing kind of thing so if you're going to invest make sure you're getting what you're\nAttempting to get here I'm not saying that can't be done it can be done there are great Christian schools that do a great job of a quality education\nWith the quality of value system but you just gotta make sure you can't just assume because such and such was a Baptist school are such a central Presbyterian\nBut that might have been many years ago and there and you know they've got that in their heritage but they're no more than fly to the moon anymore um and so\nYou know that then you just pay for an expensive school with a\nQuestionable quality you know so they're not the second part of the equation as this and this is not the challenge you it's just a ... help you with your critical thinking and you decide which one you want to do in the process my three kids and sharing and I all went to University of Tennessee a public state school\nWhich there is some bizarre stupid but stuff that happens on the campus [laughter] okay I mean crazy and some of those professors are proved tenure should not be there you know I mean there is some nut burgers running around over there\nOn my university campus okay and I love University of Tennessee but there's some stuff happening over there\nThat just make your hair color or you know so my kids went there though but here's the thing we figured out that our kids spiritual walk was not based on what happened at school it was based on what happened at home okay and so our kids plugged into young life while they were in a public
