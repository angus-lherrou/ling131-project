{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "In any case I don't know is what I have to say get on the Canadians and I'm sure a lot of Americans who are thinking you know I'm tired of this and I want to move somewhere but Canada too cold may have rethought it now it may have been ... by a person or two\nYou know why you think that what being high could've gnomes your senses and whatever so that's fun while you have trade offs like I'm going to be cold but I'll be sound so you won't care so much that you're cold valid point I'm sick of it\nBut I'm just putting it out there you know I'm not saying it's what I Would do but it does make it does seem like it would be easier to uh to take I just I don't know um\nOnce in a while I listened can just be honest about my pot smoking history I think I well I smoked pot back in the day like when I was in college because he didn't really um but then you know I stopped and every once in a while now many your ... as many years later as it is now I think I Would try that again you know just to see\nBut I don't feel comfortable breaking the law so until it becomes legal in Georgia I guess I'm not trying again unless I go to Canada on vacation I Wonder if tourism is going to go up there oh you gave me a fall on Yahoo\nYeah well that that was actually I think one of the things that they were pushing through Canadian Parliament is on tourism dollars 'cause the folks down south don't have it yet yeah so\nI'm just so funny I this is just the\nMarijuana flower for now so in other words no vaporize there was no edibles a and know marijuana in these beverages are expected to be legal this year but they're working on all that that may happen next year so I think they want\nOf you know ease into it like you should if you're a smoker\nAnd you know they'll just get to that later like when they feel like it you know what I'm saying man [laughter] I'm\nIn any case I just thought I should bring it up because maybe we should take a lesson from that I mean the one of ... one of the arguments all along about legalizing marijuana has\nAnd shopping to drug trafficking keeping it away from younger adults if you have it legal but with an age limit it's much easier to control a keeping it out of the hands of really young kids and so I think a lot of what's going to happen is a lot of the countries that have thought about this are going to be watching Canada for the next\nYear or so and see how it goes see what happens to their crime rates um and maybe follow suit fast forward like five ten years from now marijuana is going to be legal everywhere\nGive a kind of looks like it's going that way just a little\nBit and then we're going to have all kinds of fun stuff happening lately bunkers yeah we're going to have all kinds of like there's going to be cruises there's going to be like you know the full on like you know like flights that get you high you know I mean are they going to be ...\nYou know what I mean like we're all going to land but it's like the ... it's the high version [laughter]\nTo go and you'll think its smog smokes about yeah should everyone smokes I gather [laughter] altogether now I just wanted to catch up I thought it was important\nTo catch up on a few of the stories we may have mess all we've been so focused on the Saudi Arabia story because\nThat's just been the headline\nFor days and days and is now but a lot of other things are going on I mentioned Volkswagen out of context a little bit earlier but I Want to bring them back up 'cause they were in my mind because they've also been in the headlines yet again Volkswagen now hit with a ... or nine hundred and twenty six million dollar fine\nThis is still fall out from their emissions cheating scandal that started it's got to be three years ago now but that started something like that or this time it is because of the similar failings the emissions cheating feelings but not at Volkswagen at their subsidiary Audi\nSo that's what this fine is about a and this was a fine imposed in Germany not here in the U.S\nVolkswagen saying earlier this week that they're accepting that fine imposed by German prosecutors they're not going to appeal others going to go ahead and pay that and ah and try to move on from all of this um but it will of course had their\nUh their books and therefore uh shareholders will not be loving it and whatever quarter that hits the books so I just a little update on that\nIt just got it I I Want to do sort of I think bring it up to you because it just goes to show you that you know choosing a business practice that is illegal\nYou might get away with it but if you don't the cost of getting caught\nIs so high I think about how much money they could have just saved and how much of their reputation that they could have saved had they just followed the rules and the first place or just something to think\nAbout as you make your own decisions about how to uh go far in your business life\nAnd your personal life [noise] I just want to catch up on a couple of those things also there was an Obama\nStudent debt relief rule that the Trump Administration vi a back seat of off our education secretary was trying to block essentially and it finally this particular rule which was set up by the way to help students\nWho were cheated by for profit colleges that closed to get relief on their student at best several I'm referring to and uh that rule finally took effect earlier this week uh\nTemps by secretary to boss to block this and to try to protect the a for profit colleges\nYou know I'm gonna pick on her for that right I was just wondering if anybody thought I was just going to end the story there\nThese colleges that were for profit colleges that ...\nA a a word that promise things they could not deliver like job hiring rates things like that this is you know things like the Trump University would fall into that category places that promise all kinds of things uh and couldn't deliver\nAnd then went out of business and left students holding the bag and holding these huge loans to pay off the student that\nIt seems to me and many of these colleges by the way we're sued and many of them are also prosecuted by the government and paid fines now they do not pay enough and fines to cover the cost of all of these student loan debts but they certainly pay some\nBut it seems to me that they should have been charged with the wrongdoers the evildoers if you will and this scenario should have been charged the full cost of all of those loans and they shouldn't be the ones paying these students back not the government\nCould be via the government you know what I'm saying but there should be a fund set up its paid into by the ... the schools\nI I this is where I get really annoyed about these companies being able to file bankruptcy you know and brush their hands off of the whole thing because let me tell you something\nUnless I filed bankruptcy personally and it's not easy to not nearly as easy to do personally as it is for these giant companies\n[noise] if I\nHave a bill do personally and I don't want to pay it I don't have that option\nMy creditors will say no you've got to pay this will set up a payment plan for you but you have to pay so my argument\nIs that these corporations like ITT Tech or whatever it was one of the ones that went out of business Trump University whomever they are\nWould should have to do the same thing they should have to set up a\nPlan and pay all these people's loans for them or pay them the money back over time or something rather than just\nFiling for bankruptcy closing up shop and walking away and leaving by the way either these individuals or the government or the rest of us holding the bag\nAnd then you have Betsy divide us and the Trump Administration protecting trying\nNot to let these students get help and trying and allowing these colleges these so called colleges to walk away\nCome on where's\nThe common sense here this is where I get frustrated because I well I Do believe in fiscal conservativism I don't believe in always protecting the big guy that was not fiscal conservatism to me\nThat's just unfair period [noise] um and I want the government paying that off but I don't want the students paying it either I Want the criminal to pay it that's how it should be\nBut now we have laws to protect the big companies and we have nothing to protect the little guy\nI get to know that we as the taxpayers have to pay for it\nSo come on\nCome on people and these are the stories by the way that don't get a lot of coverage 'cause you know why they sexy but that's why we try to at least keep you up to date on some of that stuff where I got myself worked up on that one new dynamic\nOn that nowhere officially out of time but we will be back tomorrow CNN [noise]\n\n\nFollow gene on Facebook and Twitter after a very short lived in a very nice one year olds will reduce the forties and streaming live only five or ...\n[noise]\nNBC News radio on ... secretary of state Mike Pompeo and President Trump are discussing findings following Pompeo's trip to Saudi Arabia or you'll pressed Saudi leaders about the disappearance of Washington Post called ... but he also notes that key relationship the U.S has with the Saudis\nBut I've been doing it for Thirty years ought to be good at it and so um [noise] you know but when I started on the beans and I'm\nA so that that that that just be a ... that kind of a person and just care\nAbout the people there if you look in their eyes and listen to them and you know you're you're going to be just fine but because that's why they came in any way 'cause you're a person they trusted and just to be the person that caused them to come in the first place and you're going to be fine just don't want to know everything is you don't it's okay\n[laughter] I definitely don't [laughter]\nWell I don't I I sit in front of Fifteen million people in ... on this radio show I have to say I don't know sometimes I don't know and that's the only answer because it's the only truthful won't anyway and\nAnd um you know you can Google it like I can Google it lets tried together I don't know you know but um that's why I don't take a lot of tax questions because I'm not very good at taxes\nUm that kinda stuff so you just you don't have to be everything you just got to be somebody that cares\nAnd if you're that you're going to be a great financial ... to coordinate her moral clash you already

send you a copy of the book the total money make over it'll walk you right through the baby steps of exactly\nHow to do what I'm Talking about I think you can do this if you read that book it'll show

deserve what's up\nHow the quick question me and my wife are on step to um we plan on being free within six months or in the ... our\nOur goal is within two years to move now we'll be on step three [noise] um and my question is if we come in about five to ten thousand dollars short of our emergency savings fine but yet we sell the house very pretty good profit\n... some of the money from that sell the house into the into the emergency farm in order to bring that up to date and then put the rest toward the house or how would you want us to go about doing that\nI'm confused why would you come in short\n[noise] um just because we need to save up for some other things or she needs a car before we move out of town um and just with the money we be cutting in there and we'd come up maybe just a little bit short before you want to move but we do need to [laughter]\nUm well you can do what you want to do I mean you're grown up you're allowed to there's no law on any of this but um yeah so um what what I Do I think when you buy stuff that's not an emergency before you have an emergency fund you are inviting Murphy to move in your spare bedroom\nOkay I think you're asking for trouble when I got an emergency fund in place I quit having emergencies and it was the weirdest thing but as long as I was broke my live looked like a country song and other I think you're asking for it I'm so no I don't think her bond buying her car's\nNon emergency and so it does not supersede\nYour ah your need for an emergency fund now if you want to say three to six months of expenses is your emergency bonding you want to say well we're going to get to the three mark and then we're going to do some purchases and we may be put up a little bit more later\nBut we're comfortable with the three months of expenses emergency funds at least until we get her car or whatever these other things are that you're wanting to do that's fine but I bought her cars on emergency\nIt's not she's got a car\nSo that's how we know we don't usually emergency fund for it mark is in Orlando, Florida Hi Mark how are you\nDoing here near better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my girlfriend and I have been together for about three years or very young and we would like to move on and move forward our lives and get married and living together good uh we don't know over financially stable though and we all want to be smart about it financially ...\nHow old are you Twenty one okay and what do you make\nA about thirty thirty five year [laughter] and what's your career\nUh right now I'm just a warehouse worker okay so what's your plan\nI Know ... I don't know if we should go and no no it wasn't your career plan or replace our you know\nPretend like some young man who is a sharp young guy who's working in a warehouse is Twenty one just walked into your house and want to marry your daughter\nYeah what would you tell him I'd want to know what his dad gummed plan is right\nYes sir how are you going to take care of this girl\nI Would love to take care of it but like\nHannah I'm giving you a hard time brother okay it was if you're if you think about it that way if forces you to think about your long term prospects which is as her bad that's what he'd be looking at right they'd\nBe saying OK guys a sharp young do they not making anything right now you're working in a warehouse but everybody's got really got a really good career path he's got a plan and it's going to work out I mean by the time he's thirty one what are you going to be doing you know so I'm more concerned about that I think you can make it on thirty five does she have a job\nA chief in school and doing a part time job at a restaurant when does she graduated from school\nShared about another year and a half years\nOkay and what were her degree began\nAh she's teaching okay and who's paying for her school\nRight now her her parents okay alright would they continue that and she could complete and be a teacher while you're married\nOr have to ask but really I I think it would go down critical with it\nOkay that's good so you could go ahead and get married and you'd have her part time in coming years already five thousand on her income knowing that in a year Eighteen months she's going to be a teacher and your household incomes going more than double\nYou'd be making over Seventy ... closed eighty thousand depending on what she's teaching where she's teaching and all that kind of stuff right but with a teaching certificate in Florida she'll she'll make good money\nAnd then you've got better prospects 'cause you're gonna start thinking about what you want to be when you're thirty one and start taking the steps to be that so that when you're forty one year also a better one\nAnd fifty one year rich one\n... that makes sense okay yeah there\nSo I think you got the stuff to get married uh but I I'm more concerned about where you're going and where you are to day\nTo answer the question of are you ready for marriage and I think you are you're sharp young guy and I'm obviously she's doing she's got a great career track there so you know what I Would want you to answer for your own satisfaction I was poking at you and saying let's pretend it's her dad rights but for your own satisfaction\nWhat are you wander\nWherever you go because let me tell you if you aim at nothing you hit it every time you will be thirty one year old warehouse worker\nAnd you don't want to do that there's nothing wrong with no shame and being a warehouse worker but you want to be growing and evolving right\nYeah you want to be something better you I Want you to own the freaking warehouse\nOkay okay yeah that's how I Would look at it and if you got all that kind of talk through and so forth and then you got a game plan C I my goal was I was going to be rich and real estate when I was your age is what I wanted to I was dating my wife I was Twenty one I was so broke I couldn't pay attention I had a daughter sixteen and my checking

garden income um because I'm an international student I can just work on campus so my current income is about Thirteen hundred dollars a year and I'm going to lose that job in December because when I

about four hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars a year okay my goodness gracious what in the world do you do I'm an emergency room physician\nOkay so you're an empty yes okay and you're working your brains out yes and I'm three eighty was had to be med school to about two hundred and sixty I was in student loans and about one twenty with our mortgage your house and everything\nYeah how are you thirty one how long you been out of school are about three years okay so you come out of med school and a kind of ... a year or so it goes by but then right after that you decided to attack the stuff with a vengeance tell me the story my goodness\nYeah well I finished it was actually residency three years ago and when I came out I started going to a church that was doing financial peace university and some of my friends were taking it and talking about it and saying great things\nAnd so I decided to download your audio book subtle money make over ... I started listening to it and I think that turning point for me was when I got to the point about the debt snowball and lifting your debt\nBecause up until that point I had been just doing everything they try to avoid thinking about it it was stressful I just I didn't even want to you know deal with it and I will go on and I saw that in the past three years I had been pain about Thirteen thousand dollars a year\nAnd about Fifteen thousand dollars a year with a crane in interest every year\nSo I really wasn't even making that day and and the student loans and so I knew something needed to change I Need to get serious especially being in my late twenties at the time and single\nI didn't want to have this bird and looming over my head for the next decade or two and certainly if I got married had a family and the future I didn't want to bring that burden into that\nWhere you're paying off a ridiculous amount of that with a ridiculously wonderful income show you hum wow okay so you're you're finished residency\nAnd really about a year went by before you started this right yeah roughly year okay did you come straight out and go into ER yeah yeah Microsoft with emergency medicine so you were making box already but then you're just when you shut down at the math on there she went oh I can do this\nYeah I just realized that something absolutely need to change because I just I couldn't live like that anymore\nWow look at you it just doesn't mean you just do ban now do you take a lot of extra time at a yard to in order to get the incumbent this or is that one of the a A R position makes\nSo I actually went to my boss and asked if I could work on ships in the yard and I did that for the entire twenties too much point in life because it paid significantly more to work like\nYeah this is a it's it's that Governor double with it or it's about twenty percent more in our twenty percent of All right but wow so you're really sacrificed together is not the people it's like you were losing your mind I mean your family your doctor your enjoy your life I ... I mean\nYeah the one thing I heard a lot of was in regards to buying a new car because I was still driving\nA used car for medical school at that point it's like being how did it right and so my friends and family but tell me you know you're crazy you can afford a new car you can afford a car payment and I would tell them now I really just want to save and I'll buy my ex former cash and Ofeibea used car and they don't have enough\nYeah what do you have anything you wonder I Know I mean you might for Fifteen thousand you know your payments [noise]\nThis is an amazing stories done like a very well not well you did exactly\nWhat I tried to get doctors to their most dogs come out and go [noise] finally worked all this time I've gone to school my whole life mhm I deserve a new house and the car I deserve a trip and they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and I it's crazy and\nYou need a plan you obviously have a great military retirement coming out right\nIt'd be okay come on electric bill\nOkay All right and ah does your wife work outside the home\nYes you go okay she'll between her income and your military retirement the households not going to fold up\nNo not at all it would be about ... to to the family of a year\nYeah and that's if you don't work so why do you need to save money\nAll ... uh in third with ... and living a little little in the more money now they're trying to get our budget and everything under control and I just want to make sure that\n... what I Would do in the state as I get my budget under Seventy five thousand between now and then and I would get my career lined up between now and then you got plenty of time\nHere that yeah I just I don't I don't want I mean you can't save up enough to not deal with those two issues agreed uh yes 'cause you'll burn through whatever it is if you never go back to work and you always spend more than the Seventy five\nNo matter how much you're safe if you served a hundred grand\nYou burn through it eventually you know I'm Sorry we ... we after we have to go ahead and address those issues so let's just address some now\nBut again thank you for your service we appreciate it and so yeah I get my career lined up and get my budget wound up under Seventy five thousand and that takes the pressure off of getting their career\nWound up exactly but a ... year even your your okay it's not your good long term plan but no I I think I'd go ahead and work on getting my debts paid off now and build your emergency fund whatever you're going to do but let's keep working your debt snowball keep working your baby steps\nGet their career lined up that's what I Would do\nRyan is in Atlanta Hi Ryan how're you\nDoing good how are you doing Dave better than I deserve what's up\nSounding question [noise] investing so I guess the short a review I'm I'm thirty and my wife's thirty three\nA combined income right now about one Seventy five ... I'm only ... is more games I'm a car payment and then I'm a little bit of student loan that we've got the cash to pay it off\nA which we're I'm about to go at the end it off the U.S pay 'em even after that we can get at least six months of\nUm you know emergency expenses that back emergency fund um I've got a four one K. and a pension she has four one K. and profit sharing and I'm In question is what a extra income every month\nThey who should be voted at something that's strictly tied retirement what it seemed like we have a lot of origin it'd be better to put that into something more accessible like a like a man it's a like a some type of managed fund it can be accessed prior to retirement if need be\nYou know we call those bridge funds um ... at some point I Would go there but I think you've got some cleaning up to do y'all been pretty sloppy you make a lot of money to be as broke as you are\nUm how long have you been making that kinda money\nOn the last couple of years okay\nIt's it's it's time to clean up the rest of this mess since yeah let's read some checks today and pay off student loan the car you got to pay off both of them\nDo yeah good let's do that today\nAnd then you need to have your emergency fond of three to six months of expenses not income three to six months of expenses\nAnd uh that's what we call taken you through baby step three which lays the foundation for a solid financial plan your debt free and you have your rainy day fund except your home okay then we move on to what we call baby steps four or five and six do you have children\nNot right now okay\nThen ah we would baby steps for is Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's not much with what you guys make\nWhat it's a good start and it's not going to keep you from retiring and doing the bridge stuff later which I'm going to come back to and actually do what you want to do but I'm going to do it in the right order\nUm [noise] once you're doing that than baby step five is kids college that does not apply here baby steps six pay off your house or lamb or reach over knock the house out beyond that which is has the same effect to your net worth\nThat the bridge loan does because I have in your home paid off frees you up an enabler due to need a lot less income\nTo retire before you can access the retirement funds okay now then once the house is paid off which really do how much do you own your home\nAll the good old two eighty\nOkay if you do what I'm Talking about here probably in about five years maybe seven before you're forty or house is going to be paid off\nAnd by then you're probably making two two and a quarter if you're on a normal career track maybe even more okay so your income is increasing your ... one hundred percent that free before you're forty now we can do a lot of stuff\nAnd I have a single parent in the world mathematically with one Seventy five two and a quarter or whatever it is coming in\nNow you max out retirement and you build other wealth which will have this effect you're looking for of what we call the ... bridge financing and our bridge savings or bridge investing bridge between age fifty two and\nYou know if you wanted to have enough to to do some stuff with before then but the whole idea of being that we're going to build wealth\nAs a result of having no payments\nTo go with your fabulous income uh your most powerful wealth building tool is your income we've just finished a study here that Chris Hogan is doing a book on a ... of the largest study of millionaires ever done and what we find is as they pay off their home in an average of ten point two years\nMost of them do not make as much as you make\nThe vast majority of millionaires don't make as much as you make\n'em and then they steadily invest in there for one k.'s and once that's maxed out they do other investing in just good mutual funds or by some real estate that you pay cash for its income producing or something like that where you've got some other moneys that you've got access to\nThat is not return not all tied up in retirement\nAnd so you're thinking right I just put it to the back of a line it's to the front on the line on when you're going to get to it\nUm and you'll get there faster if you're both the way I'm Talking about in the way you're talking about in clean up this mass you make too much money be sitting around stupid car payment to ridiculously high man thanks for the call open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five\nI couldn't tell a is following me on YouTube dot com slash Dave Ramsey by the way you can watch the show live on YouTube and you can see all the debt free screams on there and you can see all the rants on there\nSome really good stories about people having turned their lives around all kinds of very cool stuff are YouTube channel is packed\nFull of stuff or you can just sit there and watch watch watch watch watch and if you want to learn every time we posted a new video you get if you don't know when you subscribe to YouTube channel you get a email\nAnd uh every time we posted a video so go to the day Ramsey show YouTube channel\nAwkward tell us I was I got fifty thousand dollars worth of bad about forty thousand that student loans bobbing credit card that the other five and medical bills are really don't know where to begin\nWell one time and we tell folks to [noise] to list their deaths smallest total largest time telling your home pay minimum payments on everything but the little one in the little ones when it's going to take the payments used to play there at any other money you can squeeze out of your life and your budget and\nYou throw at the next one every time he found one young\nMoney to the next [noise] English the smallest margin in [noise]\nA thanks for the Gulf and this is that Iran [noise]\nBecause you know you can do again you can do this for a year you could lose for two or three years but you cannot do it over the scope of ten to Twenty years and\nBecause your your house poor at that point your your your house was draining the blood out of your life and you you just don't have anything left here you have no margin you're no wiggle room\nAnd uh so you guys have got to sit down and analyzes or something we can do to get our incomes up substantially or we've got to look at living\nFurther out in in a different setting where it's not as expensive I Know California real estate expensive I understand I'm In ... in and out of California in and out of Manhattan all the time I understand these markets I Know the markets but I mean it's almost impossible to live on the island of Manhattan unless you make a hundred dollars a year\nUm we just cannot afford the rent even on a studio apartment and so that's what you're facing in your market there uh and then the you know we're talking about this in San Fran the other day when I was over there you you cannot afford to live in Silicon valley\nUnless you make substantial money and so I mean so there's and Silicon Valley as a result is having a real problem staffing service type jobs\nBecause nobody the service type jobs for typical service type income can afford to live there and so you run into all kinds of people are being busted him to do\nLabor type jobs and are in them because they can't afford to live in Silicon valley and that's that's just a mathematical facts of the situation so that applies to you and you've got to make some decisions are is are we going to do something with our careers that allows to live in this house or\nOr we're going to do in order to stay in that job and and the general area we're probably looking at a more substantial commute Amy is with us in Detroit Michigan Hi Amy how are you\nKidding how

phenomenal you did a great job presenting that really connected to the\nThank you yes it uh it was exciting to see people jot down some of the things we were talking about that practically allow them to get where they want to be you know that I mean we can all vision mountaintop\nBut then it gets real scary when we started thinking about how do I scale that mountaintop as we talked a lot about the proximity principal and gave people some ideas on the right people they may be around it and the right places they need to be\nBecause of your weather is something you can be in the proximity of the things\nThat are here to the proximity principles simply says in order to do what I Want to do you feel like\nThat I've got to be around people who are doing that and in places where that is happening so think about that when I'm Around the right people they all point meaning to the to the right places and they want to go in those places and were specifically looking for three things in the right places where I can learn or I can do\nAnd where I can connect and Dave when I'm In the right places I inevitably going to be more of the right people and so it becomes this cyclical process that is so profoundly simple\nIt should demystify the path to get anywhere I Want to go you're an example it here's what's good about this no matter how successful you get your waist practicing the proximity what's your continuously looking to get around the right people whether it be for personal reasons are professional reasons you like to sit down billionaires want to learn things about these men and women [noise]\nYou know and you're constantly thinking about what are the places I Need to be at a worse Ramsey solutions need to be this is a very simple principle that no matter where you're at life if you want to get somewhere you have to practice proximity you know I've noticed that happening here in our\nLittle a burger outside of Nashville Franklin, Tennessee has has ended up becoming a

handful of others that I'm just not even thinking in Richmond right now [noise]\nUm but a ... a lot of movement I just seems to be this thing happening\nAnd and it's like an all fucking artist community like Asheville North Carolina very much an art community you know and you get around things and the people and the places that something's happening and then you have a better chance to pull it off\nAnd it's not that the Donald Miller or die ... in Iraq there are already in every day we certainly don't but we all know each other and we're all interacted and we've all helped each other that's one way or another ah sometimes it's just a drop by nothing real fancy but it is a very much all within about five miles of each other you know as an example\nYeah it it it here's what happens when you get around like minded people\nThen there is a natural a force if you will it's almost magnetic\nThat they are going to pull you into their or of a little bit just by their example and you you know there ... there was a guy that you and I both admire I never had the chance to meet him Charles tremendous Jones you know it's a famous saying that said you know who you are five years from now is largely depended on the books you read\nAnd the people you meet and we also heard the age old colloquial isn't that nobody can attribute it to anybody but it's not what you know it's who you know who you know so again what we've done here on the show was was helping people try to\nDemystify or take away the fear of getting where they want to go is by showing them this is a process is not going to happen overnight it might take you four years of putting yourself in proximity to the right person for me to have you know my story you watched it from afar eight years\nEight years of small
