{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Concocted this entire thing all I Know is no one has been able to ah ...\nMrs Ford's story about anything and this appears to be just political a political witch hunts\nAnd coordinated effort to stall if you were wrongly accrued accused the way he was you would be mad too damn mad personally I think he would have rather mildly given the circumstances the left\nHas done more harm or with this deal then they realize this has made good hardworking folks like myself really angry on his behalf if you want to be considered even mildly moderate try looking at both sides of this story and at least consider the idea that he may be innocent and the left has behaved rather horribly\nOkay um that is what William how to say a listener to this show so William first of all let me just say thank you for your comment I appreciate you taking the time to or email us and you can anyone can do that also just go to ... dot com and click on contact us we're happy to you\nOr I usually try to respond either on the show like I'm doing right now or to write back\nAnd I want to say a couple of things there are a lot of words out there um that describe\nThe middle of the road um when it refers to politics and I'm not to be perfectly honest I think there are different interpretations from what all those words man there's moderate centrist there's independent and there's a lot of different ways of saying this and I want to be clear on where I stand\nI Am fiscally conservative socially liberal\nUh I never\nClaimed to be anything other than that the word moderate is a word I chose to use because I Am essentially when I'm essentially saying is that I Am taking many of my physical views from the right and many of my social views\nMost if not all of my ... well not all but most of my social views from the left\nSo that were to me moderate meant somewhere in the middle if I chose the wrong word then I Apologize I'm I Believe in less regulation but not no regulation I Believe in uh the second amendment but also gun control a I Am pro choice\nI Am pro women I Am pro diversity I Am pro algae B. T. Q. these are the things I Believe in so I I feel like I've tried to be as clear as I can about that so\nIf you are judging me as a quote not a moderate because I Can't get behind BRIC cabinet or because I'm choosing to believe the woman ah Christine Blasey Ford in the scenario\nThen uh oh I can do is try to tell you where I come down and why\n[noise] I Will\nAnd second William let me just say I'm that I'm going to do what you're asking out and say okay what if he's innocent\n\nIf he's innocent and these charges you know I I first of all I Do believe that Christine Blasey Ford was credible the the idea that she somehow got the person wrong it's hard for me to believe especially because she claims that she's a hundred percent sure and she seemed quite credible but okay I Will make the assumption for the sake of this discussion that he is innocent\nUm the fact that there are multiple people that are suggesting that he or did not represent himself accurately and his Fox interview or\nTo the Senate Judiciary committee when talking about those years in which these accusations are relevant a is concerning to me and while I understand him being frustrated and of course very upset and angry if these allegations were all false it's still\nMandatory that someone who's going to sit on the Supreme Court carry themselves in a measured dignified way and handles that anger\nI'm In a way that isn't insulting to the senators asking questions that is understanding of the woman who had some obviously traumatic experience he did not do any of those things he did not answer a lot of the questions directly\nUm and so yes I Do understand the ... someone's anger being falsely accused but that doesn't mean you can't you you get an a pass to not answer questions and it also doesn't mean you get the job\nAnd I'm just going to continue to go back to the fact that this is not a criminal trial and that this is a job interview for one of the most important jobs in the country um and I and I think it's also been pretty clear about the fact that from my perspective I did not want him in the job to begin with\nBecause for me his views on\nPro choice and algae be the queue and guns and whether or not a president you know should have to face a special counsel\nAnd or potentially a be indicted or be able to pardon himself I don't agree with the judges views on those things so yes I openly admit that I come into this conversation with bias\nThat his anti Brett Kavanaugh but that doesn't mean I Can't look at what's happening I'm and give perspective on it\nThat's just my perspective\nUm and I understand if it's not yours but we have to be able to have a conversation with each other without yelling left and right without yelling or I don't know what let's just have the conversation the idea that you know Lindsey Graham is so angry uh\nChuck Grassley so angry and ... and and you know all of them has the most right to be angry\nI give him that um and the idea that this is the whole thing has concocted by the left is far fetched now is the left politicizing a hundred percent and so is the right\nThey are I mean the left absolutely is politicizing this ... ... is the left it to be blamed in some way for the timing of all of this\nProbably I'll give you that um but even if\nThis was and I but I Will say logically speaking and if you listen to what Christine Blasey Ford\nSaid she said I'm not a pawn of anybody nobody's\nEncouraged me to do this paid me to do this anything else I wrote a letter\nOf my own choice and yes my name was added without my permission but she didn't believe that it was a Dianne Feinstein the office that did it\nAnd wants her name was added it was again her choice to come forward so I\nA hard time believing this whole thing was you know tinfoil hat on concocted by the left did they take advantage of it a hundred percent\nOr did the right yes did\nThey all politicize this yes they did and they still are\nUm so that's my take on all of that and I hope you feel like I at least ... voiced by reading your comment on the show um because I don't want people to feel like they don't have a voice you are free to comment on our social media or or to call if you like and and I\nI Do want to say also that if you're going to do that\nUm\nKnow and I do give you credit William for this and also for the comment I got last night from somebody else whose name I forgot I'm Sorry ban I think um the you know I appreciate that you refrain from name calling and being mean and nasty because I've also gotten a lot of ...\nWhat I did before I was I [laughter] I Can't tell people who are trying to get um\nWork with a a non profit you help the housing\nAnd say okay um and so you think you've got to lead on that and you're afraid you might get governor she'd by somebody showing you if you got that job correct okay\nWell the good news is is the instant before they go in his shoe or you could file and they'd never get it done\nSo we're still nothing on fire were ways away from having to worry about their so you'd have to get a job and they would actually have to file a garnishment at that job and find out you have that job\nBefore you went that far you may end up filing\nOkay in here might end up that and I would certainly understand with all the hell you've been through would clean give you a clean slate\nAnd um you get a fresh start and you may end up filing a because it may be unreasonable to try to work your way through these things with your income but today you don't have to make that decision one of the things that happens when someone's been through what you've been through\nIs you feel the tyranny the tyrant\nIn your head from the background and it pushes you to do things a very suddenly very quickly\nAnd out of almost ... out of almost a desperation an emotional desperation I Am I wrong or am I reading your mail\nHere correct okay and so what I'm going to tell you there's a slow down a little bit because of the worst financial decisions you make or when you're desperate\nBecause you feel like you're for sure you're trapped and you start slashing and flailing around like your drowning or something and you really can do some stupid stuff and I actually know how much credit card debt is involved here\n[noise] um it's probably about twenty thousand dollars and ...\nGood and um do you have any other debt student loan debt\nI didn't like that yeah that's probably about ... three thousand\nType that is not bankrupt the ball right okay and do you have any IRS that\nNo just um foreclosure on the house\nOkay and what type of a home loan did you have F ha VA or conventional\n[noise] um I ... it was well it started off fresh ... but then it got [noise] um so then when he finance and I'm at this point I don't even remember what it was like\nHuh it's possible that they're not going to trace you at all\nSo if you just said that's not there and and we start making some money and we wanted to settle with two and three year old credit card debt for twenty cents on the dollar\nFour thousand dollars if that's the case and a lot of fighting on your part you'd have to have your fight back a arguing with them you can probably clear twenty thousand dollars worth of old credit card debt for around four thousand dollars\nAnd the student loan that doesn't change if that's all the case and they're not going to end your wages and you just began to work through this\nAnd you could have cleared it for four grand and it would all just gone away without a bankruptcy to see the bankruptcy starts the nightmare the credit nightmare the money nightmare over\nAgain right starts at all new\nBut if you can just clear these things up like drop off into the past a whole lot faster and they're not as permanent as a bankruptcy as you may end up being forced into bankruptcy by going\nBut to day I Would not find all based on fear of something that might happen that has not yet happened the raging man is not real you got away from him\n[noise] you're going to be okay if I Am able to start paying off but that oh wait till the batch teenage girls Charlotte flowers that to largest where\nI Would love to swim smallest the largest and I would call the smallest one in subtle with them\nFor ten to twenty cents on the dollar and then I Would set of what the next one for ten to twenty cents on the dollar ... meanwhile I'd get my student loans going on a basic payment plan that's all after you're back to work and feeding your kids and I have lights and water and my

multi millionaire\nOkay great thank you sound like they recreate your life\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah's whether it's in Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call I'm sure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that you know a a financial peace university and I have paid out forty thousand dollars in twelve month\nGood for you and yes and I'm Down to just one dead which is a bill that we've been paying for many years now ... I went to a small payments mhm and uh it's been offended collection and we've been looking at our credit report just making sure that all these debts have fallen off\nAnd um it well it turns out\nThat hospital bill had fallen off of our credit report\nAnd because of that my husband in a ... with the idea of just not adding that to the debt now Bob and just continuing to men on payment or even not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether\nOne is you actually owed them money so you should pay it\nYeah that's one problem the second problem is is that it's gonna come back to haunt you just 'cause they're not reporting it today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and report it at any time\nAnd so right what happened what's happened is is the collection a agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with is just not downloaded their files to credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just to mark what a bad mark because this is a defaulted\nThis is a bad bill it's not a current bill because they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered your payments because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so ah how much is the bill\nI it's less than seven thousand at that point okay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to\nPay them the minimum wage and I would build up a you know a lump sum of three or four thousand and offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing\nOkay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you owe the bill so clear the bill move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHello thank you for taking my phone call sure what I have I have a question [laughter] I Am\nSeventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for my tax shelter anybody [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option and I when I took a annuity out my thinking was to take a lifetime monthly benefit and so then when I went to uh Africa about it they gave me a several other options [noise]\nUm some of the other options for to take a fixed annuity monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no [laughter]\nI neither one way to take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care home policy no or another option but to take a tenure certain with which would be lower premiums ... eleven then it went raised to be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um\nAnd ah so ah [laughter] the anytime you started weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages notice I didn't even ask what I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance world what we call those bundling\nAnd there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance or homeowners were friends together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so that I smelled harassed and you have a good you have a good nose on your kid out [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you a check with an investment advisor like one of the smart buster pros and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that I think you'll end up with more money alive and\nDead doing that then you will messing with this annuity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home no guarantee it's going to go up\nIn value we're down in value either one no no insurance huh backing your home no no FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk why because well we can look at their track record of homes and be very comfortable with them and if I could find a mutual fund that I was just comfortable with\nIts track record it's volatility\nAs I was with your home at Seventy years old something like a growth in income ponder balance fund that kind of a thing that's probably where I'm putting my money\nFrom you at Seventy and um and it wouldn't be anywhere near an insurance company and uh so I'll be rolling this whole thing over into something else\nChecked smart faster at day Ramsey dot com put in your intro

your homes paid for everything else was paid for a vacation home is a wonderful extra as you start buildings from wealth but basically what is it it's a very large toy\nBirch pencil toy that goes up in value hopefully and if you rent it it might make you some money\nMy family not me my family the rest of them most of the rest of them including the grandkids just spent a week down at um\nRosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day and I rented a house on the beach really nice big expensive multi million dollar house for the week and obviously some people on that and rented out by the week\nI'm here's the thing about resort rentals vacation home rentals um you're going to make some money on it but you're not gonna ... you're going to make usually enough to\nAfter you pay all the fees for the maid service and the you know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get the property management usually take half of it the managers and that covers you know made service and that kinda stuff and then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a hot season with a ski house or in your house in the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines\nYou you're not going to get rich on rent it out you really not I mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment property it's more of a way to offset some of your annual costs of your toys\nIf you look at it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not going to be thrilled with it as an investment you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money for the ... per dollar invest it\nAnd it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know rent or something you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or to build wind on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know that there's a deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living in their sleeping in your bed\nAnd you just have to think about that you know and\nYou know it's just it's a way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff or not he wasn't a frat party in there and it was you know babies and\n... and that kind of stuff in there so we want anything like that but you know stuff I don't think we broke anything but stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\n\nDon't we put it this way for Sharon Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second home as a vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that yeah that's a price you pay the rent it out\nAnd all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the cost of your way if you want to rent out we've gotta a lake house we don't rent it out we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a our income\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the ... or weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases they're a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy interest a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going on in the you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to get a condo over knocks for one of the ball game over there and that he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more stuff more repair them and you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich from then you'll be fine\nThat's been about five years of investments that have kind of held um that that small their money into having about Seventy thousand dollars or so and cash for cash is ...\n... very well done sir you are way ahead of the curve congratulations well what we teach folks is to follow a plan we call the baby steps we think it is the shortest raped shortest route to wealth\nOkay and a baby step one is a thousand dollar saved too is debt free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fund of\nThree to six months of expenses you've obviously done that\nFor five and six you do simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement is maybe step for five is kids college doesn't apply here six is pay off our surely so that brings us into our question\nNow the way I look at paying off your house with a non retirement non\nEmergency fund money which is sounds like if I heard you right you've got fifty five K. in miscellaneous investments that some non retirement and not your emergency fund is that right\nTrack and you ... eighty on your house did you say is that right yup okay and um the uh the way I look at that is ... if you owed thirty thousand bucks on your house\nWould you go borrow\nFifty thousand to invested in stocks and bonds and my answer will quickly be no\nYeah and in essence if you do a column of your assets and a column of your liabilities or what your own and what you owe that's called a balance sheet you probably heard that before and uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the same mathematical effect\nAs if you had borrowed on your home to buy the stocks\nThat I pay\n... ... if we don't if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to\nThree to six months of expenses it you know twenty three thousand or twenty two thousand or whatever was might be a little sick I might pull that down to ten or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty with a ten thousand dollar emergency funds\nSo I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that and I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you know that house paid off in a year what's the house worth\nA it's only about a hundred and ...\n... twenty two years old with a paid four hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nYou know and then take and then you take that old payments used to have in all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and you use that that fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing it plus here's what's kinda weird you've made ...\nYou unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head and a ... you know what else will happen is that you remember when you signed the mortgage did you feel emotional weight\nOr ... I started off with I've actually already refinanced once\nA week and I mean when you did the original deal the first time and you went from debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on that oh that\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years or ... yeah\nThat's what I'm Talking about that because there's more going on here than simple math there's complicated math that entails risk\nAnd and even even relational and I'm spiritual things the borrower is slave to the window that's the way you felt Thirty years I Can't stand this I got to get rid of this well the same thing will happen in reverse but on the positive side of hey when you don't have any\n... no wait nothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play it changes the way you do you're investing it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both\nThat both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so yeah I don't get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take you five years this time I'm much he got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean you mathematically relation Lee spiritually emotionally\nWhen you're free you just do better\nAnd you just make better choices and you're already making really good choices so all of that to say yes I Would cash out the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten\nOr that doesn't quite get us there so you got to lean in and out of your budget and cash flow out the rest of that thing and finish it up within\nYou know four or five months the debt free on this whatever it is six months whatever it takes and then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up that emergency fund a little bit fine but then kick those investments in the butt get them going again and you will prosper you are on your way sir so honored to talk to you very very well done\nWine is an Indianapolis Hi Wayne welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThanks Dave I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it's really made a difference a mile I\nWill thank you ... today\nWell my wife and I have been a leading the life of gives out for about two years now and uh where are you pretty much become that for other than our student loans which we're working on and then we ended up getting a now I got pregnant with her first child\nReally good question thanks for joining us from Lawrence in Dallas texas Hi Lauren how are you\nToday my or taking my call my pleasure how can I help\nOn so back in two thousand it hey I'm a graduate from college and I purchased a car at the get her name\nTold me that I is it a gift under her name\nHas alligator exactly exactly okay told me once I got a four time got that was like a flaw or restaurants like hey Lenny that actually passed over the payment at okay without getting myself into jail\nPayments are included in paying payments Oh nice okay right after the story sucks [laughter]\nSo I'm now at three years later a or as lash ear see I got my job\nAnd she gave me the payments and I realize that even just now started off in the corporate world I don't make enough to to pay credit card so I'm like oh I I like LA that caught the NFL I Know\nYour diet line that I Need to get rid of the car I don't know how to go about doing that at the end you know it's not in our our off though thick yet and it also takes so\nShe mentally unable don't act like is she mentally unable to make legal decisions\nNo she's not mentally eight she's mentally able she has a higher standard if their credit so that's why he was able to get the car and you know get painted actually they\nCrash so here's the thing she tried to do a nice thing for you and she did it in a really stupid way and so now you're both stuck\nRight because you she ... she owes more\nIt's more on what your credit at all your ... involved it's her credit that we're worried about we want to do a nice thing for her 'cause she's sick and not able to deal with this show or what she probably knows more on this car than it is worth I'm guessing\nThey care for it it out I think Kelly Blue books that he was a word around at close to twenty thousand it sent me on the left\nIt's worth close to twenty thousand what is owed against it\nI Want to throw like ... like pointing out now okay or does your aunts have any money\nShe retired but not really so she couldn't afford it\nOkay All right well I'm sure you guys are in a pinch us is very uncomfortable because there's what needs to happen she needs to sell this car\nBecause her niece can't pay the payments\nAnd when she sells the car she's going to lose seven thousand dollars on it what are we going to do with that\nDo you feel obligated to pay that\n\nYou're not legally are way I Do\nThink that I mean I Know what I Do get because I said it I Know yeah I like it or not\nThey offer yeah how old are you\nI'm twenty five it what do you make\nA choice without or\nShellfish\nOK well someone's going to find the seven thousand dollars to put with the twenty thousand dollars that you get from your that she gets from her buyer to pay the car off so that the buyer can get the title and that's\nWhich doesn't sound really fair to be about credit yeah that does that doesn't sound like a good plan to make because she's going to end the I got sick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "05"}
