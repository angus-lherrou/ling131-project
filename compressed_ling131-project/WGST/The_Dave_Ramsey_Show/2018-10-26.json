{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Yeah politics is politics has been ugly it's ugly are now but it's always been this way and it is hard to figure out who you who you align with in some cases because\nThere's a lot of candidates for a lot of different offices and you have to figure out what district you're in which Kennedy ... you know which things you even get to have a say in and then of those people who are the ones you aligned with and a\nLot of people will do if they're going to go at all will just go and you know pulled the tick you know pull the lever so to speak for all ours are all these because they don't know but this is cool so we were talking to her all the all of that and it was like oh well you know they used to and he explained the whole I side with thing\nAnd I think this is a solution we need to send us out to like everyone who's thinking it's too complicated\nAnd the thing I like the most about it is so depending on how politically engaged or informed you are doesn't really matter 'cause like one of the questions right here 'cause I have it up so should the U.S withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement you if you don't even know what that is there is a learned more button yeah to discuss the news on the resource it's great okay you can answer a lot of\nQuestions I feel like I have just been enlightened [laughter] I'm excited about that so I'm looking at the questions on here now and it's pretty clear you just put your you know ask you all the stuff social issues global issues national issues local\nYou put in what you think or to your point you do a little research and it'll tell you vote\nFor and you can actually waited different I Know we like to talk about you know one issue voters and things like that once you answer the question it asks you how important is this to you oh there you go to import at least important kind of in the middle so you know if you really could\nGive a junk less about you know climate stuff you can put lesser released or just don't answer them but the economy is important you put most important on those\nRandom question like I'm scrolling through right now I'm under economic issues right so here are some of the questions should the government make cuts to public spending in order to reduce the national debt yes no or other stances um should the U.S raised taxes on the rich\nYes now other stances and then I think it should ask you argue rich I mean that's just\nThat's just me I'm just that's just me being silly a\nShould the government raise the federal minimum wage um you know then there's domestic policy issues and you just get the answer these and then it helps you figure out who is aligned with you I Love that and all the social issues are there a pro life pro choice a gay marriage they're all they're\nIn the best part is down towards the bottom to have a local issues you can type in your ZIP Code and it will give you certain thing how relating to your local situation\nYeah I'm so doing now is probably going to say like you\nYou are you should you just need to leave the country [laughter] are you sure there have been joined by island somewhere with her name on it you should just go there or in any case\nI sighed west dot com and just Google I side with Georgia and again get yourself a millennial if you don't already have once\nAll your politically disengaged friends like most of mine just point them to the website yeah it don't force them into a chair make them take the test\nThey also I think it would be very funny if people like my age and older started walking up to random millennials and be like hey I don't have a millennial in my life would you be my millennial\nPretty loving generation I think we're like the second coming of the of the what what was it like if he if our children are like the second coming of them so if you come up and you're nice about it with a smile on your face most of us will probably say sure right but\nThen at the second question is offending the millennial says we'll do this like a little scared than the millennial says well why why did evil I Need someone to explain you know some of the Internet stuff to me and help me figure out you know there are any Internet resources for voting there'll be like a [laughter]\nMaybe maybe just mind millennia\nAnd that's where my ... my fellow millennials listening right now we need to get our other millennials up and up on the stuff that\nThat is really cool I I really liked that I think that's really really a cool website and a good resource Oh thank you for that new guy neck um but that's the point you know honestly if you were even\nJust to Google around a little bit you can find this information and I also suggest just as a side note when you are trying to research candidates whether it's um you know locally nationally now or two years from now\nUm that you go to the source like you can read news articles and that's great do that but also go to the source read the person's platform that what they're presenting for themselves right like don't don't just read about them read their own\nYou know I'm words about what they stand for and I say that in part because it makes me hearken back to like the high school you know president of the student body kind of elections\nYou know in those scenarios you knew the people obviously so it was a little bit different but they ran the campaign or whatever they thought was important and you listen to them and I I I Want that you know let let people at least at least try to understand what they say they're for before you\nUm get swayed by negative ads or party posturing or whatever else whatever else it as having I really suggest everybody do um if you have a minute\nIs go to the Democratic party official website and the Republican Party official website\nAnd read their platforms read there the main both of them have um pages on our sights that just list almost kind of endless farm with very little detail just a high level less of what they stand for\nAnd I guarantee you you will be surprised by what some of them include and don't include\nUm and I think that really matters\nIt does because we start defending either one or the other of the party thinking we know what they're all about and we really don't\nYou know I also think you go ahead\nI was just going to say you know I remember a couple of weeks ago on the show you pull back up and I looked at because I admittedly aligned more with the Democratic party like you do in looking at some of the things on the platform I looked at the moment\nI didn't know that yeah and I don't really know how I totally feel about that right but I wasn't aware right\nAnd I feel like that's the case on both sides you know there are some things on the right that I\nHundred percent agree when but then there are some a hundred percent deal breakers on that side for me and I think the reason why I tend to lean laugh is because\nWhile there are some things on the left I don't agree with there's nothing that's an absolutely deal breaker for me on that list there are some things I'm like I I wouldn't choose that right but the things I Do agree with are important to me and that's where you know the I side with and getting into the priorities matters to write\nUm you know and I still argue that you you have to also understand that you're not going to get your weight nope no candidate is going to be exactly aligned with you\nSo you also have to pick the one that's as close as possible and also does not include something that will horribly offend you write like that's part of it too and I think that's where we got into trouble in the in the last election with Trump is that there were a lot of people who were choosing the financial stuff\nUm the financial gain the tax reform or the less regulations of businesses could you know achieve more uh and they chose all of that and chose to ignore the stuff that could have been really I'm ugly to them I don't necessarily I'm a little worried about how he's going to be on the global stage\nHe'll bring the right people in around them so I don't need to worry about it I'll just focus on the financial or are you know I Am socially liberal but the financial stuff is more important to me so I'm just gonna let that go and assume that nothing dramatic will happen in that camp for the four or eight years that he's in office so um but that's why I say go read the um the party platforms\nBecause I think it's it it might it might or might open your eyes a little bit where it'll be like Yeah Yup got it knew it yup got it\nRight which I'm sure it happens to plenty of people who can't do something like this but what I thought totally cool which just sort of reinforces that your beliefs are founded you know you kind of knew what you were talking about a little bit\nYeah also I still say and we talked about this several weeks ago but this is also important as we head into this election season or rent it now but until election day is the idea that you know you can have a big tent party\nAnd and by the way when you read their platforms on both sides they do\nThere is no way any one person cares about all of the things on those less right so in theory you could have a big tent party where you could have certain Republicans that are you know very far right and very much into Christian conservativism and others that are you know equally important to the party who are more moderate\nAnd care more about fiscal issues and\nYou know or whatever the case may be I mean there are Republicans who are pro choice not many but there is to um I mean there's literally two innocent um you know but to those those things should be okay because we should be able to compromise that should be part of what's happening both with in the parties\nUh and within the coalitions and then also across party lines maybe if we all voted we could for some more compromise what imagine that\nI Do want to just remind you one last time before at a time that tomorrow is the last Saturday to early vote so if you need a Saturday please

just sit for a little while if you want to park it in something that rides the market while you're ah when I'm saving money at that stage it baby step seven which I obviously amount than what I Do sometimes I'll just throw extra cash a guy like that into a simple S. and P. five hundred fund\nA it's a no load fun and it's going to do whatever the market does so it could go down before a pull it out but most of the time it goes up I mean you could lose a little bit on it but um at least is going to ride the market and you know mark is doing real as hot right now I don't know how long it'll be hot but that's\nThat's what you're facing and so you know you could park that three hundred in there and and you know you might make twenty thirty grand on it while you're waiting to buy your first Fisher real estate\nBut I'll just I'll throw a certain amount every month into an S. and P. and when it gets big enough I use it to buy real estate with\nAnd um that's how I Do it but I mean you can do whatever you want to do if you want to set a certain amount and mutual funds permanently you probably want to try to beat the ... with those funds but the um the money you're kind of just holding

when we got these kids we're in a contract for deep I'm trying to find a bank that would be willing to give us the money for a non traditional long because we were first time homebuyers on an

kids in their adopted now they were ... completion\nYeah what could you sell the house for right now as it is\nI'm Glad we could probably get to fix the for it and you and you are one on one Seventy that's pretty tempting and I'll\nGo rent something in clean this mess up\nMy my only concern with that is because trust me I've many a night thinking about that is our kids that we had we have five kids total we have two biological and tree adopted our three adopt a kid all have TPS be reactive attachment just some very\nSerious mental stuff but they're working in fighting through and I just I'm afraid that move and a shift up in their life again is just gonna\nI'm afraid that the parents being stressed out and never home because they're working all the time to clean up a hundred and forty eight thousand dollars where the stupid that's going to cause these kids' problems\nAnd that's kinda where where yeah I work a lot yeah I'll bet and you don't have a life\nWas this crap owns you something's going to give you need to decide what's going to give or it's going to give without you deciding\nIt's going to blow up on your dude\nI'm Sorry you didn't make the call I think you need to sell your house and I think the kids will deal with that temporary shift and change much easier than they will deal with two years up to three years of high stress in the household\nAnd you never be in there [noise] yeah\nI'm no I'm no kid expert I just raise three but ... and I never dealt with the stuff you're dealing with and I understand they're very sensitive and I get all of that on a I'm not trying to be on feeling I'm just trying to say I'm a rip the band died off guy and I think even with the kids with that situation that might be the case\nI think you guys don't want to sell the house goes far to kill him a dream of the rehab but the house too emotionally\nAnd so I'm On blame that on you and your wife I I I'm gone man I I'm\nJust how you're you're working on a house you're trying to run a business you've got kids with the issues that you've adopted you got a house full of different things coming at you at one time you need to get a few things off your plate\nI mean if you lived in a house that you didn't have to work on and you didn't have any that we\nGot rid of two of your three huge stress or share and I think girls quality of life will go way up\nSounds really appealing to me it by the way it's stupid house there's houses on every corner they'll get you know the house [noise] but you guys have painted yourself in the corner you're gonna get pain on your shoe ...\nThey just decide which one you know and so\nThat's one thing you can do that then you lose you saw her car or you saw a bunch of your equipment that you've got and start the process of cleaning this out but who am I not going to pay is not a formula that takes you good places in five years when you've got some other options so I'm\nI I Love your heart I Love what you're trying to do for those kids that are messed up and you're loving on him and trying to help them turn their life around and in the middle of that that you're you're just you're good people man\nYou're my kind of folk I like yeah I Wish I could just wave a wand and make this go away\nBut if I knew I'm going to concentrate on these kids and the quality of life in my family can him over the next five years and if I don't have this debt and I don't have um the stress of working all the time to get rid of the day that all of a sudden I've got my quality of life back\nAnd if the one thing I did give up was this house mess um\nOh and by the way I don't have to work on the house what ... what hours I Am home are actually spend time with these children there stood out swinging a hammer when I'm at home um I just think there's you you just put you put your Superman Cape a brother he turned Seventy three things at once I don't think you can do it all\nAnd I think that's showing up in your numbers\nBut um I think you're good man I think he loves people and like your drawn do the right thing and you try and love your family oil but I'm if I'm you I'm selling that houses just a stupid house you can get you know you get out of debt you get your business built up you bring up a big pile of cash you can buy you another house and two or three years\nAnd you know settle in there and you're just about the dream of homeownership is not off the table the dream of doing a rehab while I have three kids with ... D in my house\nThese things just don't mix\nYou know it doesn't mixers too much going on this thing up till stressed out just talking about all of it and I don't have to deal with it so I see what you're facing I'm so sorry but that's what I Would do and that's what the shows about what I Would do so I can do whatever you wanted to your grownups but I'm not a\n... who you're not gonna pay is not the answer\nWho you're not you are going to pay mom and dad 'cause you're going to do that out of guilt and you are going to pay the Irish are they going to come take stuff um you put the student loans or hardship but for all you can decide not to pay the credit cards but eventually you got to get this mess cleaned up\nAnd it's going to come back to roost Anya so I'm Glad you're in financial ... and if I can help you further you call me back anytime Lewis was in Palm Springs California Hi Louis how are you\nGood how are you did better than I deserve what's up\nUh I'm trying to advise my mom she she uh\nShe did it at the EU and she is out of debt except her mortgage\nUm shoot cat Nineteen thousand dollars cash in the bank\nUm ... when she\nWould be getting shown from a an investment she's trying to a cash out of the potentially will have about twenty five thousand dollars cash I looking at her budget I figure about twelve thousand you wouldn't be a good three to take my emergency fund okay\nThe ... she got about a potentially Thirteen thousand dollars extra cash it in three years old\nMhm she liked retire at sixty five ...\nShe has a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in a poor when it's a mhm um I just got her set up to do a automatic withdrawals into a rock irate show ... that thing out at sixty five hundred a year mhm\nShe's right now for ... she'll be investing Fifteen Percent of our ink on into retirement mhm um I projected with that with a Fifteen Percent out of it I get about ten percent to be a little conservative I figure she'll be at about eight hundred thousand or ... not\nGoing to force feed the first year off with some of it which I might go ahead and dropped fifty five hundred on this year's raw\nUm are sixty five hundred which you can do at her age on this huge drop out of it and then and then jump forward and structure structure withdrawals for the Roth after the first of the year that's probably what I was there was some of it and I'm probably throwing the rest of it at the house\nBaby steps it because you're doing for five six five done to fly\nThat's right where you are and uh but you know you're right on the right track your your barking at the right trees here\nAnd so I think you're doing the right kind of stuff that's how I Would do with the question man like you were joining us [noise] that Bush is our number ... show in the books and [noise]\n\n\nBlake the production officer for the show\nThe model year in various rules on it ...\nAnd is this just gotten finger on our meeting twenty dean forget him as aren't being America's favorite pick on drugs you know\nIf you will ... assume run over Fifteen hundred numbers are being twenty you shouldn't be male or move over sixty five hundred dollars for you to be on every you know see the the nine thousand dollars off\nEnd of the model year means the guns are huge civil and again because these are these are moving here millionaire where were these costs less yourself ... highway Ninety two non Lyme disease you're really knocked\nInjury is not much longer several years for a living you select the fringes of the year in every city on sale now and certainly not\nTo where we want it to be how do yeah I I Want to make more money okay well right now it it it facilitates me working and working on our future plans\nOkay All right I'm ... and so this this um move down in house you're moving more than half of house uh it sounds like a multi ... even if you rent for six months or something in our moved back in this price range or you know it wouldn't if you're worried wouldn't make any sense um and\nAnd so this move down to half of the house is probably a three to five year plan\n\nOkay All right because you're going to do something to get your income back up a without having to completely sacrifice your soul at work I get that part I'm not asking you to do that but I also there's a there's an equation out there that's floating around in the culture that I'm kind of working against\nSubtly and that is is that in order to be happy you have to make less money and that's not an equation I'm going to participate in\nAgree because usually means that you just didn't go do something that God designed you to do because you were afraid\nAnd I don't participate in fear so um but again I'm not trying to destroy your family or anything like that this was a sizable step back for you all in order to take big steps forward as long as you don't take this sizable step back and settling on and make it your life\nThen I'm cool with that that's kind of where I'm saying so I Hope that helps a good question and a courageous decision on your part to do that James is with us in Rochester, Minnesota how James how are you\nI'm pretty good thank you for taking my call sure what's up I'm\nAh [noise] well like I got married last year got your book is a proven ever heard of it before that and then ah\nI'm On board my wife has ... so she's kind of just

I feel that's probably not how she feels at all\nOkay ... where I'm 'cause that's not a good way to have a relationship but you should not make decisions together based on who makes the most money has the most which that's not a good plan especially when one of use thirty and the other one's twenty two\nOkay so you got a little more life experience could we agree on that\nThat's all right okay good and that's not to say she's in up to twenty two but in this case uh apparently she is so uh in in this particular subject so how are we going to do this year's started talking about what\nWe need to do we don't need to go to the mall we don't need to spend so much money we need to get out that you started talking about what after you read my book instead of talking to her about how and why\nYou

generously to causes what would we do if we had a million dollars well what's the shortest path to get to that dream\nOf being able to do those things the shortest path is to live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else the shortest path is to be dead free and living on a plan in adults devise and plan and follow it children do what feels good\nIt's a sign of maturity

us on the art\nWow yeah like like for much\nWay like June okay All right\nSo like six months plus or minus All right um\nOkay it doesn't matter much um the thing I Would do though is if you put the money into a savings account instead of paying an extra on the house\nAnd you have to like yourself I don't know that shows like metal yourself a letter that comes June first says if the house was not up for sale put this money on the house\nOkay so in other words if you waffle on this decision and the money gets spent on bass boat it wasn't a good plan\n[noise] okay 'cause that's what happens to

okay\nSignals from the boost that um\nWell you got a big well you got a big pile of an emergency fund and you really sound like you've hit some things and I obviously this is an emotional issue and that I mean it recently and I and I mean a lot to you\n[noise] sorry to interrupt the reason why I'm nervous because I'm not able to build it back up as high as it started so it makes me nervous to take a big chunk out\n... how big is the ... ... about a third so twenty grand that other sixty yes okay All right\nWell the emergency fund is there in case there was\nObviously an emergency captain

children and how old are you thirty nine okay All right um\n\n[noise] there's ... there's two things that are bump into my head and they're ... they're they're both are working against each other okay so I'll just say I'm Out loud I'll just say okay let's just process this together a little bit okay thing one is I tell folks not to use their emergency fund except for emergencies\nOkay thing too is this is very very very important\nTo you obviously it it is and uh I mean it's it's and and you have a a window of time you know uh so I guess what\nI'm going to do is I'm going to shop around and and make sure I've gotten all the possible ways to pull this off there's twenty grand the best most efficient most reasonable most safe\nWay is or a Fifteen grand methodology is they're thirty five grand methodology is or other things that I 'cause I don't know anything about this at all um I mean other than the obvious to you know the high level understanding of it but I'm\nBut I'm going to start going to gather more information anytime I'm buying anything for twenty grand I'm going to learn a lot and you may have already done all that but I'm going to I'm going to really push it on the research always the more options you have ... when making a decision the better decision you always make you follow me during that time I'm also going to just be piling up cash like crazy\nLike my hair was on fire let's just keep adding an adding an adding an addict but the other thing that comes into my mind is forty thousand might be an adequate emergency fund for you\nAnd that's the juxtaposition this is not an emergency\nWe can say that for sure but I feel like I feel like it it feels like it it is but it's not an emergency it's not a a it's an unexpected event it's an elective\nLuxury that's Barry very very emotional and very very important ... and that's a reasonable statement but but I I think if I'm In your shoes I might declare forty thousand my emergency fund\n\nAnd then I'm okay 'cause I Want to catch most of what would come your way what kind of an emergency would come your way that would be more than forty thousand and extended unemployment will be the only one that would\nRight\nI mean ... ... ... I mean I assume you've got good healthcare coverage\nIdeal but they won't cover it because\nI don't like talking about that I'm saying if you had a major health issue\nYou know that that would that would eat up forty grand but it wouldn't really wouldn't I mean you to get through forty grand if you got you know the ... co pay that's a lot and I thought that'd be a million dollar expense you know so I'd be very and I think you're okay at forty grand\n\nAnd if you declare that then we don't have to declare there's an emergency I'm I'm just process and that's with 'cause I'm trying to figure out what to do it\n[noise] okay um\nAnd if you want a superior emergency fund backup later you can do that but you don't have to feel like you've violated a ... a principled process to do this then\nOkay that makes me feel better as a logical to you I think so yeah I think though\nHave you got a good friends or family or pastor or something like counseling you and walking with you on the just the whole process on this and the decision making and everything\nYou know [laughter] not doing this in a vacuum writer so do I. [laughter] I've been told I don't have to worry about it but I Am [laughter] bye\nBye good counsel was that what you're saying\nNot necessarily good counsel but friends and family say oh you know\nYou're in front of me and I are wary about who could crap I'm Talking about somebody that loves you enough to look in your eyes and go really seriously what are you doing here I mean our our yes you should do this you know but it's not just a I mean if somebody really thinking this through with you're not just casually over coffee going\nGood accountability good counsel in the multitude of council there's safety and that's what I'm looking for but I don't I don't hear anything holding me back here in your situation\nVery interesting question though very interesting situation thanks for calling in and we appreciate you being a listener but Rami is with us in Columbia South Carolina isn't rummy rummy\nIt threw me high romey high how can I help\nYeah I um I wanted to reach out to you I was recently cold call and buy a kind of a a major insurance provider and they were trying to sell me on a some insurance products so I'll let you know term insurance and are with ability which I agreed with and that I needed\nAnd um but I don't like the prices they quoted me were rather high so I went ahead and you know reached out to one of your recommendations and whatnot and got some uh some other quote that were a lot better ... and ah and reach back out to them and mentioned it to them and they had mentioned yeah those are those are kind of like\nThat those insurance companies aren't good their um their their ratings are high financial you want to go with the home or hire expensive uh insurance companies are going to they're going to be\nAround in the next Twenty years you know and I'm going to show you felt like oh okay um so I Need to buy that you basically described as the Mercedes of ensuring you need to buy you said if you don't want to be in like a you know a Chevy yeah how do I wanted to get your thoughts on that [laughter]\nWell um that's an absolutely ludicrous way to solve the objection okay there are there are financial ratings for life insurance companies if they do not meet a certain level of financial criteria the state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance there\nSo if they're almost broke the state will let them sell in your state\nAnd I have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency you to do that number one number two if you have terminal life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nUnless you're sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more insurance it's kinda like if your car did you check the financial stability of your car insurance company lord no [laughter] right now I go broke you just go get another one\nYou know if you've got a restive and progressive goes broke you just get a different one you don't think about this progressive have the money to pay my claim\nYou know but you can look I Am best ratings of someone at Zander insurances website and they are all financially solvent as much as this group that sell any of this stuff that's a that's a complete line of BS Ron Rome is what it was\nOkay well that makes me feel a lot better 'cause I yeah\nI went ahead and when will be delivered expensive option anyways they say well I wouldn't the guys like I wouldn't do that from my family ah yeah you another hundred and\nAnd by the way you called called me yeah [laughter] right right yeah that's when they called call you that's all just one thing right there but [laughter]\nOh I Would say I could get it up to thirty eight ... the\nEarth or you said thirty eight a minute ago\nYeah well I'm just trying to do a quick math uh\nRight now here's the thing I don't want your house payment to be much more than a fourth of your take home pay is about a third of your take on by today but I think when I had my four oh one K. back and you're pretty helpful late jamming on those four O. one K. it sounds like\nSo I'm going to temporarily stop the four oh one K. your house is not the problem you're toys or your problem and your student loan is your problem\nA hundred thousand dollars worth of toys when you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year as backward guy because they're all going down in value shouldn't have toys stuff with wheels and motors that add up to more than about fifty percent of your take on gay or fifty percent of your income now you didn't just cut your income down\nSubstantially when mama came home I got that part\nBut still you were over you were at a hundred percent even when she was working\nMhm so you got too much tied up and things going down in value\nThat's a bigger problem than your houses and you're staring down the barrel of a fifty thousand dollar debt that you need to clear I Would say you ought to clear that and it's probably going to take your three years in the setting if you stop everything vacations eating out and for one gays and sell a toy or to it's probably still gonna take a weapon on which toy yourself\nBut um you know I'm getting all this debt\nBecause it hasn't benefitted you number one number\nTwo I'm getting out of that but even if it had benefitted you even if you got a fifty thousand lawyer raises because of it I use that fifty thousand to clear that that the first thing first order of business but I really don't think your house was the problem I probably would sell some toys or no I Know I Would sell some toys I shouldn't say that so lightly\nUm that's where your problem is you've got too much invested in depreciating assets\nAnd on your houses it's generally okay I'll temporarily would stop my four oh one K. and I would beat on this debt with a hammer until it's gone\nBut I Want you to do once you're rolling stock and stuff with motors and it to be less than half your annual income now if you say your income coming up very dramatically in a very short order and you want to hold a couple of these toys or something that's fine but still you need to keep it around fifty percent or less a because you just got too much juice tied up and stuff that's going the wrong way it's all going down\nYou look up and that hundred dollars' worth stuff's gonna be worth fifty thousand about a blink of an eye\nAnd then scratch your head and wonder why you're broke you know you got stuff going the wrong way so\nYeah I I think you I'm probably got a pass on something that you thought we were going to show which was the house\nAnd you got surprised by me Sonya toys but I you know whatever you want their toys but that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes and oh by the way I Am a boat and a card guy I like anything with a motor and it just about but that but the problem with all of it is it goes down in value\nAnd so it needs to be a small percentage of your world\nRob is with us in Bend Oregon Hi Rob how are you\nBreathe Dave thank you so much for all the stuff you and your organization view um I've got a question I have traveled the pound boy of employment I've gone from jobs where I had to wear maintaining two jobs that were possible careers\nTo owning my own job and now I'm at a point where I'm starting a business and I wanted to be employee base [noise]\nBut my question is for that\nNew one is an employee based business\n[noise] well that that's one where I don't do all the work I have people have people doing the work for me\nCool that's better than you are just doing all the work and honing your job I got you\nOkay right very gray so now I'm going to land not now I Hope to work on your business not just a minute okay good\nWreck and so when it comes to compensation for the employees is it better to give them more money or or benefits or how do you balance that\nWell when your brand new and small you don't have a lot of choices the benefits of are ridiculously expensive\nAnd so um you know like for instance health insurance when when you have less than ten people you they can buy health insurance cheaper than you can for them\nSo I'd rather just get more money and let them do what they want to wear this for they buy health insurance through their spouses work\nThat kind of like ... different benefits are very difficult for the business without that are twenty people are less but you can give them other benefits that are not corporate tied benefits like treating them good\nA tree in my family being there when the baby is\nArson and flowers or the ...\nYou can treat them like human beings they don't get treated that way with\nThis or whatever injuries [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die and that does happen\nTheir wellbeing would be
