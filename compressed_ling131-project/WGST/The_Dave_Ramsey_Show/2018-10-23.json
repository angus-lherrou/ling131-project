{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Chinese spies were able to get their claws essentially into almost thirty\nDifferent U.S companies by compromising the American technology supply chain and getting their ships\nInto some of the hardware at companies that are not Chinese manufacturers but rather American manufacturers end up those chips then therefore would allow\nHackers on whomever to access said devices and do a variety of different things whether it's spy on you or get into your software steal your identity whatever the different things are that hackers can and want to do [noise]\nPart of a what they said in this Bloomberg story which is pretty extensive and we will posted on our show and it's if you want to read the whole story or is that in the thirty companies named there where Amazon and apple\nSo wanting you to um well listen I don't know what their motives were so I Can't say what they wanted you to do but I think the response\nIs for people who are Amazon and apple customers is two of their hardware up their devices or whether you're talking about uh the Amazon Fire sticks or Alexa devices or you're talking about iPhones and iPads and computers for Apple\nA is to feel like maybe you can't trust those devices\nUm so that's that\nControversy controversy as I said started to bubble up earlier this month now the reporter who wrote the piece for Bloomberg says I think it was co written by two reporters and they say that they got this information through quote extensive interviews with government and corporate sources\nWell since that time a lot of the\nCorporate executives who've been named in the story ah companies So Apple and now Amazon\nHave come out and said this is just flat out wrong\nIt started last week when Apple CEO Tim Cook came out and called for Bloomberg to retract the report saying that they said happened uh Tim Cook sat down for an interview with both speed news and talked about this he said this is a quote from him this did not happen\nThere's no truth to this and eventually in that same interview again calling for Bloomberg to retract the story well earlier today Amazon\nGot on board with Tim Cook and said\nVia I Believe Twitter Tim Cook is right Bloomberg story is wrong about Amazon to [noise] uh\nThis is coming from Andy ... who is a Amazon Web services executive oh I guess that would also be partly where set equipment could be part of Amazon Web services so um it's an interesting drama here and the question really is\nWhich is true because so far\nThe way unless and I'm not checked since we came on the air but as of I when I was prepping for the show a earlier today Bloomberg has not retracted the story so\nThey're sticking with it for now in fact I don't believe they've had any comment at all since the story came out but the report itself does site Seventeen unnamed sources\nAnd so there's something there somebody saying something that said\nThere's been no officially compromise hardware that's bubbled up nobody has found these chips allegedly that are that exist so kind of interesting um this is one of the story that I find fascinating because\nIf it didn't happen I think about how easy it might be to make something like that happen doesn't seem like\nThe beginning of like a modern day bonds maybe you're right though I think\nThere are some there there which is why the story was written and why people have flocked to it for even fake news has to be kind of plausible right when we started the show out talking about lies and talking about President Trump and some of the the tall tales he's been telling and many\nOf them have a nugget of truth some of them are just flat out made up but there's some colonel some small seed of truth\nOr plausibility at the very least right I mean you certainly can except that you know that when there's an immigrant group of immigrants heading this way ah you know from Central America that there could be criminals and the group you can believe that right or you can believe that it wouldn't be that hard for\nUm someone from the middle east you had a bad intentions to get themselves mixed in with that group and walk on into the country that way it's not impossible to believe that and in part because there have been stories in which that happened in the past\nAnd so you know the idea that a Chinese company or Chinese companies or or Chinese or actors in particular that our government affiliated cut in some way\nInfiltrate the supply chain because so much of it does come from you know so much of our technology and our wasn't so much of our stuff and general comes from China so the idea that\nThey could put something in the supply chain that had\nYou know I was like a Trojan Horse that had some way to be bad seems kind of all evil\nSo look I have an obviously spoken to the Bloomberg reporters I don't know you know\nWho their sources where I have no insides any on this at all um but I think it will be interesting to see if Bloomberg decides to uh provide any evidence to corroborate their story if they back this up if they stick with it or if they pull it and are tracked\nAnd you do wonder to you as consumers of technology does is put you off\nUm I have apple products of course I haven't bought anything new in a while so I think mine are safe [laughter] um and same thing with Amazon I have Amazon products avenue or Amazon products honestly because I have a ... billion Alex's running around my house they've taken over um\nMaybe they're maybe the Chinese are listening and reproducing and you are and if and I honestly if the Chinese are listening to me via like staff they get whatever they get [laughter]\nYou know 'cause I live alone and I say all kinds of weird stuff in my apartment by myself I'm In any case I'm joking obviously but it could be serious right depends on where that equipment ends up but it does make the question\nYou know if we whether or not we can trust any maker of technology and how do we really know um that these things are danger free in terms of\nLooking into our lives and and where's that data going and he's getting a hold of it I mean some of it we voluntarily give up but\nThis is not that just goes beyond that right so that's the big difference here um I bet you now the tech\nStocks were down a little bit today the market I've been sort of keeping an eye on the market today because it open down a the ... opened a down four hundred points this morning and it has rebounded a little bit as the day has a warrant on\nBut ah at last check it was still down about two hundred a points which is less than ... percent to sound terrible but to and that's a little bit over a ... percent now\nUm but in any case a lot of that has to do with um some fears about China and about the trade war with China or in some global uncertainty on the whole and tech stocks in particular a have gone down a bit and that drives everything down because it's all about the tech stocks these days they're just kind of interesting\nTo uh look at a piece of news like that that for our\nPurposes is essentially uncorroborated now may be true but\nIt's all there is no evidence it's all from unnamed sources there's NO NAME sources there's no physical evidence that we as consumers of news have seen so just sort of interesting to see how the market is so\nEasily swayed and I understand why a Tim Cook might come out and say something because it probably is some doubt certainly coming from corporate customers um on on a report like this and investors too I'm sure investors are calling and saying it big investors are calling and saying what's the what here\nUh anyway I just thought I Would uh leave you in on that one 'cause I thought it was sort of fascinating but the fake news and the truth and lies the unnamed sources not just in the political world but also in the business world and in the tech role to name one last thing bringing it all back to government you know there are some\nGovernments are arenas in which the technology is so so so so old on purpose because they're afraid if they bring the newer technology in that exactly the kind of thing will happen so somebody has\nTo be really good at vetting this new technology because there should be a way for our government to take advantage of the greatest latest technology including being connected without worrying that foreign actors are going to have access to sensitive government shift so very very interesting\nThere and obviously if more companies that thirty that were named come forward we will let you know even\nNot on a check to see if it comes out we'll let you know on that nowhere officially out of time we will be back tomorrow feed on

I'm slow down and then in March outsourcing trying to figure out what's the deal I was thinking I Need another job and you told somebody on the radio you got to deliver pizzas and I said okay I think I can do that and the\nNights I'm not working I also had a part time job but I could work a second part time job and the nights and weekends and that's what I did I went out on a Wednesday and are way down at a Saturday and by Wednesday I was delivering pizzas ... and I did that um for sixteen and a half months and I you know where\nEvery most days I worked at least two jobs if I was working one job it was kind of a vacation [laughter] um I don't think I ever did three and and at once but I worked a lot\nUm so I and I'm so it paid off my car really quickly and start at 'em and then I had student loans and my credit card and then I Am just past march I got five thousand dollars\nUm forget and I'm from my student loans because I teach I might have had a one school and the balance on my student loans was than seven hundred and\nEighty three dollars I paid it off the next week and I thought that was the best feeling and then it was march of this year and it's you know it's coming up for my birthday and I was really afraid it wasn't going to happen I talked myself it's gonna it's gonna be okay if you don't you're not that free by your birthday\nIt's gonna be okay you'll do it in June it will be fine but on on may thirtieth I when I got paid for June I paid my last two hundred dollars on my credit card on great so and I worked at another about my delivering pizzas um ticket start library to find out later that I just kept\nWhat was your first month delivered from\nFrom the ... um I think it was about\nTwelve hundred dollars I made about in the Fifteen or sixteen months I made about twenty thousand over twenty thousand dollars of and Pete says okay you know how many Russia where I'm bored\nI I Would say you interfering is going to have a low probability of them changing\nA very low probability now if they ask you\nYour opinion now that's starting to say that they're starting to recognize that there's something wrong but right now none of them think anything is wrong with all this craziness and it's crazy and the main is what it is unbelievable dysfunction\nBut I guess you could just sit down and said mom you know enablers are the nicest\nPeople that you'll ever meet mom you're one of 'em you're a nice person nice you're so nice you cannot say no you're so nice that you think about doing things for\nMy sister that you're doing her favor and the actual truth as enablers are not nice people because they actually bring harm\nTo the people that they're enabling because they are enabling they're causing them they're helping them to do things that are bad\nAnd doing things you know not being a fully functioning self supporting adult at thirty eight years old is a bad thing and to enable that to cause that to occur you you've done harm to your daughter\nIf you're listening to me and you're thirty eight year old living in your house that has been there for a long time and you're buying them cars on unless they're mentally deficient in some way\n\nYou are doing them great harm because they have not they have never had to grow the strength of character to stand on their own and when you die they're going to be up a creek\nI mean you built out of trust fund baby here while you were still alive is what you did oh so awful Dan's with us in Charlotte Hi Dan welcome to the Dave Ramsey ship\nOut if there are you doing today better than I deserve sir how can I help you get to hear I actually I have I was I'm twenty five years old I'm when I was born I think three months after I was born in my family gave me theory on mhm um I've had 'em everything mhm\nThey total about four thousand dollars as of march ... double check to the time to sit down and do it but I was curious on your opinion what should I cashed those and and get like liquid\nImmediately them 'cause they're immediately even though the interest rate is ... percent on um\nYeah but don't you have do you have your head no\nNo no I'm actually graduated college ah luckily with no debt my parents helped me and I I I'm\nGood how do you have do you have a um your emergency fund built of three to six months of expense was\nActually just took a hit on my truck a water pump broke okay if I had to\nI Would imagine that that might have to use this money to make sure you had an emergency fund once you've done that is there is any of it left I Would start investing\nAnd move on to what we called baby step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement so but yeah they're they're not\nIt's not a great place to park money long term and it's not a great place to borrow money short term either one so I don't use savings bonds for anything Jesse is with us in Fargo North Dakota Hi Jessie how are you\nAsking\nWhy are you good how can I help [noise] so [noise] I'm debt free and then in my house uh about two months ago a good Mike yeah so my car uh is worth six thousand dollars\nAnd the aging just went out on a couple of days ago ... not good so I I have a seven thousand dollars in my emergency fund right now mhm I'm my I'm deciding do I go out and buy a seven thousand our vehicle\nOr do I spend a three to four thousand dollars to fix my current vehicle\nMhm [noise] okay well the car is probably worth a thousand dollars as it sets salvage right\nCorrect [noise] and so if you can spend two thousand on it that'd be kind a like spending three 'cause you could have got one for it to end it is worth and then you could sell it for six even if you were going to turn around and sell it if you can get it running for two\nThat's probably what I Would do much north of that I don't want to start to think about it but I mean that you know you're going to lose five thousand dollars now or you're going to lose two thousand dollars by fixing it and selling it for six you follow me\nWhen you write so I'm\nProbably fixing fixing it with an old used engine what what happened to the engine\n[noise] um [noise] he ... the mechanics\nSaid that there's something broke and and he doesn't know why it just I was driving it and it just started inquiring and wouldn't go anywhere\nOkay you need a new mechanic\nIs a need to know what's wrong with the car I mean something broke in ... well no kidding\n[noise] in the Asian silicon I don't know I don't know exactly what it is\nI Know you don't know what it is the mechanics ought to be able to tell what it is I mean it it had dropped ... that means that blew it it's what we call blown engine and in that case you're probably going to buy used engine from a junk yard and have someone put it in there and you probably do that for a couple of grand what kind of car is it\nIt's a board at four four okay I mean you could burn a vow of or something and that might be six hundred eight hundred bucks to fix it\nNow he he said he said it blew the engine\nYeah but he didn't even know what it is you're sad\nRight [noise] yeah I'm a union other opinion dirty and find out what happened to Ted gum car but anyway it ... your worst case scenario is you put a used engine from a junk yard in there for a couple of ... and you sell the car\nFor six foot six in your pocket\n... miles to that you've taken out of your emergency fun and then you put some money with that and move up in car a little bit but you're probably going to repair this car before you sell it because you probably will make more money on it that way\nOr even net of an ancient but not not above five thousand dollar in genetic two thousand dollar engine so again a six thousand dollar car does not get a brand new engine in it\nYou put a huge change in from a salvage art in it so what's your daughter\nKelly is with us in Antigua Hi Kelly how are you\nI'm good how are you there better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm okay who am I going to finish they killed and I'm kinda cry how for sale and it's way below market because the lady is trying to sell it quickly her that she can live in your head [laughter]\nAnd we don't have our um downpayment tamed up yet\nAnd you're and you don't even when you're still in debt now where we kind of maybe\nThat you said you were in it I'm Sorry okay so you're not a baby step too but you don't have your emergency fund or your down payment\n[laughter] he said he would be willing to trade kind of owner financing for ... or ... in night and then she would pay the entirety of the ... that we make a haircut and my current Thad Allen called belong at the end of Eighteen what's your household income\nAt that than India here okay cool what's the house selling for one forty seven okay excellent which is so cheap trick here [noise] yeah [noise]\nWell here's here's what I Would do that ... that would work very similar for her okay but I'm just gonna structure it a little bit different I Want you to rent it [noise]\nFor that Eighteen months with an option to purchase it for X prize and the price could even slide down Fifteen hundred a month or if you want and what kind of okay but that's the exact same financial transaction for her but the house doesn't go near name until you have\nAnd you can buy it now the price per thousand is really stupid hot okay but if you had ten of those and had a hundred thousand bucks lined up 'cause you've got some gimmick stuff is better than having no insurance\nOkay but again you're always measuring than back against that what is costing you a what I pay a thousand dollars a year for ten thousand dollars worth of insurance no\nRight no but what I pay a hundred bucks for that policy in this situation maybe\nThat is really high for a forty year old per thousand you see what I'm saying so you know it's just a matter of relative cost to the amount of coverage and and just does it give you sticker shock when you look at it the last thing of course is if you remain uninsured belong term\nYour goal would be the same as it would be for those who have insurance and that is by getting out of bed and building wealthier need for insurance goes way\nOkay because if you have a million dollars in your four one K. and you have no debt house or anything and you die your wife can probably make it\nOkay the medical ... that's called self insured in other words\nOkay with the increase maybe the amount of the emergency fund at all if I'm remain in trouble\nProbably yeah yeah I'm\n... you know just because again she's going to be facing something and that would be part of your\nSelf insured wealth building picture that we're trying to go for long term and we go for that either way I mean the goal is raise the kids get them out of the house so they're not there to have to be fed right a goal is to get the house paid off and everything else paid off and then build a huge mistake if you've done those three things\nYou know somewhere in your fifties or sixties you becomes completely self insured maybe sooner because your wife would be okay if you left behind with a huge pile of money that the kids are going to make sense\nAnd so we work towards that that's why we should just term insurance sister the one of the reasons we should disarm insurance because ... as you were finding out runs out so it's a couple of three suggestions there but I'll tell you this I think within five years you're in trouble\nOkay if you stay clear of the diabetes if if the diagnosis doesn't recur\nSo um but designer can tell you more or it used to be that if you had diabetes or cancer or heart you're just done no no no amount of time but the insurance market has gotten much more sophisticated in analyzing your actual situation case by case and those three things do not\nPermanently mean no life insurance ever\nKnow again you know cancer diagnosis two weeks ago you're not in trouble you know but if you've been cleared cancer free for five years and somebody told you never get insurance you may be able to get insurance\nAnd start to look at that rate it but it won't be you won't get premium prices but you check on that folks you check on that calls and and talk to them no doggie at the ...

I think the budget on my own and I presented it to him and I said you know if you're willing to do that and he wise and and I was like if you're willing to this I Need you to sign this\nThey may they may have signed a contract yeah yeah\nShe knew you know I I was cautiously optimistic yeah um because\nAgain I had kind of lost that hope of I Would ever be out of debt I remember thinking praying like man it'd be nice to just be zero again you know starting a zero\nBut she made me sign it and I was like All right this is going to be like a a diet fat you know the next fad for a diet you get on it for two or three weeks in the next thing and you know you get back to eat and\nUm so she made me sign it and you know I stuck to it you know if I put my name on something that deal yeah big deal that's that's my name that's my word is my bond you know she made me sign it\nAnd she knew that I was very good I like that\nWow that's fun yeah and so there's ... there's zero based budget was born at your house it was an it's game on a monitor the months later we take the are actually quite Nader and the first of all you know and we've done in about five times and for all yeah thank\nYou how may course Dave and I I just take a few moments you know to the to the listeners and and those are you watching them you to coordinate in a few class you don't have to have the answers Dave and his team on the video will have the answers\nYou know it's nine classes over nine weeks just take two hours a week that's Eighteen hours you know instead of binge watching TV and keeping up with the car dash in how 'bout you teach people how to keep up with the Joneses so\nThere were no sign you up at the moment that doing it infomercial regularly scheduled programing [laughter]\nThank you very nice well it is fine because not only to hold you accountable but you get to watch people you really get a front row seat to watch people change their lives\nYeah and those nine weeks you know we've had stories folks come up to us and and and and one of the older gentlemen our class with tears in his eyes just saying you know I've never stuck to anything in my life and\nAnd I'm doing this and it's working I'm seeing I'm going to follow this for a while just it blesses you and your name and now it's more than the facts the figures in the math it it's really changing lives I I Wish we could put our Congress through a free you know\n... ... okay okay [laughter] All right well I think that into the question 'cause out within about ... percent and I'm thinking you know would be on our you when things are going to sound like they're from ... to\n... just a temporary thing it's not that I don't like you investing in four one K. when you get to be there for you easily with no payments in the world except the house payment can put Fifteen Percent of your income\nIn retirement but you know that the problem is you're delaying how long you get there and here's what happens the things that we focus on in our life\nAre the things we're good at are you married\n[noise] no I'm Single I Am twenty nine years old\nOkay are you dating [laughter] yeah ... ... relationship\nYeah I've been married for three years in actually trying to make that next that you know like an X years are\nOkay so have you noticed that while you're in this stage of you're dating\nHow focused you are on her\n[laughter] [laughter] what you focus on you're good at have you noticed that [laughter] that is true yeah and and so you know it it's ... and it's our behavior saying it's a psychological thing it's a spiritual thing it's an emotional thing and that is is that\n... and so it's more that's more of the reason to stop the investing than the math\nTen percent that you're putting in is not going to cause you to get out of debt that much faster but what does he is when you're like all in a mall and like you are with her you're all in ...\nYou're all in okay you're focused you're concentrating\nAnd and that's that's what we want you to do with the debt here for a short period of time I want you to be all and I'm not doing anything I have no life I'm focused on working extra I'm selling stuff I'm not doing anything ... beans and rice rice and beans um get now\nOkay then when we get you out of that that that's what gets people out of that more than the mathematical manipulation so that's what's important about temporarily stopping you're investing when you're in baby step too and that's why we suggest that hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we'll send you a copy of the book the total money make over\nAnd they will help explain that a little bit further for you\nThan a is with us in a City Iowa how do they how are you\nTied eight and a huge fan I think that you and your name in talking to people that my name's I Swear to [laughter] oh I'm Sorry how can I help I'm calling about my um my youngest\nBrother he's Twenty years old and four years ago he came from behind a highway speeds train car road race and my parents are going into litigation for what his future will be like um kids in a job training program kind of just learning basic skills like how much and\nYou know big groceries things like that\nSo many American ... got a brain in area out of this yeah I hear that\nA brain injury a lot of memory is huge and um and positivity and so I'm not really sure how to you know my dad I Do some research and I was like well I'm gonna call Dave and she like he would change about [noise] um there's legal stuff as far as hot as secure at a future for Daniel that he'll be taking care of ...\nI'm Sorry what a sad situation I assume they have an attorney right they do yeah\nMhm and they've assessed the ability to ah that that the person they hit them had insurance and or assets that make it worth chasing them around right\n[noise] yeah it's been a long process over four years just kind of keen what would happen with Daniel or this time ... you know that the effects of this accident\nWell there's a\nI mean there there's not a magic thing but a a a good attorney in this situation should be able to help you run the numbers out that basically has a you know the the accident has taken away his earning ability for the next sixty years\nMhm that's a very expensive\nThing that he is lost that they need to pay him for\nMillions and millions of dollars\nMhm is what he would have learned in his working lifetime is now gone\nYeah and so to offset that due to the accident is the liability of the person that caused the accident\nAnd you don't have to be an attorney to know that okay and so the calculation of that I'm ... and ... you know could we get a big enough lump sum that it that a lump sum invested causes a you know Daniels income to never be a problem again\nMhm and so if you take a million dollars and invest it and then you know as an eighty thousand to a hundred thousand dollar income the rest of his life\nAs an example you see what I'm saying\nAnd um and that's probably not enough but I mean that's that's the that's an example of a calculation to offset what he would have potentially earned in his working lifetime because that was stolen from him\nBecause of this accident and uh I'm not being angry towards the person that I have no idea the conditions are the accident but that's just the liability that that person then their insurance company has as ... as a result of law okay and your attorney's already told you all of that that some basic thing\nIt's like business law one on one okay the very first one learns that kinda stuff so um\nYou know once you do that then you're saying we're we're replacing his lost income and certainly than medical bills in addition to that\nAnd uh and medical bills would include any kind of job training we can do to help him have a quality life skill and you know anything we do increases quality of life going forward right\nMhm but there's not a magic number to figure this out is just a ... there's a calculation you can do to estimate these things and you know all of those things added together makes the\nUh you know the the settlement negotiation with the insurance company go on now they may be in there probably is um limits to the insurance coverage and there are limits not to liability but to the assets that the person has let's say this person had basically no money\nAnd the insurance companies on the hook for half a million dollars you can negotiate the rest of your life and you're not getting more and a half million dollars because guys broke and you can't get blood out of Iraq\nOkay and so you sue him into oblivion and it won't do any good suing people to make them have money it just takes money they do have if you win\nAnd I'm obviously you'd wind here but um but it take a long time so the settlement may be that the insurance that is the person carried maxed out and it ...\nIs out there are a lot of their assets now if that person is worth two million dollars and the insurance company has a million dollars then your maximum you're going to get out of this three million dollars\nTake everything the person had if you wanted to do that and get the million dollars out of their insurance company to Megan from that person they solve everything they've got and give it to you\nOr or give it to Daniel\nIn this case and so that that's how the calculation works but what most folks don't realize because this is so emotional so tragic is that the math is limited by the insurance companies max pay in their policy and the assets of the person that hit them\nThose two things that are together is the most you're going to get that 'cause there's no magic money doesn't just appear because some tragic and this is definitely\nTragic for a situation I'm so sorry you all are facing it\nBut that's that's how your math all shake out so what I'm going to be doing is investigating what the ... on the insurance policy is and the asset base of the person who hit them that's the thing to present information I Want to real quick because then it doesn't matter if I calculate ten million dollars is the settlement offer if there's nobody gonna pay it\nOf course can pay this Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\nYour twenty three okay well let's just let's just do it with some numbers for a second then how much are you putting in a month\n[noise] ah [noise] almost seven hundred dollars that they they're eight and nine that check\nOkay so I'm just gonna you're seven hundred dollars as an example okay well let's start with that you're twenty three a show in forty years you would be sixty three does that sound right\nThat's right okay if you're investing and if you average to twelve percent you'd have about eight million dollars in your four O. one K. right\nNow let's understand the seven hundred fifty two earners not fit to twelve times and then we said forty times so out of that eight million dollars\nThree hundred thousand of it is money that you put in\nAll the rest of it is gross\nSo we're seeing like Ninety eight percent of the money in that account when you get to age sixty five in our example large sixty three in our example okay Ninety seven percent Ninety eight percent of what's in there\nIs all gross and it's all tax free if you save a little money on your taxes now on this three hundred thousand walk your buddy is suggesting which is stupid\nOkay if you save a little money on three hundred thousand you get to pay taxes on eight million\nYou see the problem\nThat makes sense that had not thought of that yeah\nAlmost all the money that\nYour age especially that will be in the account will be growth and the growth being tax free under the raw adding is way more important than the tiny tiny little tax break that you would get today by screwing around and having some of it be pre tax and some of some of it be Ross\nSo I Would tell you man there's no way I personally I'm fifty seven I Do only a rough\nAnd and the numbers are nowhere near as cool for me as they are for you because I mean it is is just not anywhere near that good but hey thanks for

they were both talking about by the way some of these calls that but it's just what came in what were the most of the questions about investing\nAnd retiring with dignity so if you're twenty three and a twenty six you know what you're called\nHave you not heard that all the millennials are deadbeat so stupid\nWhile I'm here to tell you they're not because I talked to a smart ones like those two every day not all of them are living in their mother's basement looking at their participation trophy ... a lot of them are awesome and are killing it and they're thoughtful and they're thinking about their future or their mission driven\nI may say so don't let somebody trash the millennials in your presence and don't you be traction them now some of them are dead Bates but some of your baby boomers are too\nI mean\nAnd and I made some Jim ... parents are cousins OK so seriously\nDumber than Iraq but the point being every generation has got some idiots right\nEvery race has got some idiots every region of the country's got some idiots every success from idiots there's idiots they're everywhere\nBut there are some cool sharp\nYoung people are asking very cool questions because that doesn't give you hope for the future of this nation when you got a twenty three year old asking how to investors four one K. then you're just not smart that gives me hope\nThat says that it's going to be okay 'cause there's a whole bunch of them\nThat are thinking and focusing and ... and their ... and man once you see when I was twenty three\nI saw a compound interest table man I went oh
