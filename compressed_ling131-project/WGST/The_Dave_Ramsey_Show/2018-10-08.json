{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Potentially I mean we don't know\nYet how he's going to rule on any cases we only have guesses based on you know what we're being told by people who have interviewed him and spoken to him and ask them questions and confirmed him and so we have people like Susan Collins and saying you know I don't believe he's going to\nOverturn roe v Wade as an example I Believe he sees that is settled law but we don't know because if the way he answer those questions in a in private meetings is similar to the way he answered them in you know in public you know when you asked in front of the Senate Judiciary committee\nHe was pretty big with his answers and so we don't really know what he's going to do um we do know that President Trump made a campaign promise to get\nA Supreme Court justices and who would in his opinion overturn roe v way that he was going to pick conservative justices and then and he said this uh I'm not quoting I'm paraphrasing but he said\nUm and then yes roe v Wade will likely be overturned because that's just what they would do that would make sense we're putting people and for those reasons and that's what they'll do so\nUh we'll see I mean we'll see as the court is in session cases are starting to come up before coming up now so we'll see but\nIn the short term we're looking at the mid term elections and what this post Kavanaugh's confirmation will do in terms of having an effect on people voting or not voting so I guess the big question to you is are you going to vote\nAnd if you are or were you planning to vote before all of this or not a forum for three six seven nine four seven eight is our number four four three six seven W GST if you want to weigh in 'em and if you're not driving and you have a pen\nOr a computer in front of you just that down because honestly You're welcome to cause any time and share your views it is just Nick and I am in here so we do our best to get to calls when they come in it's not always easy for us to bear with us but we'll put you through the other way\nI always just to comment on our social media and or you know the message will were more than happy to respond but I'm just curious if anyone is sort of motivated from all of this to vote if they weren't going to vote before and that's a hard one for me because I was going to vote anyway\nSo I'm I'm voting in this election I made a commitment ah not that long ago if I'm being honest I think you know for most of my adult life I voted in the presidential elections and occasionally and another in and in between um but now I made a commitment a couple of years ago to vote in all elections\nAnd to at least do some homework some minimal homework to know\nWho was on the ballot in my uh area and who I was going to get to vote for at least have some idea of what they were about so I've made that come in and I'm going to be voting and I try to take a picture of myself you know 'cause I Try to take my own advice and take a picture with my sticker or whatever outside the you can't do it right out so I don't think they let you take pictures they don't like\nThat when I look at a hundred feet or a hundred and fifty feet so it's really something back to your car and and take the picture of\nThe times I voted actually I'm really fortunate I can walk to my polling place even the early voting one is only it's a little further\nBy him it was a little bit of a track but I still could do it so I watch so I didn't really know where the wind was better were the demarcation where you're not supposed to take photos but it took a selfie with my sticker [noise]\nUm but anyway I was going to vote regardless so my question really to you is are you going to vote and if you are where are you going to to vote before all this and I would suggest that if you are on the fence about whether or not you're going to vote\nThat you do it it doesn't take that long especially in these in between years to educate yourself on who's on your ballot or and what they're about and to pick a vote and I would rather I said this earlier in the show but I'll stick to my guns on this I Would rather have I'm a great voter turnout\nHave the election not necessarily go the way I wanted them to have low voter turnout and when ... only because I think it's so important and I want to see it become a trend and you know I think we need to teach\nFor kids the importance of that and not as like oh this big bad boring thing you need to do I think it needs to be turned into something as exciting as turning sixteen and being able to drive you know\nI'm turning tan and getting into the double digits like so exciting you know turning Thirteen and you're a teenager now so exciting and turning Eighteen and being able to vote should be that exciting and we need to work on that\n[noise] um well we're talking about teaching your kids um I think you know one of the things I'm taking away from the this fraught Kavanaugh confirmations situation is that\nWe haven't really gotten very far in terms of how we are viewing um victims of sexual\nAssault or harassment and you know we're in the middle of this hashtag me too movement and yes maybe we're making some progress but they're still seem to be um based\nOn the evidence a preponderance of people who will take the side of the accused when it became when it's a he said she said that that they'll believe the man I'm versus the woman and you know and I think a lot of this is happening to us now\nBecause stories like Christine Bobby forth are so old and so what got me thinking is are we doing a good job with our kids and I I'll start with daughters and we'll get to send in a second but are we doing a good enough job with our daughter's on teaching\nThem what behavior is acceptable\nIn terms of someone touching you or someone touches even this way or that way what is acceptable and what is not\nAnd who you can tell and when you should tell them and how you should tell them because I think we might be able to change the dynamic here not now but for future if we start teaching kids now to\nTell when something like this happens to them immediately\nImmediately and if we parent our kids in such a way that they feel like they can trust us to believe them\nAnd that's huge I made a big point with my own daughter I think of making her feel like she could tell me if for example there was drinking going on um\nYou know or that she could talk to me about her sex life or whatever it was she's grown don't worry um but you know I don't think I did talk to her about sexual harassment or sexual assault\nUm she did have an incident as a kid that wasn't ... you know wasn't um it was more of a um\n[noise] I'm an infringement let's just say I mean she wasn't raped or anything like that was just be clear but she had a moment a smart alec he boy on the school bus you know grabbed her boobs and she told me about it pretty early on 'em\nAnd so I can attest to that you know should this ever come back up a fat kid decides to you\nKnow try to get on the Supreme Court someday I she told me at the time that it happened\nYou know um\nBut I think that's important right and that was coincidence I think I don't think I made it clear to her to talk about those things but I think we had a she and I had enough of a trusting relationship and she felt like she did not feel any shame in that I think she felt like she didn't feel like it was her fault but that was a very you know was in public it was a you know different situation if you're\nAt a party and near flirting with a boy and you you know then you start to question whether it's your fault I don't care I think we need to be teaching our daughters\nThat it doesn't matter what the circumstance was these are the limits these are the rules and if someone anyone crosses those lines you need to come to me right away and we will work through it together [noise] um I think\nYou know if you take nothing else away from any of that what do you believe Christine Blasey Ford or you don't\nI think we can all appreciate that we don't want our sisters wives\nDaughters um you know female friends to go through this so if we can at least put our anxious and our anger aside and said to the women and girls in our lives hey you know what if something like this ever happened to you I Will believe you I Know you I trust you and I believe you and please come to me and I will help you let's start with that\nI mean if we get nothing else from this and you know that we're running out of time on the show today to I Will just say when it comes to men and boys we need to teach similar messages to the boys a by being victims but also about being perpetrators hey guys\nI Know it's fun you're like you're getting into puberty you're learning about sexuality but it's not okay to cross these lines these are the lines you don't cross\nAnd my two cents and it's also not okay to let your friends do it either right hold your buddies accountable yeah\nThat's right and same thing for girls and boys you know yeah it's not funny it's okay it's not funny and you can't laugh it off so if we've learned nothing else again which ever side you come down on whomever you believe in all of this\nUm at least let's start getting the messaging to our kids I'm to be on point so that you know thirty six years from now this can't happen again\nYou know what's at least get they're All right on that now we are officially added to but we will be back

question just started listening to your podcast or my dad listens to you and he's been recommended for a while but uh we started listening to you in and go through financial piece of my wife and I are planning to do that and just finally got her on board with everything\nI'm my question is to start a budget Dave I'm a contractor and so I get paid you know performance or or peace rate so my my pay\nChanges all the time one month we might make a thousand women who make four thousand sure\nHow the ... budget without Dave take\nConceptually here's how you do it in the mechanically will walk through and a couple of different ways okay conceptually we just say okay what's our worst month and the next coming twelve likely it sounds like yours is five K. very like it's very very likely you're not gonna be below five K. in the coming twelve agreed\nAgreed okay they might but it'd be very unusual now so we set the budget up regular on five K. we ... we have five K. coming in we're going to give every one of those dollars a name on assignment of mission and so five K. minus my categories equals zero every dollar has an assignment\nOkay on the five K. and so there you're going to take care of most of the things in your life then the things that you couldn't get on that list but you still\nPrimarily in this case is gonna be want to do not need to do\nOr it might be want to save some money it might be want to go on a trip that might be want to pay off some debt it's you know but it's not necessary for your living you can live on the five probably it's kind of gravy bonus money so to speak above five K. we make a list of those things and we say are after our regular budget if we make a dollar\nWhat is the most important thing on this new list that didn't make the cut on the budget the understand yet they're\nOkay and I don't care what it is you and your wife to look at that and you say that's number one okay you say are we ... we made enough above five thousand to do that when you put a dollar amount decided it's four hundred and Ninety dollars okay so now we made five thousand four hundred million dollars when we make the next dollar what's the next most important thing\nThe ... this month that don't have to be for the rest of your life it's just for this coming month and you put it to decide that and then a three and therefore and then you rewrite the list in order now you have a prioritized spending plan for each dollar that comes in it already is spent by prioritization above five caves that logical to you\nYes or no that's your concept the practical application is one or two things you can use your every dollar budget apt to do all of that and just\nChange it through the month as the money comes and just go okay we're we're going to set up on five\nBut as we get more money and will change the income and will drop down in and will change the list okay and you can apply route through your every dollar budget out or if you've gotten your financial piece university materials\nOr you've got the total money make over book or any of the any of the books that are have my based on the front I'm just about they have a budget forms in

show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nHey I'm I have a question about that Charles how are you going to have your theory of the history twenty five years old I'm and I'm\nI was offered to buy that I didn't think it I just think there are a lot and I have come back I live that they you know I got a lot\nAnd then all of that I Would have to go I did that for it that four\nHundred and fifty thousand dollars mhm\n[noise] and at the table at a temperature down ... ... ... I get all the time I own a ... for thirty thousand dollar pay that cash I catch the whole thing um but I'm just wondering if it's something it's just better to buy it rather than start out because I Know that's a start up at like ...\n... and I want to get your opinion on it\n[noise] [noise] well um what I have found is the number one cause of small business failure is cash flow\nAnd cash flow is restricted by primarily to things that cause businesses to fail but don't take care of their tax bill and they get by on on their taxes and they go into debt number two and so um you you increase your probability of failure ten ...\nIf you're going to do this\nI have to tell you I personally don't borrow money for anything and I have never in Thirty years are doing the show advise anyone to go into debt to buy a business ever and so I'm not going to do that because you have to pay this bill whether all those clients leave the next month or not and that could bankrupt you\nIt could be fairly easily actually\nBecause you basically don't have any money and so I don't know what the value of an insurance agency is they are valued you know you've got a a you know you've got a book of business the book of business has a value and it has a um a persistence rate and the meaning the number of people you lose two attrition or don't lose too attrition each year\nUm and that persistence rate and the size of the book business creates a certain amount of cash flow generally speaking the net profit after everyone including the owner that's operating ... a business\nHave been paid the net profit the taxable income of the business times for or maybe times five is a small business equation on insurance industry it might be different than that I don't know\nBut what what is the net profit if you were running this thing after you pay you\nA coupon for what I haven't got an intense\nYou would make three hundred and ten thousand dollars in the first year\nAt about their\nProfit I don't have access to the book yeah profit after after\nThe rent is paid the secretary is paid every body at present\nAt their payroll after ... after appointed after insurance and\nWell that's not a bad price on a business if you can pay it all back in two years and\nThat kind of tricky favorite chair well if you're if you're only paying six fifty four it was sixty five thousand down and you make three Dan you live on nothing you pay it all back when I got three kids oh\nOkay well then it takes three years now All right but uh uh that's that's about what I'm Talking about then it sounds like it sounds like about four times the net profit because that does not include having paid you\nAnd so there it allows for factor that's a fairly normal appraisal right so they're not ripping you off on the price of a but I Would not go into to do it I Would charge or on\nCoca and then when you were going to make a bunch of money in your own if you want to add to your own about buying out another practice you could save up the money and do that if you are making two ten in through every three years you could save up and buy a businesses were six hundred right\nRight and so that's pretty cool we can do that later and add to your book of business by buying out other agencies\nAre by buying out of a stand alone but I I Can't recommend I personally wouldn't do it if I was twenty five years old if I was forty five years old or ... voters will I personally wouldn't do that\nUm I Would start my own and got it out I did that with this business we started on a card table my living room we've never borrowed a dime there's just under eight hundred of us working here and it's a two hundred million dollar businesses seven buildings\nSo um but we started on a card table my living room and all the bumps and bruises along when I'm really glad I didn't have any debt Vicky is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Vicky how are you\n... and it's like if they clicking here to what's up\n[noise] okay I Am

if anybody is reporting on you and the only way that would happen\nIs if you have an ongoing relationship with them in and you're still owed them money or you're still using their product even though you're paying it off every month that could be an ... card then you will always maintain a credit score some kind so the only way as if you have apps that you go off the grid basically you're saying I

bankruptcy they're not supposed to but sometimes they're computers kick out that they still haven't gotten paid well they're not going to get paid just after seven zero and I had two of them are three of them reports three years later\nAnd that started the whole process over I had to go back and dispute those because they were not allowed to report that um they did ultimately get paid 'cause I went back and paid my bankruptcy but um as a moral thing not as a legal thing but anyway all that to say\nYou've got to have the thing completely squeaky clean and then apparently if they haven't changed at this month and they don't start counting your rent\nOr they didn't start counting something else that we don't know that they count then your credit score will go to zero which is what we call it but they technically call it in the terminal because we have no way to determine a credit score um you know they actually sent me an email back in the day that said um\nYou know we want to check on you because our credit score a your credit scores disappeared during now under terminal and um we wanted to make sure there was not a mistake or that you weren't dead um and I kinda thought that was a

basically a thousand bucks a month give or take during that time average and a ... that's really watching what you're doing you muster casual and the whole thing\nYes it was it was very tight ... when I was a at least at the beginning stages I figured it out that um if if I budgeted everything out and all of just the basic bills in food and gas I had about forty dollars leftover per month while do it was it was typed\nUp some extra jobs not help but you're over ... got a little bit out of film but some doesn't pay too much good deal good deal so three years ago you said you started financial ... personal journey began and other than that\nI'm kind of a story well first of all my sister who's here um I did uh did your program into their debt free scream and that's how I first heard about you and I was and so I learned some of it by us most is kind of but I also we're like oh that's good enough I got it\nUm which wasn't smart or um so then it was in twenty four teen which is when I moved sixty miles away from home just getting by myself to an apartment a signed a lease everything figured out everything was good and\nI had to move on the seventh of August and the third of August my car broke down completely engine died everything is done while and so I'm like I Need to move I Need to move now I have no way to get there in a way to get my job when I get there don't know anybody up there\nUm so I was just ran out and bought a car and I end up to that point I had been\nSmart and only buying a cash in cash for cars but at this point I was like\nEvery time I get breaks down in a year I'm tired of holy impulse yet and I like I was just like that kind of looks nice I'm going to get that one [laughter] pay too much for it I'm pretty sure and um and so\nBut of course I'd already signed a lease so that was something I hadn't taken into account run and so moved up there and about four months later my that car the engine fried brought down the exact reason that I bought a new car is what happened\nAnd so it took out a car repair alone and um because I was like I'm not going to let go this car I just got four months ago I'm going to keep it\nAnd um so yeah so replaces the engine at that point in time it was like there was I was over drafting it was it was it was bad um and because I wasn't budgeting and um I think I don't know if it was for moving gift or if it was for um\nFor a Christmas gift from corney gave me a uh the box for financial peace but I was still stubborn I'm so like I put it on my dresser and I'm like I I'll probably do that I'll probably get around to a certain amount of sleep in the same room with a box it'll be okay I just want to actually learn it you know by us most is\nAnd um it it didn't I didn't [laughter] so um I was still over drafting and actually it was I Believe it was April twenty Fifteen when she came up just to stay over my apartment so she could fly out of Minneapolis to do that free scream\nAnd I'm like she knows my situation and she ... she will see that on open box as you will give me a lot of crap because she knows and I can't have that only a good sister rules are exactly [laughter] so I'm like before she gets here I'm signing up for a class and that was the motivating factor so I finally got it so it's her fault\n[laughter] rightful all the way to do her debt free scream you get shamed and the process causes you to be here to do your debt free sharing back and I'll take it doesn't work such good family stuff right there and I should\nSay it ends up being a pretty good book into because I went out of 'em\nAnd ... honestly kind of kicking the tape because I really felt like I Need to get serious when I Walk or I don't want to use the\nEr the get out of jail free card and um I Want to be wild with his own really just trying to get your take on how it's said oh\nHow old are you are on twenty four of them now how long you been married five years you all had this discussion about the way your feeling about this track\nYes absolutely what she's trying to\nLose ... we uh we just need to pray about it and we figure out what what's the most widely decision\nWhich I how much the check for\nTwenty seven Bob will not pay off everything\n[noise] I'm not quite but we do have a five hundred and savings or we could take a I think maybe three of that and be done with everything\nEverything but the house yeah OK yeah good and then begin your emergency fund sure who passed away\nMy grandfather okay All right well there's a couple of gauges we wanted to number one we want to be biblical was which is what she was saying and pray about this and then number two we want to do something with his money that your grandfather would be sitting in heaven and so you're doing this and smile oddly enough these are actually the exact same things\nUm because when you start doing more things with money that's going to be honoring to his memory in other words right bill and so paying off the debt would not make him mad as long as you had a process to never go back in [noise]\nAnd that's what bothers you a little bit so what I Want you to do is I Want you to go back through financial peace university and I want you to park their money in a side savings account that is not attached in any way to an ATM card debit card or your checking account where you can't do it without a better for the bank\nOr you have to physically go down there and make it hard to get to impart there for nine weeks until you go through the classes to gather you've got the one year membership I'm going to pay for it for you to go to financial position worst day okay\nAnd attributes university is a one year membership you've got nine lessons in nine weeks you've seen some of them some of them have been re done since you saw them\nAnd uh you go through those then when you get done with that I think you'll know what to do and you take that money and work the baby steps but uh the problem is as you said the get out of jail free card if you don't change your behaviors and have something more than just a promise to yourself you're going to\nStraighten up then you could really cause a problem lighter um yeah and so what you want to do is proved to yourself during this nine weeks that you have changed your behaviors\nAnd when you are looking at each other going okay we're really doing this\nWe're not screwing around were not goofing off we're not going to issue\nWe're really going to do it no itching Dave ... financial ... ish wise is\nWe're not going to ... and so that'll get you into a mess I and so you know I Would if I knew I Want to prove to myself that I'm not going to do to shore up [noise] and that's what I'm telling you to do a is so go to the non classes in nine weeks\nAnd on and say you can watch the videos and you can go on keep going you go to the legacy journey class online\nOr you can you can get into groups on line and say\nYou know should continue the discussion with the tribe and talking about it you got every dollar plus connecting to your bank on line and that's there with you for a year I'm giving you every bit of that um we sell all that for a hundred and twenty nine dollars just about five hundred dollars worth of stuff though\nAnd I really really really incredible value\nAnd uh it's all a church and we want you to take care of it all we ask is is that you follow the stuff both of you plug into this and some day when you're doing really good find a guy who um feels like a product and you help him out\nAnd that's ... thanks for the call Megan is in Chicago Hi Megan welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I Am a new ... forgive me for my ignorance um [laughter] I Am on baby step to we have our um housing our savings that are currently working on our debt we have about thirty four thousand dollars\nI mean that includes our cars we do not have a mortgage we currently rent now my question is um we're going to have it paid off work and the next two years maybe even a year right um [noise] now we have a plan that we wanted to take our children I'm\nInto an RV for about two years and travel the country\nUm however we would have to finance ticket Harvey and something to tell\nAnd we kind of actor her kids are getting older I'm terribly would not like to wait a little but I just wanted to see what your advice for America would be\nA dream I live in the dream cool very cool well I'm not going to I don't tell people to borrow money because every time I find people borrowing money often broke people right and um and if you borrow on something that goes down in value as fast as an RV does I'm going to find really broke people\nHave you ever tried to sell used RV and seen other people are and mowed yeah possible to get rid of them are they're hard to get financing on and they go down in value faster than almost anything what wheels motors they are mathematically horrendous\nA just a mess and so um do the other one is a big a medium sized boat if you get a hundred million dollar boat you can get financing on it and if you get a cheap ... can get financing on it but the middle range of boats the fifty two hundred and fifty thousand is a difficult product\nAnd a show you just about have to have the money to just consume it and be able to afford it so what I Would tell you what's your household income\nI'm sixty thousand\nOr ... I Would get myself out of debt I'd worked extra jobs and then I Would save up and pay cash for an RV that would um\nThat would suffice for the two year period of time and then if you saw it at somewhat of a loss at least you got oh you don't have any data on it and you don't get caught in it it's not a problem it doesn't ruin your life going forward because if you take a wonderful dream like you have and you finance it you're going to turn it into a nightmare\nRight it's going to cause a problem for your family 'cause I mean you put a hundred granted an RV by the time you get home is worth fifty\nRight and you're going to be stuck and ... all that money and you know you're going to mess up your kid's college plan you're going to mess up your retirement I mean it could be disastrous if you do this wrong and so what I Do save up and buy one or look for a program where you can rent one for two years if we can do that for two years and just turn it back in\nA doubt there is one they're probably very very expensive I Know you can rent them short term for the weekend and those aren't bad deals but a two year plan is a different\nUm when you add all of this up\nIt might be\nThat you guys could stay in your you could travel in your car um or your issue be or whatever it is you own and stay in hotels cheaper by the time you out at all\nBecause you're going to lose so much money on the transaction and again I'm not trying to ruin your dream I just don't want your dream to be a nightmare\nSo do it with no debt you do it used to and um and do some mathematical analysis on it and you've got some nice to do that while you're working to get your other debts paid off right now\nAnd then if you want to say about fifty grand and buy a three year old or a two year old hundred grand ... or something and and then it becomes more twenty five by the time you get home I'm mad at you for that that doesn't ruin your life but if you if you just go write a check and finance something you're going to be in a mess kiddo and I don't want that for you I Want you to when I say thanks for the call\nWas fourteen almost Fifteen million of you listening each week we know

fifty\nTo move up a hundred and fifty thousand dollars yeah and you're using his moving into the father in law suite as the justification for doing that but obviously the whole house the the increase is not all about the father in law suite correct\nYeah we're going to upgrade our house within the next few years anyway what's\nYour household income\nUm it's about two hundred and fifty thousand\nOr
