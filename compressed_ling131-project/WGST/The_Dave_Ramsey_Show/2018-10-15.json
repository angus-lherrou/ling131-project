{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "You know ... if you will about a possibly running you've got\nA Joe Biden who is sort of out in about speech you find you've got Bernie Sanders of course Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren Cory Booker a and the list goes on even Michael Bloomberg changing parties now saying he's a Democrat and a and might be running oh and let's not forget Michael ...\nWho by the way I think has a prayer but I enjoy from an entertainment perspective that he wants to run centers any\nMuslim research sorry but obviously Donald Trump has already officially declared\nOh oh yeah yeah for a ... one Mr John Delaney who's out a a representative from Maryland has declared on the Democratic side but it is it okay well in some really we're learning just point out that in this new survey of who might when Delaney is the in last place [laughter]\nSo um it's not working there early declaration and help him to change you could\nCome up a little bit but he has less than one percent of the poll that was taken the lead of this a poll a\nIt was this is a CNN poll ... it brings Joe Biden and at thirty three percent a there is a this is a very split thing by the way it's a thirty three percent is actually really high because next in line is Bernie Sanders of Thirteen percent followed by Kamala Harris at nine percent in Elizabeth Warren at eight\nPercent and will stop there because and it goes on a will stop there because Elizabeth Warren a\nIs probably the loudest of the those that are considering it of late she has made\nNoise on several occasions now in the last few weeks about possibly running a the latest being this overnight she released or the Boston Globe actually released a story a\nThat Elizabeth Warren had gone ahead and gotten a DNA test to try to put an end to the Native American slashed Pocahontas debate that the president has enjoyed a Everytime he mentions her name for any reason\nAnd\nYou would think that he would get over this whole thing because I feel like once again it's just so racist and ugly the way that he I mean it's one thing to make fun of her\nBut in doing so he and those like him who are joining in all the fun air quotes the fun are being so disrespectful to Native Americans on the whole\nYou know with the imitations and\nA Tomahawk shopping and the house and the head dresses and the Pocahontas thing and all of that it's just so disrespectful I'm not just her her but to\nNative Americans really I'm In any case the president has been on this topic for quite some time and there's this you know a lot of um allegations\nThat not only did she falsely claimed to have Native American heritage but then that she used said claim to get things like into colleges and soon to certain jobs that she got certain things because she declared herself a\nMinority or for the record there is no evidence of that and so she decided to try to put this whole thing to bed to go and have a DNA test\nNow she could have done it the way a lot of people do DNA tests these days with ancestry dot com or twenty three and me or or whatever but she decided to try to get as official as she could about this going specifically to a lab so that she could prove that it was you know there was a witnesses that it was her DNA that was being supplied\nAnd then to have the results analyzed by a Stanford professor who is an expert in the field a we have a little excerpt of her conversation with the expert take a lesson\nAnd the other genomes did fine ... segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence that we believe the error rate is less than one of them\nWants to call my mom a lawyer\nWould have the facts [laughter] we we have a Native American ancestry and you're\nSo there you go a that is a Stanford professor and that by the way with all the delightful like\nSaga music behind it as sort of from is from a video about a five minute long video four or five minute long video that Elizabeth Warren herself a put together that is clearly an indicator that she is running and twenty twenty it is a puff\nSort of I Am a real American I Am from Oklahoma here meet my older and some Republican brothers\nAh like see let me tell you that my whole here's a picture of my parents let me tell you the whole story of how I came up in the world as she talks in in you know at length about the fact that she dropped out of school and then went back to college after she was married and had her first child and she put herself through law school that way a\nWas a hard working American Woman and by the way here's my DNA test just so you know\nI'm In the video she also includes the mockery by President Trump of her a Native American heritage no let's be clear she has only a small percentage of a\nNative American in her blood it's from several generations back uh I forget the percentages are saying but like you know I don't even remember but I didn't you look up neck and tell me that uh someone in one of the Native American chief of one of the tribes\nYes so it's she they're saying they could be six two tenths generation yes relaxing for her crap if it's six generation that makes her one thirty seconds right Native American bank and the leader of the Cherokee tribe in the United states is one thirty seconds jerky it'd be\nSo there you go yeah you know she also talked about in the video of the fact that she is not sort of a of an official member of a tribe she didn't she that's not something that's a part of her life but this is a part of our history and you know now she has the evidence to prove it now what are the other things and you may or may not remember this is that the president\nA man made an offer really wanted her to go get the DNA test um here's what he said this was maybe a couple of years ago right yeah listen\nI Want you to make sure they would like to have you take the test of the shows you're\nOkay a million dollars to her favorite charity that was recorded we we see you we hear you we heard Jew so she took the test and it proved that she has in fact as much\nA Native American heritage as one of the tribe leaders ... so that would count in my opinion\nExactly yeah how [noise] how can they only have one that you didn't know you owed well it's old and you've forgotten the old\nGuy didn't I I'm not I'm not organized ... starting to get organized\nAnd how you how old are you oh I'm twenty nine okay sure some of these deaths might be like eight or nine years old even and they did yeah\nOkay All right well the super super old ones will find you you may not be able to find them but they'll come around ... eventually are the ones that you know what they are and you know where they are you can talk to them on the phone and then get a balance\nAnd you know and and you can get pretty close that way unless you've got a hundred thousand dollars in old stuff you forgot about which would be hard to grasp psychologically but I'm no possibly you did on my impossible there's something there show\nUm but but I wouldn't worry about having all of that exact what I Would do is just get the things that you are sure of and those are things that are top of mind for you you could recall you know you certainly know that you're if you're if you have a car payment or if you don't you certainly know\nIf you've got a credit card debts current or you don't you know about those so let's just start with the things we know and get active balances on all of those and just called the bank in each case called ... whoever the Linder is in each case and get their\nGet them to give it till you verbally over the phone\nAnd the purpose of that is just to help you start doing some calculations of the future so your hope comes back right right so why do you guys know start two years ago while humans screwing off for two years after you went through the glass\nWe couldn't afford to no good years\nLiterally bring it home [noise] uh well yeah he lost that she was fired from one guy and then he lost that now that uh he was five to drive [laughter]\nBefore then and when we started um financial ... we went on and bringing in about five hundred dollars and our debt our bills I live and have come out\nRobbing Peter to pay 'em ... and yeah but now my husband and I can put a post office and I we have three children out before\nBut I can do at a stop have you heard of those like ... ... it took up like that but the ... based out there to kind of go forward and how and\nListen to this to you guys need to go back to fund attribution first it goes you flunked there was no yeah but you belong to a class there was no thing in the class has said you have to have a certain\nAmount of money to start managing money well\nYou have to start managing the money that you have well\nAnd so we couldn't afford to is not a good reason what that tells me as you were just overwhelmed irresponsible and didn't want to deal with it and now you're now you're being responsible now you've got some jobs and now you're ready to be grown up and get after this song help you again okay but this time even if there's not enough money coming in to pay your bills\nThat does not equal I Can't afford to do this\nThat's not a true statement a true statement is I Can't afford to take care of everything so I'm going to take care of the most important things first\nAnd I'm going to manage those until I get those managed and then I'll get a little more money all go go to the next thing a little more money I'll go the next thing and it it'll give you a real good picture of what your income needs to be to not only survive but to get out of this mess\nSo I'm well will sign you up for another year in some attribution ...

know how to do it you call me or you call someone here Ramsey and we will walk you through this but there is no such thing of I Can't I don't make enough money to manage money\nThat is not ever a true statement folks show you manage the money that you have well and you know what ends up happening gosh for all of you out there I've been there to where you didn't even have enough coming in to pay your current bills right do you have to ... which is not going to get paid you have to draw that line\nOn the page and ... where the money runs out Iran that line\nAnd then the people call up that are below the line and they go are you going to pay us now you're blow on\nWhat line while draw a line where my money runs out near blow the line and um the kids eating is above the line and you're below the line and you're mainly boring 'cause you're a nasty Everytime you call them if you keep being nasty Everytime they call\nYou know stay below on\nUntil that line just disappears\nDoes that's kinda how I decided to blow the line see I get to control the money that comes into my house you don't Mr phone call her now you hear a dial tone\nNear this works how you deal with the collectors and the

I was going through a career change or to wear 'em all all the only income I had was a a paid internship mhm where's making ten thousand dollars a year [laughter] [noise]\nUm and still needed to

... chosen career field that I have now I got a real big day ... a big bump in\nPay 'em and then I'm Free you can negotiate the whole child support and that's when I basically started the whole ... a snowball okay metal back in\nSeptember twenty sixteen gotcha so in that twenty month period of time what was your range of income\nThat particular point um it was a roughly in the low forties forty to for a living I work as a G. I. S. analysts uh-huh okay and that's what you got your degree yes okay cool and on what kind of that was the Nineteen thousand [noise] um it was I'm a student loan for about\nUh Thirteen thousand six

[laughter]\nYeah\nRight [laughter] I understand [laughter] oh man you've been through it rather certainly would have been through the good news is you're standing on top you serve or above\nGround for the first time in a while here yes on solid ground Hauser feel\nUm I Know from whatever foundation I build right now is the solid rock that like a matter of life on that any man there you're on the real solid ground right now is already are it's it's compacted that's how we know what's all of us are\nGood good for you yeah you're in a really really good place a\nRight would you want to be on the other side of this transaction no okay\nThey ... ... yeah you close your you signed a contract you said you were going by the south I don't even know if you can afford it it sounds like you're doing it out of order you should have been out of that you should have had your emergency fund in place you should have done these other things but you know keep your word\nYou give your work\nAnd that's the first thing that comes up [noise] hey thanks for the call literally is with us in Knoxville highly how are you\nHow are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] you know adequate than my I call certainly I mean he named the executive ... well [noise] um I've never seen that well and interested in my hand with that fact that I make sure I fully understand hit my head after he had a question it is it appropriate I can see that well and you have any suggestions on highly recommend station\nOr it's more than appropriate as a matter of fact it's just flat out strange he made you the executor without first talking to you\nThat's like weird [laughter] yeah\nThat's a very presumptive to say the least so ah let's re start the conversation on ... uh I didn't sign up for this and I am willing to consider\nHelping you in this way and I think you thought you were honoring me with this and I appreciate the honor I think uh but there's a couple of things that are going to go along with me agreeing to be your executor\nUm otherwise I Can't be your executor number one is I have to know what every detail of your situation is\nAnd that includes reading the wheel and understanding the wheel and going over it with your lawyer number two is all of those affected by the will have to be informed before your death what the world says\n'cause I'm not going to implement stuff that I get blamed for and everybody's pissed at me and it was you that did\nYou follow me ... ...\nYeah 'cause you're going to have like your cousins or whoever it is that he's asking you to not give money to that thinks they're getting money they're not going to be mad at him he's dead they're going to be mad at you and all you are allowed to do by the law\nIs exactly what the ... and yet you're going to get all the relational blame\nAnd all the emotional blame and I'm not set myself up into that no way we're going to have a lot of reading of the wheel with the parties that are involved they're all going to know what it says in junior boys getting cut out because he's doing heroin we need to go and tell him while he's alive he gets no money\nWhile I'm Still alive if he won't do that and he won't let you see everything in advance just say honey I understand you don't have to do that at your stuff but you need to take me off of the executor ship\nBecause those are my terms for serving as executive does that sound unreasonable do you\nNot at all I I appreciate that's how I was feeling as well ...\nYeah that's exactly what I Would do and by the way if he won't take you off as soon as he dies you step before the judge to say I refuse it I'm not gonna take it I told him always alive I'm not going to do it and I'm not going to do it every day I don't get built\nInto it okay thanks for the call open phones a AAA eight to five five to to fly by white folks that little exercise right there is a really good for all of you go ahead and tell everybody this is what you're going to get\nThis is what you're not going to get little Suzie gets the China cabinet\nLittle George gets the gun collection I don't care what it is it going ahead and tell everybody in that way they got when they tell me one time on the back porch and we're all that crap it needs to be in oil and everybody needs to know what's going on daddy told me on the back porch does not stand up in court\nAnd so you're going to have people angry\nAnd you might as well go ahead and just go this is what we're doing no need to be angry it's my stuff I get to do with what I Want to do with it I'm managing for God I'm going to give it to you to manage for God and this is how this works and be real clear everyone should do that you should always have to see this idea of we have a reading of the will\nAnd it's almost like a movie scene\nThe third wife the trophy wife\nIs in the study the dysfunctional son is in the study\nThe um the responsible daughter is in the study you ... you know these movies and you're saying on their own set up for several bad movies that are out there and then they the ... and ... you know the walnut line the office of the attorney and the attorney begins to read the will

I don't hear a I don't hear a discrepancy in my mind you wrote a check I probably wouldn't written the check but you've written it now you pay the contract or you're in\nHi hey what's up here to to have you know\nI I I Am I'm trying to figure out what to do my [laughter] and an apprenticeship position that's paid but it's only about thirty grand a year\nWe expect that and about a year he would be making pretty good around a hundred grand shall which are the things\nHe is it's kind of an architectural failed to fish and [noise]\nUm and he's got a great opportunity and we definitely agree like I said that she did so well Lebanon parents' basement yeah because he couldn't live on that I'm looking for that and [noise]\nBut what I'm thinking in my feeling is that um he's doing that and like he he logged anything forty hours a week [laughter] but meanwhile like we're just barely getting by check and living in their parents' basement so it's like [noise]\nI'd kill and I've been working part time I got a baby but I don't have to bring in the ...\nHow old is your how\nShe's eight months old how old are you too oh thirty four and thirty six okay\nAnd he took this route I took this apprentice jobs how long ago\nIt's been about six months\nAnd there's written promises\nThat at the completion of the ... of parental trip that he will have a access to this kind of income\nNow there are no comment that I never\nHeard of an architectural sales apprenticeships so I'm just is new to me I'm trying to understand\nWhy it would do this you know it's not um\nIt's not a new aren't like a a very common thing and that's all right he's got his foot in the door in a position I'm\nAn opportunity that a lot of people don't get 'em and we know that on our own you know like we were totally believing that this will happen I don't know if you're in the meantime it's like okay\nWe're only working forty hours during the ... be working on the job\nCreate [noise]\nYup got bills to pay you can't pay and his wife who's got a baby at home is calling me it's a pretty simple equation and has more money so how far ... what what is his income that I was thirty and and what do you how much would another thousand dollars a month change your life\n[noise] um\nIt it would definitely help with the orange alert calm and you know like we can make a dent in our debt I just you know we're not we're just barely paying\nI'm not trying to make you feel calm I'm trying to get your where you can map medically pay the bills mathematically does a thousand dollars a month extra do it\nNow okay what is a turning like living without\nNo I'm not trying to move you out here on an apprenticeship and agreed to live in her basement now you're going to put up with her\n[laughter]\nWith the territory is what you got signed up for it you know you can't afford to move out while he's on the apprenticeship\nWeight that's your doctor you're stuck there for six more months or as a six more months left in this thing\n[noise] um [noise]\nIt's like I said we don't really know exactly I Would I Would get about a year\nOkay I Want to know exactly [noise] ... ... friday by friday\nI Want to know what the guidelines are of this apprenticeship one of the ends of my income goes up shark and move out of your mother's basement\nThis ... this I Hope they keep their word I think they're going to keep their word but I'm not even sure what word they gave me it doesn't work for me I think you guys need the mail this deal down so you know what you signed up for and you know what you've signed up for so you can see alive and the tunnel and you can put a chart on the wall when you get to move out of his mother's basement\nAnd um and then he needs to work and extra job to get the bills paid and I'm going to guess and say you have a big hunk and car payment and he'd sell the car or just a guess but it's a fairly educated guess so I Would add that to the equation as well\n[noise] hope that

I was really happy without a doubt\nYeah it was really really strong really awful stuff\nSo much of it I mean I I've been uh I just was editing a blogger commercial break a couple of commercials or do something about the content people on a blog article I'd written them a few weeks ago before I got hurt or talks and they've had you know that element of overcoming fear because I think there's so much\nWe talk about transforming around here a lot of transformation transfer forming and\nGetting yourself out of debt transforming her marriage outlets parrot talks about that ritual and less with

accent\nIt doesn't that boys in your head gets really loud and it starts to even sound rational you start to make it make excuses that really make you make a lot of sense and you stay\nIs perfect for your furniture building business okay right\nAmelia that's awesome first of all I Love how you introduce yourself he said I'm a young entrepreneur and right there that mindset\nIs already going to set you up for success you already see yourself in a space that just screams confidence and I love that\nI Will tell you one of the great things a million I see this a lot is you don't have to wait until you graduate from college to start working on this this is something that you could have a side business and start while you're in college to help you not only pay your bills\nBut then you're building up demand building up your brand by the time you graduate this could be your full time job in fact um I worked with a guy that did that he started it a little T shirt business Dave in college little T shirt business that was a multimillion dollar business before he ever graduated and that was his full time thing so I mean you can do this I just want to encourage you\nThe idea that it's difficult to get in this space because you're a girl I think\nIs more in your head than in reality if you build great pieces people want to buy him if you solve problems for people if you had a great product and you take care of the market place they don't really care if it was you or do some old someone young they just love the furniture\nI I'm an older that doesn't buy furniture but my wife went through a decorator and how can just tell you ... either my wife or I were we buy a piece of custom made furniture made by a lady that would actually be a brand advantage 'cause we would think that was pretty cool\nYeah that you had that you have a good eye for it that there's yeah I think that you this does it have to be a barrier for you if anyone and gets out he was an advantage just you just get started because you're going to get the most confidence when you saw that first piece even if it's small piece even if you sell it to your aunt I don't care\nJust get started dip your toe in the water Amelia will make sure that Kelly since my book and you can follow that plan it's a step by step plan to grow this business\nAnd start small start on the sly side and you'll see your confidence growing up promised you a ... that will be a non issue won't even be a fear in your head anymore because like Dave said you'll start to see it as an advantage that you offer the marketplace through your business that excited for you the fact that you're even asking this question and making that phone call girl you got big things ahead for you I'm so excited for you\nTo let me tell you what happened to me a million when I went broke and I wrote a book about how to handle money I'm a broke a show on a book about money\nThat's kind of a disadvantage and the other who\nWould want to read them money book from a guy that went broke that is what I used to think and after seven Fifteen million books a kind of figured out everybody wants to buy a money book from a guy who went broke and learned his lesson\nAnd so it actually turned into my what I thought was my disadvantage what my my insecurity\nThat felt like a disadvantage\nEnded up actually being my brand differentiate or\nBecause I Know how people feel I've been there done that I got the T shirts you've got a brand advantages you've got the female touch\nOn the furniture um and you're going to put a a different kind of look different kind of feel to it and uh and it makes you different you're not just another group making furniture it's really cool you know it makes you stand out I just love it I think you need to get some really cool pictures\nWith you with your power tools and yet you have some you know get in there with the ... or whatever and safety glasses on and that's your business card\nI I think it's an advantage I think it's a ... the opposite of a disadvantage but when I started\nMy in security\nI thought was a brand disadvantage has turned into one of my biggest brand advantages because it might be different and you need to identify that when you're doing a business right\nIt's interesting to we just had on her leadership master series last week and I was on a panel with Suzanne sand in the ... and ... and a very common theme we heard a in the audience asking questions is how to fix demon women leaders women leader I don't know how do I succeed as a woman in a man's industry\nAnd there are certainly some industries where you need to be aware of what you're going into but the reality is so often\nIt is bigger in our head than it is in reality it's to your point if the thing we think is holding us back when that's the thing that's going to set us apart and make people want to buy from us and so I I Love the whole perspective Amelia ah that that you already see yourself as an entrepreneur now you just need to see yourself as a successful business owner and starts picked us up well\nI mean I think about somebody like um you know we had gone to rush because we ... and she's been a little time with her obviously female obviously African American obviously super brilliant oh you've got smarter to ... oh yeah with a woman so unbelievably smart [noise] but um I mean a\n... successful I mean ... ... the United states of America I mean you know this is no small job here yeah ... and\nBut what ended up happening with her what what we we were asking her about the same thing the barriers you know the racial barrier the sexism racism all this kind of stuff\nAnd she used the line uh from her neighborhood she should growing up in a segregated neighborhood in Birmingham, Alabama that her mom and told her it doesn't matter where you're coming from where you're going ... and ... other people with their prejudice beside\nMy fate Yup I decide my ... and it was like coming out it was just very calm but yet or to loud and clear confidence in there but again it comes back to that that um you know you're going to I'm going on the space and I'm going to turn what you think is a\nDisadvantage that race sex whatever it is you got into an advantage because it's a brand differentiate are\nWell I Love how you've been talked about you and share and buying furniture if you look at most American household the women make the purchasing designing decorating decisions\nOr what I think of a a woman that makes plans she's known in the spaces are creating furniture and plans and all white and I buy her plant like bunk bed plans or a fork in the backyard plans\nAnd I love hers more because she has that female touch now female designed so far at least you think she does not only in my mind you've got you really weren't connected we're best friends you know to me so uh other area will will draw those people based on that she didn't even realize it\nNow that's less verve are important I think this is good information\nThe book is business boutique it has a number one buzz shower and you can see why rusty ride is with us the founder of that you don't hear her speak all over America\nAnd teach and you'll see her own media you'll see her a business ... dot com and those of you that are members of the um business boutique academy regularly get coaching from her\nUh and of course now the crusty right business podcast\nYes very well right it is it is taken off and it's amazing how when you can encourage people and inspire them and teach them while they're living their lives so like lift there's right now on the radio show they may be driving in the car on a commute they may be going for a run or they may be cooking or cleaning or something around the house that you're able to encourage them and give them a\nThe steps and plans and tools that they need to win so it's been really fun to to see the stories coming out of someone that their life has changed from the cast\nWell the information is important because information is what changes your life\nUm you don't you you know you can listen to music and or if you're if for those of you in the car all day I mean if you listen to the same if you listen to him all the time you get the same song about over what the hour and a half or so now putting all loop and I like the music I enjoy that I Would talk radio in general but\nSo you're just gonna keep it in your house payment for now and get these kids through school and of course as you get school quote unquote taken care of\nA meaning that you know you've got enough money for them to finish without that then you start reaching over and knocked in extra home the house at that point\nAnd the value of the house or the ... or the ... the value of the house increasing or decreasing during that time I Would just dictate whether I keep bath towels but it wouldn't dictate whether Russia which the baby steps\nRight and is there an unconventional thinking that maybe we haven't thought of as far as the house that we did do a ... a um [noise]\nOh you call it a a a harp alone you know several years ago to to help us out with a uh [noise]\nYou know I'm blown re decrease that was a good good but um you know we get we're still twenty four into it I Can't see paying money to go to a Fifteen even at this point it would cost money to save money I feel like it would just\nBe I Would prefer it out for you pay extra on the house after you've gotten college for sixteen year olds lined up that's what I'm saying right and so you're paying minimum payments on the house right now until we get this college thing now have you told me he had a one year old and a three year old\nI Would say well let's just start something for kids college fifty hundred bucks a month or something so we know we kind of exercising their college muscle and then we'll reach over knock the house out you know uh but but in your situation what's your household income\nRate at a hundred ... a little bit of bunker that's good okay and you go to something on the house still\nNo we're one Seventy seven oh good okay so and the the the kids are what age sixteen and\nNo they are uh a fourteen and Thirteen\nFourteen and thirteenth oh crap out somewhere at a sixty minute okay uh well so you got for years and five years before they go to school if you watch what you're doing and they choose in the state schools you probably could get that funded by the time they get there\nAnd then you're done and then after that there was the last five years you just whatever's left on the mortgage we reach over and start beating on it\nYes sir and of course during that time typical your income going to go up\nThat's what we were for every day right there when we typically in terms overtime go up unless you know\nPlus or minus situations you know but but typically that's what you're faced with so you're you're heading in the right way you're doing the stuff around and I'm just going to move that college thing up because you've got teenagers and I'm just there's not move it up I'm On a loaded up before I Move on past five maybe step five said he is in Olympia, Washington how how are you\nHow are you better than others are what's up\nAnd really we're listener I probably maybe maybe maybe around and and ...
