{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Felt like we didn't tell you all last week seven in Monday and Tuesday\nAnd time once yeah I'm In any case it is a\nGoing to be an important vote here in the state we in particular for the role of governor I Would say\nUm we could have a historic vote Stacey Abrams when she would be the first woman governor and the first black woman governor in our state so that would be a she'd be the first woman governor in our state and the first black woman governor full stop nationwide yeah so uh that would be a pretty phenomenal just from a gender and race perspective\nAnd amazing but um you know if you're not if you're not on her side then I guess that really doesn't matter um\nWhat's you know of course happening now happens every election season and that is that the negative political ads are\nRunning rampant on the television stations if you watch TV it's pretty hard to mess or I Try to fast forward through as much of that as I can because bill um but I Do have a question about it\nDo you feel like that influences you if you hear something on a negative ad do you a just believe it be think I Need to check and see if that's really true you know or see none of the above you just sort of discounted as the other person's you know\nThe trail um I I think what's probably more real than not in all of the negative ads is that there's some kernel of truth to it that is blown up beyond what it\nReally is or what it really means for the sake of the ad and what's sad to me is that we don't seem to be any closer to ending the world with negative political ads because apparently they work\nAnd in fact they get your attention far more than any positive ad ever has\nWhat does it say about us as humans we just love a train wreck\nYou know we just love a catastrophe I mean even watching the storm coverage over the last twenty four hours has been phenomenal I put the TV on several times over the course of the last\nTwenty four hours or as I was due to check the news and every station is hurricane nonstop\nNow I'm ... I'm sure that's not as true if you were watching the local news and you know Wyoming um but certainly on the national news that is pretty much all they were talking\nAbout and if you don't live right there\nI Would argue or somewhere near here I mean arguably we're going to get hit by a little bit of that so it's more interesting here and we might be more likely to have family or friends or vacation homes in those areas and maybe it's more relevant here in Georgia\nBut still I mean this is what the national coverage is I mean so much so that even the talk shows last night you know the conversation shows on Fox and CNN were filled with hurricane coverage it's because we love a train wreck\nAnd that I mean with the\nWeather train wrecks we get to watch the train coming we get to watch the train before it even heads the other trained\nAnd and we just cannot turn away um and I think that is the same kind of mentality that draws us to the negative political ads\nIt's it's it's ... you know it's gossipy it's\nSomething that we can grab on to you and and argue about and talk about it the water cooler work and they still have water cooler seven oh maybe a little bit because I have one here okay little water ... but no one calls them that anymore I just had my address [laughter]\nThe break room will just say the brick okay people still have those right okay way people still take breaks okay you\nKnow to know that I'm\nIn any case you know I think it's unfortunate and once again I Would love to challenge\nYou all to to to those out first of all um\nAnd to do real research on the candidates the best you can ah to go on line to listen to the debates or to listen to the interviews um to go to the website of the candidates themselves and to read their platform what they stand for\nGood at a party Web site go to the Democratic party website in the Republican Party website and read the platforms I think you'll be surprised I actually have done it I got curious I said what are these guys stand for for real these\nLike not just what we think from watching the news or Fox or CNN or or whatever I Want to know and actually went to uh the Democratic website and the Republican a website and I was surprised at some of what's on both platform so I think it's worth checking those things out and trying\nTo you know make a real informed decision not a team decision on a party decision and not a decision that is swayed a solely by\nThe train wrecks that are negative ads and or you know the gossip of your friends at the at the in the brain cramp\nCouldn't help but I wanted to go right back to the water cooler um\nOkay on that front it's also we're lucky enough already time to start talking about twenty twenty and who is going to be running and twenty twenty side note I like it it's twenty twenty\nI mean just that the number is twenty twenty because you know it has so many implications perfect vision right and he's twenty twenty I think about the ... yeah just kind of an interesting number but in any case um you know obviously we know Trump is going to run I mean is already running\nFor president and twenty twenty uh he really started campaigning for that role and it's not a secret I mean he openly started campaigning for that role right away um the question on the Republican side of course we'll be does it get a does he have any challengers and uh how seriously does the Republican Party take that if at all\nRight now or the Republican Party seems to be pretty\nYou know high on Trump and and uh obviously the midterms are going to impact that one way or the other right we're going to see uh what the what the midterms due to that if the\nIf they keep the Senate and the house if the Republicans keep a Senate and house I would be surprised if you saw any body really seriously coming out uh to uh to give Trump around for his money on the on the right on the left they're going to try their darnedest\nTo get somebody better than Trump to beat him and Trump has said on many occasions that he is ready you will take on any challenger he will fight Joe Biden out in the back in the playground or whatever it is the two of them want to do I don't know\nHe he feels like he's got this in the bag and he's ready to go that's what he's expressed every time he's been asked so who is going to run a lot that is the question right now\nUh nobody is saying I'm In a hundred percent but a lot of people are not saying they're out either and a lot of them are expressing some signaling if you will some interest a little bit more in just the other day a\nSaid flat out I may I may run right she didn't say I'm I'm running but she gave a I I mean\nThere could be it could happen sort of thing or Cory Booker is another name that we're hearing tossed around quite a bit and he's been doing a lot of speech defined and trying to have moments and so he could be a potential candidate in twenty twenty uh\nInterestingly enough earlier today a story broke about Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York\nHe has changed his party affiliation again a he has now been everything I don't think you've been a member of the Green Party or the Tea Party or the Dana party\nWas a libertarian think it will pull it wasn't me for a short meeting he definitely was a Republican and independent and as of today he's a registered Democrat so that happened today a\nAnd he has apparently weighing a bed of on the Democratic side for a run and twenty twenty\nI think he could be a really interesting candidate for a number of reasons but one is that he is self funded like Trump was so he is a billionaire also in his own right and doesn't need to take money from anybody to do his campaign I'm\nAlso he is a fiscal conservative social liberal\nWhich I think is true for a lot of people I mean not as how I describe myself and I think there are people on both sides who would find that philosophy attractive now they may not find him to be the right guy for the job but I think it would find that philosophy very attractive\nUm what does that do to you know the the far reaches of either party the Bernie's and the Trump I don't know\nUm it all remains to be seen and then of course there's uncle Joe Joe Biden ah also not you know saying that he he might run\nCan we plant I think there are many people who Democrats for Trump\nNot a single sperm count and I can think of the nomination and I'm not one at this point [noise]\nDoes not have a better understanding and formulation of American foreign policy prison I\nGuess in a dig at President Trump highlights all the Democrats who would be better than Trump at foreign policy and throws in and I'm not running yeah at this point I'm not running at this point so a lot is going to happen obviously\nBetween now and the race and twenty twenty a first among all of that will be the midterms and the outcome of the midterms is going to influence all of this as well as going to be interesting to watch and we will keep you up on all of it I'm not no we're at a time we'll be back tomorrow you that [laughter]\n[noise]\nFalls in on Facebook and Twitter ashes buried in a very nice when you're on TALK radio says forty [noise]\nNBC News radio on ... hurricane Michael becomes a horrible memory to clean up is in full swing in large parts of the southeast Florida task force for member luckily comes pillow says this was different than Hurricane Harvey which helped with last year\nYou would be a renter with an option to purchase the house for the loan balance for a number of years until you get your other debts paid off now much of the dead of you got\nLike that could be four thousand left on their own\nOkay ...\nOkay so she moves out you move in and around that you sell your house oh how much where you're much equity way to get out of your house\nMaybe sit down and not very much at all\nI'm going to sound like celebrate the baby the baby step to a little bit ... the payments not too high that doesn't bother me a when you ... what's the ... you have any idea what they're afraid is on the loan\nUm Luther she writes refinanced about I'm ... years ago and I would imagine that it's not very high\nIt's reasonable so it so it's reasonable to show you could get a mortgage that was a very similar rate and payment when you get ready to purchase it after you get out of baby step to and get your emergency fund on and baby step three but it's going to take you a little while to do that a little bit longer because you're eight hundred bucks it's ten thousand dollars a year more to live there\nRight [noise] well I don't know if I Would do it or just because of emotions are but this is not a bad\nThing you're just a renter here's your worst case scenario you're a renter you've sold your house you're renting your mother in law's house and you realize you can't afford it and so then your mother in law will do what she would have done if you say no now and she will sell the house and you will have to move\nAs you say no now she needs to just sell the house right [laughter] okay so you could try it and say no later no harm\nNo file okay\nBut you don't have to be ... you don't want to sign a contract to be obligated as we're going to go in Iran try it we're going to rent it for the payment and we won a written contract that we're renting it for the payment or brothers or sisters anywhere\nUm there is a brother\nAnd he made by going to be pissed off about the fact you're getting all this equity given to you\nKnow you sure as far as I understand that now there\nYeah I think we're all having coffee in one big pile and talking about this this is how families end up not speaking to each other generationally okay so yeah we're all going to talk about it and we're going to do this in writing I Want you to lease it with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance\n[laughter] lease it for the payment was an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance and then just like you or rent or somewhere else and you decided you couldn't stay than she would just sell it then and that's no different than her selling it now accept that may have gone up a little bit in value and she might get a little more money out of it\n\nDoesn't hurt to give this a try the only thing it hurts is eight hundred bucks a month more rent but it's if there's if this was a place you see yourself living for many many many years like the rest of your life maybe\nI'm probably given Iran at this and partly because of the emotion here emotions okay personal finances personal\nAnd that doesn't mean it's situational a ethical or that the truth changes it just means you look at it and you go to them that I Do them you know that the car sitting in the driveway I rebuilt it from the time I was Thirteen to the time I was Nineteen when my dad and he died two years later I'm not selling that car\nThat car sitting in the driveway I bought a three weeks ago when I was stupid and smoking crack when I bought the car I'm selling that car\nThere's a difference in the both of them are car both of them are sitting in the driveway both of them are transaction that needs to occur but we're going to factor in you know that there's something real ... about the connectivity till the item\nAnd it's a reason reasonable people would acknowledge that can activity you cannot do personal finance without it also being personal\nThat's why people don't get out of that really don't get mad enough and you got to get mad [noise] getting mad personal

years ago they got you on this journey\nSo it probably goes back a little further than five years but uh we were at a point in our marriage where we we paid attorneys and we were headed for divorce so we have a huge family we have six kids between the two of us feel a lot of stress with a blended family mhm a lot of chaos and\nBoth of us spend money like crazy and and um we paid six thousand dollars to attorneys and we were I left the house to took our youngest child and ... and just ...\nA friend of mine invited me on to see you and you were doing a tunnel a makeover event and she had invited me to go see you and I didn't know who you are but I didn't want to be at home with him I said sure I'll go see you\nAnd I was at the arena yes I was like five thousand or email policy and we had a friend yes uh-huh and so we I went to go see you and I'm\nAt a lot of issues that I hadn't dealt with from my childhood and from for life and I just stuffed them down and I was spending like crazy and I didn't know that I was the majority of the problem in our relationship and then when you said um if you have a problem with money it's not the money you\nKnow it just kind of lifted blinders off my eyes and I realized OK I'm problems and and\nThen I had to do something to to get all that out take take take slice off once I went home and I begged him to get a shot and I bought your starter ... when I was there and um and we started our journey\nThere were ... were retook the Thirteen week a few class at our church we started back to church I order of along separation from somebody in regular tenders and went through a marriage recovery program and we just go to a really awesome church or churches\nCity church to their hands what city church ... yeah it was it was God just working and our lives in front of the moment\nYou know forever but really from the ... we started this plan it just everything started getting better and and we were closer together and we were on the same page and um it's just amazing\nAnd it took us thinking Fifteen months to pay off all all of the non mortgage that a hundred and almost a hundred and ten thousand dollars we sold everything inside and she wasn't nailed down in our house and I mean when\nThe show which flipped with you to his foot up doesn't it yeah I Know you went from a whole whole spending stupid all the way over to a wide open smart yeah yeah wow that's a true one eighty yeah\nWe just it was like the horses that you talked about in your SPF classes and\nThen we just got together and we are nothing was going to stop us and we ate beans and cheese every\nScene and we're going out to dinner tonight at a fairly extravagant good and we're stressed out good no I just want to have that we've we've stayed plugged\nIn the block and he was like six or Ninety and mocked which seem to be high but you're supposed to be temporary so fast forward to today\nWe are in contract to buy a home up inverted Colorado and we had an offer in our house for cash all cash offer we're supposed to hold on our home this very day to buy the new one and then next Thursday when this one\nWell apparently or wheelchair did not stress to the buyers how they needed to put in the tragedy actual application\nOnto a shirt that kid mom and buying a house for him does not have a job so he probably on the verge of being disqualified combine this home and were freaking out because we took on Monday at sixty day loan out of my husband's IRA because it's it's kind of\nWanted to do that\n[laughter] well yeah that's exactly what had been paid them all night 'cause we ... we just thought it was just going to be a temporary transaction oh I put it back in right away and no penalties\nCredentials on your do you know would still be on Thursday at all what happens if you don't close on Thursday\nI what being told if we had the option to put a three percent down into recast as soon as we sell our house and I wanted to know what you felt about these re casting of loans you\nWhat is your don't close on Thursday\nI get to do the deal is going to be and you have backup offers already and they said their home\nOkay so ... this was a knock the manufactured home this is a homeowner\nYes the manufacturing home actually standing to make a ten to twelve thousand dollars\nYou know how much of a much of an earth my trick that you put\nWe put three thousand down\nAnd you're probably gonna lose that if you don't close\nRight and\nAnd we're going to have a contingency on the sale of your other home\nYou know they would not allow him to continue it out here a house gets really fit in almost sold by the end of the day\nYou know showing 'em ... you know so the market you know so um and here's what you're doing you're getting desperate and every time I get desperate I get stupid and you're above either need to not close on this house Thursday Politico\nIs [noise] okay [laughter] that's what I'm telling myself in the house but how do the work I Know in our house and and you know we feel like we're giving throwing away she turned Ninety dollars a month this year and\nYou know you might be but it's just a house it was six hundred and Ninety dollars major problem we're getting ready to make a multi hundred thousand dollar problem and then if your house doesn't sell over back in Iowa for two years Europe or creek and\nLive out here in in any I'm more in Longmont, Colorado we're seeing the manufactured home\nIn Long Beach the manufactured home that didn't that the kids who are closing down\nYeah his mom okay you know there are a lot of it all cash deal okay and\nWe just found out yesterday for a realtor which he assured if the kid had already put this application for weeks ago when he put the author and for her and we didn't turn out\nYou just need to sit there and you're manufacturing home and manufactured home until you get it so when you get it sold and when it closes only then can you close on another purchased [noise] and if that me and if that means you rent for a little while in between the manger for a little while in between and you're going to end up with two houses\nYeah I Know don't do I need to be honest you\nDon't do it on how about before rather well appreciate that but don't do it you know what happens is is you get caught everybody does issue I'd do it do you've done it you get caught up in the the the narrative of this the story of this\nAnd it starts to feel like you're stuck and you have to do things but you don't have to do anything\nThat might have been like we don't have any interest to house I know it's just how you're in but when\nYou remember how your heartfelt big an open when you move to Colorado and you're going to try to adventure\nI Know everybody kind of their claim this is the opposite of that I Know your heart I feel like it's in a cage and it yeah I told my husband I feel cornered right now in a quiet evening we had\nYou know why you feel cornered is cause your corner wondering why he was real court so here's what you do in your corner you throw up your hands and you walk out\nYet I did that last night I walked out with my husband we tracked it I Can't even say anymore\nI as a matter of not dealing with it I'm not talking about a voyage sometime you well know Neal ... I'll be happy to\nClose on this deal when my trailer cells yeah\nWhen my trailer is so my trailer has a so I Can't close until that happens and so if you guys have to dump us in the street dump us in the street and go on to the next guy and that's\nProbably what's gonna happen oh well there's a house on every corner in Denver you'll get you another house and don't get desperate 'cause as soon as you feel cornered as soon as you feel desperate as soon as you feel forced that's when you do stupid stuff and there's realtors feeling desperate they're trying to get your clothes on something you should be close on\nIt should've been a contingency to start with but now we're going to make it on 'cause you're just not going to close because if you do you're going to regret it you're going to end up owning both of these houses for ten years\nAnd then you're going to have a real problem it's going to damage or financial is just going to take a decade to recover from a bad decision walk away or tell them just we're going to have the brakes boys and girls until this thing closes if we can get this closed\nAnd we'll close if we can't and we're not going to be able to oh we're gonna go to the next guy well [noise]\nUm I understand you have the right to do that 'cause I'm not closing on Thursday\nAnd then but if you want to wait on us we'll be happy to close on it will keep our word but it's got to be based on this thing selling and um I Would walk to exactly what I Do calm down [noise] mark is with us in Indianapolis I mark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThank you for your service sir thank you how can I help launch sixty and I have six little properties three that are free and clear and three that small mortgages and I just always assumed that we would probably sell one of the time are basically about now they'll start now and\nAnd that would be part of your retirement and a friend of mine said well wait a minute you there will be with the uh the reason I thought we needed to sell them I thought that to Social Security at a limit of around fourteen thousand or so that you can make per year before they uh [noise]\nYou know and he says way long held investment tidal ...\nI think there's just passive income and doesn't apply you need to check that out I agree with them I'm not positive but I wouldn't keep I wouldn't sell a good investment\nJust to change my Social Security stuff Social Security is not that big a part of the equation these properties or two if they're good properties I'd keep them even if it does mess up Social Security\nWhere they're profitable we'd been I guess you'd say like that's all it but they're not the you know there is Britain butter round the tree bedroom one bath how the how best can\nStay rented it was a big market for 'em right\n[noise] yeah yeah but it was huge 'cause I Know you know rich period I mean when you're sixteen fifty five on this and you're saying you've been through with runners and\nIf you don't want for renters lots of different equation but I'm not selling them to get out of Social Security bravo\nI may or may not cause they're so scared abroad may be passive income might not come up with Social Security but you might want to sell 'em anyway if you just don't like being on the runners anymore but overall is real estate investment to carry all the way through retirement if you don't mind messing with it yes it's a good investment and this is\nThe ...

charge of minutes at sales for Wells Fargo\nAnd I'm I'm a full time stay at home mom but during that process I was a um health and fitness coach\nOkay very good and what kind of that was the sixty nine thousand dollars a couple of cars and a little bit of student loan left\nCool did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off no we just pay them off our got us into the travel okay very cool but nine months ago some kind of a switch flip because when you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car needing right um other when you're going out and we decided to ... to the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we wanted and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we did the brand new\nAnd it was then we're just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though we can pay it no problem it was just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future so we just we went ... intensity near term so mhm\nSo how did you get into where in this process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following pod cast a lot of time on the road and always listen to it as I can read we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church\nBracing center and so we uh got that started right about the time we started we got everything in line to start a few in January at our church and we did that and so it was kind of we started it and then as we got a few we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on a second session I'm loving it\nSo well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that so that you you can attend and may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of stems from what drove me to it because I Believe in modeling all behaviors and so if I'm going to model what I wanted my children have in the future I had the model at my house\nNow my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Morris caught them taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out I mean oh my goodness you know that's what happened but it's happened on this show can hear much [laughter]\nSo well done you guys very well done so when you have someone in your class and\nThe show up for financial peace and they're not game on because they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole hasn't kicked in yet the belief housing kicked in yet what do you tell them they need to do\nTo be debt free one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars and nine\nMonths we don't do that and\nYou start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them well\nThere's kind of a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as two of you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just flies through the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWell that's really true but generally true okay\n[noise]\nI I thought about and uh I'm I'm already starting now planning on um I'm trying to get jobs or at least one or two jobs over the summer work forty hours really keep it on the gear it could get off this with credit cards\nThem and you're you said you're a college professor or what subjects do you teach\nTeach theology specifically for individuals with disabilities\nWow and I would guess that would also apply to athletes would it not\nNo my athletes it can be disability sports but my research specifically for people who have the ability of cognitive disabilities and they have trouble getting out of the couch and exercise are being physically active mount more toward the competitive fun yeah\nOkay I Would think an independent practice separate from your teaching where you worked hand a hand in glove with some therapy people into therapy community\nA would be ideal for an on going extra income and your jacket up a lot during the summer\nOr in a sense you're you're a tutoring if you will your own students are but you're using your research and your expertise in your information\nThat ought to be very valuable uh and that you could build a coke business consulting business working with therapists are that you come in and and you know supplement what they're doing it and move things alone so I I think you've got a real upside there on your income that's exciting stops\nWesley with us in Pensacola Hi Wesley welcome to the ...\nThank you Dave how're you doing today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so a little background my wife and I graduated college last year a completely debt free I'm and I'm looking into trying to get a separate vehicle because right now we've been driving or like you said a ... you got a a United States marine driving a few hundred thousand miles Korea so thanks for that\nBut I [laughter] I thought driving the base but whatever [laughter] I\nLive in the car payments because I told my buddy as you also that struck me told me about it fifty thousand dollar car and I'm like we need to talk\nAnyway so my question is I'm trying to figure out what to do next because I Want to get rid of the press they don't want to replace it with a\nTruck and I've got a Nineteen sixty four Chevy back home um and my uncle is willing to buy your labor for me for free or they get it fixed up when you engineer for training in all kinds of stuff it's really sweet looking shot truck\nA problem for the is that you know it's not going to be quite as reliable probably not going to be reliable as a moderate our way the\nLaw which would would you buy a considered going down the road and you know\nDumping a couple of dollars into this truck and make it you know what\nYou know driving around or do you you know save up and wait for a vehicle later on\nI think the trucks a keeper and it's a project truck that you work on after you get your financial straightened out\nOkay um so I I think that previous was going to be hated to I'm with you but [laughter] but I think it's going to be a lot more reliable than a fixed up sixty four I've got a ... I got a Nineteen sixty Baptists rebuild from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... to four but dual start for barrels on it it's a beast\nOr not but but it is a project car I mean they you you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be some day um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car with what you would have spent on the truck motor and that kinda stuff\nAnd move into a little different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a ... D move up kind of a thing then I'd be okay with that if you want to do that\nBut um but I don't think I'd let that truck get away and I want to do the project 'cause it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin Hi Josh how are you\n[noise] I'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I've got a question um regarding a credit card from business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here 'cause I'm looking for some by [noise] um my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off all of our debt at about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um\n[noise] I work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and\nWe are required basically ... you know pay for some of those business expenses during the trip that money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to fee\nPays for that but we have to kind of want that money I had the time um [noise] we've closed all of our credit cards\nExcept for the one for the business trips because we don't have money\nYou know set aside to be able to pay for the fences I might have been much of the expenses run a month [noise] well I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it get anywhere from a thousand three thousand dollars coverage and the hotel mood\nAnd then you're you're going to get the money back then you get the money back within thirty Dutch\nYeah OK correct so mean we're we're paying we hang that off and and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use of\nThe ... you need to see that one time you need to ... from the one time or two thousand dollars in a separate ... new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing reimburse ...\nBusiness travel and you use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not pay you back\nA little company you're taking a big risk sure you're\nYou're the bank or for the small company that is too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary\nAt some point they may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nLong now so that the company that when you go and visit they they don't they don't\nPay you they pay your company and then your company pays you write your company goes broke they're going to take that money from that other company and pay other bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold some day sure I've seen it happen I've been doing it as Thirty years or seen happen a lot\nOkay so then where does or does that fit in with\nThat leaves you well known as up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I Would do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk I Will tell you I'm going to go back to your little bitty company and say gosh I'm Out of that\nI don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back\nIt's only two thousand dollar right\nI don't ask people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person\nThis trying to feed their dogs and their kids and keep their own and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on there on them know this company here pays for their airline tickets so we pay for the rental car and we pay for their hotel in their food when they travel I don't have somebody here to travel and\nOn it and I ... and that's why we don't have any money like I paid a thousand on line and Seventeen thousand on either one could be worked really hard\nTo watch your household income\nOne thirty year [laughter] that's\nGood okay and you're for paid for rentals and they have this one okay yeah um how quickly\nCan you play this one off if you really lean into it like you did before\nI rarely ... any to hear what's going to be very\nOkay yeah I Would think you could yeah\nThat sounds right and then what I Would do is I Would build up character and I would never buy anything else again so what I Would ask you to talk about tonight turn off the television sit down at the kitchen table tonight looked at each other and go okay do we want to sacrifice really deeply out of our lifestyle\nAnd make a hundred and thirty thousand a year we got for paid for rentals but do we want to act like we're broke people and poor at all on to this rental for two years is this rental worth that to us so we can knock this out really really fast\nAnd then never do it again\nOr kind of a no horn and we want to sell it but I don't want to but I don't want to keep it with NO PLAN to pay it off fast\nOkay and then here's the other thing no more Home Depot credit cards no more sign up for dental rentals if the best way to do it is to live to free the nationally live debt free yeah stop it yeah\nYou got to decide which way you're going to be like you got one foot on the boat one on the dock philosophically yeah\nSo um you know decide because I think you were really doing good until we got to Home Depot and borrow money for rental and then you kinda like lost your mind for a minute\nOr\nThat's what it sounds like ... now you can clean it up I mean you cleaned up the Home Depot which ... moved over to this deal now we can clean it up by either selling it or we can lean into it for two years\nAnd I have no life and clean this thing up and here's this rental wars that we love that rental that much\nI you know I don't know if you do or not you might I like real estate I might do it but I wouldn't do it again the next time you get ready to buy something at home depot pay cash for the next time you get ... to ... to buy rental you pay cash for it regardless of what you do with this rental but I Would do one of the others\nThat's what I Would do so thanks for calling it sounds like you guys got a lot going on I mean you're making good money you get your school
