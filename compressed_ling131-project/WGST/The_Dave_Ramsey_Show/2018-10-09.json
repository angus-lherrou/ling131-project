be some fine line and all of that um we're seeing different\nYou know parts of our\nYou know different groups of Americans I guess is the way to say at wanting different things and I think the younger generation in particular\nA younger workforce if you will also is a very much wanting different things and maybe they're older counterparts you know the ... of which I Am one we were kind of raise to just make as much money as you can at all costs you know that that was like we were raised in the air of get on the corporate ladder climb as high as you can make as much money as you can\nI'm not that we were raised to be unethical um but we were raised to be materialistic capitalistic and it was all about making as much money as you can and the ethics and morals of it really weren't the point\nI'm as evidenced by the movies of the time that were popular and all of that\nBut the younger generation sees things a little bit differently I bring all of that up in our tech Tuesday show

is no reason to your house okay like\nAtlanta most hated I I wouldn't do it to blow that\nTo blow up that amount of that um if you told me out a hundred and you can sell the house and clear a hundred and you're making eighty starts to be kind of tempting 'cause you're gonna have a long slog but you can knock out already sick so here's what I Would do\nI think I Would table that decision for now

years and five months ago when a switch flipped tell me what happened\nSo a great story but it started five years ago today when we got married a very good two months after that we decided to buy a house and our debt went from about two hundred and fifty to three hundred and two thousand dollars ...\nAnd uh we started on their own path not sharing the debt I was to pay off what I did and she was to pay off her part mhm and I I made a really brilliant decision and I bought a flu on a credit card oh good three hundred dollar\nHuge money argument that wasn't an argument was an ultimatum he said I'm not doing this again\nThis is a second marriage for both of us\nAnd now she had money problems before with her previous mhm and wasn't going to do it again so I said\nI don't know how to do it but I Know a guy who does\nAnd I let her over to the podcast and that started I wrote\nWhoa very cool very far shows the flu to broke the camel's back up the aisle attitude\nAutor from his first marriage and uh she the oldest is going to start band and he went home charged it and I thought what\nOkay now\nWell it's it's you know that's good you should you know buying your daughter flew much more sense yeah [laughter] wow I just didn't so you play in the flu to visualize\nAbout uh the firefighter the flu guy but yeah okay whatever [laughter]\nA good a fun very fun you guys OK so yeah you did look up and you realize last time a one lady told me she said my start her husband is the first one\nShe said that time I figured out that this doesn't work and I'm not doing this again that's a good line that I've had you had an I've had a moment and uh\nThey all said okay I'm with you I've had it to let's fix this so it wasn't a I'm a\n... this long drawn out argument but it was kind of just hit the balls and no okay look just wait we've got two ways that were there is a way that works in a way that doesn't work why we're doing it doesn't work\nExactly well and I had never really heard of before and I didn't even know how to use a pot cafes even know what a pod cast was and so when Dale charge the flute at the time we kept our finances separate ... and I said we're getting ready to go on a\nVacation Italy mhm and I said I Can't do it if you if you have credit card debt ... so we cancel that bowl and I went on a yoga retreat on my own ...\nIn part of that retreat was four hours of meditation and I listen to your\n[laughter]\nAnd I came back and said okay I'm ready to do that that that want to work where he can do this guy okay and so then you got the books are financial peace university or what or just listen to the project\nI'm mostly we listen to the ... that's good then we thought the book and then we've led 'em as to you oh okay so I did all\nBecause the property is actually owned by the ... you the items are owned by the press if you don't do that then the ... says no benefit that's called funding the trust re titled ... everything you own end of the name of the trust which is a bit expensive two and a lot cumbersome\nUm consequently I was reading in financial planning magazine the other day article that said Seventy eight percent of the trust that our former never fun to many people pay their stupid lawyer their financial advisor thirty five hundred bucks to build the trust and then they never retired all the stuff in the name of trust which means that trust has absolutely nothing it's got nothing in it\nAnd so it's it's absolutely no value\nSo I don't use living ... uh I don't personally use living trust and I have a substantial network with a lot of detailed\nEstate planning now I Do have some ... I have a couple of trust here or there but the they have different functions then what this guy is describing and so no I Would not build a trust now you can set up and you have your attorney or a state planning attorney do this not your financial advisor\nI trust to a family trust to be formed upon your death\nAnd upon your desk the money if both of you die and you have minor children the money goes into addressed and then it's management to go to the children was talking about that and the first segment of the shower\nAnd um or a second second mother is our I guess but you can do that that's that's not that hard to do\nAnd it doesn't really cost anything because there's no trust being formed and no trust happening unless both of you died I had that in my will when my children were minors\nAnd then of course my will has changed since the children are of age they're no longer legally children emotionally either for that matter but there we go so I mean some of you have children that are emotionally still minors but of chronologically moved on like the guy [laughter]\nThirty Years' old ask him what he did for a living he said I'm a stay at home son [laughter] I'm a stay at our own sun [laughter] what a cure but in the street [laughter]\nMy name is Mike in Chicago [laughter] my ...\nI'm good how are you doing better than I deserve was up\nSo I have a baby too I have a ton of medical bills um and recently I was originally paying ten bucks a month for a medical bill that I had\nA they stopped it was an automatic withdrawal and I stopped taking out and they've sent my account to collections and then to a lawyer and refinance Feldman to court ... I'm I'm just trying to figure out what my\nOptions are all if I Need to hire a lawyer or what I Need to do\nMuch on that bill\nA Fifteen sixty one thousand five hundred and sixty\nOkay and what's your household income or about Seventy five thousand dollars for him and what ten dollars a month because of all the other bills\nYeah I got all kind of a hundred dollars in medical bills and a lot of credit card as well student loan\nSo what's what's the total medical bill balance\nOf all the medical bills and I have are probably Fifteen thousand dollars mhm him and my daughter just diagnosed with a few other medical issues that more bills will be coming show\nHow to get a dollar and a three okay and what were the medical issues\nShe has called ... syndrome a a carry mail formation and then she was diagnosed with epilepsy ...\nOkay you gotta do you guys have had a hard time with this little baby girl honey\nYeah yeah she's got a few ... ever since she was born so they have a lot of things going on [noise]\nAnd how much credit card that do you have a lawyer\nProbably at twenty five thousand dollars mhm\nAnd how much they're going to have\nThat one up there that's about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars ...\nWho's the doctor [laughter] I'm just at the trial I stay at home mom [noise]\nHuh [noise] All right [noise] um well what normally happens if you have a heart and you're a good\nPerson and you have a baby that is sick you pay all of your attention to the baby and it drains every drop of emotion and love and concentration and focus out of your family your body and your life and it's all directed at this baby\nAnd that's ... that's what's happened to you which just means you're a good dad and the good husband you guys and cannot paid attention to the money at all and all that means is your human\nIt's screwing up your life now and you're going to have to deal with it right [noise] yeah so as tough as it is I'm your daughter is not going to get one hundred percent of your attention anymore\nI'm your money's going to have to get some percentage until you get this thing back under control so let's put the student loans or if they're not already on hardship for all um if you scrape together five to seven hundred dollars on offer it to the attorney on this Fifteen hundred dollars as a lump sum settlement they'll take it\nOkay 'cause we called today are very feminine fairly called today that you know we ... what can we do and they just said\nUm you either pay the full amount of core cheese and attorney fees or hire a lawyer well for you in court\nOkay and you can call them back and say I've got five hundred bucks I can use that for a lawyer or I can give it to you to settle this debt which one do you want to\nBe okay and what if they don't take that and then\nYou know you keep messing with the national weather and messing with them because they're gonna listen you're dealing not with an attorney you're probably not even dealing with a paralegal you're dealing with a large law firm\nThat runs medical collections through like a wage it in a factory this is your life at your daughter it's the illness and the struggles it's got a lot of emotion tied to it to them\nThey have no soul there is nothing to this thing except you're just a number on a page\nAnd they have a whole bunch of numbers on a page they talked to ... stop thousand people like you every single day and they give everybody the exact same script\nOkay this is not like you owe me money and I called them we would actually talk about it yeah you're dealing with a robot in a factory and if you get that stuck in your head when you're done\nUm you know you're hearing really really good shape financially so um you ought to be able to coast\nAs long as you need to um the trick is I don't want you to settle for something [noise] um you know making sixty thousand bucks when you've made to sixty I'm closer because you've proven you're worth that over more than a fluke or you did it over a long period of time so we know that you have to\nUm\nUnbelievable world class skills one is you have an in depth knowledge of luxury motor homes and uh how they work and what makes them tick and how you can help somebody in a situation and so on there okay that is a very narrow set of a skills\nIt really has only one application in your city and you lost that job\nOkay the second thing we know is is that you know how to sell large ticket items to wealthy people\nAnd you're very good at it\nAnd so were you for instance to sell 'em\nAshton Martin ... or ...\nYou would be in a similar market\nAnd the downside is you don't know much about how they work you've never worked on them\nSo the curve would be but you know how to communicate serve closed the sale handle the service after the sale how a high end luxury buyer wants to be treated and needs to be treated in order to create repeat business you are an expert in that\nAnd I think that set of skills can be applied in other places would you agree\nKept her I don't care if you're selling a hundred thousand dollar watches if you want to do that that's fine I put ... I just came I went to something we're wheels on it because you had some wheels or motor before so you're mechanically inclined as well so maybe that's it but\nYou know I talked to a guy though they sell in the crowd out of high on cars and he used to be in the um recruiting business she used to sell a you know recruit people for jobs\nAnd it's just similar skill set because he was dealing with high on the executive placement and then he's dealing with a executive placement into cars and it it's the same set of people you're dealing with this thing to think the same way you know how to keep that kind of person moving unhappy\n[noise] and I think if you think if you broaden that out that why do you have you back off your pan out with your camera angle you'll see that and I think you're going to be fine so I wouldn't panic I'm\nThe only other thing I could think of is if you can kind of some kind of brokerage situation where you're brokering high end luxury RVs um for two hundred and fifty grand you can fly in and out of a city every so often and make a deal happen\nAnd so I mean you could go straight to manufacture or to a dealer of the same brand fired you but as in a much larger metropolitan area and sell to people\nAll over the nation and hand hold their hands in the process with a broker process I'm done I'm not sure where the leads come from not sure how that deal happens but um when you're dealing with sometimes two or three hundred thousand dollars airplane tickets are cheap\nAnd that makes that deal happened can't do that when you're making thirty five thousand but in your situation you there's a lot of stuff you can do um I mean you could be gone one night a week and jump around and really close some big deals you could sell a jets private jets\nThat's another thing that would fit perfectly\nIn your scenario um and the job market's pretty hot right now because the economy's booming couldn't give a jet away two years ago\nAnd now you can't find one show um you know that's another place you that you think of a luxury mechanical element that's all I'm doing I'm just brainstorming out loud here I think you've gotta lotta upside potential\nIt may take you six months to land in the right seat\nAnd but you got plenty of money you're alright get on a budget watch what you're doing\nDon't don't you're spending come up [noise]\nBut don't don't do something dumb and [noise]\nIt's a tenth of what you use to make and call that okay [noise] and don't say that was your passion either because I'll smack you\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nI Know it's back to school season but that doesn't mean you have to stress out about what's for dinner for almost ten years I've been telling you about my\nFriends that he meals who make meal planning and shopping virtually stress free you can even have your groceries gathered for pickup over delivery right from the emails that it's the smartest way to save money every month and you'll be a hero is your family each delicious healthy dinners together sign up for a free\nTwo week trial today at emails dot com that's easy meals dot com\nMoney fight we had them and unfortunately the leading causes of divorce in America today this is number one New York times best selling author Rachel created and are fast\nPaced culture a busy now sometimes our marriage is take a backseat suddenly we look up and realize it's been a while since we've focused attention on another important parts and are about why not get a finite to learn more about each other\nFile joint docking last pair at night and money and narrative that definitely gave him the dot com to raise their gear seats today\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nLegally and forever is with time share exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've accepted thousands\nOf timeshare owners this year alone they're the best in the business because they simply add more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process but there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit teams so confident in their exit service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund called eight\nFor for nine nine nine exit and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine or ... or timeshare exit team dot com\nAtlanta Dan Berrett here joined me weekdays from ... pm to get caught\nOn the stories of the day the Dana buried show is live and local and right here on TALK radio six forty W G.

opportunity to refinance and take cash out to pay off all our bed it'd be great to be out of debt a better one run there's by your first well you wouldn't be out of that\nYou would have just move the debt over onto your house\nDumb idea\nEighty eight percent of the time that people take debt con solid Asian loans out but don't change their habits and they're on their debts back up\nThe only time I tell people to move that into adept consolidation has to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure and you're not asking me about either one of those so I think your bank wants to see you deeply in debt does that's what banks do\nSo well is when a bank says\nHey I got a great idea what they're really saying is hey I can make some money off of you\nI mean really like playing with a skunk and wondering why you got sprayed seriously it's not it's not a pet it's a skunk\nThe only reasonable way to forecast investment returns\nUm is to say what they have done in the past\nOver a long period of time is likely to be what they will do in the future over a long period of time plus or minus wonderful and tragic events\nOkay guy which we can't predict those so if the economy booms in other words you can't predict that exactly\nIf the economy tanks you can't predict that exactly if somebody fires missile at us and it changes the economy you can't predict somebody's last couple of airplanes into a couple of towers you can't predict that but it will affect the economy so\nWhat we have to just give our best shot on that but the whole thing you've hurt you know a past our results are not indicative of future returns horseshoe crab which they are\nOtherwise you would buy and they buy a house in a ... crummy neighborhoods instead of a good neighborhood right\nYeah and so what we have here is what's known as a crummy neighborhood [laughter]\nGold as as not got a good track record long term as a matter of fact it sucks as an investment over a long period of time and so ... what's his gold and silver worth today if you catch it all in\nAround a hundred thousand so if we call a hundred thousand dollars in the military but would you buy gold and silver coins with it no no [laughter] okay for the same reason that you wouldn't buy them again you would sell them today now let's decide what we're going to be a hundred thousand oh you'd like to pay down the mortgage sure I'll go with that\nBut there's something for their separate decisions do you see what I'm saying [noise] kind of and to me the confusion as Matt\nI don't need the gold and silver like we can just plod along paying our mortgage cannot be gotten three and a half years\nNo no no no no it's not about the more\nIt's not about the only one more time hundred thousand dollars cash hundred dollar bills laying in the middle of your kitchen table uh-huh\nAre you going to buy gold with it I don't mean money but are we going to buy gold with it you know\nIf you keep this by tomorrow it's like you bought it again do you understand that mathematically\nYeah\nMaking the decision to keep it at the same as making the decision to buy it\nI could tell other people that when it comes to things like I'm OK Byron come at four O. one K. path of mortgage but had no\nOther implication like it's sitting there okay\nYou know it doesn't have an implication forget the mortgage mortgage pretend like we were going to go to Disneyland but the money All right I don't care what we're doing the money the point is the way you properly analyze whether to keep this goal is to say I have a hundred thousand dollar sitting in the middle of\nThe table would I buy gold with it\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd if you keep it tomorrow you bought it again and if you keep it the next day you bought it again every day and keep something it's as if you made the decision to purchase it again for its current market value\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that as long as you don't mind buying it so let me give you an example if you if you and I both thought or if you thought gold was going to double in the next year and you had evidence to make you actually believe that\nWe're going to turn a hundred thousand two hundred thousand and one year and you all and you and I both believe that are just you believe that and we had a hundred thousand dollars cash sitting in the middle of the table and I said would you buy goldie Hawn crappy ass 'cause I could turn a hundred in the two hundred\nRight yeah but we're making the decision then not based on what we paid for it we're making the decision based on what we think it's going to do in the future\nOkay the decision to buy or sell or hold theirs is based on the future not the past other than we use the past to project our future but then when we do that with gold it tells us to sell\nYeah ... satellite take your last take your lumps you made a dumb investment you lost a bunch of money that stupid tax now you've got a pile of money in the military but what do you wanna do with that money well modeled pals Morgan what the heck okay therefore decisions are two different decisions are two different buckets\nTo do ... proper critical thinking on this Jonah is in Dallas texas Hi Jonah how are you\nHey there how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a college student uh I have about ... between eight and ten thousand dollars a year that is coming in that I don't have anything to pay for where you're writing for everyone um it's a merit scholarship so that I get a bunch of extra money\nOkay good for you very cool man a merit based based on what your your grades or your citizenship or what\nUm my national merit had a I'm a national merit scholar\nOK and can you do anything to mess up\nUm I can but pretty it'd be a very high\nWhat's the or could you do that would mess it up if my GPA drops oh well All right well that that that's not that hard that's fairly easy okay yeah\nYou can drop a GPA pretty easy okay so what would I Do if I were in your shoes I Would pile up that money in a savings account as an insurance policy to ensure that I finished with no debt you are your best investment no I Would not invest this money\nOkay\nAnd and uh because you're you're the best investment mathematically what are you studying wrecked economic adult\nYeah you're a great investment you're going to do really well and and you're right you got all these great bass scholarship so you're you're a smart guy so yeah I I don't need what the ... I don't need you to have the money that the eight thousand dollars would make\nYou during the next two or three years I Do need you to graduate with these honors in this wonderful degree field and pay cash for it with no debt\nThat is a very very very important\nAnd that's exactly what I Would do in your situation thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five day but I'm thinking about getting financial ... going in my local union you have to be at a baby a certain baby step to be a coordinator\nNo we try not to have perfect people being our coordinators and we would prefer\nYou'd be wherever you is\nIf you're just getting started you want to be a coordinator you can coordinate a clash all we want you to tell the truth\nDon't go in there and like your some kind of dead gum rich financial person got all your act together if you don't just tell the truth I'm learning this with you people I don't know so many people are out of me I got my first baby step my first thousand dollars you can lead a clash\nIf you love people you can put chairs are circling leader discussion and stick to a plan that somebody else gives you\nThen You're welcome to lead\nAs a coordinator financial ... anywhere you want to lead it we'd love to have you\nGet in touch with our team and we'll help you get that set up Patrick\nAnd thank you thank you thank you for following us on Twitter\nYou can also follow us on Instagram we got about a million folks there we got about four and a half million five million Facebook\nReally is in Birmingham hey Emily welcome to the day Ramsey show\nI think and what's happened and\nI hadn't and I are having a little bit agreement I don't think he can help us out okay and I recently came in to a little bit of inheritance ... thing that my grandparents last year ... and I'm thinking that we have and\nTo that one being our mortgage and then the second thing our car ... and\nAnd my husband and wife and feel that that money should go towards the car and I am just to meaning it as a little bit more sentimental and wanting to go toward something a little bit more sentimental and I'm Wondering is incorrect\nIt kind of you that money is kind of like a final game didn't shake it can take away the emotions and jets go towards that\nShow you want to buy something with it\nWell yeah it's like I'm meeting and knew as as sweet as and appliances all mine and kind of been around for way too long and it was hardly working in the first place\nAnd my grandmother and when that taught me how to cook so I mean for me that would be kind of a more final gift I guess I Would say and but my husband and it's like hey if we have the extra money let\nIt toward a car I get that paid down\nAnd try and how much money's involved\nAt just under nine grand [noise] All right\nUm\nWell I analyze these things through sentimental limbs as well and uh the way I Would ask myself this is okay grandma was obviously good with their money\nShe left her grandkids and kids nine thousand bucks okay mhm um show grandma sitting in heaven looking at her grandbaby\nWhat makes her smile because her granddaughter did this with the money they're not thinking a dishwasher does that\n[laughter]\nNow I get the ... so she taught you to cook mhm I might take a thousand dollars and buy some cooking utensils so that every time I use that set of\nPots and pans or knives or whatever that I thought of ... I don't know why but the rest of it on my car but I think grandma probably with somebody that hate abet and she might be smiling as your butt off of that I got to agree with your husband\nOkay um but it's not like I'm not doing that through the lens of I'm calling your sentiments silly\nI'm just I'm I'm just saying you're sentiment you can actually use that to try to say okay this is a you know the the character of this woman issues are frugal person of saving person she was careful with their money my guess is she hated debt\nOr does that sound familiar I mean [noise] [noise]\nOh yeah fear fail they paid off all that lounge real estate and made it pretty much as their retirement\nYeah so I mean I think she'd be smiling it'd be better off your car but also think should be smiling if you'd spend you know a grand on some stuff do you use in the kitchen I get that unless balances out a little bit much the only car\nAt the time but I think twenty four twenty five thousand dollars for the ... what's your household and wouldn't pay it off they just don't get to what your household income\n[noise] uh right under added sugars here\nOkay All right well it's all going to get taken care of British in any way to show more than anything it's just an emotional discussion I don't I mean yeah as long as you don't um\nWell the ... or you know what what would have ensuring Ramsey do we would look at it through the lens of what what is was and that would also be pleasing to grandma and so I probably would buy you know I'd probably say sure and let's go get a really high end amazing set of\nCooking pots and pans are knobs or whatever drop a grand on it I don't know something like that and then let's throw the rest of it at this in honor of grandmother because I think she'd be
