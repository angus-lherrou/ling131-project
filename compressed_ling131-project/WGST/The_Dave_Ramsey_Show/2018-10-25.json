I'm I'm gonna I Am going to a little bit dropping like I'm not and I'm going to leave that subject alone we've got a few minutes left in the show I'm gonna switch gears on you\nBecause there's other stuff going on and well I had met that this is not a big news story I Do want to talk about it Megan Kelly making headlines um for the second time in two weeks because\nShe is losing her show now I Want to be clear if you read the full story she is not losing her show because of the reason she made headlines earlier was it this week or like a last week this week um she made a comment about dressing in blackface for Halloween and\nThat is not why her show is being cancelled it I think was the straw that broke the camel's back as they say um but I Want to get into this a little bit so first take a listen to the comments she made that got her in trouble earlier in the week\n[laughter] and you get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on or a black person who puts on weight we\nLike that that that was okay as long as you address another character in the controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she is Diana Ross and she made her skin look darker than it really is and people said that that was racist\nAnd I felt like who doesn't want to and she wants to look like a A N around for one day I I don't know how like that got races on Halloween\n[noise] All right after she made those comments again that was making Kelly I'm On her show with you know a panel obviously sitting are having a discussion and the comments essentially was not understanding how that it's racist or black based on even for Halloween that's essentially what she said\nOf course as as they should the inter webs went crazy\nAnd everybody you know was explaining to her all over the Internet why that was wrong but also um her colleagues uh were upset a lot of her colleague that NBC were upset and spoke to her about it\nUm\nAnd ah today I Believe starting today she's her live shows are not on she's in rerun and they're looking at having her out of their ... from what I understand that said she did do a show the day after this happened and she did something that I Am always a fan of that has apologized take a listen\nAnd I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry we may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or a white person making errors darker to make a costume complete\nI defended the idea saying as long as it as it was respectful and part of the Halloween costume it's loaded okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nYeah here's the problem you know I talked about this before we came on the air and Nick was saying um well I should let you speak for yourself you were saying she shouldn't be fired for that\nI think that this being you know her\nIf this was the reason that she was fired the thought okay because I feel like you know she\nWas just something I think a lot of people do it we just you don't know you have an honest kind of innocent feeling for one thing being that way but it is and you don't ... she didn't have a racist reason for thinking blackface was okay now fully her eyes were opened after the fact when she realized her own she was and she owned it so I think kind of good on her for that\nRight now there could have been mistakes we don't know about from the production team for example but at the right thing to do would have been to allow and you said this yourself to would have been to allow the conversation to continue in that moment where she could have dug ourselves back out of it she could have listened to the other people on the stage with her that we're telling her it was wrong a\nAnd said okay you're right I Apologize I shouldn't have said that I didn't I wasn't thinking about the history of it and so for people who don't understand the history of it is this black face was\nUsed to mock\nBlack people in Amos and Andy and things like that in that era\nAnd that is why it is not okay it it's not just ... it's not done respectfully it was used as a tool of mockery for a long period of time in this country\nAnd so that is why is not OK and she as a host of a major TV show she as someone who is making twenty three million dollars a year had a responsibility to do our homework on it before she spoke about her opinion on air\nThat's that's all there is to that but also to be clear she was not or she is not losing her show because of that she's losing her show\nBecause she doesn't she hasn't bringing in the ratings that they want and the show in working um she is not the draw a for NBC fans that she was for Fox News fans so it was a mistake that they made um NBC call me just than\nA on that now we are officially out of time for the day I Am Dana Barrett I Do my best people and I will be back tomorrow [noise]\nFollows\nIn on Facebook and Twitter Ashley dino beret turned into a very useful news here on TALK radio six forty to fifty and streaming live only find hard review um\n[noise]\nAnd the news

opioid addiction conference dishes as the Trump Administration condemns these violent acts\nI'm well a quick little background for you I'm twenty three and I live with my fiance here in indie\nUm we're in baby steps to and looking to pay off for about ten thousand dollars worth of debt by the end of the year I'm In Philly been attacking it hard um and the question is actually referring to [noise] like out there the sister who is twenty four she lives right now\nWith our parents um and she has just been a lot of trouble financially uh she's upside down on a car payment I Know and this really struggling career wise as well\nUm she's expressed a desire to come and ... with us for a while and indeed and get back up on her feet\nAnd I want to know what a smart way to try and help her as I Do have a desire to help her um but I don't want it to cause any kind of stress between myself and you know my future wife as I don't want it there ever to be a situation where she you know stuck between myself and and her sister\nToo late um the uh [noise] she so when's the wedding date\nUm we're looking for some time or oh Christmas next year\nOkay why are you waiting until Christmas mixture\nOr we would like for her to finish college before we get marriage to graduate for a school\nWhy\nUm I don't know we just felt like it was a good decision to try and wait a little bit and and make sure that where\nYou don't ... them together to do\nRight so I don't know what the differences here right\nOkay just something to think about because it kind of affects the other question and I'm not just being a smart out like okay this is your sister in law or it's your girlfriend's sister there is a different right okay a girlfriend's sister wrong stuff on them a lot easier and I can't my sister in law\nWere you know and uh so you got to walk that they're so here's the thing\nUh it takes ... drinks to be gentle you guys are not standing on really strong relational strength right now you're not married\nAnd you're not standing on really strong financial strengths and for you all to be gentle with this other girl who's not got her act together who happens to be a sister [laughter] um is gonna be hard\nIt's gonna be hard because you don't have a lot of margin you know versus like sharing and I've been married thirty five years we got up a zillion dollars okay so we can handle

at a little bit more of a distance than down the hallway\nUh-huh or wouldn't move around with you I ... I Would put your relationship ahead of her need\nI Want to help her I'm with you but there's there's really a lot I'm just being an old guy now a lot of financial guy okay there's just a lot of downside to this relation like um and cause you know\nShe comes in there you can't there's no there's nothing ... if you're ... your fiance decided she's going to be an enabler and give her sister money\nYou you start stepping in and say and that's a bad idea that you're going to be the bad guy or and really and you know or you get to participate in in ... in both of these things are stupid and so nobody's going to tell this girl no because everybody stand off from each other they try and get later than I\nI wouldn't move around a if she wants to come to town will feed her occasionally she can come by ... lover and she needs to get roommate have a job and come to town and get our act together and be like a stand up adult\nIf she comes she could come for three weeks and stay well she's

whatever procedure that this particular specialist is going to proceed with um ... you know so no I wouldn't go to the doctor or I Would get comfortable with that doctor\nI'm not may be that that's an off putting enough 'cause it's kind of a weird request it may be the debts off putting enough to you that you just don't want to use this doctor better than what you said in the email sometimes I hear people say you know I I'm not going to tie that church\nBecause I don't agree with things that are going on at that church\nBut you're going to trust them to spiritually train you\nYou're going to trust them with your children's show one Sunday school class you're going to trust them to influence you on your view of scriptural scripture and your walk with God but you don't trust them with your money\nWell let's just dumb it's so into the system is appalling\nYou don't trust them enough to touch you don't trust them with money but you trust them when they were so\nThat's just weird\nIt's just a bad idea so that's the thing\nNow I have at times with the church that I'm attending while I'm watching the misbehavior of leadership and I've taken a little time off of tithing and set it aside little bit to see how this was going to turn out but long term if I'm not willing to give their I shouldn't go there\nAnd the same would be true of this doctor story here and is with us in Baltimore, Maryland Hi Ann how are you\nI'm great how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise] I paid thirty five well not paid off but I paid thirty five thousand dollars\nIn ... in the year good for you I'm torn thank you towards student loan fixing to you and then I was in a car crash and the money thing going for medical expenses and um\nDo things a lock my motivation\nAnd also and the other thing is I found a great deal I have some auto body um problems with my car and I found someone who is willing to do do it for cheaper price and I want to get repaired\nBut it it's going to be eight hundred dollars\nAnd you don't have eight hundred dollars\nWell I have that I Know you're not gonna like that but I got it I have a thousand dollar emergency\nFund but the Ira hit ... and they ... they are going to get that money [noise] um I can save up\nI mean I thought you were out of that\nOh no no no I'm not out of bed well just paid off their I've already five thousand a year now that was torn my student loan debt\nI see and you didn't pay the IRS before you paid your student loan\nOr that it came out of nowhere that I haven't I'm getting paperwork in the mail from my CPA but I have a terrible for about eight or nine or ... mhm\nBallot now mhm\nOkay and so you have one thousand dollar saved for emergencies is all\nYeah but I I have I got a credit card and I know you don't like credit card and I don't normally use credit cards but if you're an actress on line and I can use the credit card ended a hundred dollars a month to\nUse it for one or the auto body red hair which is eight hundred dollars\nYeah yeah\nI ... and I mean\nThat that's so backward from everything you've ever heard me say I'm appalled that you think I Would actually respond positively that ridiculous statement\nI mean really you just called Dave Ramsey and said I Want to use a credit card on the air\nOkay well I think about that [laughter]\nI mean either way you are going on here no I mean you've gotta you've gotta think about an hour day Ramsey things but you need to think about what how do you want to live your life here's why you lost your motivation is you're inconsistent\nYou need to say in your mind and in your heart of hearts and you need to grasp intellectually and spiritually that the shortest path to wealth and generosity and stability in your finances sustainability is to get out of debt and stay out of debt and at that point you're saying I'll never borrow again as part of that\nRegardless of what I Need to have happen now you are at a car accident that you're not getting insurance settlement for that\nNow they're saying that there was no no no and a damage to our vehicle and they're saying they don't believe that it um that crash injured me\nBut I I'm actually had pain before the crash occurred so I'm just paying for myself what my I'm In Charlotte\nOkay but I'm Talking about the car wreck the Oso you did not get any insurance for the damage to your car\nOh yeah I did I got five hundred dollar that come from I threw a\nInstead of putting it on the auto body repair which now you want to do\nYeah so this repair is very very\nMinor an eight hundred dollar a bump it's not okay\nSo the eight hundred dollar repair the reef I Want to do it now become a great deal because it's not it damaged that I've been driving around with her\nA long time the other damage yeah what am I may stop everything like that ... a few thousand dollar let me stop for a number one I'm not going to tell you to borrow money you knew that for\nYour call me right number two and this is not an emergency\nSmelled emergence right there it's not an emergency\nI don't care if it's a great deal\nNot emergency and you don't have any money you accept what's in your emergency fund\nNow and you've got the IRS breathing down your neck which is a lot bigger deal than a bump on your car\nAnd so now you didn't clear up the Irish and you can save up the money to fix the car if the guy won't do it in a year from now for eight hundred dollars then when you actually have the money\nThen you just want to be able to do it with him you dismiss that deal but so what I'm you know one thing I have learned is that when I Am impulsive\nAnd when I make quick decisions on something based on something I feel like I'm being emotionally drug into it's almost always a bad financial decision and a lot of the things circling around this conversation I've had that field with them\nAnd so you need to slow down get yourself on a very strict plan and live that plan all the way out regardless of what opportunities or crisis has come into your life\nAnytime there's a problem you just get back on track\nBack on track back on track and when you stabilized that you're going to stabilize not only are money but a whole bunch of other areas of your life that are also felt like a dog trace military title\nOr you just been going in circles\nAnd that's what's going on I can hear it I can feel it and talking to you you're going to be All right but that's what you need to do and no we're\nNot going to use a credit card to take advantage of a bargain to fix your car not what they are a lot better now is not an emergency so we're not using the emergency fund and very clear principles figuring landslide than you're just like a lot of them to everyone else [laughter]\n[noise] but you get

I Love it how much will be paid off\nHave my notes here I paid off about forty eight thousand two hundred dollars good for you and how long did that take twenty two months you and your range of income during that time I started off making Seventy and ended about making Ninety three thousand wow good for you what do you do for a living\nUh I oversee marketing for a software company and I also started my own company during the process that okay good for you what kind of that was the forty eight thousand dollars what'd you say oh everything mainly student loans um I also had a student loan or a Carlin out I also had four one K. loan\nUm and then also had to pay some taxes to the IRS\nBroker she like normal oh very normal a little bit of ... out there and just kind of bumping along yeah and I'm making decent money but got a big pile of debt and don't feel like a ...\nWell I I'm a travel junkie and so whenever I realized that can go on all the trip that I wanted and yeah\nRemember oh yeah and it kind of you know was horrible about being on a trip and not being able to afford things to eat here\nAnd so what happened twenty two months ago I was traveling with my boyfriend time soon to be my husband and he the year before had paid for a trip for both of us to go to Costa Rica which was great yeah um so I was going to pay it back and say hey you know I'm going to pay for our trip next year\nAnd then realized I can actually afford is um airfare whoa I had to go to come and say hey can you can you purchase your own airfare um so it was kind of that you know and then also saying I made good money and I couldn't do everything I wanted to do so much money to be there's broke exactly what you do\nUm I got really serious I actually read the total money make over about six years ago mhm end started to to become ill intent started to understand some of the teachings\nBut then um the twenty two months ago is really whenever kicked in going in this stupid why am I taking so long to get to that 'cause I had started and then stopped and then got back into it mhm that's whenever I you know I had my lovely excel spreadsheet out to use the every dollar app I'm\nSo we started doing all that and plus my company started to um do smart dollar at all for coming up the Becker okay\nGreat so they talked smart dollar yep which is are going through the whole ... as an HR benefited her company yes very neat and so that gave you about the time you were disgusted in going beyond airline ticket while law smart dollar appears from the charging\nYeah and actually um to circumvent and I and I think when we go through this process you start to get really creative mhm so one of my passions is to travel so I became a national speaker and had other people pay for my travel I was just working the entire time um but I still got to do a lot of my travel well also working on my income and\nYeah small borrowed a whole lot of professional eater I Wonder if I get I'm pregnant for them or you're surprised people pay for a little ... when you get creative it's exactly right so the company teacher smart dollar you're going through it you get your income up with all the ... gigs you're traveling getting paid your software on the side you're doing your work not only\nAbout a thousand dollar job and\nWhat is the secret to pay off forty by a thousand dollars worth of that I'm twenty two much\nSo I'm I'm a marketer um my one tad bit is don't pay attention to commercials or social media boat because that's the second you start to see the restaurants on commercials or the cool stuff that people are purchasing and showing off on social media you start to have that why should have with the Joneses have mhm\nSo don't put as much weight and to what you see that all the markers in the world that are really good at what we do if it's trying to get you to purchase something outside of your means for her shut off the that device to shut off the TV shut off that shut off the social media um and do something else but she kind of show over\nThere all the ritual cruise book love your life and author that what it's all about his don't don't compare your life to other people's highlight reel on Facebook or yeah very cool good for you and what did you do did you cook your spending did you sell stuff did you live on beans and rice what'd you do\nUm so I sold some things I did a garage sale and really I Want it to get rid of the clutter in my house\nAnd um I actually created a marketing campaign around my garage sale so I titled that I'm ... turned minimalist and I did a full fledged marketing campaign around it and also created posters to go in my yard and I had a poster of you with your face on it that said Dave Ramsey is making me so much stuff [laughter]\nHim in just four years those twenty grand\nThat's just dramatic so\nGiven that you don't want to own things that are going down in value\nYou don't want a total up things going down in value more than half your annual income so that's the first measures do your cars all your vehicle scenes with boats motors and wheels are added up to more than half your annual income if so then yeah you need to show\nSomething the second thing is can you be debt free everything but your house in a year I'm Sorry and two years within two years if you can busted\nTaking extra jobs so so much stuff the kids think their next beans and rice rice and beans don't see the inside of a restaurant what's your work and there are no vacations busted and be debt free\nScorched earth and be debt free\nIn less than two years\nThen you would keep your car even if you owe more on it then it's actually worse there's going to pay it off and you're going to clear it you're going to own it it's going to be\nAll through all done right that's where we're going to end up now\nIf you owe more on your car then it's actually worth and you can't it's going to be more than half your on your income and or you can't pay it off inside of two years then you do need to sell it how do you sell a car that you're upside down on that you owe more on your car than his work in that case if you need to sound like you've got to cover the difference\nYou owe twenty thousand dollars on the car the car is worth sixteen you can sell it for sixteen but you've got to have the other four to put with the sixteen to get the title from the bank in order when you give the title to the ... in order to give the title to the new\nOwner\nAnd so where are you going to get that other four thousand dollars if you're upside down before that was not as well you would have to in that case\nBorrow the four thousand dollars\nSaved the four thousand dollars\nOr talk to the current lent Linder on the car and letting you sign a note for the four thousand dollar difference that will only happen if you had like a credit union or a local bank it won't happen with a big bank our car loan company General Motors credit is not going to do that\nLexus motor credit is not going to do that\nAnd so on something that is what you do hope that helps open phones a triple eight eight to five ... five two to five you jump in and we'll talk about your life and your money John is with us in Detroit hey John how are you\nGood day how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell I thank you for taking my call not speak to you um my wife and I are avid planners and we're planning our next move here in the next few years I'm forty nine and she's forty thick\nWe don't have kids um and we're thinking about moving to the Las Vegas area over the next two to three years we got a plan for an ...\nUm my question to you if we're looking and because we do a lot of travelling um ourselves and we're not sure it looking at a condo\nOr an actual having a home would be a good idea what's your what's your opinion on condo um 'cause we are planning on whatever we purchase we're planning on paying a fine or that we eat you know I have no market\nAnd that's good okay opinion on them regarding what value increases are what\nWell uh you know those facing the sort of thing because I think we we buy a condo um we're looking we kind of over three hundred thousand um [noise] they do they're highly about or something like that\nUm if we don't waste of money um could do to go into a condo versus a home where he's not sure what the white financial ... would be\nWell no it's not a waste of money um the benefits are as you said you don't have to deal with the exterior maintenance and when you're traveling you've got neighbors that are close and if something occurs obviously you could\nYou know or have the next door neighbor or the person near you have a key and that kind of a thing there's a lot of possible good things about owning a condo as far as they as far as a condominium increasing in value\nA everything that controls the value increasing on real estate there there's three things location location location right right and and so is it a is it a condominium in a good area\nMeaning to an area that's a stable growing their values are increasing a good neighborhood to neighborhood people considerably a desirable place to live\nA ... and so I Want to I Want to buy a condominium in a fairly established area or in an area that is you know right on the edge of a rapidly growing edge of an established area that kind of a thing for from a ... British resell standpoint okay\nAnd um you know if you do that you're going to get similar grows in value to what you would in a single family\nIn that same neighborhood same families do a little bit better there's a little bit more market for them and there is condos but you know uh if you're in an area that's accepting of condominiums you'd be fine in Vegas will be fine with that now having said all of that then the only downside is what you mentioned earlier\nAnd that is the H away and the handling of the budget of the ... I Would want to investigate because you are a planner\nThe budget and um how they're doing with the H away budgeting let me give me an example I had a condo come on a rental or a many years ago in a condo complex that they had budgeted no reserves to replace the roof\nOkay now the condominium association is responsible for the exterior maintenance which would include the roof replacement so they come up with a several million dollar problem because the roofs are going bad right and they done no planning to get rid of it so guess what they did\nA special assessed every body and the place in addition to the right choice for you to keep 'cause they had that route stinking ... Lincoln all over the place\nExactly but that devalued the condo and book took cash out of everybody's pockets\nOkay and so if you look up and they've got no reserves for parking lot replacement no reserves for exterior maintenance no reserves for roof replacement in their budget\nAnd you know and you're looking at a complex is ten years old you got a problem you're walking into and so the thing you want to look at their the deferred maintenance is hidden down in that age are way reserves budget [noise]\nThe second thing you're going to run into is a and I'm In a bunch of ... own a bunch of real estate I hate H always right generally speaking the people that want to be on in charge of the ... way or the people that are in charge of nothing else anywhere else and their Barney Fife\nThey will drive you freaking nuts\nAbsolutely and there are people that need a life now there's exceptions to that but by and large or you're going to run into a lot of that\nYeah I'm currently currently live at home or the thought is right now and I'm the president obviously they [laughter]\nBasically [laughter]\nI say that are you [laughter] know I\nI said it that way because I didn't want to run in a firefight kind of situation is very very guy\n[laughter] okay [laughter] right well God you say you know there there's a lot of that it's not it's not a hundred percent truth thank goodness I hopefully now on but you know no fat at all [laughter] but that's what you want to watch for is the politics\nOf the association I'm In one I joined the barrel suing each other and it's just on the whole neighborhoods is melting down you know just ridiculous so you just hit it you got to match what you could get into you know if you're the president so she had she already knew all the stuff I was just talking about them as far as I'm even reserves in a homeless\nSituation things there that you've got to have reserves income\nPreserved cover [noise] so that's all you gotta look for [laughter] that's fabulous Ramsey show [noise]\nHey guys this is James child producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you got to a brand new dot com boom\nJoin us for the old timers association ... go to a ... to register for an event near you together we can handle [noise]\n... twenty Eighteen presented by capital what happened on December ... during the\nMarshmallow led the\nI'm being able to easily got ... you know somebody and make them feel\nGood and confident\nMhm okay so here's the situation I think you've got more talented than that I Want you to do an exercise where you spend a little bit of alone time today while it's fresh in your mind I Want you to ride out several skills that you have because you have more skills than just being able to talk well\nAre you you you you started a business in Seoul you started at fourteen and sold it I think you're thinking way too hard and I want you just release your brain right out the top three or four things you do best\nAnd then I Want you to go over to the passion side work that you just enjoy you find yourself you know this is a small task around the car if I was going to pay you to more than just be around cars what would you want to do all day and just begin to do to let your mind run and make a list of three or four of your top passions things that you enjoy to do\nAnd I want you to sit down with somebody who knows you very very well and there's also a truth telling your life and we want them to be able to verify and confirm both of those list the reason is is because I think you need a jolt of confidence and and you you're very special young lady who's done something\nPretty amazing at the age of twenty three\nAnd I think you're just you're over thinking and I think you need to get somebody else in your life will show you a mirror and you come away going okay I get so back to that talent passion calm but once you get clarity on that it's how do I use those top skills to do work that I Love\nAnd and and if that's involving cars great but maybe just maybe you know you love talking to people about cars and help them get get in a new car do you get a lot of joy when you sell a car to somebody\nHow yeah how do you feel when they walk off the lot and they're pleased how's it make you feel\nBad if you get pressure yeah\nSo I think if you're looking long term to start a business I'd stay in that space I'd be thinking about how are you can continue this idea [noise]\nUm and and maybe expand a little bit but what you're doing is is when I ask you this direct questions you're having a hard time identifying some specific things and this is important I think there's a lot of people out there in the same boat we get this we get this on on the culture quite a bit\nAnd there is some type of limiting belief\nThat is holding you back when you can't quickly say these are some things I Do well\nBecause here's what I Know if I sit down with people who know you will\nAnd I interviewed them about you those of you that are listening right now that having a hard time seeing all this is this is a talent these are my top town when I sit with those people they're going to tell me areas that you are good things you do well\nAnd there's something that's holding your back and locking you or is it that some buddy verbally abused you did you have a failure in your life at some point that has made you believe that you don't have much to offer\nFolks we deal with this every day and some of the out there are locked up on that one limiting belief and when you get beyond that realize wait a second I have something to offer I have something to give\nThen you begin to allow yourself to truly identify\nWhat it is that you do well and worked it makes your heart come alive\nSick a question from Facebook Rachel rights and should I take a lower paying entry level job is it is the first step toward a new career path that would eventually lead to a higher salary if so should I Do this while still and baby step to or should I wait until after baby steps or this is a great question\nSo if the answer is you would take a pay cut by taking the\nEntry level job which is what she's saying here's a lower paying entry level jobs\nIn less you can handle that I Would wait until you get baby
