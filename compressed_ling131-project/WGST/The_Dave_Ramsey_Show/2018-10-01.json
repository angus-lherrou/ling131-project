{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "I'm not sure\nHow that exactly happened they're blaming it the company Frank the PR firm blaming it on one person at the at their agency and has apologized for it but it was too late like anything else in modern times the press release went out on the news got out and it got all over social media yeah thanks so\nHere's what they had to say ... owner Matt ... said quote this post is absolute nonsense while we definitely have country routes he called it no ... brewing or those associated with our brand\nIs now or has ever been rooted in hate we do not tolerate hate that's just idiotic we welcome anyone who enjoys good beer a and\nWe don't basically don't carry said he went on to say uh the misinformation that went out over social media is wrong we could care less about your political viewpoint\nOnly that you like our beer so there you go\nI understand that you know it's one thing to be Nike and to take a political a town on something it's a whole other\nThing to be a small company and try to do that so ... in any case\nAh it is what it is and hopefully they will survive that because we do like when our local companies um you know get find their way through troubles\nI think that's something that companies have struggled with before where PR agency or some other Brenda that you've affiliated yourself with kind of steps in it and drag your name into it how do you\n... 'cause obviously a scuffle and come out it looks like a statement from them right well no no no no it's the third party company retired who did it wrong we made a mistake\nUm yeah I think that\nIt is\nI'm a really big dilemma for people because especially when you're a small company you want a delegate and you're not going to necessarily hire a fulltime PR person who knows you inside and out like that you're going to hire a farm\nAnd lots of big companies hire firms to by the way um but that is one of the ... this is why entrepreneurs I I think have trouble delegating\nBecause they can't afford to step in it\nLike Nike has bad PR firm and steps in it they can afford a ... right I mean delta had a big ... with the whole um you know and are a thing and lost the whole giant tax credits\nRight right they lost a ton essentially a ton of money over it but they can afford that does the delta but Scott flaws in delta and they can't afford to lose drinkers you know they need them so it's a really big challenge for small companies I get that totally\nI'm In any case I wished about Saddam and I wanted to make it clear that if you happen to see any of that on social media don't listen to it Scott fall just want you to drink beer and they are not taking a political side K everybody Claire got it\nA while we're talking about companies that can't afford trouble let's talk Tesla for just a minute\nTesla stock way up after Iran mosque settled with the SEC that'll happen very quickly the SEC announcing just last week that they were suing a lawn mosque for his tweets suggesting that he was going to take the company private and had secured funding\nUh he\nDecided to rather than go through a an actual trial or case and just go ahead and settle for the settlement includes the following month we'll be paying a penalty of twenty million dollars\nI was wondering where those things go ... go to the SEC like who gets to keep that\nDoes anyone now if you know give us a call for a for three six seven nine four seven eight look the bank and monopoly well whenever\nIt's true it's like whenever there\nAre those finds um like for any violation like a federal a fine of for something I always wonder like\nWhere does that go does that just go to like this because I could have passed some of the deficit like\nWhat happens is that like you know how you know we always say the police go out on the road like towards the end of the month to make their quota for speeding tickets right so they could just like they need to make a certain quota 'cause that supports the police all the money they brand the tickets\nMaybe it's like that maybe those funds that when they feel and they get a settlement they just get to keep that\nI don't know how that works that white people parties and happy hour twenty\nAnd the guy who like filed the suit gets a promotion and you know what I mean yeah everybody's cheering the SEC I have I mean ringing a bell you know they're all excited and I don't know anyway anyway twenty million dollar settlement uh\nThat mosque is paying\nA personal payment I guess it's not a company payment because they didn't see Tesla they feed him uh he also as part of the settlement has agreed to step away from his position as chairman of the board of Tesla\nBut it doesn't mean that he leaves tests altogether because he will remain in position as CEO now I'm just putting this out there and I'm not saying he's going to do it but if that's me and I really didn't feel like I should give up to twenty million bucks maybe I just thought my salary\nYou know\nTwenty million dollar increase in the CIA's salary bam got the money back yeah or maybe you just do it like five million a year so it's not as ... you know and for years you're ... or whatever well Christmas bonus hearing that it's all good listen I don't\nKnow how the board of Tesla feels about all of this overall they did step out in support of the mosque when the SEC announced that they were filing suit\nI'm fine with a settlement having him off the board and um but still involved maybe the best of all worlds for them because they still get to have a little more control over some of his craziness I'm\n... and they get to keep his brilliance you know in charge essentially so ah interesting development there I'm certainly I'm\nNot the last we're going to hear of Eli mosque I'm quite sure it was saying before we wrap up for today I Would be remiss if I didn't mention a first of all the\nAlmost a thousand lives lost in Indonesia after the tsunami and earthquake there so so tragic um if I didn't say that my\nHeart wasn't with those people I Would be lying because it just makes me cringe that these things happen and it does set you straight in a lot of ways that Mother Nature we can sit here all day long with our political nonsense and Mother Nature can come in and change the game like that\nUh and especially in a place like that where they did not and don't have the infrastructure 'em to deal with the wounded we cut the numbers could go up way up in terms of the number of deaths even still even after um [noise]\nUh where we are now after the the waters have proceeded in all of that so tragic tragic situation in there and of course while we're mentioning tragedies I also have to say uh that it is the one year anniversary of the Vegas shooting as well and\nIt is so sad\nTo me that we continue to experience\nTragedies like this like this Vegas\nShooting that were that are manmade\nMean you can't control Mother Nature we can't stop an earthquake from happening or at least I don't think or it's you know me\nOr or or a hurricane or or any of that but we could make an impact on the number of gun deaths in this country and even after a mind boggling you know record breaking mass shooting one year ago\nWe've essentially done nothing we've made no real change uh in our gun laws we've made no real change in our\nUh in the way we deal with mental health um we're not we're not fixing the problem we're arguing with each other like we always do and getting nowhere like we always do\nAre incredibly incredibly frustrating um you know fifty eight people died in that shooting in Vegas it wasn't in a school school safety had nothing to do with it uh\nIn addition to the fifty eight people\nThat died four hundred and some were wounded or\nBy by the guns themselves and another\nOver four hundred and fifty were injured just running away essentially and getting you know\nYeah trampled on and stomped on and whatever else horrible uh we still don't know a motive and we probably never well because the shooter of course killed himself as well um what we do know though is he had a lot of guns more than any one person needs under any amendment for a second third fourth fifth twenty of I don't care uh\nAnd he had a lot of bumps stocks which helped him do what he did as quickly as he did um\nPresident Trump said he was going to take some stocks off the market that hasn't happened\nWe should remember to ask those questions of the people were electing to office even when it's not the current headline I'm going to leave\nYou on that note but we will be back tomorrow to protect ... we'll see then [noise]\nFollow\nGene on Facebook and Twitter Ashley dino beret and being a very useful news here on TALK radio six forty to fifty and

I still have it in my mix and I'm Still gonna recommend you do but you're right you what you found there is representative of you know the real track records or the international recommend twenty five percent\nYes yes yes yes I'm Still doing this one I'm personally doing because I just do we just finished the announcers on I sat down with our European uh had him runs from hypothetical back and we went back Thirty years and forty years in Twenty years and looked at said what would it look like with them what what three funds\nOr a and actually ran a real estate investment trust us impossible fourth sarin three different scenarios the current for\nThree not counting the international and their Iran and pulled international out and put ... in\nA high performing rate because of ... performing rates are doing pretty well and the funny thing was the international the current mix beat up all the other two on the twenty or thirty or forty or track record\nSo a hypothetical or you know a real funds in the real marketplace so sticking with it it it but I was just like you are it's disillusioning to look down and see how poorly\nThey're performing to the point that I was considering the advice that I've given for Thirty years changing it I mean we were looking at going to you know we missed it has this mark as a ship sailed you know but really because it runs inverse of the other funds on returns it's good to have in the mix\nAnd becomes a hedge for you against the downturn so good question them thanks for calling him open phones or triple eight eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five\nJohnny's on Instagram as it ever a good idea to prioritize student loans over smaller debt balances into that snowball given their collection practices and punitive measures window fault a dude ever debt has collection practices and punitive measures\nEvery one of 'em student loans or no exception and no you don't you're not going into collection you're you're paying it off social the opposite of collection\nIs you're paying extra on it you're getting rid of it you're piling on your list your debt smallest largest you're going to pay them off in that order you're going to be an attack mode and that's exactly what I Would do with it and that's exactly how it would show now known to lift your debts\nAnd and when you're lifting your debts for the ... smallest largest that's not categories\nIf you have a one thousand dollar student loan and two thousand on a credit card and a four thousand dollar student loan you'd do student loan credit card student loan\nIs not student loans or all the total category\nYou know that's not what we're doing we do the whole\nWe do the whole thing break it out by individual\nDeaths and list those individual deaths smallest hardest minimum payments on everything but the little ones and attacked the little one with a vengeance thank you for following us on Instagram appreciate it this is that Iran should show [noise]\n\n\nThere's some exciting news simply save is now valued at one billion dollars to this company used to be just five guys working together now they protect over two million people and here's why simply say ... system is easy to use and takes just minutes to set up there are no contracts are hidden fees and twenty\nFour seven monitoring is only\nFourteen Ninety nine a month visit simply say direct dot com my listeners get free shipping and free returns that simply say direct dot\nCom hey this is Rachel created that is always drilled into us that you can buy quality things they'll get a great deal act like I live ... ... ... offers amazing matches for every budget\nAnd now they got a brand new mattress called nuts they kept their best mattress and made it even better it's incredible try testing needle for a hundred nights rent free at ... dot com at CNN dot com I don't remember except for free at the end dot com\nKrystle gym here you ever talk to people who say things like becoming a millionaire is impossible these days or people are only millionaires because they come from already wealthy families will we just got done with the largest research ever conducted on American millionaires and the simple truth is\nEveryday people become millionaires all the time\nHow did they do it the overwhelming majority did so by investing consistently and with the help and guidance upper professional\nThat's why our team has already done the hard work for you we've vetted and interviewed thousands of investing professionals all across the country who are committed to helping you reach your goals get started today go to Dave Ramsey dot com slash smart dresser and look up the smart buster pros or in your area\n...

good very cool very cool so what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt if you paid off eighty thousand bucks I mean really\nUm I mean for for me I think it's a sacrifice um we\nI drove a Dave car I mean there was a bitter for a year um no I see no radio and it was a it was a ... a rough year in that car in Georgia you know mhm I'm specifically I remember in that car one time I'm listening to your podcast I'm On my headphones in\nThe car when I was in a drive through and I looked down in the car was overeating\nAnd I had been working outside in at a third job and um [noise] had my shirt on buttoned up a sweat and how little I mean literally looked like the biggest redneck almost Lana mhm and a car is overeating I had to turn the heat on and I was thinking is is is this worth it\n[laughter] [laughter] I've been\nThere done that yeah it's also very cool what do you tell people the key to getting out of that is Sarah\n[noise] a lot of sacrifice you definitely have to communicate and sat down into our budget and we did the cash only ... you know to this day even out or that phrase we're still doing the caste system\nOnce that money is gone it's gone we have an Eighteen month old at home ... has a budget okay harmonies out it out you know um but I think too you just have to track thank God he has gotten us everything they were the bumps in Iran along the way\nI'm Lynn ... last summer of two thousand Seventeen\nHe was supposed to work every day or three weeks as\nA summer school and he was going to have to get some nights at the prison today Bible school and and sadly his grandfather passed away and so all of these plans for this extra income coming in my shot sure I'm In a few weeks later\nOkay All right well I mean if you're saving you know fifty seven twenty percent of that plus or minus ... you're going to have a lot of money when you put the majority of them from forty to sixty five is twenty five years a slave insurers money we were talking about saving you know Fifteen twenty grand a year\nWhich I can do that you know you don't you know\nOkay at my age or my four oh one K. do I want the raw for all wars on my ...\nYeah she wants tax break for sure\nPoker on the edge on the tribute to I waited like four or five more years\nAnd the only the only way you answer the question is does it cause you to not be able to retire\nAnd um so I don't want people you know to stay out of there for a one k.'s and miss it for very long but you've got a big goal here and they're big goal is to not have ever have a house payment\nAnd you know what that does is if you turn that money into investing rather than ... blowout prime and every month you invested instead then the answer is you know you haven't you haven't waited too long you're fine but if you turn around bought something with it every month and you were in consume at all\nThen you may have in your only want to put Fifteen Percent aside than you might be might be making them stay clear\nTiffany's in Baltimore, Maryland Tiffany welcome to the Ramsey show\nHello hey what's up I'm calling\nBecause I'm trying to do that if I Want to file bankruptcy or not [noise]\nSo much

...\nMost of it of credit card and a half percent alone helpful but one credit card company is Thirteen thousand they just sent me a letter and if I paid twenty five thousand and they would you know I'm just calling me calling them all and tell 'em I'm having a hardship to see if they would lower I might go\nMhm boat undoing good for them blower you don't have any money\nWhile my husband's income I was thinking but it's still not enough [noise]\nOh well that's part of the picture when what does he make\nAbout twenty eight thousand in that much and he lost his job when I first got her mhm um when I first got her are you not meanders through online receiving disability\nNote I'm applying I'm sure that we had to tell me to apply for a permanent disability to say\nBut I'm In and out of work so much they're now going to be really really low is not even when the when I cook it because you know go about our credit and I've been in and out in and out of where\nI'm at this point I went through a disability lawyers and so I'm trying to find out he said he can't really tell me much until they go in and see if I should do it that we do it if I could do with that and what their team\nAnd then if I did it Thirteen he didn't know how much they were going to pay that they want to get it out get out\nAnd then I might have to wind up paying I mean you know they'll only and that money I don't understand\nYou gave him Eighteen hundred dollars to file bankrupt shining really anything oh I don't get anything aren't so you're not paying on these credit cards or these loans today right\nNo not right now and I'm not read it and when the\nShow and they were already gonna be look let's pretend you're just didn't pay those loans for a year\nAnd they just sit there the worst cases would suit you're right\nYeah and what are they going to get you don't have anything you don't have an income and you don't have the assets they can do you own something as valuable\nWhile I have a home to home that live in I have the home and I looked at the equity and other home um I have about fifty thousand and now I Can't sell the house though because I tried to sell it for what they thought I was either go\nMarket yourself and and then it is because that's how ... how are you like sixty Seventy thousand dollars I mean you know I'm an area that how are you all for like one out in like a hundred and fifty thousand\nMhm but why can't you sell your\nHouse it's a lot of them in the argument that are headed again\nWhy can't you know your house\nWhile the other house that I don't live in one I'm thinking of it has about fifty thousand analyze\nWhy can't you sell it\nBecause the ... are you you have a lot of foreclosures and people are telling them for sixty and you know what\nI'm old Ninety eight\nOkay so sell it and get out much you can out of it and pay somebody will\nSay oh my dad with that\nYeah definitely for you go bankrupt\nYou when you file bankruptcy they don't let you keep investment property with equity and then not pay your bills smell how bankruptcy law works so the Trump bankruptcy trustee will force the sale of that property and there'll be forced to be paid against your bills\nAnd I think you can get enough out of that to go to each one of these and you can probably shuttle fifty thousand in your situation for around thirty five if you negotiate with them but you need the money in your hand to do that and you know what I mean money\nSo this is a way to get those all cleared up and then in the process of course we've got to figure out how to get your income back up and get your household income working again 'cause that's the root cause of all of this\nBeen so long term where are you going to be in two years where are you going to be in a year where are you going to be in three years which are long term game plan and what are you doing about getting there that's got to be your next step because you've got to get either disability income coming in um you know if you're the workers' comp if it if you were hurt you said on the job or you or I can tell from what you're saying that which way it was but\nYou know any money that is do you or any money you can create you used to create your future ghetto\nAnd that's what we want you to do we want you to have a future and and so you start looking out there in the into the future and saying how am I going to take the next step is to get there but as far as filing bankruptcy I don't think that's going to be advantageous to you when you got this much older when you've got this much equity in a property and I think you can clear up the debt by selling it\nSelling it taking the equity using that money that thirty thirty five thousand dollars it's they're forty thousand whenever you\nGet out of it and subtle at fifty one thousand doubts about negotiate with them get that in writing before you send them any money but I think you can work your way through this

[laughter] oh well he makes I think a hundred thousand dollars a year maybe\n... so she doesn't know how she didn't have to work to eat yeah okay so I mean what if she just didn't want to work\nWell uh I feel like for her type of spending that's the problem she likes and money mhm\nMhm and how old are you I'm Eighteen okay All right\nWell there's a rule that we have discovered and these types of conversations and it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder but they don't really want your opinion about money or sex and so your mother's not going to take an Eighteen year olds input on her spending habits\nYou don't have standing you don't have credibility with her to have that discussion and that's what you're discovering um our own no you're not wrong at all\nYou know and it's just difficult now you know when you're fifty eight and she's Ninety six or something yeah she may take your input those days right that's a different that's a different parent child relationship than an Eighteen to whatever and so\nYou know you have to build some credibility so the only thing I Would tell you that there was a couple of things um one is I Would not bring up her spending again unless she brings it up\nOK okay too I Would tell her lots of stories about the times that you used to mess up mom I used to spend them do this and I used to do this in mind when I got on this budget I got on this humble up system I got on this plan to get out of that I'm doing so good and you just tell your story\nIs your story is not condemning her\nIt's just lose just holding up the idea that there's hope right\nTo tell your story and talk about how you're winning doing these things and that changes everything for you then the second thing you can do is is is there anyone like maybe your dad who could sit down and talk with her and the two of them actually start getting their act together\nWell I'm actually I guess my dad has talked to her he's actually one of the people that we should call and we don't watch his show\nMhm oh okay well this was his job not yours is what I'm saying and sunny ah this would be like a husband now calling now that's a little different standing and he puts his arm around his wife and says look we got a problem here you're spending like you're in Congress\nI mean we got to stop this there's a problem here\nAnd when you sit down and work through this issue together and we've got to put together some kind of a plan where we have a good life\nAnd we have a good life meaning we spend some money now and we invest and save show that we have to live like no one else so later we can live like no one else but really this is on your dad to do this is not on you you real cause you're he's got standing he's got to a position in the household to have a discussion\nWhere as an Eighteen year old you don't and um it's not just you obviously are very sharp and you can do all kinds of things for you I'm not saying you're not good or you're not whole or whatever I'm just saying in your mom's highs you're still that little baby she used a diaper\nAnd it's just hard for her to take advice from you but now her husband that's a different thing\nAnd um you know he can sit down and if it was ... miles from the Chernobyl to shut down window discussion going this is this is something we're not doing here and there's a problem\nAnd we've got to work through this and so he's put up with is a long time and it's time for him to deal with it now that's that's what I'm saying hey thank you for the call open phones at triple eight eight to

it and your range of income during that time we were broke twenty twenty five twenty five thousand and we just accept a new jobs and right now are making a hundred and twenty five you know what are you all do for a living\nI worked for advertising agency in Oklahoma City\nAnd then on the store manager at the coach store at I'm In Oklahoma City very cool I Know your wife like sandbags booming\nYeah she's got a pretty good collection she deserves anything should get right up with me so well done you guys you're you're wondering how long you been married\nSeven years no right so a year into marriage you start within three years later you kick it into high gear for sure tell me about the journey what happened and and show other people how it's done\nUm right after we graduated we had so much in school that and and we just we need to get rid of this and and\nI grew up in a single family home and my mom worked really really hard and you know I wanted to say I want to take every advantage that we had and get our you know get everything in line and be successful on so\nAnd I felt entitled like I deserved a jeep wrangler and I work too hard and so we really were fighting and I just felt in title I was acting like a little boy and I needed to be coming man and I just knew I she deserves better and I just I had to you know let my pride down\nTo what happened what what was the breaking point what kicked it into gear because obviously you flipped hobbies and shoots the way she looked at you just then when you said that was admiration and respect and it was who was really the way every man wants his wife to look at them know what you just did was incredible so uh tell me about that what happened well\nMainly just argued a lot and we wanted to have a very healthy and happy marriage and I just remember standing in the kitchen three years ago and he held my face in his hands and he was like we are going to get rid of the S. and I think um\nWe just finally got on the same page and felt like we were connecting mhm um because you mentioned a lot that when your priorities are nine and your budget your priorities are aligned in your marriage and so for us that was kind of just something that was really important\nYeah and I just I didn't have any hope I didn't think we could do it what\nWhat flipped courage ... which I got this we're going to do this\nWould've happened um I just I\nI think I just didn't want to hurt or any more ... hurting I Love her so much and I don't want to it just wasn't fair to her and I was the one who's spending money and going out to eat doing whatever I wanted to do and so\nAnd I was hearing you are not important yeah finally we're like we're the most important thing in on us and we need to get our finances and mine and be on the same age in our life moving forward\nAnd so at that point it's game on yeah and what what kind of income where you making at that point three years ago I think between eighty them about eighty okay so you're still come up from ... to one twenty five during that three years in a hurry impressive very cool so then okay you've made the decision were on the same page then what happened to\nMake a budget and it kind of\nIt was I felt constricted up first and then I kept listening to your show and it's like almost like gave me permission to spend money and I felt safe didn't spend money it wasn't like oh this is going to cost me a night on the couch and he felt like okay we're on the same page and I felt an acting more and when I found this happier and I was like you know stuff doesn't make me happy anymore and I don't need\nOK slightly under funded so what is your daycare budget a month\nMarkets that sixty five I think it takes the seven eighty or the year and it's kinda max that can do and that they say it's five thousand\nWell there you go you're under funding it automatically them so that's perfect yeah yeah I Would I Would put the whole five thousand through there which is going to save you about Fifteen hundred dollars a year\nThat's a nice benefit definitely thanks thanks appreciate the call Anders next in Canada Hi Andrew how are you\nOrder you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so we have cures recently paid off her house and the U.S so we are completely debt free and I just wanted to ask you a question about next steps okay\nSo\nWe live in a two bedroom townhouse pretty tight we have a family of four and go on on the way mhm\nSo we are a moral case here for a little while but in the next few years we want to say about the cash or a large [noise] good\nKill so\nMy income is roughly a hundred thousand a year my wife know that she was on maternity leave really making anything\nIs she going back to work she won't eat milk okay so you have a hundred dollar household income what your toenails worth two hundred and forty to fifty and when you move up what what price would you move up to\nThree four hundred\nOkay she and a hundred and sixty thousand it's gone up in value during that time so you need a hundred and something thousand dollars how long has it gone tricky to save a hundred and something thousand dollars who our\nQuestion is I I Am quoting away the fifteenth for some among ... ... on my employer nachos four percent ...\nSo we have a Nineteen percent [noise] ... that's going Nineteen percent of my income that's going to retirement mhm my question is what makes sense to go back to three baby step three D.\nNo and no no what uh what is your age or I'm thirty and my ...\nThis is going on in okay well you got plenty of time you're going to be OK\nI'm into here here's what's gonna happen during the next three years five years whatever it is your income going to go up and the value of your town house they're going to go up or slow value what you're going to buy is going to go up to right but it's so we're not dealing with a fixed\nItem to do forecasting with the fixed item your your income is not fixed it you know you're going to see some increases and the value of the town houses not fixed and of course your target is not fixed\nUm and so we don't know exactly where you're going to end up there\nBut um no I I Would say at Fifteen Percent if I were in your shoes and then I Would just save aggressively I Would take extra jobs any other money that come your way inheritance is bonuses anything else the role that in the house fund don't consume it anytime you can get your hands on anything just do it in the house fun though in the house one thought the hell's fun\nAnd um but we know if you save thirty thousand dollars a year\nThat in three years and some change you'd have another hundred thousand but with a stone should almost be there\nSo I think your three I think you've got three year plan\nYou might have a four year playing something like that while doing the Fifteen Percent but it's going to be tied it'd be a tight budget to do that but you got trashed by not going to shut your back into that you know that and you didn't have to go back into that either smart man Cindy's immobile Mississippi Hi Cindy how are you\nHigh Mobile Alabama I Would\nThink so I'm looking at killing going where are you from woman okay how can I help\nWell we're new to the financial peace University We're entering our third week and my husband is the fiduciary for his\nBrother who passed away he was one hundred percent disabled veteran and he left quite a large state my husband has an attorney immobile who is I'm taking it to the court or at least six months and then it'll be distributed\nAnd um my husband I'm just concerned that the Veterans Administration will come around and in any day or maybe three years from now and say no we need that money back because it wasn't used from I\nAm and I don't know Charlotte are my money that came from the VA is right in the huge state yeah so they gave him a lump sum due to his disability\nNow he was one hundred percent disabled and every month he was the um money and the Veterans Administration and I had been paid all his you know care bills and everything like that mhm\nBut because Mike would give it away on the first day he got at the Veterans Administration could be a family member to watch over his estate and some might have been doing that for Twenty years oh mine now the so the state grew\n... it's not they're not going to come after that but hey they paid a disabled veteran for being destroyed\nAnd yet a family member managed it well for the good of the veteran who has now passed they they've got no standing whatsoever to come after that okay All right no I I think you're fine is your husband the show layer\nNo no he had written a will with my brother my can do it in a wheel with my husband's help to give some to his nieces and then distributed amongst his dividing brothers and sisters\nSo much was the ...\nI think around two hundred and fifty I think each of the three scientifically they're gonna get Seventy and the fiber by six nieces will get ten thousand each from I'm not really sure there's also some gold coins you know\nYour husband is a good man and he\nWas he was very much and we ended up taking to all his Veterans Administration point in the last year the glad because the VA health care was not efficient unless my cat are represented there 'cause my one hundred percent disabled mhm mhm\n[noise] um we miss him now that I'm back in the money\nYou know definitely definitely but your husband to a good care of it and that's what I'm saying\nYeah we might get liked him better than we are was there

the policy altogether\nThey don't know what they can do says James Hunt consumer federation of America as life insurance ... where they pay a premium\nAnd they thought they paid for life and now they're facing extremely high premiums to keep them going\nRecent wave of lawsuits which began cropping up around twenty Fifteen of targeted universal life policies sold in the eighties and nineties insurers offered an attractive guaranteed minimum interest rate the policy holders of about four to five percent\nSupported by higher interest rates set by the federal government during this time but a decade of rock bottom interest rates in the wake of their financial crisis hurt insurers profitability reducing the return on the bonds an underpinning their products and so they ... the right so here's what happens\nWith the universal live policy why these things are happening why people are pissed off about it so you're told that if you pay a premium you'll have the policy of your whole life a portion of the premium goes to pay for the insurance and a portion goes into your investment called the cash value\nThe problem is these things are based on the insurance and so the mist based on an A R T which is an annual were noble term\nIf you think about it every year you live you're more likely to dodge statistically a forty six year olds more likely to live to dodge statistically than a forty five year old on average Seventy six year old is more likely to die than fifty six year old on average statistically speaking so they\nCharge more it costs more because of the probability of death to ensure someone who's older or by get that and so if the let's say you had a hundred dollar a month or two hundred dollar a month premium okay and if it started out at age\nThirty five and the cost to cover you at age thirty five was fifty dollars a month of the two hundred then you'd have a hundred and fifty going into investment that should be just fine right but then what happens is over time\nThe cost to cover you let's say let's get you up to age sixty might be two hundred and fifty dollars\nWhich are only paying two hundred and fifty dollars coming from eating your savings up that you put in\nAnd so your insurance costs goes up every year to the point that it passes the premium it eats up the savings when the savings is gone the insurance company comes through knocking on your door and says now\nIt costs three hundred dollars a month for you to just have insurance no savings\nBecause not only have as the increasing premium or eaten up what you were paying or the increasing costs veterans eaten up your premium but it's also going over that and eaten up your savings now there's nothing left and we're not going to cover you anymore unless you pay this new higher premium for insurance only\nHuge is God's screwed by buying a bad\nBadly designed horrible financial product and so when all\nThese guys are but if you don't understand the index university yeah flexible premium yes\nI Do understand that and I've seen this happen I've met with these people when they're sixty five years old and their insurance that they've paid into for forty years has has completely self destruct did and now they're standing there with nothing\nAnd they paid huge premium is if they paid a one twentieth as much they'd had term insurance over all that same twenty year period of time and they could have invested and then nobody is going to tinker with their investments and steal their investments to pay insurance premiums to some\nDead gum insurance company if it if your if your insurance product has\n... if you have a life insurance policy that has a savings component to it\nIt's building up cash value you're getting screwed [noise]\nThe worst of the worst for these
