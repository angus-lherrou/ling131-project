{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "I'm Rachel Evans that's your work hard play hard report for details on all the events we talked about today go to Dana Barrett dot com\nBust\nHere on the street [noise]\nOf the national news that's been a keeping us occupied it's been hard to keep up with the local stories too but there has been one story that's been bubbling up over the last\nI'm just gonna say several weeks but I Know it's actually been longer um about the goals which is an area downtown that sort of between um\nThe five points area and Mercedes Benz stadium and there's been some questions about what better it could be developed in June and actually this has been an area that's been talked about for a variety of different projects over the years and nothing much has really happened but now\nIt's the center of some controversy so because I haven't had a the time to really follow this closely I thought I'd bring in somebody who's in the no\nThe Jennifer ... is back with us today she is the VP of planning and economic development\nUm for central Atlanta progress hurry up I'm great thanks Dana thanks for having me uh it is it's very good to see you and I want to get right into this um\nGold's story so first of all it's a funny name\nYou know it's interesting there's actually Nashville has a Gulf ... but it ... um this was the original location of the founding of the city so there's railroad tracks yeah um and it was all the rail infrastructure and then we build bridges over the tracks and those became the streets and the whole sort of the Gulf\nShift gap I think and so and really what's down there now it's in that space right now is sort of nothing right parking lot\nSurface parking lots are generally if you tailgate for the falcons really enter United you might know it well there are still active reliance on there as well um but other than that I'm not much\nAnd correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't it the possible spot a couple of years ago for like a multi mode all at transportation hub\nThere was a there was a a planning effort that reinvention I'm a commercial development and not unlike the current proposal that with integrated with a pretty significant public investment in um a bus and train station\nAll right so this go round and again I'm going to like just tell you right up front Jennifer to jump in if I'm saying something that's wrong but my recollection too is that we started hearing more about the Gulf again when the Amazon age ... to a frenzy began that correct\nIronically yes um but the the team um see I Am group who is a a a large ... develop or had actually been silently putting together ... eleven are so different\nLand owners and parcels in that area before Amazon came along and we were well positioned to have a great spot for them um to to put forth to them so it got a lot more notoriety at that\nPoint right so I think at this point just to to remind everybody Amazon has not said whether they're going to the correct but I think a lot of people in our thinking it's the DC area\nYeah there's um you know if you are a betting person that would probably where he'd put your money now but there has been no official word\nRight so even with the I Am and their proposal if Amazon were to pick Atlanta they would still be could that area still be used as part of the CIA\nCould absolutely could be one of the it is one of the locations that the city and state put forth\nAre gone because the development program that see I Am is proposing is a significant amount of office space okay um and so could meet the demand for an Amazon or any other company that looking for a while to office but yeah OK well located to transit a lot of the\nThe criteria in the Amazon proposal um or well situated to the site in the Gulch\nYeah absolutely um er Jennifer ... hanging out with us from central and a progress and we're digging into this Gulch controversy going on so so the CIA hands making this proposal and we're back to also wanting to have some\nPublic money be a part of this and is that where the controversy is on where the where the money goes or where it's coming from what's the what's the issue right now\nI think if if I had to characterize it it would be um that the team is looking to not only the city but the state\nUm to help with some tools to finance the project and I'm In that conversation then it leads to the public benefits in exchange for a partnership\nWith um with government than what other benefits or we receiving and um and I I think it's really on the scale to write it it's a big number when you add everything up\nUm the the upside of potential um financing tool could reach 'em to one point seven billion dollar yeah when you really dial that back the reality is this is not money sitting in the bank account somewhere that someone striking a check\nUm the the funds that are being identified are created by the development occurring effectively the ability to use our sales taxes and property taxes will pay back the investment that the developer has to make up front or so from what I have gathered um\nThere is you know the mayor is all for moving ahead at with that one point seven billion and the governor also has said yes he likes this he wants to move forward\nBut the Atlanta city council who gets a vote in all of this is barking right now do you know what their concerns are when I should mention that central and a progress also thinks this is a good thing and wants to move forward\nUm we do and um you know is likely on like I mentioned we um has\nHad information about the deal so has become very comfortable with it um understand the components of it is relatively complex\nUm and believe it's a great deal for the city so we're trying to get the information out their share information so that others can get up to speed if they like you weren't paying quite as much attention right along the way it really is there's a lot going on especially when they're complicated yeah yeah and so I think that the city council is really reflecting on questions and concerns from their constituents their\nUm it depends on your perspective one question is about jobs um there is um because of the creation of new office space in retail space significant opportunity for jobs I'm not just during construction but permanent jobs could be\n... up to forty thousand new jobs created in this new twelve to Fifteen block area forty acres of downtown\nUm affordability I'm clearly if I'm an issue that our city is discussing it a much larger scale how did that manifest itself here\nUm and that the benefits on there will be of a workforce housing on site on the developer has made a commitment actually a pretty impressive commitment to a minimum\nOf twenty percent of the units built onsite which could be up to three thousand unit would be affordable for Ninety nine years so this is double the level of the the the amount of housing and it it is significant extension of the timeline of any other affordable housing deals in the city\nLike if my first question on that topic would just be um you know how reliable is that commitment because I feel like we've had other projects where we've had those kinds of promises and then they haven't really come to fruition I Know you know the belt line um has been a question of\nBailout and that way so in this particular case the I Am the developer has a development agreement with the city of Atlanta um and all of the funding repayment um is predicated on delivering these benefits\nOkay so what do they you know put some legal documents from place to make that happen I mean how does that work so that they are ... you know they can't just say they got to really do it\nOn you know there is always risky mitigate the risk the risk is that the economy changes and the projects doesn't get built to housing units are not delivered but then the money is not deliver it either because we are ... so that development agreement between the I Am\nThe city of Atlanta is key\nTo and just to be clear before we wrap things up this idea of affordable housing ... there is nobody being displaced from current housing in this project ...\nNo you're exactly correct on actually the C. I. M. group is already under construction on some new housing adjacent to the site it's adjacent to castle Barry hill I'm but today um I ... ... no one lives in the parking lot\nNo one lives in the parking lot and the benefits to having this project downtown just a more robust and bustling downtown\nYeah absolutely I mean we described it as a whole it's we we say it's a hole in the heart of the city um you know we want to see it really activated\nI'm with new jobs with new places um to visit to eat to die and so um what do you live in the new development or you just come down um you know for a ... falcons game um that you don't feel that they're connected now and it's an easy walk back over to Capitol Hill to the west side back to five points\nUm you know sometimes we we do this type of reinvestment incrementally here we have a tremendous opportunity in a really complex site um to move 'em and make really a whole part of our city that's been neglected I'm more thriving and frankly contributing back to the tax base\nJennifer thank you so much for your wisdom on this topic I really appreciate you filling in the details and filling in the hole in my heart you know that's what I'm saying out here for you there you go that again with Jennifer ... from\nCentral Atlanta progress we'll put a link to a offing central Atlanta progress on our show on a page at dot com [noise]\n\nPhone would ring on Facebook and Twitter address Reno beret and doing a very useful news here on TALK radio six forty and streaming live only fired review ah\n[noise] [noise]\nIt would be the radio I'm from Robert in the Carolinas which suffered through Hurricane Florence last month are now dealing with the remnants of hurricane Michael parts of North Carolina and Virginia could be up to nine inches of rain as what is now a tropical storm makes its way out to the letter bringing the tornadoes an additional flooding\nWhich is once you get that going then what do we do from there to\nEnsure that you're never back again okay so I I Want to revisit part of the conversation 'cause I'm trying to get into your brain and see how you made the decisions to do this so you use the money that was going to be used for you to have a place to stay in a in a a ... in an apartment to fix your car\nSo instead of being Carlos you chose homeless\nOr so what had occurred was\nThat was and parks will a part of the very small town\nSo I wasn't able to find work because it was in the summer so everybody was already very over there so I mean I had the adult vehicle to drive down to a Korea will be able to secure somewhere or can too shocked at the moment mhm\nEvent that I Would have the money to get a ... um I wanted to add transportation to get to work I guess\nThey don't ... know buses drive from a a cheap bus ticket wouldn't have got new to the pleasure that you're living now um and shut up by it or\nNot well being was really like where the like down there and I really emotionally stable up and\nSo part of how you got here I guess my point is not necessarily jobs or even financial is just bad decision making\nAnd I'm not I'm not trying to shame though yet I'm just trying to say I want to analyze how you got here so we never get here again and that's what I'm trying to do with you OK\nI'm a ... and so what we've got to do is say OK when in doubt we have a place to live so [noise] um the second thing that keeps coming up is there's no jobs there's no jobs there's no jobs I don't know anything about British Columbia in terms of el\n... now I have a new job right now but\nThey suck\nThe server yeah yeah I mean\nYou're making any money and so I Know that if you were in Nashville would I Would tell you to do is take your last fifty dollars and go buy a leaf blower rich people are afraid leaves\nYou know I mean you can you can find ... you can go create work right I mean a hundred young men knock on our door where the pressure washer and he's\n... he's pressure washing driveways and paying for his tuition to go to college and so there's work to be done that pays a whole lot more than ten hours a week as a server with bad tips in your situation and so I got to do something to create income here and it's probably some kind of\nSelf employed unpleasant thing that you do for a little while but that pays really good\nI mean for a short term all heavy cleanup septic tanks with a toothbrush ship it pays good to get you some money okay 'cause right now in the short term you need money right that's what we're doing and I've done all those kinds of things on the subject I go to Russia when I've done everything else okay\nUh you know cut grass and hauled treasure way and shoveled stuff and I've done all that kind of stuff and and honestly you can get people doing that kinda stuff for them or\nTo pay you better jobs and then you can make six dollars an hour or somewhere you know uh and so what happens is is your spend a lot of effort\nTrying to analyze the local job economy and get jobs suck\nAnd I'm trying to think of how we can get you working a lot\nLike your car running yeah my car driving I delivered pizzas there\nUm\nI think I Would probably make more money serving like I Want I\nMean again I don't know British Columbia but everywhere else you deliver pizzas we'll do that like five six seven nights a week you can make two thousand dollars a month and we can get you in an apartment\nYeah yeah ... ... in those I had to go anywhere\nI can I put it to\nAnd how long is sure how much should the all white\nOkay then you need

debt what do you tell people when they show you paid off all your debt when you say you pay off your desk and they say how to do that\nWell I think we first started to start to budget together and really get both parties involved all in I was a little bit more passive early on and then I started to really look at the number one thing and then we got really focused to sell me every dollar\nAnd we're just all in you know\nYou know when she went and got her second job started work on that and then I was like well I Can't let her\nKnow do that on her own and so then I started working as much overtime as possible as well so okay All right and she got involved in the budgeting oh yeah so I'm I'm the spender and uh it definitely is the winner gets involved heavily it it definitely uh goes a lot further\nOut of ... if the savor your they're involved in well in both of your work on it they're just accountability\nAbsolutely that was the only thing I was gonna say is keeping their accountability accountable yeah um we also um made like a vision board um that we had like chains we really got the McCain does involve me when we take links are changed the ham\nHave them involved

smart yeah [laughter]\nI was on the other heard things around in a good job I could I could go without me scared [laughter]\nOh my gosh you guys weren't crazy dog Ramsey oh God yes where are you and your name around all the time\nSo but yeah you know to be careful what you have a pet winning one heaven because the one before her went to heaven and so I'm Out in the front yard you on that\nOkay um and so you're doing your budget okay and are you trying to put money in every category and the budget\nThey think they'll be leaving our grocery though back here that twenty five dollars an hour and that's how we scraped up a hundred dollars or twenty five dollars a week not not okay Raman noodles or I can be in\nTouch and so what's your household income\nUm between thirty and forty thousand dollars there hasn't been an actual guard at that when you get to go to guard duty we make an extra thousand dollars a month [noise] bang when he's home he works for my parents Showtime and he makes about thirty out here\nWhat does he do for a living here mhm\nOkay\nSo what's he want to be doing ten years or Twenty years from now that makes them a lot more money\nUm\n'cause y'all are starving to death [laughter] I ... I talked to him about it and he's like oh I don't really I Dreamed that would be nice to have more money [laughter] he acted\nHears I'm always worked really hard we got married when he was Eighteen and he worked about sixty hours a week then on the corner and held it he he is a hard worker and he'd do anything for me\nMhm okay um\nI was in questioning a hearty works as questioning and make your money\nYou see the difference yes I work real hard to do yeah a lot\nLike this week already sixty hours and It's Wednesday so I'm a Thursday or whatever it is I mean forgot what it is or we go so anyway but I'm\nA I don't always do that every week but you know you've got to look at things and say\nFor the labor I'm putting out on the time I have away from my family and the stress and the strain on my body in my mind and my emotions what am I getting paid in Europe the answer is not much and that's part of what you are facing as your income challenge\nIs that right okay\nAnd I'm so why why does that brings tears\nI feel like we've just been we've had to struggle\nAnd you know like I Try to be we try to be financially responsible you know like we we've now for ...\nYeah I don't think ... I don't think you're irresponsible thinking man I really I think you're doing really good 'cause you don't have the money\nI feel like at this point I had hoped to be a little bit more had any doubt paycheck to paycheck yeah\nYeah but it there's two parts of the equation ride the income side and they almost side and you know have you noticed that didn't even ask you about the I'll go side near cash they are and that's because I think you're probably doing pretty good there\nWe really we should have a baby step number you're down in about six months\nAnd I think you're ... I think you're stretching the few dollars that you have really well so I think you're I think you're very responsible people I don't think you're overspending I don't think you're crazy I don't think you're spoiled brats um and I think he's a hard worker\nYeah\nI think you've got all that stuff going for you and that's why I Want you to win better than your winning and so I really think you guys put the kids to bed and I turn off TV light a candle or two and just sit on back porch and talk and say\nOh you know they make some more money um and it's not 'cause money's everything is because when you are or you know doing the best you can do with the dollars you're having their not stretch and then we've got to look at something what are we going to do to create some others\nIncome short term short term and long term\nWe did last night and I actually got a job at a local library but after I pay for childcare only bring home about thirty to forty dollars a day [laughter] [noise]\nSo that's that's not that's not the answer then right after we got a better a better income coming in to afford childcare if you're going to be working [noise] and and he's got to have a game plan\nAnd I don't know whether he opens his own butcher shop or whether he becomes the most famous butcher in the world doing it on TV I don't care what he does [laughter] I'm not saying you cannot be butchers but uh you can't be a butcher their ten years from now and be anywhere but where you are right now\nThe accents\nAnd so I I you know what are we going to do with the skill or this\nThing or did he just fall into this 'cause your parents were doing it or you know that's kind of exactly what happened yeah and so but I mean what if let's just kind of take the white board out start over eraser life on the white borders second and say gosh if we can do anything we wanted to do what would we do\nYeah and then let's go about doing that they don't do it today and\nWalk in and throw you know throw your knife down and walk out that's not what I'm saying but I Am saying we need a plan that takes us somewhere where we say okay this month I got a hundred bucks left over but it's not always going to be this way but it is always going to be that way if you don't change something agreed\nAgreed okay I think you can do it you're good people this is not a lot of character issues and it's not a a lack of a effort issue and it's not an immaturity thing you guys just simply mathematically it's income minus outgoing or not much income\nYeah so and he told us\nWhat how do we go about bringing it up with my parents you know like it would really be\nWhen he's gone to drill here they only talk about how inconvenient for that and it's so hard on my dad if you got heart problems and they have to take over all of the work that they're very very small operation ...\nOkay so let's kind of think about this for [laughter] this is not working for your bad 'cause it's not working for has not working for you\nYeah so this whole thing and it worked but I don't know how may not the way of bringing it up is we love your own we'd love to help you but we are starving to death over here\nAnd we're not going to continue to do this anymore and you don't have to do it today\nBut you know you can say you know my husband we don't we're taking classes and he's going to be a an X or y or Z two years from now and that's what he's going to start doing because that's really his dream\nBecause the owner would look to sell the office to another potential a buyer these offices sell very quickly within our area\nYou're talking about the building\nYou know the practice itself on sale I have a I have a hundred thousand fade\nThe practice it'd be five hundred so it'd be really probably helped a great together and other ... four hundred thousand dollars\nIn a year I mean if you could ever get tied up for a year and close that that's\nYou know\nUh and then by the real estate the second year more than a you know ... for the first year in ... to IRS a problem I I heard one I'm struggling with you you have an obvious member on the beliefs of le fabulous income I mean crazy wonderful income but I Do not tell people to borrow money to buy businesses\nAnd I'm not going to tell you to borrow money to buy this I think you can save up the money in a year\nAnd I think it'd be just didn't you know negotiate with this guy put together a deal and\nEven if you um took it over ran it for a year and I had an option to buy and put a hundred thousand dollars that down as your option to buy the practice and then clothes on the practice in one year in ... by cash for it and close on the real estate the next year and pay cash for it and that's how I Would do it if I were in your shoes\nUm I Do not borrow money mark and I do not tell people on the show to borrow money for business purchases\nUm I don't believe in it I think it gets you into problems and I'm a you know if this guy wants to sell this ... this practice to you that show and they'll have to sell it if I were negotiating the deal\nBut I mean certainly you can do what you want to do I think that practice um you know I suspect it's going to even add more to your income and then in the third year of this discussion you can probably pay off your house I didn't ask what your mortgage balance was but um I don't go into debt to

open phones at Tripoli eight to five five two to five or Melissa is on Facebook and Dave Ramsey a bicycle dot com slash they ... what exactly does it mean if the term insurance is Twenty years I'm forty three\nShould I go for longer or shorter term well that means that policy will not change for Twenty years\nIt's called twenty year level term and you'll have the same premium and the same amount of coverage for Twenty years after Twenty years the premium will go up dramatically um or you can go have another medical exam and buy a new policy that will not be\nGo up nearly as much as that one would go up now the question is how long do you need life insurance\nIf you've got a six year old and a twelve year old and Twenty years you'll have a twenty six year old and I'm thirty two

feels really good\nCool what do you teach a law oh good okay so a law professor and MD mhm not by\nA tip so long ago it was a lot of work to get to where we are a bit and uh I think you know coming out of medical school it's um\nYou you have this big lump of money that you owe and I remember getting statements in the mail from the loan company and I would just kind of open them and put them and put it into the side because it's so overwhelming and um I\nI was nervous about having to make an Eighteen hundred to two thousand dollar payment every month for ten years and then end up paying almost double what I'd a borrowed ...\nAnd it's basically like paying off a mortgage so um we were\nWe actually had a great I'm attending physician that during my fourth year med school actually sat us down and said\nYou know we're we're going to talk about money and we were thinking oh easy and it teaches out billing or how to run a practice and he's like no some day you're going to make a lot of money and you need to know what to do with it so you don't end up like me and my sixties and I can't retire 'cause I\n'cause I have that still while um and so he's he's the one that I heard uh your name from and got the total money make or a book and read that and\nI'm probably it was another year or two before I really started the program 'cause\nBeing in med school and not having any income living off loans it's kinda hard to figure out how you're going to pay out that while you're taking out then send 'em and then Alan and I met and we were engaged and\nWe want it to start or mirrors off rights or we want to sort of getting the same page for ... or ... or what have you with a sort of what our future was\nSold out Allen actually had a when we met he had already paid off all his school loans and had a lot of savings and I'm like hey you want to get married I've got a hundred and fifty five thousand now that you\nKnow I don't think I felt really guilty doing that yeah yeah\nAnd our church I'm at the time was offering it for you and so I'd like to go to the class because I'm terrified and I don't know what to do and\nI'm so we did that in that was in two thousand twelve wish she did that while we were engaged and so we got married August twenty twelve and so\nTo this day you know before we got married we had our budget ready to go on the spreadsheet ... from the nerd and to this day we can tell you every penny we've spent since the day we got married so that's been that's been an interesting journey but definitely blessed that\nExactly in the last two and a half years yes okay\nSo here's the thing we know about putting miles on a car and you know this is the more miles you put on the car the more you destroy its value correct\nCorrect and so if I'm going to travel um or for instance people who travel for a living people road warriors I call them they you know there there have to travel for work all the time I'm In that case you want to drive in that case you want to drive the least expensive vehicle to get the job done because you are destroying whatever you drive\nI mean you more and more grab a hundred thousand dollar car you it's going to be worth nothing by the time you finish traveling\nAnd so I'm unless you've just got millions of dollars and even before to lose a hundred grand but but you know most people don't have that so basically what we're saying is you're going to take the Seventeen thousand our vehicle and you're going to cause it to drop in value faster than anything else what's your household income\nUm I make about eighty thousand until you're single\n... single bachelor rental renting a small little\nOkay All right I'm always hanging out you have any debt\nOr just a car that ... ...\nUm eleven thousand okay All right\nWell there's nothing you know I'm hearing here this crazy as long as you realize that you know the Seventeen thousand dollar car might be worth um you're going to lose a few thousand dollars extra on it just because you're going to travel in it okay\nAnd as long as you're willing to do that ... it with the kind of money you make you should be okay let's get the car paid off as soon as possible so your preferences keep it in drive it is that right\nAh my public at the kicker for five or six years now but my friends and co worker whatever the fate betray they could try to get crazy to keep it to trade it in for what\nUm last night on I I was running around the brand new BMW hoarded uh-huh exiled falling in love with\nRon well that'd be easy to fall in love with that but the but that's even more expensive so we're going to destroy even more expensive car if you want to travel and that right\nYeah and to upgrade to a brand new one you know that would be twenty percent less\nWell number one they're in ... and you don't have the money to do that so that's ludicrous we wouldn't do it on that basis alone but on the idea that you're going to travel in it no you don't want to you know you don't want to upgrade and destroying more expensive cars about how you show if you if you're gonna travel\nYou need to run the wheels off to something that's not going to cost you as much\nSo we don't upgrade in order to lose more money when we don't have any money\nThat that doesn't make sense at all so whoever your friends are I mean they're they're encouraging you to do stupidity but I've had friends that have encouraged me to do is to ... I didn't have to do it though [noise] uh Brian's with us in Bakersfield, California hey Brian how are you\nBetter than I've been there day how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nOkay they so far I found you at the beginning of this year I impulse to and purchased they ridiculous car [laughter] and as soon as I found you I was like crap\n[laughter] oh well did you buy\nUm we bought a two thousand fans must let's fix with all the bells and whistles so we eat\nYeah well not for the sake of my pocket hurts\nYeah well I guess but I mean the cars great now okay All right yeah so what what are you oh on the ... thing\nWe'll thirty five thousand mhm okay and what's your how Adam\nHere won't be making the the fifty five maybe touching Seventy depending on my overtime oh yeah those are just you know\nSo and I'm next year I'll be getting a ... percent right plus another factor that rate down the road yeah I'm so she asked my age I'm calling to see if you what if you're OK with fish a memo I finally agreed to let it go\nGood and sell it it it's worth Twenty one thousand oh God yeah she ... down into it or die that bad\nYeah and I that that it only took like three months good lord so Twenty one down trading\nYes well I mean you know twenty three on private fail\nSomething that's not enough of a spread on private so she sent this car went from thirty five thousand uh twenty three thousand and one year\nActually technically over forty thousand two thirty five thousand I also canceled the warranty on it\n'cause we had a extending warranty yeah and and we found out back and it's funny how when you pay off vehicle already reached ... miles all of a sudden a it starts to fail on you and our chief counsel Africa you or did\nThe cars one our old\nAnd I almost a year old yeah\nAll right so yeah when you get rid of this thing for so many reasons so so what's your plan\nA plan is a member like people\nI Know we saw um four thousand five thousand dollar cars I'm I could save up that money\nAnd I already have in my neck thank um refund\nBut what I was thinking is because our monthly payment at the hub throughout the whole month and it's like eight hundred dollars so because I also have a student loan and assuming payments like once she about almost done with that and we have like six thousand dollars left over\nSo what it what it might just go ahead and sell this car mhm bottled a difference and go to the guy who are on the car that showing for like four or five thousand dollars and just make payments off on this for like a hundred bucks and the monthly payment will go down to four hundred dollars to making a mess mhm\nYeah I mean to be okay with it yeah sure but I I I'm not sure I understood how your financing the your second car the ... of the uh the five thousand dollar car there you're buying how are you financing it\nThey'll just go ahead just like\nYou know just like you're going to go buy a car for a little down payment on it oh okay I Know where the you know what I mean\nYou know that's fine if you can just get a regular car loan on it that's fine let's do that because we're still reducing your debt by half\nRight and um by doing this and then you can concentrate on getting that carpeted off and then getting the whole that your dog with this other car which is absolutely horrendous it's a great car I'm surprised that thing just drop that foreign value um make real sure you got your numbers right on that\nBecause I I mean I\nThe cars are horrible as far as going down in value I get it I I'm I'm a card guy but they and they go down in value rapidly but that one is like a black hole for money on or something like that is incredible\nAnd then you start that when you're twenty to thirty to forty or fifty two but you can put that money on there every month and you don't stop based on a Beagle tracing the rabbit looking into a camera\nIn some New York studio ... you don't stop and start and try to figure out when the market's going over when the market's going down you just by remarked\nShort millionaires to and that's how they become millionaires\nBut when you jump up and you jump down and you jumped up and you're jump down and you're trying to figure this out you're going to lose your but\nNo one gets hurt on a rollercoaster except those jump off ride the ride throw your hands up\nAnd say we see it's all it's a special\nYou'll buy some\nI I don't I'm always tempted when they go down to buy extra I don't even ...
