{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Uh and I'm the same way now like sometimes I'll go to go out of my during the morning with the dog and I'll realize that the door has been a mock all night long that's really bad um\nI have terrible I forget to like the car forget to like the house and I'm I'm very bad about my passwords and security on mine as well but if you were a normal person and not like me\nI'm then you should probably change your ID and password just just than a but at the very least make sure you log out of my back on I Do feel like one of the confusing things about all of\nThese hacks and scandals and breaches along the way is that you know we hear this news\nAnd to some extent we're you know we're like immune to it now are like oh you know another breach and you don't do anything because you like that's a big deal I'm the big ones are going to come along and we're not going to do anything\nTo protect ourselves ahead of time or after the fact when we should so I think the bigger question from all of these to me is what is the implication and I don't feel like the media and I can't help with us because I don't know but I think the implication of what they can get like that's where\nYou know they got my credit card but then they never used it so what does that really mean is it\nThat do I should I worry or you know they got my user i._d. and password but then I don't think anything happen with that but maybe it will in a year I mean this is where\nIt's really hard to connect the meaning of the event to the consequence and you know I got an email the other day from a friend of mine\nThat I Know is very liberal I just know and I got this email that came into my inbox that was essentially wanting me to sign a petition to help get Brett Kavanaugh confirmed and I'm pretty I'm pretty sure that was their email being hacked so I just delete it the amount than look at it but\nI don't know how that email got compromise right and then if I clicked on it then what would have happened to me and so I Do think it would be better if they gave us some more clear understanding with each of these hacks with hey if\nYour information was part of this hack change all drop all your credit card and start over freeze your credit immediately because you know or you know change all of your social media passwords\nBecause don't just do it but here's why here's what could happen to you\nWell let's see if it's something we forget about sometimes it's just so interconnected everything is right your email address that's your logging for how many different things the password you use for your Facebook account password for how many things in your life and how many things have you just\nSaid OK final log in with Facebook rights and and so you're connected the all these other apps and that's the other thing they suggest as a safety measure is to go on connect all the apps that you've allowed Facebook to connect with but the problem is\nThe reason first of all I don't even know once you if you've connected that way like if I have an idea and password I've written down somewhere not always in the right place\nMarch jotted down the ones that I've just logged on with Facebook I don't know oh and the whole reason I did I Know you can go through Facebook and figure it out I Know next to me that but but but face on it right I Know but I think you know people don't even think through which things they're doing that on 'em and you do it because you like the convenience\nSo somebody needs to come up with a highly encrypted super easy way to log into a bunch of stuff that can't be hacked how about that and if that you\nAnd you are listening to me and the greater metro Atlanta area than have I got a suggestion for you or\nJoined the Atlanta starting to battle they have extended their deadline on and you can win a hundred thousand dollar investment in your company so I Love\nThe idea of somebody who can figure out how to save us from his password debacle\nAnd the hassle of all of that winning\nFor you because you'd have to be a lot smarter than me but if it's you uh get in on the Atlanta started about all again the deadline has been extended to October eighth you still have a few days to get your application and I work in a post a link\nTo how to apply on our show notes page at ... dot com and also if you just want to go a watch you can still get tickets to the actual Atlanta starting to battle event which is happening November thirteenth the mark your calendar and get your tickets I Do believe\nThis is one of those ... cells out every year so\nI'm going to switch gears and talk about other events you might want to be aware of in the coming weeks a first of all you can do this one from the comfort comfort of your couch a with a big old bowl of popcorn and your beverage of choice perhaps beer I don't know um but it is a midterm election season and\nUh we are going to have debates at all levels in Georgia so the G. P. B. S. along with the Atlanta press club are putting on a debate series\nA they started actually live streaming a and recording the debates this morning a they'll start airing on PBS tomorrow night at seven PM is the first oh I think tonight actually know today during the day a few of them are getting a\nOut there but just started GB dot org and search for debate scheduled that's the best way to find the schedule\nBut literally you've got everything from at every level from public service commission a two state school superintendent to agriculture commissioner insurance commissioner attorney general\nA lieutenant governor it's all the congressional districts that have opened races right now we'll have debates and then of course the gubernatorial debate that is the the grand finale if you will um and if you're really not sure if you're in the undecided camp at least on governor and lieutenant governor\nYou may want to wait until you see those debates before you early vote because early voting starts soon I think right a deadline for\nRegistration is next week when the better the tenth okay and then early voting starts when do you know a good what's up with one I think it's shortly thereafter\nHonestly it's sometime within a few weeks because of the election itself will be the first week of November the gubernatorial debate on G. P. B. won't be happening until Tuesday Oct ... October twenty third so uh if you want to see that before you vote then plan on voting the next day maybe like the twenty fourth for early voting slope\nAnd then um but\nCheck that out also ah the lieutenant governor debate is on a ... be on Wednesday October tenth\nAnd early voting starts on the fifteenth of October so thank you for the next following week Monday's laugh\nUm listen it's really close\nThe gubernatorial race in Georgia right now between Stacey Abrams and Brian ... is\nEssentially a toss up uh every new poll that comes out shows them you know within the margin of error almost sort of right there um\nAt the at neck and neck on that race so your vote will matter and you know there is no electoral college on a state vote right like we don't have to worry about that\nThere is no district ... district ing issues like there might be on your congressional\nBoat I mean this is a statewide vote so this is one in which your vote fully and totally matters lieutenant governors all they'll have the state level positions their state level position so every single vote counts and that's assuming we can count them right but that's a whole other [laughter] that's a discussion\nFor a whole other day uh All right well we're running through a events he might want to put on your calendar please know Bob Woodward is coming to the Fox theater on October twenty eighth yeah of course is the Pulitzer Prize winning reporter uh best known for the Nixon era reporting he did and a Pulitzer Prize he wants to that\nAh but he has a new book out fear Trump in the White House and uh he'll be talking about that book in conversation with the Atlanta Journal constitution editor Kevin Riley\nThe tickets will go on sale this Friday October fest\nAt noon on if you want more details on that you can go to Fox theater dot org um you can also called the ticket office we're going to post a link to all of that on our ... page 'cause I Do think it will sell out\nI really do I mean I Know that we're in a red state and all that stuff but I think there's a there's a lot of blue and the urban areas and there's going to be a lot of people that want to hear from ... from Bob Woodward and hear what he has to say the interesting hearing conversation of Kevin Riley too with the local um interviewer it really should have been made let's be honest but ah\nYou know I Do wonder if Kevin uh Reilly we'll ask him questions that relate to Georgia specifically you know or a pill stick with all sort of national level Trump stuff um it'll be interesting to see how that goes down I'd love to go so hopefully I'll be able to get a ticket to that but put it on your calendar uh\nIt's October twenty eighth tickets go on sale again on October fest for that ah obviously a lot going on by the minute on

got I got the issue with that uh my point is is still\nA I don't think that's going to change the equation or like a a a you know if I'm In your shoes I Want you to not just accept carte blanche that there's one way or not not I mean not medically one way but pricing structure in approach to this\nPaying for it there's only one way to do this is the twenty thousand dollar while you're on TALK to friends and that's what they all say it's all twenty thousand dollars 'cause they don't want the same doctor and it's all those dollars alone I Want to learn about Seventy five hundred dollar idea and try that a couple of times I'll I'll gamble a little bit with the medical profession if I'm In your shoes in other words\nAnd that helps me if I'm In your shoes go\nHey we're going to take a couple of months off and we're going to take ten thousand dollars and and then we're going to go back at it again on the debt while we see how that works out and then if we need to stop again and go out ten thousand dollars and then go back out the dad again that'd be fine\nYeah OK but my wife will be very happy to hear that yeah I mean I I I Would do that but but don't just accept\nThe one guy as the only way to attempt this okay in terms of ... not not in terms of medical procedure I'm not talking about that I don't know anything about that but in terms of the pricing structure and it has to do with you\nKnow the the the ... whether\nThey guarantee you know multiple tries us you know you buy a package of five or whatever all that kind of stuff I've heard all kinds of ways of getting at is and it's kind of weird to talk about it that way but [noise] but that's really what's going on and so just learn a little bit more push back get some other opinions from other pricing structures and then based on that yes\nYou know if you want to take a month or two off of the ... a baby step to and you know I have the cash to do whatever you're doing and then go back out the baby step to again and then if you have to stop again and try another time that that's fine I don't have any issue with that but um\nDo we just say oh no it's thirty five thousand dollars like discussion the other day which is absurd and we're just going to stop everything and go do that because we've completely lost our minds and uh because this was an emotional subject and it's very very important to have babies and I'm completely with you might be the best things on the planet I mean it's awesome I Love it\nSo I you know that that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes that's what I Would do is just learn

a townhouse in Seattle what's that worth\nA well we're actually like thirty minutes south of Seattle not in yeah [laughter] don't count that yeah yeah so I Would say they're around right now a hundred and fifty a hundred and forty but when I bought it um so it was like around Seventy so it doubled okay wow so you're single\nYes single mom I have two kids um\nThey're eleven and nine so this was just on my income\nSo you're just plowed through it as making sixty grand as a single mom with two kids and paid off your house at thirty one years old\nYeah rock star it's incredible telling your story what happened four years ago that made you think you could do this\nSo actually my journey started an eight years ago that's when I found you back then I used to listen to Suzie Orman read her book than I'm kind of a nerd um went to school for business and I think I was looking for like a book and personal finance and that's when I came upon the total money make over\nAt first when I write ... oh okay this sounds interesting but um I mean as I got into it more I really liked what you had I started listening to you and that's when I was like hooked 'cause you go straight to the point\nSo I started up paying off my credit cards I had a little bit of credit card debt as student loans small student loan um like three thousand and then I really got intense on paying off my car\nWhich at that time was like twelve thousand\nI'm so that was around eight years I've been on this journey for eight years I've had at my two kids or what people didn't know what that I was in a relationship that was toxic it was abusive um both verbal and\nPhysical so I'm just being on the plan helped me kind of set myself up to her I didn't have to be in second in a relationship in that particular relationship mhm\nUm I started I paid off my car started putting money in savings emergency fun because I knew that once you know the relationship ended that I'd be\nThe only one reason you know financially responsible for my kids um which is what happened so five years ago um I had an emergency fun I started ... putting money aside for a house luckily I was able to stay with my mom at that time we were staying with my mom\nUm there was a some domestic abuse and then to the end and\nUm but I had set myself up to where I had no debt so they will six months later to purchase the townhouse so that we're kinda started\nYour amazing I think you\nYou're a survivor I don't know if you know this or not there is a very a correlation between extreme levels are financial control and domestic violence\nSo usually if a guy's this big a jerk yeah\nAbusive verbally and physically he also tries to control you through the money and that sounds like what was going on here what am I hearing that right\nYeah oh I'm the one that word so I was able to push he didn't work that they will result in his home so I knew\nThat I read about you got rid of a larger that's awesome\n[laughter] yeah\nLike I like that where you lose your check out here and the loser\nYet and I have to you know get things to you for putting together this plan so I can\nSay my young when did it you're a hero I mean your bus loose from loser bill [laughter] and you go get your car paid off move in with your mom get your emergency fund now you're living in a paid for ALS just outside Seattle is worth a hundred and fifty thousand dollars I wouldn't by the way you're thirty one [laughter] I think you're incredible\nI think you know I Wonder if they think are very um she's like my best friend's sister ... not really sister but you know being motivator so\nSo uh there's a twenty six year old out there listening\nWere your house payment at thirty eight hundred bucks over eight hundred does not demand over time\nYou can pay an eight hundred dollar house payment on thirty eight hundred without working ...\nOr medical and I found that ... what A L o yeah I'm here\nI'm just hearing word voices coming from somewhere else\nOh my wife didn't that that may\nOh oh okay good All right so uh um but the\nThe thirty eight hundred over the eight hundred is not your problem what were your paying and rent before\nFour hundred okay\nShow four hundred dollars is breaking you guys making thirty eight hundred a month\n\nAnd that's what I mean I'm having\nA look at our budget multiple times trying to figure out where we can ... we don't have a vehicle payments we have both our cars are paid off mhm\nUm but ... medical bills for my daughter are equate to about nine hundred a month\nMhm um\nYou have that or that whether you rent it or whether you bought the\nGrip\nThe house didn't didn't change that and when ... was four hundred dollars a month\nAnd you don't have any do you have any other data other than your home\nOr go alone um we have\nSix thousand dollars in outstanding medical bills we haven't paid yet and then unfortunately uh about a thousand dollars on a credit card\nOr ... or ... you you you've got a tight budget but this is not um you know be\n... I mean I ... I don't tell people to buy a home when they're in that okay so if you call me every time I was told you ought to buy but this house is not like\nYou know if you call me up you're making thirty eight hundred dollars your husband's Fifteen hundred dollars and now we got a problem I'm going to put that out on the market but your house payment is way less than a fourth of your take on pay\nAnd so you're fine I mean it's really not your problem\nI think you guys are just starting to budget and uh the emotional weight of a ... of dealing with the medical situation you're facing and when you're when you're a baby I mean when you're babies' heart and they're just ... it just wears you down you know that's just makes you human or makes you a good daddy and a good mommy\nBut when the truth is it makes it kind of hard to see past ah I'm just looking at the drama math numbers right now I don't ... I mean I I feel for you guys know pray for you but I don't have the emotional weight\nThat you guys have got facing the stuff you face every day dealing with the situation you know so\nThat's just very real a ... but but the math actually you know thirty eight hundred bucks minus nine hundred dollars minus eight hundred dollars for a house payment or you know minus food honest lights modest water doesn't leave a lot of room but you could pay your\nMuch on everything doing that and then you can pick up your overtime and start making some headway on some of these deaths and cleaning them often as they these little desk clean all these credit cards outstanding medical bills in student loans clean off\nYou know over the next year and a half two years you're gonna start having a little bit of wiggle room and you guys will keep moving forward and head but I I think that that you're just\nYou know you're just feeling the weight of all of this and it's kinda clouding it's this is doable though where are you are is doable I I think you can pull it off no I Would not show your house or would not have bought it because I don't ... to buy a house where we got that but\nIt's your house is not like when I hear those numbers on my like what are you crazy none of that so there none of it you're you're it's very very reasonable\nUh for your situation now would it help if you earn an extra thousand bucks a month you'd that dumb rotted would clean this mess up faster two thousand bucks a month even faster so are you have you got a couple of years are really hard work and lots of overtime inside jobs ahead of you yeah you sure do\nAre you guys going to be taking a bunch of fans who vacations no you've got a bunch of that\nYou're cleaning up after reality but hold on I'll have to like pick up we're going to get your copy of the total money make over book and give it to ya and um help get you started and if you need some more help you call me I'll help you in any way I can\nI'm Sorry you guys are facing all these challenges but I think you're up for it I think you can do the math makes sense to me that you're giving me unless there's something we left out of this equation\nSo thank you for the call Josh is with us in Los Angeles Hi Josh how are you\nGood how are you doing Dave better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] not too much I've got a question for you I'm On baby step which is pay off my house early [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't have any other debt because my house they have a six month emergency fun um but I kinda did all your stuff out of order because I never really liked that but anyway um I have a hundred and sixty four thousand dollars less to pay off my house\nBut I also have about a hundred thousand dollars invested in mutual fund and stuff like that and I'm curious\nWould it be wiser to um take the hundred thousand dollars out of my personal investment put that all toward the house and then just pay off the remaining sixty four thousand or should I leave that money invested and the money that I have every month just accelerate payment on my how\n... what's your household income\nUh probably about a hundred and fifty thousand\nSo you could be like that free and when you were if you did this\nUh um yeah yeah I'd be done by the end of next year I'm sure if I if I took the hundred thousand but it's hard to tell\nIf your house was paid for and you didn't have any money and investments what'd you borrow a hundred thousand on your home to putting investments\n[noise] know same thing\nUm I don't follow a time\nWell I mean if you have a hundred thousand dollars in an investment and you take it out the investment in order to put in and pay off your home that's the same thing in reverse if you didn't do that it's the same thing is if you if you leave it in the investment it's the same thing as borrowing on your home to invest deserved it\nGot it yeah\nOkay so it's a balance sheet equation meaning that balance sheet is where you list your assets on one side of the pager liabilities on the other side of the page\nAnd right and you can switch back and forth by borrowing money\nMeaning if you were sitting there with no investments paid for house you could you could borrow money and put you know money you drop dead over there on that one side of the page but on the other side of the page now you'd have an investment right\nAnd all I'm doing is on doing that by asking the question in reverse though it's a bit of a trick I kind of ... ah the trick is that it makes you think not just with your head but also with your heart\nAnd I always like to think of when my my head is where I Do math in my heart for a measure risk\nAnd your real risk averse you hate that like I Do yeah and so the idea of borrowing on a paid for house chagrin investment is absurd and your mind\nYeah I mean you immediately reacted but that's a heart things she that's where that's at risk bark this ... that you're measuring this cause you to do that you didn't stop and do math you went you recoiled and went crazy and your mind right you know\nAnd that's that that but and and start by asking it in reverse so all

more than that yeah they can survive it more than that and again I Want to hear the story around the income you know they just started the job and you know might be their incomes going to be going up dramatically in the next two years the same and\nI had I had that they're protective tenants and\n... that ... and I have I think the five hundred dollar per month terrified income and then I have on the high end ... at twelve thousand wow I'm terrified income and and\nSo I Am kind of leaning toward that the higher income with no pets yeah that that the lower income just for our security\nYeah I mean I I ... and again if that's if they don't have an eight hundred dollar car payment or something I got to know what else was in the mix the whole story but all things being equal\nYeah that's the direction I Want to see that they've got the room the ability and they're not going to be tackled from behind and then you just talking to them and ask for training have they really learned their

thirty five and you're so you're you're Fifteen sixteen years behind that other couple too so very well thank God you got plenty of time more this is awesome what happened thirty nine months ago they put you on this track\nWell so um before Jennifer now I got married um I was that free except for the house but then I went and did something really stupid uh I had about twenty five thousand saved up and I'm not one at a car so instead of a paying the full amount uh put four thousand down on it and decided I was going to pay it off really quick\nAnd I'm Alice quadrupling up on payments and then I looked up about three months later and I said this is really stupid so I just went ahead and paid off the principal balance and I started listening to your show and ah you inspired me to uh\nStart working on the house so now let ... started doing that and uh I'll let you never know what I was doing in awe inspired her to are are are encouraged her to um how old are they married didn't loans or\nThree years little every three years okay so when you guys got married than it was game on on the street ... didn't loans were crushing\nYes they were bad and how much was Sallie Mae I'm fifty six thousand dollars okay I was one of those that are did not know what they wanted to do so I just kept changing my major and now I'll just put it on student loans and and um\nThe interest but uh not pleasant about seven percent ... every time we would throw money at it\nIt just it didn't seem to go anywhere that you know it can so you had to throw a lot of money at it and kill it yes not have check every month we we sent to it and we just lived on Randy's income\nOkay and so when you guys were dating where you discussing all of this I guess I had a yes yes yeah he had to accept that I had student loans before he may be\nGetting into [laughter]\nWell he had a big car by [laughter]\nWell congratulations you do what do you tell people that key to getting out of that is newly married couple dating couple getting ready to get married there facing a mountain of student loans what do they need to do\nUh well uh since you mentioned our marriage we didn't go all out on the marriage we um had it at his grandmother's house a wedding yeah yeah the wedding and it was that you know it was simple we didn't want anything huge we knew we uh you know ran for the long haul with the actual marriage to the wedding and you know\n... we kept it simple um in our marriage with are buying we kept everything kind of minimalist steak mhm um if it broke we fixed it and said it went and\nBought another one um you know just try not to be McHugh materialistic ... we didn't need to buy a lot of clothes or anything like that\nSo that's a big thing keeping costs down yeah that's what allows you to do this what other points do you have for getting\nOut of that oil are definitely you know we live in the age of of excuses you know everybody has an excuse for something and I got a lot of ... [laughter]\nYeah I'm just a you know don't make any excuses we've heard a million times you know oh well if we major income we could get out of that or if we didn't have kids we could get edited the really anybody can do it I\nMean if we pulled out of all all strike down here\nYou know very cool yeah that's good that's a good point no excuses just get after it you're going to you hey that's your deal so do you deal you know whatever your deal is do it\nThat that's what was dealt with you get excellent good job you guys are eating wild on we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you as well retire inspired number one bestseller and keep keep tuned in to his podcast return inspired and that'll keep you on the track to now becoming millionaires and outrageously generous along the way okay thank you well done YouTube\nSo sixty thousand is your take home so that means you're probably making Seventy five eighty\nGive or take okay when you put your twenty five percent tax bracket right now if you were to cash out the Seventeen thousand out of your savings out of your retirement the government is going to charge you a ten percent penalty wash your twenty five percent tax rate\nShow you're going to get kicked in the ... to the tune of thirty five percent\nSo it's kind of like saying hey Dave I Want to borrow money a thirty five percent interest to pay off my student loan answer would be ... you know\nYou see what I'm saying\nYes they do lay down\nThe good news is you won the argument the bad news is you're both have to read the book again [laughter]\nAll right thanks for the call Rick Carruthers rex in Fort Lauderdale Florida I Rick how're you\nGuys are how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm just calling about a product I have a I bought a while back all the Wii U L\nA very universal life yes\nYes sir Yes sir I'm and I'm not really sure what to do with it I'm not I know I'm not a fan of it but again even when I talk my eyes are on the ins and outs of it I used to walk away confused and not sure what to do with it\nIs that's because of his one of the techniques they used to get people to keep it in the dark for the new world [laughter] oh mushroom process or keep them in the dark for the manure tried to grow mushrooms um [laughter] so\nAh he ... the deal is this just a cash value life insurance policy\nThere are three types her whole life universe bird will universe alive and just verbal life and a universe alive or verbal universal laws and the variable universal sometimes has a mutual fund selection the inside of it there's years\nAgo yeah okay and so what happens is though of course that you you know you're not a fan of it 'cause you're not seeing good return ...\nNo it's about eight percent returns but all the fees built into it I think about it if not more yeah well and\nYou usually if you're in a good mutual fund that's making ten or twelve you'll ... somewhere in the seven range or after fees which if you're just bought the mutual fund you might have made ten or twelve in your case you're making eight and there are fees are getting you down probably in the four ranger actually\nWill be my guess usually the ... are going to eat four to five roughly in those things\nAnd so instead of buying a mutual fund directly you're buying it through their stupid policy and they're kicking you in the teeth to the turn of another four or five percent that's where it comes down to it that's problem number one problem number two is the ... the life insurance portion of it is what's called an A R T an annual adjustable term\nAnd uh the cheapest term insurance you can buy his term insurance for one year based on your age that year and then it address up every year as you get older okay that's the ...\nThe push to term policy by the year\nNot the cheapest way to buy it over ten years or Twenty years okay but you know if you buy just based on your age this year so you're paying in X number of dollars\nSome of it is going to buy the life insurance and some of those going to the investment that we've already ascertain is doing poorly okay no less and less every year is going to the investment more and more is going to the insurance because your insurance cost is increasing every year because they are the have you noticed that as well\n[laughter] I have not okay\nAnd uh because ... and so what we have always suggested that I don't sell any of this I don't give a crap but here's the math on it I have found that a Fifteen to twenty year level term policy locks in and gives you less expensive term insurance\nAnd when you invest the money directly into the mutual fund you don't have the extra fees and you get a better net of fees return\nThat makes sense and plus when you die with the Wii U L they're going to pay the face and keep your investment that's the worst part of it\nSo it's a horrible plan when you die but I it just really bad while you're alive and it gets really worse when you die so what I Would suggest you do is get the proper amount of term insurance in place and then drop this garbage and do your investing somewhere else does that make sense\nIt does I think the reason I haven't done that yet because of the surrender charges\nWell you're you've already bought that I mean you're just add that just got ripped and this also means you probably need a new financial advisor\n'cause I think I think you have a life insurance salesman this calling himself a financial adviser\nAnd certainly possible [laughter] so it sounds like the way it doesn't sound like\nMost of the people in the mutual fund moral don't sell this crap I say that I Am ... and some of them sell term insurance too but most of them don't solve this crap because nobody believes in this garbage except the life insurance people\nNobody anymore nobody there's no one in the financial arena in the financial spaces that says buy whole live life insurance or by the cash value insurance of any kind of there isn't one out there\nThey're they're just because the math is just so horrible and you figured that part out but this guy's doing smoke and mirrors and having to pay under a shell and keeping you confused as to teaching you\n'cause he knows if you've ever understood at that you drop it and him to probably so I'm thinking you need a new advisor and you need to get some term insurance ...
