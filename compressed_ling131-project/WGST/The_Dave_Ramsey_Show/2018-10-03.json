{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "I ride I didn't want to be well you know I was wondering\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get or don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was when I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know when\nI'm when I was I don't know what I Want to\nLose a man's life has shuttered\nThere's nothing that has not mocking about that he just had a back and forth conversation with himself playing the role of the questioners and Christine Blasey Ford in an absolutely sarcastic mocking tone\nWhile waving his arms about and you know getting ... miles from a crowd in what way is that not mockery I mean I think this is just proof that Sarah Sanders\nIs nothing but a mouthpiece she doesn't have a brain of her own shouldn't use her own brand oh she's so brainwashed that she doesn't even recognize mockery when she sees it that was mockery my friends no question about it now you may believe that Brett Kavanaugh was getting the short end of the stick care and that's fine if that's what you choose to believe\nBut to say that that wasn't mockery\nIs just it's it's there's no other way to categorize that he was\nPlaying he was doing a show he was playing the rules of both he literally was using her word I didn't know that he didn't say she says she only had one beer he said I only had one beer one like there was nothing that wasn't mocking\nThere uh All right in any case I'm\nObviously continue to keep you posted on that but I did mention a as we were heading to break that the James Beard foundation has done something I think is really cool um they have made some changes to diversify their awards\nNow if you're not as duty maybe you don't know what the James Beard foundation is all about but they give a awards to chefs and restaurateurs and media they're sort of um you know the premier aboard\nGroup for uh the food this\nOn the whole and what they've decided to do and they've done a bunch of things but sort of the most part where they I think is their decision to make the committees of volunteers\nThat chooses the people who are going to win the awards be as diverse as the population in America so they're not saying that the award winners will match the diversity of America but the people choosing them well and to me that's how you\nA set your organization above because how can you criticize that\nIf a diverse group of people choose a ... a diverse group of award winners great if a diverse group of people choose\nAll men or women or young people old people or whatever but it was chosen by a diverse group then that's fair and that's I think what true diversity should look like 'em and so good for them\nI Love that I don't know exactly when this goes into effect but I Do think it's a really great idea and I think that's the kind of thing that look at it it's a little bit harder to apply that to a company\nBecause you still people are looking at the total number of workers right not just who decides on central having a diverse age our group\nUm it's also about having diverse group\nOf workers but we've soldiers have been mentioned before you kind of almost have to start at the top with the diversity right you can have your board room be full of nothing but why do you have to have women you have to have minorities at the top leading certain branches of your company whatever and then that will find its way down in the hiring process\nYeah for sure um that's true and I think um you could there's probably outside of the box thinking sort of ways that you could help with some of that too\nLike if you're if you're not there and you're CEO and you're the sweet is all male I mean maybe you could bring in a panel of workers who are further down in the organization that helped select their next manager\nOr the manager for another department and the other part of the company or whatever it is right\nUm and I've said this many times one of the arguments you hear a lot about diversity and hiring whether it be gender diversity or racial diversity is that well we we didn't get enough\nUh applicants who are diverse we asked you know we put out a request for we went to our you know are a ... or age are from that we use you know are hiring from recruiting farm and we and we went on line to these different sites and we put out a request for a project manager\nAnd we got you know three quarters of the people applying were male and white and you know one\nQuarter was female or or racially diverse or whatever the case\nMay be and so of that group we picked the best and they just happen to be white man well you can go back to your age are company to your recruiting company and say I want a diverse group of candidates get me a diverse group of candidates that are qualified for this job you can push harder\nOr to have the right candidates and the pile of resume that you're going to review so there's ways\nA around that's for sure\nUm I don't just don't just flown in an excuse\nI guess is what I'm saying there what are you doing over there I feel like there's some trouble happening in the studio right now\nWhile I just I remember when you mentioned that I remembered something that we just pulled from Stephen Colbert about his show specifically you might have I Believe that release please do but and very frustrated with\nThe old show about my um inability to find the diverse candidates\nFor the show and it was late in that show when I came to realize that it was my naivete\nThan a normal process would get you the unusual real um it wasn't until we said no you please don't send us anyone but women who'd say like it's very important and we want it writers color we want women and you would get a hundred and fifty packets and there'd be eight women and till I said\nNo only women and then I got eighty seven women\nAnd I thought ... where were these where would these people before we realized we had to actually make an extraordinary step\nTo get an extraordinary room [noise]\nYeah I mean it's it's a philosophy that I've had for a long time and I love that even call bear a white dude a figure that out because a lot of people don't figure that out they just sort of say well I asked for applicants and this is when I got but no you have to take an extraordinary step or to get there um I think it's so so true\nAnd you know sometimes look we all um are guilty of sort of doing things the way they've always been done and not even realizing that there are other ways to do it\nAnd sometimes that's what it's all ... all about is is stepping back and ah and saying wait a minute maybe there's a better way here maybe there's something else we can do you know maybe we're not all the way where we need to be yet but there's other things we can do to make it better\nI'm speaking of making it better or making it worse or before we wrap up today I Want to bring up Rachel Mitchell and are women on Wednesday segment she is the ah air quotes female prosecutor who was brought in by the Republican Party to a question Christine Blasey Ford last week and I feel like\nShe did a disservice to\nThe process and two women in general um\nBy even a green to do it which isn't entirely fair because I Do feel like if it wasn't hurt would have been someone else and maybe she thought well if it's not me as someone else I can I can do this right I'm qualified and I can do this and so I Can't really fault her for that\nBut by green to the terms that the G O P put force which was working at all costs are questioning to you we're going to do it in these five minute intervals going from left to right left to right left to right oh and when Brett Kavanaugh gets there we don't need you anymore\nSo you can question the accuser but not the accused I'm using questioned the woman but not the man I'm you can use your prosecutorial skills questioning the victim but not the accused I mean none of that made sense\nAnd then she added insult to injury in my opinion by producing a report which she was probably paid to do is part of this ... this agreement or she produced a report\nFor the G O P afterwards and the you know the summation of the report essentially was that no reasonable prosecutor\nCould bring a case against Brett Kavanaugh a in criminal court but this is not criminal court this is a job interview for one of the most important jobs in the country are\nAnd whether or not there is a criminal act here isn't really the question the question is did the act happen or not and if it did and if there's even you know let's just go with this if there's even a reasonable doubt that maybe it happened then he probably shouldn't have that job\nYou probably shouldn't and so for her to bring in and make it seem like a valid argument that it can't be prosecuted in a criminal court thirty six years later did a disservice I think to victims everywhere all end on that note that would be back tomorrow I'll see that my\n[noise]\nFollow gene on Facebook and Twitter Ashley dino beret and being a very useful news here on TALK radio six forty to fifty and

some part of the messages we put on their\nFacebook\nDoes not put everything through the throttle are measures so they can make us by ads from well it doesn't really work that way guys but I Try anyway he says what's the difference between a credit union in a bank\nA bank is owned by stock holders\nThat when the bank makes a profit and they should make a profit we want them to make some profit in the bank makes a profit the stock holders the owners of the company\nYet that profit basically I mean it is the profits dispersed in the form of um dividends or the value of the stock has increased because the bank continue ... whatever it is but basically the owners of a bank are stockholders and that's where the profit goes\nA credit union is operated more like a cooperative\nWhere the owners of a credit union are there it's actually not for profit technically speaking and um the not the owners of the credit union are the credit union members which are also the customers\nAnd so as a customer of the credit union the services and interest rates and whatever you pay in with a credit union they profit that has created\nIs returned to the members in the form of increased services or in the form of actual dispersed much\nI mean sometimes you actually just get a little check from your credit union put into your account and so uh that's the difference uh banks don't like or don't offer banks don't like credit union as they say they have an unfair advantage\nBecause there have nonprofit status I'm more or less really not true\nUm the it's real simple the credit union simply does not make a profit 'cause whatever profit is made just plow back into cheaper checking accounts better interest rates on loans or higher interest rates on savings\nAnd so the you know basically they end up not making a profit so if a bank wanted to uh make less profit could do the same thing\nSo they don't have a disadvantage they're just trying to keep stock holders happy and sell stuff to customers the credit union has customers that are the stock holders of a sense the owners are the members and so it returns and all of that really doesn't matter ... bit\nIf you don't get good service from the organization\nAnd so we endorsed credit unions are not because of their nonprofit status but because they have reasonably priced goods and ... are reasonably priced banking services for you to use and you'll be treated not like a number\nYou retreated ... by you know people that actually care you'll also have that similar experience at a local community by a regional bank and that's who I Do business with personally\nI don't personally have an account right now the credit union I'm not opposed to I just don't my stuff our our business accounts and our our personal accounts were all at local\nOr read our regional and I'm a community banks in our area we do business with several banks\nAnd so and it's very simple it's just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller ... kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talked to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap and they over charge you for most of the services and this day and time their online offerings or their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated they're not that good they're not good at anything\nSo uh it's a little different with family you just have to set a boundary and just go OK guys we're going Dutch tonight I mean everybody's paying their own right\nI'm paying my on your pioneers way you're that very yeah I Know but that's one that free 'cause I'm cheap show you're paying your own and so um you know you just call it out and you just have some fun with it laugh about it'd be sarcastic about at whatever your family gift is right\nAnd I'm In some of them are going to be upset but if they're going to be upset 'cause you don't buy their food than well oh well\nYou know and as far as friends go do the same thing but if this is a continual thing then we just aren't you know\nIt's not a real friend 'cause a friend that you have to bother relationship that's called prostitution and that's not friend okay and so um you know I don't have to buy my friendships my my friends I've got friends that are wealthier than me and friends that are nowhere near as wealthy as me\nI'm doesn't matter I might buy dinner but that's all my choice not on their expectation\nI'm pretty generous about done a lot but I don't I don't think about it but the point my wife is like you really don't need to pay every time but I don't I'm not worried about it is but if I ever since somebody being title I'd get all hillbilly and a second you know I'd be like no you're not entitled\nUm and my wife has a little bit more\nShe has this thing about fairness and so she wants everything to be fair and I'm just trying to explain to her fears what happens at the county fair is not going to happen but but you know you just ... that's okay I mean you talk it through is what I'm saying and you're going to find occasionally somebody that you're not going to be able to continue in relationship with\nAnd um that could even be family if it's extreme but hopefully it's not something like that that's very hurtful for you but um most of the time it's just like no you know we're paying our share you pay your shirt and split it up or this time we're going to give you\nThe gift and we're going to pay for everything but that's on your option is not a gift if it's entitlement so it's a good question though um and that happens more it probably happens more to people with family than it does with French I mean you got a real low class\nGroup of friends of all your friends expect you to pick up the tab all the time discovered that free I mean you're running with some trailer park trash you know I mean really\nYou you you got to think about that I just I that that\nReally it's more of a family thing but for most people um I Will tell you that honestly\nAs weird it is for us um was sharing an eye because we're kind of in the spotlight uh we've had very little boundary issues with family or friends on us we've been really blessed were really fortunate and ah so that's the tip of the hat to both of them that we've had almost no\nTimes that we've had to sit down with a friend and go a new\nAnd almost no time to a family I mean it's um but our families are you know responsible hardworking people I mean that kind of thing and so it's just that we're blessed in that way because I Know people that you know they get their\nRecord deal and all of a sudden some cousin they didn't even know comes out of the woodwork you know and uh I've not had that I Know I've got some cousins that I don't hardly know but none of 'em came out of the woodwork they stayed in the woodwork good for them so I'm not looking for money away I wouldn't mind seeing some of them but I mean I don't know I'm looking for money we don't even though you are\nSo um it's something everybody deals with I think you know you hear people like it the lotto and this\nAnd and then crazy sets in and their family and or I'll tell you where else I run into its where they say and I fell players\nMan they got a big signing bonus and crazy comes out of the woodwork on them I mean they get some dysfunctional crap in their lives it's amazing and are people who feel entitled to a piece of their success and it it it really is really as an illness it's a problem\nStephanie is with us from Birmingham Hi Stephanie what's up in your world\nLarry how are you married\nJust the same darling how can I help\nWe're going to have a quick and back in ... ... ... ... ... thank you very

line of credit on a rental property where we're paying to solve fall into the baby steps or Brennan if it's relatively small you easily could stick it in to baby step to most of the time we let real estate that of all kinds lay it baby steps six\nOr if you have a very large equity line of credit on a rental property you might want to refinance it into a traditional mortgage and get rid of the risk associated with the pop and interest rates are possible called provision for that line of credit\nAnd I don't want to get yourself in a pinch with a bank calling notes or that they're allowed to call based on the way that's written like that a lack of liquidity as we say could put you in a problem you know the cash to pay 'em [noise] so um but so\nYou know you got like a you make a hundred dollars a year you got a hundred thousand our line of credit that's probably refinance you make a hundred thousand dollars a year and he got attend those on line of credit it's probably a baby step to item um the point is\nWe want to work through the debt but we want to get on with retirement an emergency fund in a reasonable paces well and a figure out where we're going from there\nSo good question Matthew is in Daytona Hi Matthew how are you\nI'm good and you better\nThan I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm how do I have for college and not go into debt\nAnd how old are you Eighteen Eighteen very cool what are you gonna study\nUm possibly\nUm [noise] [noise]\nPretty much anything that I can get in through and we're\nA true I can I T yeah she said okay so you like technology yeah All right\nWell um I I think the first go before you go start your education process is you need to have an idea of what you're going to study because that will change the answer to your question that you asked okay so let's say for instance that you wanted to be a Web programmer\nAnd um I've got folk guys on my team that make 'em in excess of a hundred thousand dollars well in excess of that that that ah right ruby on rails code okay not I'm not a bad career and\nThat's an example of an IT type of thing okay and Web programmer writing code now if you're going to do that you would not need and it would not be preferable for you to get a four year degree in information technology that's not necessary to do that\nYou would need to take some classes on how to code and you'd want to learn you know some of the basic IT things and so I Would probably direct you towards a vote tech type school a which is probably a two year degree while you're studying and everything that and I would tell you to work your tail off in the technology field\nUh and if you can uh you know bring\nCoffee for people who are doing code and just watch over their shoulder and learn from them and hang out from them and you're a new hobby is hanging out with people who are world class code riders ... than a you know and you're taking some classes that will get you and they're more than a four year degree will get you and then it's a lot cheaper\nBut it depends on what I mean when you say I see but you could change your mind but I'm ... I'm not going to do I T I Want to go into business well then you might want to do a four year degree with a degree you know the specialization in marketing or finance or something like that and in that case the answer would be different on how to pay for it here's the thing you want to number one\nCarefully select what it is you want to study\nAnd that it makes your eyes light up when you talk about it you kind of smile down inside when you talk about doing this\nThing whatever the thing is okay once you've selected that then you decide how to study it if it's a four year degree if it's a two year vote tech degree\nOr am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a regular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college is a lot less expensive and you can get your basic side of the way for the first two years for\nA four year degree if you want to start the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is\nCollege cost is the number one cause of student loan that\nThey are and what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a used pickup truck both our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nListen\nInsurance world is full of gimmicks particularly the life insurance world and anytime you hear a gimmick it's almost always a good idea to run\nYou know ... ears or what you should have long term disability insurance everyone\nShould have long term disability insurance\nIf unless you are in an industry where each such high risk and you're just it's nutty it cost you ten thousand dollars a month to have it you can't because your you know you're\nA high rise window washer or something like that right you can't get long term disability insurance but other than that everybody ought to have long term disability insurance for most of the time you can get it through your work is not that expensive if you're a long term disability insurance\nDon't buy wave your a premium\nOn your life insurance all that does pay your life insurance premium for you if you become disabled so what is that it's a little tiny baby miniature\nLong term disability insurance policy salt is and it's very expensive one\nIt'd be better off to use that same amount of money to increase the coverage of your existing long term disability or help you buy it if you haven't bought it yet and you heard me today and you need to get longer and disability\nOr you go just like that again gimmicks\nThey're everywhere particularly around the life insurance world and just buy insurance\nOh you know I don't want friends with the Nobel Prize with that I just wanted a hamburger note on friends with\nYour friends with that there's always an upgrade there's always an up say stay away from it Benjamin is one of those in Wichita, Kansas Hi Benjamin how're you\nDoing great how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nHave a question for you my wife and I are currently working on baby step to uh we have one more quote unquote non mortgage debt to pay off what should we paid off by the end of the year\nAnd we'll have um [noise] that is technically is technically a mortgage because we bought a house to use it a rental so that would be true\n[noise] [noise] right so I didn't know of that for rental um if that still considered a debt and should be paid off as part of baby step to six or we should move that\nNot six mortgages are insects okay even if it's not my home even if they're not your heart the rental\nEven if you're home because it's ... it's typically you know and most people listening if they have a rental property is a large that\nAnd we're we're done with a baby step to as we're getting rid of all the ... and or consumer debt sometimes are large but we're trying to get rid of all of that and that really gives you a huge amount of cash flow to do baby step three finish your emergency fund for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and five kids college and six\nOh go ahead and pay the mortgage off or out on the rentals and our personal residents Emily is with us from Cincinnati Hi Emily how are you\nHow about yourself\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um my I mean I we sold our house and purchased a um fly rental flash home we buy a horse farm and we are renting out the horse farm facility but living in the house\nAnd renting out paying our mortgage mortgage ... very large now and I'm kind of panicking about that and I don't like that at all [laughter] but my husband is looking at it as a business and investment [noise]\nUm and I want to pay it off really act that we've heard that we don't want to pay that off very it got the tape that that\nI don't know I Wish I did my husband income payroll going down down is\nSo businesses should be into\n'em I that people have told me that night I don't like that idea\nYou know people are stupid [laughter] people don't listen to super stupid broke right now is the best businesses in the world are dead free ones right now and so what if this whole thing was paid off you know how much should be making oh my goodness gracious [laughter] so how much time on this on this horse farm we\nFour hundred and thirty eight hours\nAnd ...\nAnd right and we're over seven hundred rate like seven fifty and what's your household income I'm a hundred\nNine and then we get five thousand dollars a month the rental the horse farm\nAnd what if they don't pay the rent\nUm yeah you have to eat and how did they come\nYou know you're screwed you're in a mess yeah they don't pay the rent is what happens if ... to be scared you have a lot of risk here who risked one tenant and if that one tenant doesn't pay it messes up your whole world\nThat's right that's called ultra high risk should you pay their solve yes as soon as possible ladder salad one of the this is an accident looking for a place to happen\nI Hope you get out of this and intact but I Would uh I Would do everything I can to reduce the debt as fast as I possibly could as quickly as you can get it paid off and then it's not a big deal if they don't pay the rent because you don't you know you don't fall over dead but financially\nGee I mean you take five thousand bucks a month out of your life you've got nothing left some bad bad situation so yeah you need to be scared you're smart to be scared and all these people will say you ought to keep that in the situation there once known as stupid people a man James is with us in New York Hi James how are you\n[noise] they don't do a better\nThan I deserve what's up\nI have a quick question I'm I'm debt free um I make about a hundred thirty thousand dollar ... uh before taxes I'm Sorry\nI'm my question is that I live in an apartment and I woke up in an apartment and eventually they are home but everyone at telling me that I'm hoping that park open up an apartment I should just stay where I'm at\nAnd saying our home but I Do like a gone through a lot and I want a nicer apartment what would you recommend I've gone through a lot so I Want to waste my money\nHow's that a reward\nSee here's a guy or whatever you spend on rent is lost\nRight yeah\nYou can rent as renters patients while you get the money together to buy something and so I Want to pay a little patience money as I have to pay so that I can buy something as soon as I can buy\nI mean you could go rent something really super nice and super expensive but it would mean you never buy some of your bottom is super nice thing right did you spend all your money on rent\nAnd you know that's a dumb idea obviously so um I I Would be with whoever told you that you stay where you\nAre and a pay as little as possible because it's patience and it's gone down I was down the toilet what are we spending rents gone\nSo I Want I Want to minimize what I spend on that so that I can get into a homeless quickly as possible it's living like no one else so that later I can live and give like no one else\nAnd and you know that's the best way to go about it as far as I'm concerned\nJust follows us on Facebook dot com slash day Ramsey\nShould I make my budget based on my gross or not pay jeeze you'd make it on your net\nBecause

WG honesty and ... three Atlanta or\nBecause you're struggling with some self doubt but I Want to put you on the spot tell me what do you do best what have you always just done well maybe it was the subject became easy to you it's a task that people have said Katie are really good at that I Know there's an answer you do to say it\nOn [laughter] well I I did well in school mhm I like now um and I've always done more with children you know I did count air and things like that and I feel like though their strength but not necessarily complimentary I guess but\nWell but there's a string with math so what about math what were you good with that it's so solving a problem it came this the idea of how you solve a math problem very difficult for me Chris the I mean I'm not kidding I'm terrible at math my brain's not wired in a way to be able to break in algebra problem down but Katie you are good at solving problems correct\nCorrect All right so that is a starting point now what work have you ever dreamed about doing or you just wonder if this would be amazing if I could do this at some point in your life you wondered about something what'd you wonder about\nWhen I was a kid I wondered about no rocket ship and you know getting into space and you know what would it take to get them up and you know the whole idea when I when I was a kid was really fascinating\nOkay so here's what we've got we're not going to solve it on this call but Katie here's what got you got a starting point to go take those homework questions I gave you the people that know you and get the answers and here's what you're going to find\nYou're going to find that there are some patterns and there are some themes that continued to develop so there's already Christie a tie between being good in math and being fascinated by rockets because every NASA person I've ever met a lot of men about four or five every one of them very good math and science\nSo you're beginning to develop some themes here and you're beginning to see some pattern now for you you have a very specific challenge you need to work ideally from home so this is on line work\nThis maybe are not available to you and an online forum but the reality is is that you begin to discover different jobs that you would enjoy because it allows you to do things that you're good at like ... like the science like the problem solving and then you begin to see things like that I enjoy that because I'm good at it but I Know you run into this a lot\nYou know here's the thing Katie I just want to speak to you from mom to mom\nIt's so easy to lose their self and mother had like I hear that voice and you have like I don't know I felt like I've lost myself it's so easy to become consumed with your kids can seem to supporting your spouse it's so easy to do that but actually encouraging exactly like Ken's that you're still in there\nYou're still in there you're you're things that make you come alive does things that you weren't good at are still good at and maybe have just\nLost touch with are still in there and so it's going to take a little bit of self reflection and discovery just like Ken said now I heard you that I wrote in my book Business Week five e questions that help you know your strengths them in a given the really quickly what do you enjoy\nWhere do you excel what do others encourage any what gives you energy and what types of things come effort less to you and your answers to some of those questions will start to lead you in the direction of your strengths exactly like Ken's talking about and you can ask other people or what do you know what what are the patterns of what people say hey you're so good at that are man you oughta\nYou got to do that for a living you know what are the things where you excel in relation to other people just like Ken said what are you good at I Know you're good at things and so\nSometimes we get really overwhelmed with identifying our strengths we get all squirming like oh I just wanna be humble and not good at anything\nBut you know if God made you good at something Katie owner and lean into that and I think as you start to explore that those questions that king gave you talking to people and just remembering and having confidence you are still in there even though you loved as kids like crazy or you're still in there and you can lean into those things that make you light up and I know you will\nAnd I'm proud of you and I'm excited for you 'cause it's at the beginning of that discovery thinking was just talking about\nYou know there's a lot of doubt there because you're hurting her story a lot of people listening under you experienced this with with your tribe\nShe supported her husband she did everything to help him\nAnd what happens is you and then you
