{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "So uh that would be a pretty phenomenal just from a gender and race perspective\nAnd amazing but um you know if you're not if you're not on her side then I guess that really doesn't matter um what's you know of course happening now happens every election season and that is that the negative political ads are\nRunning rampant on the television stations if you watch TV it's pretty hard to miss a I Try to fast forward through as much of that as I can because they'll um but I Do have a question about it\nDo you feel like that influences you if you hear something on the negative ad do you a just believe it be think I Need to check and see if that's really true you know or see none of the above\nDo you just sort of discounted as the other person's you know the trail um [noise] I think what's probably more real than not in all of the negative ads is that there's some kernel of truth\nTo it that is blown up\nBeyond what it really is or what it really means for the sake of the ad\nAnd what's sad to me is that we don't seem to be any closer to ending the world of negative political ads because apparently they work and in fact they get your attention far more than any positive ad ever has\nWhat does it say about us as humans we just love a train wreck you know we just love a catastrophe I mean even\nWatching the storm coverage over the last twenty four hours has been phenomenal I put the TV on several times over the course of the last twenty four hours or as I always do to check the news and every station is hurricane nonstop\nNow I'm ... I'm sure that's not as true if you were watching the local news and you know Wyoming um but certainly on the national news that is pretty\nMuch all they were talking about and if you don't live right there\nI Would argue or somewhere you're near here I mean arguably we're going to get hit by a little bit of that so it's more interesting here and we might be more likely to have family or friends or vacation homes in those areas and maybe it's more relevant here in Georgia\nBut still I mean this is what the national\nCoverage is I mean so much so that even the talk shows last night you know the conversation shows on Fox and CNN were filled with hurricane coverage it's because we love a train wreck and that I mean with the weather train wrecks we get to watch the train coming we get to watch the train before it even heads the other end\nAnd and we just cannot turn away\nUm and I think that is the same kind of mentality that draws us to the negative political ads it's it's it's ... you know it's gossipy it's\nSomething that we can grab on to you and and argue about and talk about it the water cooler worked at they still have watercolors\nThat's now maybe a little bit because I have one here okay that's a little water machine ... but no one calls them not anymore I just looked at my age right [laughter]\nThe break room will just say the break my cat people still have those right yeah OK way people still take breaks okay I\nDon't know that I'm In any case you know I think it's\nUnfortunate and once again I Would love to challenge you all to to tune out first of all um and to do real research on the candidates the best you can uh to go on line to\nListen to the debates or to listen to the interviews um to go to the website of the candidates themselves and to read their platform what they stand for\nGood of a party Web site go to the Democratic party website in the Republican Party website and read the platforms\nI think you'll be surprised I actually have done it I got curious I said what are these guys stand for for ... like not just what we think from watching the news or Fox or CNN or or whatever I Want to know and actually went to uh the Democratic website and the Republican\nA website and I was surprised at some of what's on both platform so I think it's worth checking those things out and trying to\nMake a real informed decision not a team decision not a party decision and not a decision that his swayed a solely by the train wrecks that are negative ads and or you know the gossip of your friends at the at the in the\nBrain cramp I couldn't help it I wanted to go right back to the water cooler um\nOkay on that front it's also we're lucky enough already time to start talking about twenty twenty and who is going to be running and twenty twenty side note I like it it's twenty twenty I mean just that the number is twenty twenty because you know it has so many implications perfect vision right and twenty twenty\nI think about the good point yeah just kind of an interesting number\nBut in any case um you know obviously we know Trump is\nTo run I mean is already running for president in ... ah he really started campaigning for that role and it's not a secret I mean he openly started campaigning for that role right away um\nThe question on the Republican side of course we'll be does he get a does he have any challengers and ah how seriously does the Republican Party take that if at all\nRight now or the Republican Party seems to be pretty you know high on Trump and and uh obviously the midterms are going to impact that one way or the other right we're going to see uh what the what the midterms due to that if the or if they keep the Senate\nIn the house if the Republicans keep the Senate and the house I Would be surprised if you saw any body really seriously coming out uh to uh to give Trump around for his money on the on the right on the left they're going to try their darnedest\nTo get somebody better than Trump said he'd him and Trump has said on many occasions that he is ready he will take on any challenger he will fight Joe Biden out in the back in the playground or whatever it is to it I Want to do I do now um\nHe he feels like he's got this in the bag and he's ready to go that's what he's expressed every time he's been asked so who is going to run a left that is the question right now\nUh nobody is saying I'm In a hundred percent but a lot of people are not saying they're out either and a lot of them are expressing some they're signaling if you will some interests Elizabeth Warren just the other day a\nIt's hard to see anyone get diagnosed with cancer but whether you make this trip is dependent not\nUpon the diagnosis but upon your relationship to this person and does it you know and if you're very very close to this person that's fine if you met them once when you were three and a then they're declared your godfather then you're using this as an excuse to go home you shouldn't have

though I live here in Nashville I'm originally from Kansas so okay for will come on in your ear to do that for ... yes I Am love it I'm not sure we probably it off I paid off sixty thousand or how long it took me about three years okay and your range of income during that time\nI started out at fifty thousand and then I'm In the mid seventies I picked up a second job towards the end up my baby sat to sell ... what do you do for a living I'm an accountant I'm a CPA go watch the second job\nSo I can I just did a part time thing at the YMCA didn't earn a lot but it kept me out of trouble it kept me out of the story and you look for the federal yeah target gets\nMe in trouble [laughter] kind of throw a ball or or what kind of that was the sixty thousand it was all student loans or what's your degree in\nAccounting I got my undergrad and master's degree in accounting\nDegree or which obviously structure received ... ... are excellent excellent excellent so what happened three years ago was that when you go to school [noise]\nYes so I graduated and and you know when you graduate they require that you do exit counseling when your financial aid and as terrible as it sounds I didn't really know what that number it was going to be so I was kind of just doing my exit counseling\nHoping for the best and I saw how much I showed and it was terrifying\nBecause I knew what my starting salary was going to be and I owed more than like one year's salary or and so I saw that and I saw my monthly payment and then I saw all these different payment plans and you know I'm an accounting\nSo I knew the interest was going to add up quickly now and yeah it was just it was very scary but I knew about the baby steps so I just decided that surround I was going to take broker sure we're all about the register for [noise]\nSo I actually listen to the Dave Ramsey\nSo when I was like in junior high and high school age\nAnd your\nMind that will kind of um\nSo my dad is a farmer in Kansas fan in the summertime I Would drive tractor and combine and all you have out in the fields is the radio and I I didn't even have a cell phone back then too and so um you know I Would listen to us in radio and you learn quickly that they play the same songs over and over again\nSo then I learned about am and I could switch to a and listening to talk radio so um you know I listen to us and in the morning and then I switched to the Dave Ramsey show from one to for a nice little three hour break and listening to talk radio and then switch back to that and so it was just a nice nice little break in the day\nI have a strange movie version though combine this I don't know how your tuning in the radio as you're out here ah getting getting some ah we got picture of it I guess what was that we yes\nMy dad's a wheat farmer although we would drive combine and cut the wheat and you know after that we'd have to work the feel young does your robot called bombed by yourself I Would probably say like twelve or Thirteen marry something like that yeah I have two older sisters and they did the same thing so yeah\nYou learn how to work do you have to grow up on a formula or not or yes you are not a drop early [laughter]\nVery cool All right so this was drilled in your head come over counting you get the degree you look up go Oh yes oh maybe step so I got her boards that guy from the radio then what happened\nAnd uh well I just jumped right into it I so I went to Kansas State university I moved to Kansas City so it took me a couple of months to get established but then\nI jumped right in and I started paying off my debt and then I kind of hit a little bit of a bump in the road about a year into the process I was in a motorcycle accident and so I had to hit pause on the baby steps for about six to eight months and I just paid the minimum wage and um and then I picked it back up and was able to pay everything off but\nYou know I'm so thankful that I was working your plan because I mean I probably wouldn't have had an emergency funding place and that was\nSo important that I had that it was so helpful to me and made the terrible situation that I was in a so much more manageable so I'm just so grateful that I followed the plan and had that set aside you know it's very important\nSo many vehicles in the store go too much is actually good for you yeah so how does it feel now that you did this\nIt fills amazing it's it's the best feeling in the world ... I'm twenty eight\nTwenty another one of these rockstar millennials are very well done very cool so um you talk to your dad and your mom you were doing all this stuff\nAnd he got a bug whipped as he did his lawyer was awful\n[laughter] um he ends up paying everything\nWe absolutely ended up on everything whenever the divorce like he was making about a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year and a wide\nAs you know like that now\nWe are what are the answer though and I can and\nWe he lost his job I lost my job um and so he's gotten back into the plant it gotten back to working at like he had to go with a different company and they offered him five dollars an hour ...\nOne of the other company never reopened\nRight and what does he do\nHe works um he trader and the plant here in Atlanta okay\n... work in\nOur part of the other part of the story I Want to get straight in my head it sounded like you didn't know how much that he had until after you were engaged\nWhy I ... I was not aware I was not very smart and I pointed out that I'd never had that it didn't cross my mind was should across is\nThat you should have had this information prior to a making a commitment to marriage\nYeah that's kind of a problem like he was hiding it\nOkay and that\nBothers me more than the debt at this moment um and so what's his attitude about the debt\nUm he really hasn't been paying ... thanks for that and I just don't want to start married now that I Know about the guy I can accept that I guess before we actually set a date to get married I white you know that we are on a plan to get paid off there you go\nAnd that he believes in that plan and is committed fully to that plan if he if he is for whatever reason\nHas has given up hope and it feels like he's stuck you're just going to stay there or he just doesn't care or whatever about the debt if for whatever reason he's just going to Waller when this that's a deal breaker oh and it's not that\nI wouldn't tell you the not marry him over the debt but I Would tell you to not marry him over lying about it or not marry him over uh the fact that he wants to just stay in it because you're not going to be you know you you as a long life will help for you\nOkay if you think about ten years Fifteen Years from now you're still while on the stuff you're not going to be okay with that\nYou know that's what I absolutely don't want to do you know\nAnd so as long you know and if he's not going to be all in like we live on nothing and I'm you know he probably has to go back to court and adjust some stuff\nAnd um and I don't think he owes forty five thousand dollars on the repo I think that's what he owed on the car at the time they reported you only\nCan he owed ... Seventy thousand yeah what was she driving\nSuburban but I think it absolutely outrageous [laughter]\nUh yeah any Roald some negative equity into that to get the ... yeah and so that the forty five thousand is the difference okay they'll settle that for pennies on the dollar is probably sell about for ten grand but the rest of the stuff I don't know I mean the ex wife thing I don't know what you're going to do that how in the world ends up on her and these two attorneys\nUm [laughter] while a you might be able to settle those would lump sum ... I mean you might walk up to her and say here's a check for thirty if you go away\nUm and uh she might take it you know but you'd have to have the thirty thousand dollars is what I'm doing better not thirty dollars and so you know you've got to put some money together here and that means both of you are going to get your incomes up and you both have to have like I desire to get out of money\nOr to get out of debt and to make more money to do that you have to both have this thing and it's still going to take you a few years I mean if you guys just go bananas it's going to take you a few years\nSo um that that's what you're facing and um but the the thing is folks on those will be dating out there it is not a deal breaker as far as I'm concerned it can be for you you decide what you want to do with your life but I don't tell people to not to get married over that\nI Do tell them to not get married over the decision to stay in debt when you don't want to stay in that because that's gonna be when you can't be an agreement on money before you get married when money is the number one cause or divorce we can highly predict that your marriage is not gonna last\nIt's it's ... it's okay if the number one cause of divorce you don't agree on\nYes what you're going to get divorced I mean there's uses are fairly simple equation here\nAnd so you have to be in agreement so I don't the two fifty doesn't scare me scares me but it doesn't terrify me to say this guy's not a keeper I don't know if he's a keeper not I can't tell he sure has a bad taste and lawyers\nAnd all that but does he got his way up but um anyway [laughter] man\nHe ends up paying her lawyer his lawyer owes her Seventy grand and half of his income\n[laughter] a lot of four that's a good gosh [laughter] so uh wow\nYeah somebody so anyway yeah ... ... this was not\nAn equitable album I have no idea what the situation was but wow what a mess\nAnyway so the all of that is behind this now the question is are we committed to cleaning it up if we are then ready to go game oh that's fine thanks for the call open phones or triple eight eight to five five two to five Alex is in Pittsburgh hey Alex our you\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] very good hey we are newly married and looking to create a plan forward good to right away [noise] so [noise] the newly a newly

down in forget it and move on\nAngela is in Lansing, Michigan Hi Angela how are you\nI'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm so I have a question my husband and I just started on the baby fat last month um he works full time I'm a part time employee right now where I'm at my um last year actually started my own body agri business\nAnd I don't have any debt for your business and everything I make or not I am back back and take care so that I can increase production value eventually because I'd like to become fully employed screwed adventure mhm\nUm but actually curious what your thoughts were on taking that money that I earned out of my business and not applying it to our debt but to applying it back to the south\nUm how much are you making and what do you plan on how much you're blowing back in\nUm honestly I really don't make a whole lot I make probably on a bad month between my way in five hundred dollars and I just\nSheer spells are lousy dollars a year on year\nNo no no no I don't I don't buy gear and all that money from I Know\nWhat I'm saying that I'm just saying you're making you know you're making between four and six thousand dollars a year and you're blown back into gear\nPlanning to yes yep okay right and then\nAnd what is your uh ... what her husband make a year and what do you make it your main part time job\nAnd you make sixty a year and I think Fifteen at my part time job\nBecause it was Seventy five dollar household income is just four thousand dollars I'm\nNot the end of the world because it's not a big enough number but if they are making more I Would limited okay give yourself a block because of the problem with the um the photography world it's like the computer world there's never enough\nNo matter what you buy there's another one you know and if\nYou don't write if they're here to where they live here\nIs that you know what I'm Talking about you giggled general exactly we're talking about [laughter] there's never enough and so there's always another one and so\nYou need to just as a good business practice put some kind of a limitation on there they absolutely you know uh you know a four thousand dollars or a year not or five thousand dollars a year I don't care what it is not or five hundred dollars a month for an ... month not to exceed\nYou know and I are are forty percent of my prophet not to uh you know some some kind of a percentage or an end or money amount that at some point you start making money with their business 'cause it's not a business until you make money\nRight and I mean it's brand new it's only been a year last year I took a two thousand dollars\nA lot of ... that actually make money right now have a hobby\n[laughter] that fair\nWell you've never had a profit and it's a hobby do you make a profit is right and I learned a lot to go down the road about why we got to get a little bit better or actually I just have to\nDo something to avoid your addiction to gear and um it's okay to have gear is okay to file money into gear got lots of gear around here and we bought a lot of it\nBut there's no end to the appetite for this stuff in that world and so just put yourself

com flies Ramsey nice question is uh from Jessie now in New Jersey they were having a very hard time trying to get on track with everything including\nStarting our emergency fund what can we do when we are so behind that we can not even catch up\nFor about two months behind on all bills it's causing a lot of stress on our marriage or kids were tired of living this way but we feel like we're in so much debt\nIn so deep that we can't get out\nYeah just saying I gets really really scary when you're in a situation like that and I'm part of what's scary is the sense that you're stuck part of what's scary is you're overwhelmed\nAnd um\nLet's stop and pull one segment out of this thing and talk about that for a second or two months behind on our bills and it's causing so much stress on our marriage and kids\nBeing behind on your bill should not affect your kids\nThey should know about it you don't need to tell your five year old you're behind on the lights\nThat's not their problem much your problem and or you can tell the kids know but you don't have to give them a little big long reason why I Know it was a complete sentence [noise] no\nBut don't pass off the uh you know don't pass off the stress of the kids\nNow let's look at the rest of this what do you do when you're completely overwhelmed and terrified and feel stuck\nI've been there somebody you don't know what I'm Talking about you've been there too right here it is no fun OK here's how you fix\nYou after the began to take control of what you can take control of you have an income\nLet's make sure that that first is being controlled and that's called the budget\nNow you do not have to be able to pay everything to do a budget all a budget is as you're telling the money that you do have where it is going to go and so when you can't pay everything which catching everything up in one month would be paying everything right\nWhen you can't pay everything then you've got to say well the money that we have we're going to do the most we can do with that and for this month that's all we can do\nOkay do you own a home now no okay um first thing I Would do is I Would not buy a home until I was ...\nSo that means you need to write a check today and pay off your car and the credit card and cut up your stupid credit card [laughter] okay okay now your debt free right okay yeah okay and that was foreign to\nGet so six thousand so I'm Down to twenty four thousand right yeah okay and your land is paid off and it's worth sixty\nUh about Fifteen\nAbout fifty and uh we need sixty so you need ten thousand that's where you're getting your twenty percent I see what you're doing okay ah well we're going put fourteen thousand in the emergency fund K [laughter] so now you have an emergency phone you ten thousand with the land\nYou get a construction alone with the takeout loan a permanent takeout and your budget cannot exceed or a three hundred thousand dollar value\nThat does not mean a house that you spend three hundred thousand on the house\nOkay the value of the total package can't be more than three hundred\nDoes that make sense I don't so that means you're building a two hundred and forty thousand dollar house maximum okay\nBecause the packages worth three hundred and that gives you the twenty percent down if you spend three hundred on the house now you're at three sixty\nAnd you don't have twenty percent down anymore okay you see how that works so you're getting on the structure and loan\nThat is tied to your new mortgage that is your final mortgage called your permanent mortgage that's the mortgage that takes out your construction loans and so you're construction lender will require a take out letter where you're for or your permanent mortgages already approved sometimes you can just package all that together\nAnd with increasing interest rates are probably would package it altogether checked Churchill mortgage they can probably help you with that and you go in Milwaukee and your interest rate on your permanent mortgage\nBecause he's a mortgage interest rates are taking up and a good idea to lock 'em in when you can by the way if you have an ... and you got a higher interest rate loans folks this would be the time to call Joe mortgage a it is taking up\nAnd I would lock in rates if you're in the middle of a deal right now walk your rights and\nAnd I probably would lock 'em in like twenty minutes ago like four days ago I Would love to mend period but we are in a rising interest rate environment not under panic about but it is going up\nAnd so you might as well take advantage of the lowest possible ray you can get your hands on for refinance were for buying or in her case for building and um\nThat's by locking in current rage because I don't think you're going to see rates come back down dramatically um you know in in in the foreseeable future in the next say six to twelve months they're probably going to go up\nAnd so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's fairly easy to look at the trends\nUm then then I'm going to walk everything in as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage the bank and get this done Barbara is weather's barbers in Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nHey babe during gray how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo we are a month and a half away from being and gotten a baby that too good and um yeah you're right I don't want to live that momentum that we've had it\nGoing toward dead [laughter] and and going in to a baby step three there's like a few curve ball or they get a better happening so we want to get the baby three ... my husband is also wanting to go back into school can get a bachelor's they get a better paying job\nThat would be our baby step three\nOkay but that's my question is you know we also want to start a family but we need some type of like baby kind 'cause we want to cash flow that\nWhen you have a baby on the way\nYou will build up a baby fund no need to do it for granted\nOkay so bell that emergency fund for\nEmergency financial first for you do anything and then you start doing other life goals I wouldn't worry about saving for a baby you don't really need to save a bunch of money for a baby um if you got insurance without health insurance you know and you\nShould have health insurance and um you know you've got your emergency found in place and you know you'll be able to budget the diapers and believe me your work it out [noise] um but yeah you don't really need an extra baby savings account unless you just want to save up enough to cover whatever normal labor and delivery is out of pocket\nYeah that would be it would be around a I think we pay like Fifteen hundred dollars toward yeah the labor and delivery\nNo matter how was your surgeon that's easy enough to do during that's easy enough to do during the non much\nOkay yeah so you can just do that whenever that happens and whenever babies on the way you can just say well run our saving for that and and and you know anything you want to do that's an upgrade them move on whatever comes after the emergency fund 'cause it's not an emergency him going back to goes on emergency\nThis Fifteen hundred for the baby's not even an emergency or you can cover it it's a luxury to have that as extra savings of baby came on the way writes it baby got here before you had to say you'll be All right\nOkay yeah you got better then they're not curve balls are things that happened after baby step three\nAll right thanks for the call appreciate you joining U.S Open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five cliff is with us in Chapel Hill North Carolina Hi cliff our you\nHave I Can't complain how you'd make now that they're\nBetter than I deserve how can I help well first off I Want to thank you for what you help me and my wife to help pay off the five thousand dollars worth of debt cool\nYes sir Yes sir and up next question to you as a way if I go and fight 'em right now we have about thirty thousand dollar down payment on a house we got to land\nWe um we got land to build a home\nAnd also we're in an area that we really want to live and there are a lot of family around here gray so yes there are ... are you a how much how can we afford with our income ... we the contract that we've been talking the recommended at us alone I Know you're not a fan of\nAbsolutely not no I Would never do your ... you\nKnow it's just it's a subsidized loan and if you ever sell the house or go to refinance the loan at any point you're going to pay back all the subsidy and in some\nYou can get really trapped in these things and uh they're nasty bad no I never would do a USDA long I have to have had more problems with that loan working with people that are in trouble than any other loan I've dealt with\nWow so wow no stay wavelength as\nFar as how much how you can afford we always say I'm you know put your down payment whatever that is into the formula rights and then the loan amount\nOn a Fifteen year fixed rate loan which today's about five percent interest loan amount on a Fifteen year fixed rate loan is no more the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay\nAnd in that put you right where you want to be so like you've done some really good stuff\nOpen yeah I mean you can really do it I mean you you've you've gotten out of debt you build your emergency fund you're doing really smart things so yeah I just get you a ...\nThe least expensive alone between F. I. V. A. unconventional is a conventional war than it might well and that's released fees or at least ... especially when you go with you got a good solid downpayment you're in a good place to do it and that's exactly how I get about your business ... you're doing it and you don't and\nIf you're broke and you have a long term planning window you're starting to think like rich people\nAnd if you think

people have oils\nAnd poor people have fights when they die over nothing 'cause they don't have anything but everybody's still fighting like a bunch of ... you know we're just going to have big red neck fight here mom and dad and we're going to fight over her three things that she had on the window sill you know 'cause there's no will show\n... again you think long term and and so like wealthy people start thinking about stuff like retirement and how I'm going to pay for my kids' college when they get is born not one that can graduate from high school\nThere's a lot like oh God right it's like they were babies born with those are planning now\nYou start thinking long term that's how this works and so our team\nIs going to help you with us 'cause somebody you're listening going okay I

money in after tax account and savings account um access at my work and the account paid us off or just Chuck Chuck's on it either [noise]\nAt a time I have I have the money I guess I'm just having trouble just coming up with ... with\nThe whole you know kind of your money just you know you know like what I can make sure what's your house actually we're\nProbably about six hundred thousand\nOr based on your concern about time out of your money why do you not oh six hundred thousand on it\n[noise] chunk Dexter on it I I'm\nNot sure that that's um contrary to your comment of your money problem\nYou're\nSort of consistent okay so here's what's going on\nRight you you have um some good information but it's incomplete 'em and show that in that cause you to be left with a a a primitive analysis and let me walk you through that are in\n'cause I used to think exactly the same way so I don't know where your brain is [laughter] okay so it gives you obviously have a good intellect\nOn especially with the natural things so your your concern is if I can borrow money at three four or five percent and I can reinvest in a good mutual fund at ten ten eleven twelve percent and my not making that spread why would I ever\nYou know miss out on that spread and um you know I've got the money invested now it's making me ten twelve whatever it's making me not today but it's making me that overall and uh why would I you know lose that spread and uh I had to really wrestle that down because that's how I was trained in the financial world obviously with a finance degree\nAnd then I had to start looking at than when I started looking at stuff through the lens of the borrower is slave to the lender\nAnd there's no good mentions of that and the scripture and I'm going okay either God's stupid or and I've got something figured out he doesn't know about or there's something I don't understand and so um when I figured out was what was the that formula that we just years\nTen percent over\nFour percent a six percent spread leaves out risk\nAnd in a sophisticated uh investment analysis you adjust for risk\nMeaning I Would never compare a\nGrowth in income mutual fund apples to apples with an aggressive growth stock mutual fund the rest of stock mutual fund might have an average annual return of twenty twenty percent the other one might have an average and overturn of twelve percent but the risk ratio is completely different risk profile in those two phones is completely different agreed\nAgreed okay so what you would do is you would adjust and in in that world you can actually use something called a beta with an inverse formula on we'll get and all that crap but basically you can say because one is more risky than the other we mathematically adjust for risk to be able to compare them apples to apples\nAnd that's the proper way to do an analysis between those two fun but no one applies that concept that that level of sophistication to this debt analysis\nThat says Tom by your money and I could use this money to make more than I'm making now so ah but what I have found is is when I Do pay off my house I don't know which risk neutralizes a lot of that was the difference between the foreign the ten percent\nIt takes away most of that spread when you're when you're you know when you factor interest 'cause we're there is risk when your mortgage now it's not a lot of risk because you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off by foreign investment to play it off but there is risk\nAnd so uh you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of foreclosures are girl home with a mortgage there is rich and so I'm getting rid of that when I found this it's not completely quantifiable um", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show",
