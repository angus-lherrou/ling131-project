{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Apparently that is why the mayor pulled that she did not want it to be voted down because people did not have enough time to review the materials we don't know yet when that will be rescheduled there will be a city council meeting on Wednesday but that issue will not come up\nOr just to keep you posted on that if you're wondering what the heck the Gulch is one thing I hate about the news in general\nThere is this like sense that\nEverybody knows everything already and you're just giving them an update and I\nHave the time I turn on the News I'm like wait now what is that now of course we all have the beauty of Google Now which wasn't the case uh whenever ten or Fifteen or Twenty years ago before when did Google start before the age of Google whenever that was Twenty years nineties\nOr fly ball I don't ask genes was popular when I was in middle school high school in the mid ... so so even\nWith ten year old boy someone will have to do all when Google started um but in any case um if you don't feel like taking the time so you Google the gold I'll tell you what the deal so the goal is an area of downtown that is\nJust been the ...\nThe area in consideration for lots of different things over the years it is an area that is not develops really at All right now it's a it's essentially parking lots and it's kind of in between the stadium\nUm and little five points and it's kind of in that area and it just sort of his undeveloped space in the middle of downtown and it's big\nAnd it's been you know a possible a location for a multi mode all transit location you know like a like a Union Station kind of place where trains and buses will come and easily easy access to the airport from there you know that kind of thing\n[noise] uh that didn't happen and\nNow it is this proposal is going forward with well it's not going forward but it's being voted on about this development deal by an organization a development group called the I Am\nAnd most of the pro business folks in the greater metro area are for this they want it um the mayor wants it the ah central any progress organization wants it the problem is that some of the surrounding neighborhoods and some of just the general neighborhoods with in city of Atlanta\nAre concerned that the that we're giving away too much to get the deal and then ultimately it's not it's going to mean that less services less affordable housing et cetera et cetera for uh some of the underserved populations in the city so those are some of the concerns at the very high level picture\nUm there is no displacement with this particular deal in case you're wondering about that because there is no residents there now so it's not like some of the other neighborhoods where a gentrification happened and people have been forced out this is not one of those situations there's no one being forced out\nUm but there are issues and to their their you know are some uh ... you know parts of the proposal that are\nBeing renegotiated and rewritten to try to address some of the community's concerns so that's where it stands um this is one of those situations where I Am pro business and pro you know progress and ah I see a need\nFor more things like what's being proposed in downtown one of the things that\nMakes it land a very different as a city from a lot of the big successful cities in this country is that the downtown is mostly work\nIt's not work live and um and and now it's sort of you know work hotels and big stadiums and like maybe so maybe a little bit of play but not really live and again there are that's not\nA hundred percent there are some condo buildings there are some homes that are within the city limits and all of that I'm In the downtown area but I think this could go a long way to making downtown more vibrant so I'd like to see them get it right\nUh but I Would like to see it happen and the tax credit or an incentive debate is a whole other debate and certainly one that needs to be had around a lot of different projects\nBut it's interesting again you know where we don't blink an eye on giving an incentive let's say to get the super bowl here\nUm but we do that Lincoln I about something like this so you know it's an expensive deal for sure and it's going to cost is going to be a sin taxes have to go to help pay for this however\nUm I think it could really be um from what I understand I think it could really be positive for the city so I'm hoping that it goes through and we will keep you posted on when it will come before the city council by the way I don't live within the city so I Can't vote for that city council or mayor I'm breaking resident\nAh All right speaking of other areas around Atlanta let's talk about Clinton County it looks like there are some new the new details coming up coming out about a potential actual train light rail going into Clinton County\nI now don't look so shocked over their new dynamic but uh I have been a proponent of a transit and of Marta\nPretty much forever and that's one thing no matter how long you've listen to the show I mean certainly the show has changed over time but I have always been pro public transit because I think that's another thing\nThat's sort of separates us from being a fully world class city because we just don't have enough transit and for me that's not just buses has got to be light rail or or heavy route but it's got to be rail of some kind so um yeah hey\nFor Marta in Clinton County and I think I'm going to take credit for it\nOn your book from the one\nYou're welcome Clayton County I'm In for ya I got you know\nThey're saying now they're saying ah that it's not done yet but Marta is now close to approving a passenger rail line that will go through Clinton County uh it would be a twenty two mile line that will connect martyrs East Point station to Jonesboro and love joy which is a along the existing Norfolk Southern railroad right of way so there's already right away\nThere which makes it a much more um you know compatible with Marta coming in and some of the earth let's say that our\nIn the northern part of our east and west of the city so any case I think it's great uh I Want to so encouraged the clinicians devote for Marta when that opportunity happens because I Want to take credit for that also just putting it out there [noise] uh okay\nLaughing at least so while we're talking about local we've got to talk about the local elections and uh I Do want to mention that early voting is open but check your early voting location it may not be the same one you early voted at\nThe last time you had the opportunity now ice in fairness a that is the case for me I tried to early vote on friday I went\nAnd got in a car I had glance at the last I saw the name of the place that I voted last time which was a recreation center in DeKalb County and I got in the car and I drove over there and I got there and there ... there was no voting finds there was nothing happening was not there and so I misunderstood\nSo I'm just saying double check your locations because it turns out that while that location is going to be a valid early voting location it was it does not open until October twenty ninth\nAnd his only open for a couple of days after that before the actual election so I'm assuming it's because it's the school year and I think maybe the last time I early voted was a special election like uh in the summer or something I don't know\nBut I'm Wondering if that's part of the whole voter suppression anything like don't make the early voting locations as readily available\nI don't know that said a lot of people are early voting in our state and by the way I Am still gonna early vote most likely I just don't know if I'm going to wait and do it on October twenty ninth or if I'm going to drive a little further and do it ahead of time\nBut uh Georgia voters are rushing to cast their ballots uh this uh looking good in terms of the number of people ah they don't want to get out there and do this they uh we've tripled our voting\nSome places have three hour lines but Jordan's\nSteadfast they waited now as of uh this article that I have a about this which is from Saturday So by Saturday we already had a four hundred eighty two thousand four hundred and thirty five people who had voted in advance\nIncluding Ninety two thousand on friday alone so there you go I'm take credit for that too I'm a sucker for\nSomebody along the line\n'cause I reminded you and I'm going to keep on reminding you until the election is over you got to vote it's so so important\nUh I don't really care which side you're on just go do it there are a lot of uh you know races besides just the given a tour all race you may be in a district where there's a congressional race there may be state seats that are up for grabs a you know there's governor lieutenant governor secretary of state they're all there\nAnd you can have a saying how our state is right and ultimately our country is run if you're putting in a vote for Congress\nOr and even the state legislators they figure out how to district our state and that impacts the federal election so super super important but you get out there and vote a and so far it looks like that's happening is so I'm good Anya and keep it going you could go today you could go right now you can take a quick coffee break\nRun over to the well maybe a better plan if there's a three hour line check ahead see if you can figure out what's going on before you run over there or go on your way home they're open till seven o'clock the ones that are open\nA check before you go and uh I'm gonna keep bugging yet and\nA while yeah we'll see [laughter]\n[noise]\nOf spending money they don't have\nA ... that's a bad thing I think that's called wisdom you are the same publication making fun of millennials and now you're saying they're wary

and\nCripple the student loans as a generation and they've learned their lesson they're not doing it anymore but we can have that at CNN Money that's or steak good luck getting her first home if you

time to get this thing here and learn how to handle money the right way\nOkay cool so how did you do that what was the process you went through\n[noise] well I I personally didn't really know how to handle money very well and then uh when they had some friends that had done\nAn angel peace university and she came home one night asked if if I had heard of day Ramsey and I'm a big baseball fan and

that you're when you're old church do the things and I found out you our debt free what do you tell people the keys to getting out of that are\nHave I Would say communication and listen to your spouse and stick to the ...\n... so uh how did you do sticking to the budget over six and a half years I I Know you fell off the wagon sometimes but a lot of what percentage of the time eighty percent Ninety percent that you're stuck with a Seventy percent what was it\nI Would say close to Ninety percent we we had a few setbacks and Dave I Will say that the baby emergency fund the starter ... thousand dollars really really came into play and was so handy to have to have that at least that one is was truly a lifesaver and referral levels of\nVery cool good uh what was the hardest part of this for you guys\nFor me it was eight now ah I Love to go to restaurants and or or eat out and that was you know when the money ran out for that particular for that particular line item in the budget that was that was that was hard for me now\nWhat about you and I was shopping is whenever I Want to kale uh-huh\nNot being able to get right to shop you had a stroke certain things and certain times in shock

you that you have more cheerleaders or detractors as your went along a we had a little bit\nI'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up I'm\nSo I'm calling because I have just started to look into the ... the program and I've created my budget and I'm trying to get my fiance on board with it out of he's somewhat on board but he's not all the way [laughter]\nBut my my question is is how do we work on baby step to pay off all of our debt while also trying to cash flow a wedding\nOkay who show how much that do you have personally\n[noise] um well our\nFinance I gather no they're not together you're not married okay Jeff me I have about eleven thousand in credit card debt okay and that's it I Know how I have a five thousand dollar car ... and I have about forty four thousand seven hundred and student loan okay cool and what does he have\nHe has only a car a ... eleven thousand four hundred\nOkay and what is his income his income is about thirty eight thousand and what is your income about thirty three thousand [laughter] you know and when are you wanting to get married ones the wedding in September twenty ninth next year country got twelve much good\nOkay so you are not going to be a hundred percent that free and pay cash for a wedding between the two of you with that income [noise] those deaths\nMass murder you would like to do our best\nExactly oh I didn't want you to do poorly on the just just observing that mathematically we're not going to knock all of that out so given that that's the situation and we need to have a modest wedding would you agree with that\nYes okay so ... we do have help from his parents parents oh good how much are they chipping in um well his parents are paying for that catering and the reception that in which the huge ... of it yeah and then um the venue is free we're getting married at that capital ground level very good\nAnd then um we my parents paid for the draft and then they are paying off though for um the limited free alcohol that will be there\nOkay phenomenal good and so uh what do you guys need to put in to add to this\nI'm I'm hoping to stay around eight thousand for what for decoration I'm renting things like for the linens and stuff like that and for our if they think that too much\nYeah I've done to really really nice weddings with two daughters are like really nice things and um I mean you've got the big dog in the wedding is the reception usually the typical wedding mhm it's at least fifty percent of your budget usually the dress and the you know the the camera and the venue is usually aren't hiring the preachers not usually that much\nShow our friend is actually doing it\nRight so so we've got you know we generally speaking really you've got the big things covered here [noise] um yeah you're probably a little rich just for lemmings linens a lot of people have really nice wedding the whole wedding for ten grand okay and the national average is less than thirty\nOkay for and that includes ... Princess Diana type weddings okay I mean you know yeah [laughter] right so um\nMy mom always says I have um champagne taste with a beer budget\nYeah well I I kinda let me too that that's how I went broke so [laughter] if I'm you know it's not a big deal but I'm going to back that down in the spirit of we want to get out of bed and so I I'm going to just make up a number you guys can adjust it your adults you and your ... you and your fiance talk about it okay we're\nBoth handy I liked him a\nThing now so I'm going to say I must say let them cover the stuff they're covering and you put in five K. dot camera up OK okay you you could change it you could get for you could make it eight you can change it later okay but whatever we do I'm going to put that in the bank first\nOkay before you start your total money make over okay it's going to go ahead and bank five grand between the two of you and I want you to do that and you\nSay to save up for the wedding and then\nThat hey you know and I want you to do that in like too much okay perfect and then two months on when it passed by Christmas yeah we can do that okay\nAnd then we're going to start the debt snowball ... each individually\nDo not run your money together until you're married\nI Know you said your it's a bad idea it's bad for your budding uh engaged relationship it's really bad legally\nBecause if something God Forbid happens and I believe me I've been coaching folks for Thirty years and I see things happen that aren't nice okay [laughter] and it's stuff like a car wreck or something weird okay and you just all kinds of stuff happens and if he has paid off a bunch of your bed and you're not married it's it's it's a problem\nAnd that's really what's setting up here so um the the other way you could do this since you've got a lot more than ... you could just attack your debt snowball and he could build up to five grand\nOkay I just don't want to make him pay for that all\nWell in a sense he's not because of the day we get married it's all combined mhm and so he's not paying for it we're paying for it okay if as long as it combines on September twenty ninth\nThere's no you paid for it I paid for it okay this is our money at that point right yeah there's here's the thing if if he\nUm pays off the eleven thousand dollars he should be debt free\nHand you guys ought to have the wedding and then we got you to deal with it when you get to come home from the honeymoon and okay the actual gonna have Sallie Mae moving in your spare bedroom right well we already do yeah I Know what I mean she's still going to be there when you get out in the honeymoon they got to get rid of VIX you'll notice the next year or two but we're hoping yeah the thing is just\nLay out a plan that both of you agree to okay but please don't I don't want him paying your dad's\nOkay it gets weird\nOkay I I absolutely I didn't see it like that\nYeah it's just possible downside is all there and the upside is very little if you get to the point that he has extra money the weddings covered and he's debt free and he wants to pay on me that's just ... big pile of cash in on September the thirtieth write checks Georgia that\nOkay but then if something God Forbid happen that everything's still separated between now and then okay and I'm\nSo cool cool congratulations and we'll send you a wedding gift is called the book the total money make over hold on Kelly is going to pick up and we'll send that out to you very cool stuff\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five to to sign a Jill is on Facebook day when you started your company did you borrow money for a start up expenses no Joe I don't borrow money\nTo sound familiar\nI don't borrow money [noise] uh no I did I started on a card table my living room and I did some counseling sessions and I got paid a little bit for dance we're speaking in that paid for the printing and we launched a thing called life after death\nWas an overhead projector in a bad suit\nAnd it was a clash that became a\nFinancial peace university\nEvery time a medal of money we bought a little bit more stuff and grew the company a little bit we grew at one hundred percent organically which all that means is is the money we made we put back into the company after we ate a little bit of food\nA little bit of light bills and um which quarterback and become a quarterback and the company quarterback and the company um but we never borrow money which means that some things we wanted to do we weren't able to do and you know what to do to protect us from grocery stupid stuff cause some stuff we wanted to do that with the money do stupid stuff\nAnd if you do something stupid and you\nPay cash for it it doesn't hurt near as much as your feet or something stupid and get by pretty much all stupid and business you're going to do some stupid stuff in business Ninety percent of your other shot from your survive and make all your money on ten percent of your ideas and you don't know which ones they are ... ... oh my [noise]\nYet by a car you can't afford it's the same thing is ... better than a share of her life probably ... you know all of them are probably better\nIs it more expensive yeah three four times more you know the same thing so can you get a Chevrolet education and be fine out here yeah most of us function on that\nWe didn't go to ... uh schools that were a hundred grand a year\nYour kids aren't going to either unless you're going to run them deeply in debt which I wouldn't recommend so we decided to call you know your local\nIn state tuition schools that you think your kids might go to and you find out how much it is\n[noise] and we have we've gotten a pretty good start on that we have a great program here in Iowa and back our high school kids are able to take college courses for free and a lot of them are a lot of the kids graduate with not only to high school diploma but also their two year degree at our local community college here we are\nHighly by being able to do that and out of out of the fact that they're already doing that and kicking college classes yeah and I\nAm from Anchorage you said community college is free\n[laughter] well if you were taking classes while you're in\nHigh school in America yeah yeah well the other thing you can do is if you don't do that and you graduate from high school you still can go to community college about a third the cost of the typical in state called four year college\nAnd not here for two years if you don't have your first two years or stuff studies out of the way because most of that's just core stuff anyway and you just make sure that that community college will transfer full credit into you know I'm I don't know University of our or wherever it is we're going to go right\nAnd um our our state or whatever it is you just look at that and you lay it out and you say this is where we are going to go this is what it's going to cost\nAnd then you back into your budgets on it and go okay Seventeen year old we're going to be casual and she'll college choice is your biggest variable in a kid going to college debt free variable number two is they make their part time job filling out for scholarships\nYeah jump on Romney dodged only filling out scholarship money and um you know we're we're meeting parents and kids who were\nYou know that they're they're getting two hundred and fifty twelve hundred and fifty twenty two hundred and fifty dollar scholarships and add them all up in a pile and they turned out to be thirty grand and they pay for school not a bad part time job when you're Seventeen\nAnd you work your butt off filling out like a Brazilian of those things not ten but hundreds\nOf scholarship

is thirty you might sound like fifty one thirty one fifty very good morning I'll do for a living\nSo I'm inland acquisition for a residential home builder uh-huh and product\nMarketing very good good for you so what kind of that was the dreaded thirty thousand dollars a\nPretty equally divided between student loans and about the cars okay I really wanted to mention that in that Thirteen months and we had to hit pause and I got ... votes Fife and three minutes into it on fourth of July or\nI or I unfortunately was celebrating a little too much and uh\nApparently I had appendicitis and I thought it was more than something different so I thought it was bad food infanticide is and I had to get my appendix removed so that put us on a screeching halt yeah wow yeah so that was an emergency surgery that we had to cash so um and we did but everything on pay that off ... started up again or\nGot it filling out our our thermometer and six months later lucky me a kidney stones so yeah so I hit the double whammy yeah the only thing that didn't go as the gall bladder\nI'm Lindsay this word on greater Brendan what I Know [laughter] I Know that a lot though not urgency appendectomy you almost warrant area oh my goodness\nAnd it happened the kidney stone is two months and the new year so we had to start over ... hot or sell the but it was because we weren't and stressed out because he knew how much we can pay off your mind so long have you\nBeen married about five years on ah the December the first\nSo what happened that put you on this journey Thirteen months ago\nWe had our little guy he's too right now that I had just gone back to work some attorney leave and we always plan of big annual trips and so\nHaving him without oh we'll go do at Disney cruise or something and\nUh we're planning that trip and then I kind of stressed out because we only had maybe three thousand savings and then just didn't sound right\nAnd we knew that you are his parents actually given us I think are on DVD ... when we got engaged okay but it just didn't click back then and then watch them no no well as early as we know we watch them that we stopped at a ... and just didn't stick to it on a\nCell and I knew that you went on line found that you had an ad and I had about an hour and a half hour commute each way to work\nNow I listen to your podcast and I yeah I heard you tell a capital that was on base that too that they're ... they can't go on any vacations and that's when it's ... like we can't do any of that stuff we need to\nReally buckle down ... so that's when I came home to him and tell them no vacations we're going to get started\nTo which he was really excited they are all\nExcited I was thinking dang a payout of pay off dead or go golfing and Florida Keys or something I'm like\nOoh [laughter] our choice I guess is that [laughter] but the good news is you're out of debt now and I'm like no one else later you can ... it was like no one is now what are you still people the key to getting out of that as you're paid off thirty thousand and Thirteen months\nFor me that budget sticking to the ... that we never and stuck to it to them that always change we knew we had extra cash will be do then spontaneous spending\nAs a planning for each month happened and loves the every dollar Applebee's it all the time who and so yeah I just sticking to that budget and planning ahead and just delaying sunnier and things that you'd want and just waiting on them\nYeah and for for me I Would say it's just you know everybody's different in the way that they approach\nA this debt free journey Lindsey over here she's mixed failed guru in geek in loves to see a split out ... put a thermometer up there and let me hold her in the whole thing and get me to the top oh man I go more goals driven in that we do about it I'm going to\nFall right but on the refrigerator right when we heard on the refrigerator so that everybody can see that we're in that it's kinda like you know when you're an alcoholic you go to Alcoholics Anonymous now this was it was like hey where the ... were in debt I Am not I was our way of\nBeing honest and I ended up front and and letting people see kind of be a part of our journey if they enter a home\nSo that people look at you look curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nYou know it was a little bit of both I mean our family is very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders off and realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and taking on that and I'm like\nRight um well there's different kinds of most of them are you pay a hundred percent of everything until you get to your the duck the ball and then they pay a hundred percent [noise]\nSome of them do have a co pay you after you meet your ducked double either way you do have a higher to duck the bowl with a nature essay and they lower premium as a result\nBut you'll have to just find out what they're offering do they have a hundred percent pay after the ... um and if they do and you're healthy or you're sick either one it comes out better kind of in the middle it doesn't necessarily come out better\nBut if you're close to the doctor will every year and then they pick up a hundred percent that's a great deal if you got like a chronic illness and or if you're hardly ever sick Ramsey is knock on wood we hardly ever\nEnd up with the dock then in that case\nObviously we save a lot of money because I'm only pay what comes out of our pocket and we never go to the doctor ball so we just end up with a cheaper premium is what ends up with us and the ability to put money into the health savings account which creates a tax deductible account and you can use that money of course to meet your ducked double or\nAny other health issues that you want to cover as you go along so good question did talk to you Annette thank you for calling in Dennis is with us Dennis is in Rochester, Minnesota Hi Dennis how are you\nWilling or seltzer\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well my wife and I started a program back in June and I'm Wondering where are we drill wherever they used to\nUm [noise] we have some whole life life insurance policies um each of our parents took out like I'm sure it's at us when we were younger we still have those policies Miller we got married we each took out a policy for the mole life\nUm the cash value on their policies is about ... housing dollars mhm and we were wondering if we should cash out the policies that are getting her policy and use that money to put into our that's noble\nAbsolutely yeah\nThey're horrible product they're just um you know the whole life has to payday lender in the middle class I mean it just as a ... a ridiculously low rate of return on your money and the worst part is when you die they only pay the face value of the policy they don't pay the\nThe cash value also which means the extra money you pay to build up savings in their disappears a death\nThey keep your money you know and so it's just a bad bad product the math on it is horrendous and you're you're much better off to buy inexpensive term insurance and who you're investing anywhere except on in a life insurance product\nAnd so that's what I that's what I have done for you know Thirty years\nWould there be a tax implications on the money are we pulled out\nVery doubtful and the reason is is that your basis in a cash value policy for tax purposes\nThe the in other words what you paid into it it is everything you paid into it throughout the entire time the policy has been open so if you add up all the premiums that you've ever paid you don't even get that much out and so you really end up with a law she can't ride the law but you end up with having put more into it\nThen you get out so there is no game now yes um and it happens about five percent of the time with an old with a very very old whole life policy\nThey there it is possible that the cash value is greater than was paid in which you would only pay taxes on the difference and so you know you use the figure eleven thousand so if you if you found out that the all the premiums added up to only ten thousand than you'd pay taxes on the one thousand dollar difference will be still do it\nRight where Ninety five percent of the time Ninety eight percent of the time they lose money 'cause they suck\nYou don't make money you know and so you end up losing money on the transaction and of course that's not a taxable event when you lose money no question about that Catherine is with us in Danbury, Connecticut Hi Katherine how are you\nHi Dave I'm doing good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nUh my my husband and I just got married in August and we're combining our finances and everything else [noise]\nUm and we're working on paying off all I've aren't that we get paid off his car like three days ago Hervey yeah ... yeah mine should be paid off by the end of this year which is great\nUm and the next thing we're going to tackle and so on I mean for property that eye on 'em and then after that was good until the\nMortgage that we live and so we're planning on saving up for the three to six months of emergency fund but we're not sure how much we can save\nOr two income family obviously we have no kids on but if both of my tenants leads and my rental properties that are required like a really different amount that if I have ten and so we're trying to figure out how much it's fair makes sense\nWell given that you have two properties that can have stuff break down on them um you could set up in your rental accounts some savings just to cover the rental issues a vacancy or repair I assume you keep a separate account for your rentals do you know\nI can match I Wish I did\nI Would I Would open up a separate checking account just for the rentals and put pay all the bills associate with a rentals out of that account only and then um and of course by the payments out of there with a ... in there and then you can tell if you're making money on the rentals 'cause what's left in the account as your profit right\nRight that's a taxable a that's a portion is going to be taxable each year because everything else is going to be deducted well all the expenses associated with it and you can keep some money in that account to cover vacancies a or to cover\nBears and I might keep that it that way of separate from my emergency fund and then 'cause that's like a business over on the side it's like a small business ... okay and then ... but then at home I Would have three to six months or expenses there not counting the rentals\nUm because I got the rentals covered in the rental account and you're okay over there um and you know if you've got two incomes and you're pretty stable it sounds like you're doing really well and you're paying attention you might be okay with the three months out of the three to six months of household expenses as your\nHas your game plan and and so forth some good question thanks for joining Joe's in Austin, Texas Hi Joe I'm short on time go straight to your question\nI have um I had a ... year one year old\nAnd I was wanting to get your advice on how to um have hurt future so we have a twenty nine plan that up and it's been getting money I'm from birthdays and um you know other holiday\nAnd I was going to know how what we should do with that money and how can we teach him financially ability to get the older\nCool well good for you what a great that question yeah you just um I Would have the money inside the five twenty nine invested in good growth stocks mutual fund sort of course a five twenty nine is used for college\nAnd so we're going to teach him that his college money is there and was showing that money as he gets older and he didn't need to understand that at four years old don't don't worry about that but then there's four things should teach a kid about money for things we all need to learn about\nMoney number one is work number 'cause that's where money comes from summer to was giving number three is saving in the workforce why spend and you take them to work age appropriate when they're three we don't send 'em the salt mines okay we're gonna teach them to work to give to say and to ...\nYou know what does she ...\nShe's forty four thousand\nOkay I Would just slow down and so and it might it's slowing down my main you do some things differently and the process to because it might linked in this calendar where it starts to not be fun to be living there\nSo are you know if it's sharing and doing this we've got three kids and a ... in you know they're all grown now thank you Jesus but um but they they uh if it was me in your situation and I've been in your situation or pretty close anyway um I Would write a check today and be debt free\nAnd then I began to build my emergency fund\nAnd when I have my emergency fund a three to six months or expenses than I Will begin to build my down payment if it starts looking like that we need to rent for a year or somewhere to have our sanity and not be living with the inlaws forever and ever on men um and take a break from that and get your own place and rent for a year while you save up your down payment there's no sense in that\nAnd so I honestly\nWe probably would do that but we are people we share and I figured out were very generous and a lot of ways but we're not generous for people living with us or Islam when people we just don't do that well we got friends or just moving the missionary wear them they just moving so and so one of them and all that we can't do it we just were not wired that way\nAnd we're we're generous otherwise but we don't have that ability so honestly when I just just just us I'm not saying you I'm not saying you're bad for doing it I'm just saying we couldn't do what you're doing for very long it'd be for a very short window out of sheer and reaching desperation and then we would go get some kind of little rental and\nHave our own little life until we could save up a down payment but you know maybe you can do that maybe you can hang out there that long but if your debt free today and you land a job tomorrow what do you think you're going to be making\n[laughter] well I'm I'm hoping in somewhere in the fifty to sixty arrange\nOkay so that puts you at like at a hundred out young household income you don't have any rent\nIf you're living with them and you don't have any debt 'cause I just paid it off and then you need to save up you know Fifteen thousand bucks or so for an emergency fine and start saving for your down payment and then just run that map out how quick can you do that and then ask yourself do we want to rent a year\nAnd slowed down are buying maybe by one year which is not the end of the world it's not you know it's not like we're renting the rest of our life but just in order to have the dignity of having your own space for your kids and and bring the conflict that I mean very few people can live within\nLaws an extended period of time and it not create in not create relationship string\nAnd it it hasn't been bad living with I mean when we get along its just after a while you kind of want to sort of be able to be on your own and you know walk around the house and had to be quiet and you know I haven't people given their life's all the time\nNecessarily [laughter] a man and I and I will say whoever's parents you're living within ... years or hers it's\nNot it's always harder for the the other the other one and so if you're living with her folks it's harder for you because she's used to hanging out with them and listening to their advice and all that pressure like you\nKnow I mean we make a hundred thousand dollars a year I think I'll do what I wanted to thank you very much at all and uh yeah but so I'm probably going to land on a rental for a little while and your situation but again I'm not saying you have to do that but if you're asking me what to do with an an chili\nFor sure I'm writing a check today and I'm debt free for sure I'm starting to build an emergency fund and quickly as I Do that I'm for sure are going to start saving a down payment\nAnd um and even if you bought and didn't save the ... because you didn't have a full twenty percent that's okay with me to\nAs long as you're on a Fifteen year fixed and the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay and your debt free with your emergency fun when you move in after you make your down payment and you're going to the house will be a blessing that but if you do it the other way because you get all twisted up in a hurry\nYou're going to regret it
