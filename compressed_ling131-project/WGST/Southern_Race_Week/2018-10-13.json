especially you know if you're not checking in every moment that you have so there's a level of trust there and reports like this come out and it gives you cause for concern\nMany experts that I spoke to from with in the nursing industry and also with an advocacy group have said that there's a great lack of information surrounding the payment profit thing and the treatment that these patients are getting\nRiley Griffin reporter for Bloomberg News thank you very much for joining us\nThank you for having me [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\nAll right I'm Glad we're finally here this is my favorite story of the week\nWe've all heard stories about passengers flying with ah their cats and their dogs\nIn some cases I don't know why this is so popular but they're miniature horses if people flying with their emotional support animals and you'll deliver is longer than that to peacocks hamsters a duck wearing a diaper I Wish I could have seen the deprecating pigs unfortunately\nThe latest one in this line of emotional support animals is a lady flying with her pet squirrel or I'm Sorry her emotional support squirrel\nI'm I brought in my producer Miranda for more details on this just to find out how crazy to stories and we are\nSo talk about what steps you need to take to actually get cleared to have an emotional support animal\nThis woman was removed from a frontier airlines flight late Tuesday night when she tried to fly with her emotional support squirrels and then she refused to get off the plane after being told no according to the airline so frontier spokesperson made a statement and said that\nYes the passenger did follow protocol by calling them in advance and saying that she would be flying with an emotional support animal but she never specified that it would be anything other than the typical dog or cat right they had no idea that they were going to have a rodent on board\nThat seems like a failure of communication you would think the person handling the call would have asked well what is the animal they said rodents including squirrels are not allowed on frontier flight\nSo if it seems to be some type of policy\nOkay that could have been figured out she called in advance so he said the flight was traveling from Orlando to Cleveland they told the lady you got to get off they actually had to take\nOther passengers off the plane everybody how to get off so that they can be plain hurt they had to call the police force doubly remove her from the flight right and that in and of itself is a huge pain there is a fun facts I think you can share this red a frontier airlines features of variety animals on the tails of the plane\nYeah so they're saying that they have animals on the tails of their planes including Fox either red Fox Rudy the raccoon Jim Bob the badger and even Oscar same made a score of course\nThey did there was a viral video that was going on and the ladies actually they took her off in a wheelchair and she's lipic people off as she's being escorted out and people are cheering them because we have a little bit of audio [noise]\nFrontier announce actually about a new policy on emotional support animals that are set to go in effect on November first and allows cats and dogs and restricts train service animals to cats dogs and miniature horses thirties again miniature horses seem to be a popular one and the question then becomes how do people get emotional support animals\nI feel like you can just anybody can just say hey I Need this X. animal here to make me feel better there's actually a political that you need to go to have an emotional support and well\nThere's a couple of things so emotional support animals are different from service animals and so emotional support animals are not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act meaning that businesses are not required to accommodate them\nSo things like airlines restaurants if you don't have the her service dog because you're blind or you have a peanut allergy or whatever it is\nThey can kick you out of the restaurant and you're not out anything in order to obtain an emotional support animal you have to prove that you are emotionally disturbed\nYou have to actually go to a mental health professional right\nAnd they have to diagnose you with whatever kind of mental illness or met a motion on disability you may had and from there you can qualify to have the emotional animal to travel with you or go wherever you want and the only requirement is that they'd be well behaved and not jerks in public right don't have to have any kind of special training\nAll domesticated animals may qualify as an emotional support em cats dogs mice rabbits birds hedgehogs rats mini pigs ferrets the list goes on and on\nSo and they can be any age can be happy it can be a kitten it doesn't have to be a full grown\n... so this world could very well have qualified to be an emotional support animal I think she had it in some type of carrier and like it wasn't gonna run around and cause a bunch of trouble\nBut less than a delta spokesperson said that they've had issues with these emotional support animals on fights including dog's having panic attacks needing to get oxygen administered and flight attendants being bitten by other support animals ducks just wandering the aisles blocking the beverage cards\nI Wonder if she did have a letter saying that it was an emotional support animal I Know a lot of people for those things because they're pretty easy it's yes basically a doctors now is whether\nThere's even Web sites where you can go on line still at a yes or no questionnaire and print out your certificate sort of like becoming ordained to your friend's wedding\nThat's just a ... it's a tough thing because\nRiding in a plane is a common space you're in tight quarters you got to share that space and be respectful of other people\nAnd you never know what's gonna happen with an animal poop and pee all over the place I'm like I said I think the squirrel was probably not going to be that big of a problem but you know once the flight attendants are asking you to get off the plane is already going to be a problem [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOh man I just love that you know I'm not typically a nervous flier at all I Do get a little wary when you know the turbulence starts hitting but other than that I'm pretty solid when it comes to fly how 'bout you Miranda\nDepends on the people that I see at the gate and they're all just kind of chilling and looking at their phones I'll be good yeah but if there are a bunch of rowdy people or they're drunk already I'll puppies and it'll\nCause that anxiety or you depending on how everybody else's so here's the important question Randy if you do get anxious what would your emotional support animal will be and it can be a cat or dog has got to be a little some something a little more exotic\nOkay because it might go to is I'm going to bring my dog I\n... I Would have brought my own dark as well but you can't do that this is something\nIn the line of a ... and hamsters can I have an emotional support turtle there you go that's a that's a good one they're quiet they're kinda cute in com that is true that my animal turtle\nI think my emotional support animal would be a flop because the move again they're quiet they don't get into too much action well take that's why I think that'd be cute and something fun to a good conversation starter thank you Miranda thanks out there [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nRight that's it for us this weekend he sure to check out the daily died every Monday through friday joined us on social media at daily die hard on Twitter\nPark has something to\nLeave a comment give us a rating tells the stories that you're interested in\nAll of the daily diving I heard radio subscribe wherever you get your pocket\nThe daily died was produced by random er into an engineer by Tony ...
