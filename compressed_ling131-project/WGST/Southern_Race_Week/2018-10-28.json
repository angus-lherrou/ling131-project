{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Do you think you Miranda thank you [laughter]\n\n\nSo this has to be my favorite story of the week I'm a Southern California guy I grew up here and I love Disneyland I Love going there it is one of the happiest places on the earth and we found this article in the wall Street Journal about the big secret the Disney World and Disneyland have\nThat it's a favorite spot for people to scattered the ashes of their family members once they've passed these think it's like one of the ultimate tribute said you could have their Miranda real quick if you were going to have your ... and where would you have them spread it probably\nJones 'cause that's my favorite right I Would go on space mountain and I just want somebody to throw me up in the air so that it gets all over everyone and everything I worried they're going to sweep the lead guy ended the night that's what happens actually so\nWe spoke to Eric Schwartz all he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal and he spoke to several families who have actually done this they were very forthright about it they snuck the ashes and they spread them out in different places\nDisneyland holds a really special place in a lot of people's hearts and it just makes sense that people would want to have it be their final resting place oh here's Eric's wars all with more about the big secret from Disneyland\nI'm so glad to hear you say that it made a lot of sense to you and made a lot of sense to me to it without something I'd ever thought about but whenever I heard that this was a popular place it spread ashes it was like oh of course\nPeople love going to Disneyland it makes sense that someone want to spend eternity there and when I started talking to the custodians who work in both parks they told me Oh yes it's very much a thing of always been these rumors about it but it does happen\nAnd it so much to the point that they have a code word for it or they say it's\nA heck of clean up so if you are a worker who sees what you suspect\nAre human ashes maybe left on the seat of a ride or something like that you radio all over and you say we have a have a clean up and that means you need to grab the hyper allergenic vacuum because the custodians will then come by and if they do indeed identify the substance of human ashes they will come up in a vacuum and clean it up all everyone you know leaves the premises and\nGoes on to other right before they can come back\nDisney custodian say that it happens about once a month that they actually notice it it could be happening a lot more so that's a lot of frequency we were talking about a really quick about how much it makes sense that people would want this to be part of their final resting place\nIn the article you you detail somebody who said that they would go to Disneyland with their dad and he worked like the graveyard shift but when he was at Disneyland he was a completely different person happy go lucky and she was like can we stay here forever so it really means\nSomething to a lot of people to be in this location give us a couple of examples of how people are spreading\nThese ashes like what are they doing and you know where are they doing it all that stuff\nI spoke with six families who have spread ashes at Disney Parks and they do follow a bit of a pattern they know they're not supposed to do it so they have to get creative\nSeveral of them smuggled the ashes in prescription pill bottles you know I talked to one woman who said you know she had the very surreal experience of emptying her father's earn in the hotel bathroom\nInto a pill bottle that she could then smuggle past park security while others will simply put them in Ziploc bags and put them at the bottom of a purse or an ... that that's gotten through security as well and then once they're inside if they want to maybe spread it on a specific ride they might wait until the riots particularly dark so no one sees them other times they'll just go to a flower\nBed or a part of the park but it doesn't seem like there are a lot of people around\nNow I did speak with one woman who's in the story who and two thousand nine spread the ashes of her mother\nAnd at one point while she was doing it she was sort of overcome with grief and she hopped over the barricade surrounding the lawn outside Cinderella Castle and ran across the grass flinging them and she ran and it's a pretty dramatic statement and she says no one stopped her and I have photos of the sit\nThere and I just saw the you know so so it definitely happen and so it's like wow if if someone running across Cinderella lawn ashes doesn't get notice I mean I Can't imagine how many people do this and never\nGet caught but you're right that in talking to custodians that consensus that I arrived at what did it happen about once a month but I've heard stories of it happening more frequently heard stories of there being some downtime where they might not have one for a while but in my story alone I had six examples ranging from Nineteen Ninety six to last week\nHow did you find these people like how did they come forward I mean I I I think the park has says that if anybody is caught doing this there'll be escorted off property but I don't think there's been any arrests or anything related to this house so how did these people come forward to you\nThere haven't been any arrests that we know of the Anaheim police department says they couldn't recall any arrests being made on this kind of thing you know the people that I spoke to they were pretty public about the fact that they had spread ashes at Disney so\nIt was point of pride that you know at this point\nYeah it's a point of pride it's also I should say like even though I think most of them found a bit of a bit of humor and the whole act they they definitely it was an extremely emotional experience and\nSomething that they also saw and interpreted as honoring their loved ones final wishes so it was something that they were really touched by an and actually quite eager to share with me\nYou've touched a little bit on where the spread these ashes a lot of times flower beds Bush is on the lawns outside even in the park gauge [laughter]\nLove the quote someone said that the hunting mentioned probably has so much human ashes in it that it's not even funny and that sort of those places obviously we know what the haunted mentioned right is all about spooky and what not and it's like the perfect places to drop the ashes it gives the all new meaning you know the next time I'm going to be that I'm going to be like trying to look for human ashes there\nWell I take that as the ultimate compliment I mean I think the last I heard\nSo many examples that I can say safely say that human ashes and spread all over these parks the hunted Manchin is definitely the most popular destination but it's a small world also had quite a strong showing base mountain pirates of the Caribbean I mean\nReally if you think about it they're probably been human ashes spread there and I don't quite know why they ... the hunted Manchin is so\nI mean obviously it's on theme right for the practice but in talking to people who work in a mansion they describe just to sort of general obsession among certain fans with the haunted mansion\nI also think that it's probably strategically a pretty good spot because it's very dark and there are a lot of places where you can sort of an conspicuously into it\nKnowing this now gives all these rides new meaning when they find ashes and they have to go through the process of locating it cleaning it up\nThey'll close the rides and say they're closer technical difficulties and I've always seen rides closed for technical difficulties before it could be something mechanical but this is also one of those other reasons so what's that process when they identify what they think it is and then how do they go through about cleaning\nSo this is a process that will kick start on rights like the hunger mansion so safe or ride comes around people leave and they see some what they think are are human ashes on the seats they will clear out the premises they'll radio over for a clean up\nThey often do you tell people that there are technical difficulties that they need to attend to and then they will hit out fast passes to people because you know you're standing in line for an hour and then suddenly they say the right to have to shut down and you have to leave you gotta give 'em something wrong with people are going to get upset\nSo then the other documents come in and they suck it up you know in a manager will often ride the ride by themselves so that they can look and see like are there any ashes anywhere in the rye that we need to go in identifying and sweep up and then resume business\nA number of the people I spoke to also dumped ashes in the water of these ride like on pirates and on it's a small world so the water I think it's probably a pretty ... possible place to to discover it you're not going to see that especially on some of those darker rides\nYeah I mean it's a really fun read it's perfect for Halloween ... reporter for the wall Street Journal thank you very much for joining us\nA thank you and if you do see any ashes on the hunter mansion please call
