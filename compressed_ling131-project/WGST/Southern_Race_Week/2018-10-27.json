{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Is more of a sense of security there I think I'm past these already I liked to have my own room and\nBut the one in Miami out there it's a beautiful room it's a hundred and twenty five yeah but if I Can't bring anybody back you know I cannot friends back I'm not kidding [laughter]\nLet's say that [noise] so you'd hospitals expanding in the U.S trying to show these old identities we'll see if they gain in popularity thank you Miranda thank you Oscar [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nSo it has to be my favorite story of the week I'm a Southern California guy I grew up here and I love Disneyland I Love going there it is one of the happiest places on the earth and we found this article on Wall Street Journal about the big secret that Disney World and Disneyland have\nThat it's a favorite spot for people to scatter the ashes of their family members once they've passed these think it's like one of the ultimate tribute said you can have their Miranda real quick if you were going to have your ashes spread of Disneyland where would you have them spread it\nProbably Indiana Jones 'cause that's my favorite\nRight I Would go on space mountain and I just want somebody to throw me up in the air so that it gets all over everyone and everything\nI worried they're going to sweep you what I ended the night\nThat's what happens actually so we spoke to ... he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal and he spoke to several families who have actually done this they were very forthright about it they snuck the ashes in they spread them out in different places Disneyland holds a really special place in a lot of people's hearts and it just makes sense that people would want to\nHave it be their final resting place oh here's ... with more about the big secret from Disneyland\nI'm so glad to hear you say that it made a lot of sense to you and made a lot of sense to me to it without having I'd ever thought about but whenever I heard that this was a popular place it spread ashes it was like oh of course people love going to Disneyland it makes sense at some would want to spend eternity there and when I started talking to the custodians who work in both parks\nThey told me Oh yes it's very much a thing of always been these rumors about it but it does happen\nAnd it so much to the point that they have a code word for did they say it's\nA habit clean up so if you are a worker who sees what you suspect are human ashes maybe left on the seat of a ride or something like that you radio over and you say we have a happy to clean up and that means\nYou need to grab the hype all are gigantic vacuum because the custodians will then come by and if they do indeed identified the substance of human ashes they will come up in a vacuum and clean it up while everyone you know the premises and\nGoes on to other rights before they can come back\nDisney custodian say that it happens about once a month that they actually notice it it could be happening a lot more so that's a lot of frequency we were talking about a really quick about how much would make sense that people would want this to be part of their final resting place\nIn the article you you detail somebody who said that they would go to Disneyland with their dad and he worked like the graveyard shift but when he was at Disneyland he was a completely different person happy go lucky and she was like can we stay here forever so it really means something to a lot of people to be in this location give us a couple of\nExamples of how people are spreading these ashes like what are they doing and you know where are they doing it all that stuff\nI spoke with six families who have spread ashes at Disney Parks\nAnd they do follow a bit of a pattern they know they're not supposed to do it so they have to get creative several of them smuggled the ashes in prescription pill bottles you know I've talked to one woman who said you know she had the very surreal experience of empty and her father's or in in the hotel bathroom into a pill bottle that she\nCould then smuggle path park security while others will\nSimply put them in Ziploc bags and put them at the bottom of a ... that that's gotten through security as well and then once they're inside if they want to maybe spread it on a specific ride they might wait until the ... dark so no one sees them other times they'll just go to a flower bed or a part of the park because it doesn't seem like there are a lot of people around\nNow I did speak with one woman who's in the story who and two thousand nine spread the ashes of her mother and at one point while she was doing it she was sort of overcome with grief and she hopped over the barricade surrounding the lawn outside Cinderella Castle\nAnd ran across the grass flinging them as she ran wild and it's a pretty dramatic statement and she says no one stopped her and I have photos of the sit there and I saw the you know\nSo so it definitely happen and so it's like wow if if someone running across Cinderella lawn for a ashes doesn't get noticed I mean I Can't imagine how many people do this and never get caught but you're right that in talking to custodians the consensus that I arrived that would that have happened about once a month\nBut I've heard stories of it happening more frequently I heard stories of there being some downtime where they might not have one for a while but in my story alone I had six examples ranging from Nineteen Ninety six to last week\nHow did you find these people like how did they come forward I mean I I I think the ... says that if anybody is caught doing this there'll be escorted off property but I don't think there's been any arrests or anything related to this house so how did these people come forward to you\nThere haven't been any arrests that we know of the Anaheim police department says they couldn't recall any arrests being made on this kind of thing you know the people that I spoke to they were pretty public about the fact that they had spread ashes at Disney so\nIt was one of pride that you know at this point\nYeah it's a point of pride it's also I should say like even though I think most of them found a bit of a bit of humor and the whole act they they definitely it was an extremely emotional experience and\nSomething that they also saw and interpreted as honoring their loved one final wishes so it was something that they were really touched by and and actually quite eager to share with me\nYou've touched a little bit on where the spread these ashes a lot of times flower beds Bush is on the lawns outside even in the park gates [laughter]\nI Love the quote someone said that the hunted mentioned probably has so much human ashes in it that it's not even funny and that's one of those places obviously we know what the hundred mentioned right is all about spooky and what not and it's like the perfect places to drop the ashes it gives the all new meaning you know the next time I'm going to be they're going to be like trying to look for human ashes there\nWell I take that as the ultimate compliment I mean I think the last I heard\nSo many examples that I can say safely say that human ashes have been spread all over these parks the hunted mansion is definitely the most popular destination but it's a small world also had quite a strong showing based mountain pirates of the Caribbean I mean\nReally if you think about it they're probably been human ashes spread there and I don't quite know why they ... the hunted Manchin is so I mean obviously it's on theme right for the practice but in talking to people who work in the hunting mansion they described just to sort of general obsession among certain fans\nWith the haunted mansion I also think that it's probably strategically a pretty good spot because it's very dark and there are a lot of places where you can sort of an conspicuously into it\nKnowing this now gives all these rides new meaning when they find ashes and they have to go to the process of locating it cleaning it up\nThey'll close the rides and say they're closer technical difficulties and I've always seen rides closed for technical difficulties before it could be something mechanical but this is also one of those other reason so what's that process when they identify what they think it is and then how do they go through about cleaning\nIt is a process that will kick start on rights like the hungry mansions so safe or ride comes around people leave and they see some what they think are are human ashes on the seats they will clear out the premises they'll radio over for ... clean up\nThey often do you tell people that there are technical difficulties that they need to attend to and then they will head out fast passes\nTo people because you know you're standing in line for an hour and then suddenly they say there I'd have to shut down and you have to leave you got to give him something wrong with people are going to get upset so then the the vacuum them come in and they suck it up you know in a manager will often ride the ride by themselves so that they can look and see like are there any ashes\nAnywhere in the rye that we need to go in identifying and sweep up and then resume business\nA number of the people I spoke to also dumped ashes in the water of these ride like on pirates and on it's a small world so\nThe water I think it's probably a pretty ... possible place to to discover it you're not going to see that especially in some of those darker rides\nYeah I mean it's a really fun read it's perfect for Halloween Eric ... reporter for the wall Street Journal thank you very much for joining us\nA thank you and if you do see any ashes on the hunter mansion please call me so I can do a follow up it definitely was a great thank you\n\nThat's it for us this weekend be sure to check out the daily diving every Monday through friday joined us on social media apps nearly
