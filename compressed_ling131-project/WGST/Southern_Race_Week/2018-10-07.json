{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Yeah onto the ground below and it just so happens to position the ant directly over the colonies trails which of course increase the chances that it's going to in fact more ends and so when the fungus growing through the muscles this what it makes sense right if it's\nKind of destroying these muscles how's it been ordering the ant out of the colony and this is\nReally pull him in our research but what they're thinking is that it is actually acting as a kind\nOf nervous system of itself so it's actually replacing the nervous system of the ... so it might be releasing neurotransmitter that mimic those of the ... owned by to actually manipulate individual muscles so it's like a puppet master\nPulling strings and that's just as stunning how this could have involved but it probably happened small step by small that it started more simple than that of course but these extra manipulations help the fungus propagate it ... into more ants and that's what led to develop a six\nDream like complex manipulation but nevertheless is happening I can guarantee you that that's happening it's real life you know it's happening out there in nature\nNow it's kinda crazy as it takes about three weeks for the fungus to grow with inside the end and you talk about how I mean it's so crazy how delicate this procedure is because you know and it's living this colony when they noticed something is amiss in another end sicker stumbling are acting weird\nAnother ... will literally come and take it pick it up and throw it down to its death you know away from the colony protecting the colony\nSo the fungus has to be very careful that it doesn't trigger something weird in the end that it it's going to trigger one of the other answer and suspected of being some type of intruder\nSo how does that work how does the funniest delicately move around this because at the very end as you said when it makes it go bike the leaf or the tree branches something that's the point it takes over the brink kind of but before that the end is still operating normally it within the colony\nYeah that that's a really cool thing about ants you know I I don't want to to to short them on credit here they're really good at as you said at a sniffing out their own that happened\nTo be sick because you want to quarantine those individuals before they wreak havoc on the rest of the call anyone of that a path in as a fungus or some other sort of disease that the thing that has evolved over many millions of years and ants which then as you mentioned the fungus passive\nAnd Curt so that's probably why this is such a complex manipulation so then scientists aren't quite sure yet how\nIt's able to avoid detection because answer really good at sniffing out pheromones that's how they communicate and largely find their way around it somehow the fungus ended up taking over about half\nOf the body weight of the ant which you would assume would smell a little different than a typical and so because they have\nThis really intricate\nUnique system of missing out bad actors in the colony that's probably why the fungus is so complex that it probably started out killing\nThe ants a long time ago millions upon millions of years ago this is in fact that they found fossils that are many millions of years old of leaves with the characters they bite marks of the aunt in them which presume that the fungus had\nBeen doing this for a long time so it probably start out pretty sort kills the ... in the colony but that might get it found out and that would get it dragged out of the colony and into the graveyard where you have to stick and go\nI Love the way you put it in the article to it has to drive the host mad yet not mad enough to raise the alarms and the colony\nExactly so yeah and you know and it doesn't really show the symptoms and doesn't really show symptoms until it is literally stumbling out of the colony as the fungus ordering it to its doom up you know ten inches up a tree [laughter]\nSo you know this is as I mentioned this was an incredibly complex manipulation it doesn't seem possible but that is the beauty of natural selection evolution over\nMillions upon millions of years this has grown increasingly complex\nBecause the ant colony is it south extremely complex and able to sniff out this sort of manipulation if the end is acting at all weird so that is all the more pressure on the fungus to a ball to avoid detection and really pull off this\nStunningly complex devious manipulation\nThat's how we get this zombie I mean here it's so delicate that process and infiltrating the colony and even half the time it right the you know the fungus as a time it right so that when the end is leaving the colony that's when it releases all the chemicals and finally taken over the brain\nTo make it go ten inches up and fight the leaf and everything it's just so interesting how these things work and you were saying earlier it does a originate in the rain forest but there are some here in the United states as well in a South Carolina I think we have a at\nA certain type of this fungus as well\nYeah and that's where it gets if you can believe it all the more credible because\nIn some of the United states you of course have trees that will shed their leaves once a year and that of course would be bad for the fungus if the fungus was ordering the ... to bite onto the pain of all if that means it's going to tumble out of the tree and lose its perch above a colony so what has happened\nHere in the southern United States as well as other temperate climates around the world is\nThe fungus doesn't order the antibody onto the vein of a leap but instead\nThe branch are quick which is a perch that it can maintain year round even as the leaves fall off the tree the problem there is that that's a little bit more delicate of a perch it's easier to get a purchase on the vein of a lead by buying into it so it actually happens here in the United states as the\nFungus there's ordering the aunt to bite onto the twig it's not such a good purchase but then orders the answer rap its legs around the way and then grows as the fungus grows out of the legs and kind of attached to them to that\nStem and that's just all the more power to to purchase there and you know get a good grasp because\nIn the temperate climate the fungus can't develop nearly as quickly as it does in the rain forests where it's nice and warm and humid and actually developed over the course of a year and it will over winter just sitting there on a stem biting its time and then once the spring comes around it will then finally wrapped out of the back of the head\nOf the ... as it does in the rain forest whereas you know in the rain forest a dozen and a number of days as opposed to once upon month so it's really fascinating how in different parts of the world the fungus is uniquely adapted to really ruin the day of the ants in a in a very unique way\nIt's such a creepy cool story and I've seen the picture of the fungus growing out of the ... and it looks pretty crazy wearing a link to your article this is all part of a book that you wrote called plight of the living dead tell us about the book\nYeah so that turns out that the fungus is just one of the many many manipulators among parasites in the animal kingdom so it turns out that this is across a different species so worms do it to crickets\nTheir war or to the crickets the jump into water which is not of course ... for the credit which can drown or you can buy fish\nAnd it's at that point the worms are up and then ...\nThat's a particular kind of manipulation rabies actually is a a very well known parasitic manipulated that does it usually to raccoons and ... and things like that but can also get into the human brain so\nThe book is about the wide range of parasites the\nReally incredible range of parasites more than you'd ever imagine that can take over the minds of their hosts and really unique way whether that's by releasing chemicals or physically altering structures in the brain so called by living dead and yes it's it's a what I Hope they're fascinating exploration have this\nVery strange kingdom of species that are really ruining the days of their house\nJust reading about the ants in of itself is
