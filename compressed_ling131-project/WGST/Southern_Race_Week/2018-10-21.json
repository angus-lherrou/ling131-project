radio six forty double duty as the\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell come back to the daily died weekend edition here's the rest of our conversation with Denver gone oh and I started off by asking him how the U.S is going to fare with beer prices [laughter]\nAnd who are the countries that are going to be affected by this the most I Know Arlen like I said could see triple a prices of beer but the other countries and where does the U.S fairness\nThe northern Europe is we get to the biggest hit because they all have to import that most barley to make the beer in\nThe U.S something drops in price goes up but not as much as other places because barley production starts moving north into Canada further so we don't lose as much supply a burly is imported and exported widely and that was in corporate model but you know it really helps in terms of price to have a stuffed nearby\nWhat's been the reaction from other groups or you know beer trade groups I Know the brewers association was one of them that said hey you know but just an academic exercise don't believe all the hype nothing to lose sleep over and then they also say you know the farmers would be adapting as things would happen you know the shift\nMar the growing to other parts where they can still get good yields but so what's been the reaction out of other people outside of the study\nYou summarize the beer industry is ... pretty nicely yeah they said were on top of this thing there was a drought and the Pacific northwest last year that affected probably production and\nSo we're all aware of this and worrying about it and that's all nice but some of the people who look at sort of large scale farming say that you know these are changes are gonna be happening on continent wide scale and that is going to affect crops when you have drought and heat wave we can engineer\nFor things like drought resistance but that actually might change the nutrient profile with a barley which might change the taste of the beer\nOr you know it's what's in it and you can engineer for drought resistance but he resistance is a tough one and he is the thing that's going on what time of climate change and that might change these very basic chemical reactions that are going on and barley and make\nBarley barley and so that's why you have to move in North to harm it and you know you run out of north after a while and it becomes more expensive to do that sort of thing you're competing with other crops so the people who study these things on ... agricultural economics basis or not as sanguine as the industry on the other hand you know people\nLike beer and the industry is pretty innovative one in some way so you know maybe they will get on top of it it just shows is not cheaper though than like not having to worry about it\nYeah I think it's just pretty funny how quickly this story went viral you know obviously climate change a lot of people are always attuned to that but you throw in beer one of the authors of the study even said not sure what to make of the fact that in one day our paper on climate and beer has garnered considerably more attention than\nAny of their previous work on energy transitioned air pollution deaths anything other than that you know it's like this you know you're messing with my beer and you know everybody's interested in it right away Denver got a science reporter for buzzfeed news thank you very much for joining us thank you [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nIt's all this month of October I've been putting in little stories and the podcast is trying to get everybody to get on the same level\nOf Halloween that I Love to get every year the one that caught my attention this past week was that every child vampire burial that was found in Italy in some type of baby cemetery there was eerie discovery ... they found it was the skeleton of a ten year old that had\nA rock lodged in his mouth they bury this child is way because they were afraid I was going to come back to life and continue to spread malaria I spoke to my producer Miranda and we talked about this vampire burial site in Italy\nResearchers from the University of Arizona and also a university that Stanford\nWent on this gig in Italy and they found this child cemetery and so inside of a miniature him\nIn what used to be a gigantic Roman villa they said it was about the size of a shopping mall like you can think about like that they found a body of the ten year old child who died more than Fifteen hundred years ago the skeleton was lying on its side with its mouth open and stuffed inside was a limestone rocks\nAbout the size of a big egg and like you said they believed that child\nDied as malaria sixty miles north of round and they said that the way that they buried this catalyst they ... they ... already dead they opened the mouse for ... to the rock inside and then failed that extra spots with cement so that they can be sure that the Iraq wouldn't come out right\nAnd they were able to determine how old the kid was by looking at the heat depression\nAnd that's how they know that the rock was put in after he was dead because of those same impressions right locally or they're calling it the vampire of Luke nano it's in this ... like you said is in this area which was like the center of witchcraft and the Roman empire at that time in Italy they said that this burial site has also been called ...\nWhich is a cemetery of babies and they found all sorts of different stuff in his burial site you said it was like a huge villa\nAnd they found remnants of a ... in these trenches they're covered trenches\nThere was remains of infants toddlers aborted fetuses that had been buried alongside raven talents toad bones ROMs called dreams these things were filled with ash and sacrificial puppies\nYeah archaeologist all these deviant burials which is the ancient way of burying people who were they feared would have supernatural abilities like coming back from the dead\nOr that the where people and I I don't know how this would apply to children but it had violated society's rules and singing vampire ...\nAnd a lot of these archaeologists and researchers saying it's stuff that they just didn't understand these illnesses like malaria at the time they probably didn't have a handle on it they didn't know what it was or why it was popping up\nAnd things that they feared they thought might come back from the dead they thought they were vampires that's why they took these extra steps to bury them this way so that they couldn't come back and continue to spread diseases\nAnd they would do all kinds of things like that were rituals rentals you didn't say they were dumped honey suck all over the place and these are just to kind of try to make it as your as possible so that the spirits would just has salon and not come back\nWe don't know the gender of this ten year old the skeleton that was there but they said that near this one was a three year old girl the the remains are three oh girl they found\nThat said there her hands and feet had been way down with stones which was another form of vampire burial to keep the evil away so that she couldn't get up they were able to dig in into the bones and the remains and they also found that she had died of malaria\nBefore Ford's swim call a fine on every stage of Sunday's race and used teamwork the pull away from the field so congratulations to Eric emerald on your winter and the monster energy
