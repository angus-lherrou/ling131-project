country and a few nonprofit to agreed that the payment system needs to be restructured but they did push back against the studies methodologies saying that it was to narrow the population to be generalize about but the author of this study strongly disagreed with that claim\nAnd then if you have a family member that might be in a nursing home or something or you might suspect that some of this stuff is going on or they're getting too many treatments things like that what can you do to get a little more involved\nWhat I can say that that was published I received an email responses with love wines concern for their family members care and also reporting instances where they feel that their family has a some kind of trauma related to this issue\nIs kind of a no no and you know a family members they're being treated and you trust the people there so you don't know what's going on especially you know if you're not checking in every moment that you have so there's a level of trust there and reports like this come out and it gives you cause for concern\nMany experts that I spoke to from ... in the nursing industry and also with an advocacy groups have said that there's a great or lack of information surrounding the payment processing and the treatment that these patients are getting\nRiley Griffin reporter for Bloomberg News thank you very much for joining us\nThank you for having me [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nAll right I'm Glad we're finally here this is my favorite story of the week\nWe've all heard stories about passengers flying with uh the cats and their dogs\nIn some cases I don't know why this is so popular but they're miniature horses if people flying with their emotional support animals and you'll deliver is longer than that to peacocks hamsters a duck wearing a diaper I Wish I could have seen the deprecating pigs unfortunately\nThe latest one in this line of emotional support animals is a lady flying with her pet squirrel or I'm Sorry for emotional support squirrel\nI'm I brought in my producer Miranda for more details on this just to find out how crazy the stories and we also talk about what steps you need to take to actually get cleared to have an emotional support animal\nThis woman was removed from a frontier airlines flight late Tuesday night when she tried to fly with her emotional support squirrel and then she refused to get off the plane after being told no according to the airline so frontier spokesperson made a statement and said that\nYes the passenger did follow protocol by calling them in advance and saying that she would be flying with an emotional support animal but she never specified that it would be anything other than the typical dog or cat right they had no idea that they were going to have a rodent on board\nThat seems like a failure of communication you would think the person handling the call would have asked well what is the animal they said rodents including squirrels are not allowed on frontier flight so if it seems to be some type of policy okay that could have been figured out she called in advance so they said the flight was\nTraveling from Orlando to Cleveland they told the lady you got to get off they actually had to take other passengers off the plane everybody how to get off so that they can be plain hurt they had\nTo call the police force simply remove her from the flight right and that in another itself is a huge pain there is a fun facts I think you can share this Miranda a frontier airlines teachers or variety animals on the tails of the plane\nYeah so they're saying that they have animals on the tails of their planes including Fox either red Fox Rudy the raccoon Jim Bob the badger and even Oscar same made a score of course\nThey did there was a viral video that was going on and the ladies actually they took her off in a wheelchair and she's lipic people off as she's being escorted out and people are cheering everything that we have a little bit of audio [noise]\nFrontier announce actually about a new policy on emotional support animals that are set to go in effect on November first and allows cats and dogs and restricts train service animals to cats dogs and miniature horses there it is again miniature horses seem to be a pop out at wanting the question then becomes how do people get emotional support\nAnimals I feel like you can just anybody can just say hey I Need this X. animal here to make me feel better there's actually a political that you need to go through to have an emotional support and well\nThere's a couple of things so emotional support animals are different from service animals and so emotional support animals are not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act meaning that businesses are not required to accommodate them\nSo things like airlines restaurants if you don't have the her service dog because you are blind or you have a peanut allergy or whatever it is\nThey can kick you out of the restaurant and you're not out anything in order to obtain an emotional support animal you have to prove that you are emotionally disturbed\nYou have to actually go to a mental health professional\nRight and they have to diagnose you with whatever kind of mental illness are mad motion on disability you may had and from there you can qualify to have the emotional animal to travel with you or go wherever you want and the only requirement is that they'd be well behaved and not jerks in public right don't have to have any kind of special training\nThey'll build his record with
