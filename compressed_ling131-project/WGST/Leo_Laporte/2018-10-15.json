say there are some people that that fact that's kind of things\nThat are just going to ask you what is it that you're actually trying to be careful about when you're doing all this research\nWell there's a difference between a shooter and a or shall we say true collectors pace now now given the price of machine guns these days all of them are are collector's items but\nThere are some of them that are a really more shooters okay and for instance I have I have an MP forty that is I hate to gun which is a a U.S produced receiver that has a German a porch kept on it\nThat was produced sometime between Nineteen sixty eight and a Nineteen eighty six now that gun to me is just a shooter\nGuy one is that the one that I shot that\nIs the one that shoe shot that is on the\nOne of the most delightful guns of any type I have ever shot\n[noise] now the comparison okay 'cause I'm more than one MP forty I have one that came out of the Winchester museum when Winchester went bankrupt\nThis gun is a late Nineteen forty three gun\nThat is absolutely all original it as a cause the Germans like their their numbers and they put the last to share the last two digits or their serial number on virtually all the parts and every part on that gun is number two the receive\nPart give me an idea of the price difference between those two\nAre the two guns been running in the fourteen thousand range [laughter] okay um [noise] I\nJust stopped my insurance on a on the show which I collect or the seeing or none the curia when relic on because the last uh Rock Island or a Rock Island auction\nA collector MP forties went for ... really outstanding price search [laughter] I kind of figure something in the um twenty twenty five thousand range\nOkay so knowing what you're getting could be the six thousand dollar difference or in some of these guns that could be a twenty or thirty thousand dollar difference\nYes\nYeah I like to go through with me because people are gaining okay great but\nYou know I Know a guy who's got a gun kind of a deal I mean and you get these calls 'cause you're known as the machine gun guy and you get these calls and you were describing to me kind of the the three gun example of three different types of guns that ... or means machine guns ... list as far as what you can buy a maybe can't\nWell I was recently talking to a police department and and this is our explained what they had no ...\nUm machine guns generally fallen registered machine guns generally fall into three categories and if you imagine the tops in sub machine gun that was built in Nineteen forty three and there were three identical Thompson ... Cheryl number\nYou know a hundred thousand one hundred thousand two hundred thousand and three okay so so they in essence are identical ...\nOne of them was registered before November thirtieth of Nineteen sixty eight\nGuy one of them was free imported into the country between Nineteen sixty eight in Nineteen eighty six and the last one was re imported into the country after Nineteen [noise] okay okay [noise]\nThe first one is what we would refer to as a transferable machine gun it can be transferred to any body who could ... who could legally buy a pistol [laughter] okay you have to be Twenty one you have to not be a convicted felon you do have to live in a state that allows you to\nOwn a machine gun in there are number of states you probably could guess Pham that don't allow you to own a machine gun or chant way what ways than one that does [noise] um [noise] anyway the transferable guns\nAre are freely transferable that rare but freely transferable Daryl so therefore the most expensive a gun that has been brought in after Nineteen sixty eight but before Nineteen eighty six [noise] is typically either owned by dealer as a dealer sample\nOr by a police department now the dealer samples during that time can be freely transferred between dealers okay\nThere can't be transferred to an art ordinary a consumer but they can be transferred between dealers the final type of gun\nIs one that was a brought into the country and registered after Nineteen eighty six after May of Nineteen eighty six and those are restricted guns and they are restricted\nOnly to the military police and a dealer who can get a letter from a law enforcement agency requesting a demonstration of that got chosen\nI run through the what would be roughly the prices of these three guns in the market because if you if more people can own it then it becomes more valuable that would be the pre sixty eight right\nThe pretty sixty eight guns you're probably depending on the model in the condition probably looking at twenty thousand dollars or maybe it maybe more depending on what it is I mean if it's a cult Thompson it maybe twice that [noise] um the\nUh what we refer to as the pre sampled guns the guns that were imported and register between sixty eight in eighty six\nThose run about half of what a transferable gone wrong so call it ten maybe twelve thousand dollars for the final category are typically only work the some of their parks a\nThousand bucks because Thompson parks have have value to them but not really any kind of big money\nSo I think when you talk about three on three consecutive Sarah numbers could be worth twenty thousand could be worth ten thousand could be the worst one thousand\n[noise] it depends on the paperwork and if if you were possessing they're gone with the wrong type of paperwork that could be worth like ten years\nI'm\nSure it that way 'cause it would be contraband for a person to possess or to just not either a habit transferred to them on the proper form okay in the in the case for transferable or for a non dealer\nTo possess either of the dealer sample guts now I Need to throw a cab out there\nCan be a person who is a dealer who owns dealer samples better pre Nineteen eighty six if he gives up his license can keep those Taylor samples that's another reason why they're they ah have good value\nYour guy they hold on to say 'cause I got to take a quick work you're going to come back I Want to continue the conversation talking for a lot of what would be and this is the question what would be a good way to get in
