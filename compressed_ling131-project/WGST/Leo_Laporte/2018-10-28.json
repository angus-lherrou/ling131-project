over the world that want to be able to develop and you use that technology that's available most people are not aware of the most things and are unable to cope with\nOut of situations this is my life a like a hundred and eighty degrees better\nAbsolutely uh you know it I always I'm looking for places people can go 'cause I get calls from blind users all the time who want some help and I mentioned you know there's the independent\nLiving Research Center there's White House for the blind there's a variety of organizations\nThere on the national ... blind and says it says it's April suddenly desk

available through the status of the federal government I big lately help them with\nBut on the other hand if it's happening when you do a certain thing it maybe the video drivers for instance or crashing it because those can cause blue screens the problem is very difficult to figure out why something's blue screening can you reproduce the steps every time and it'll blue screen every time\nI Do and I'm just wondering if I tell you it it gives me to stop code would that give you ...\nYeah sometimes the problem is a computer so dumb the Arab message they give you ... it may or may not be a germane what does it say\nWell uh eight times snow I'm Sorry to nine times it totally it was a bad pool hitter\nYeah that's a memory problem\nOne other one of the thing is identified was age fault none yeah again if\nPage fault means something tried to write somewhere it shouldn't okay oh this is kind of the same so tell me the steps you said so what what is it that like if you did it right now it would force of blue screen of death\nThe last time this before I call it ... exactly what happened\nSo what are those steps said again\nI Do it the power button and you know the power came on and it crashed right away right away\nOkay so usually that means it's a hardware issue and there's something going wrong with the hardware which means it's not the browser it's not something you can fix or just by saying I'm going to use a different browser on these different software or eat something lower level\nThan that did you uh before I mean ... [noise]\nSomebody in the chat room saying are you trying to print something it's true that if you tried to if you had a corrupt print driver which could cause a blue screen and every time you build it up and tried to load that that would cause it it's probably a driver that's getting loaded when you first turn on the computer how far does it get before blue screens\nWell it does last time it was interesting case before that a few times they gave me some time and I I manage to get a little research in and bad drivers as one of the name colleges and and\nSo one of the things I tried to do is go in and he modify change out or delete some stop some drivers but I got confused doing I I probably did the wrong thing\nAh let me kind of if I what\nWhat I Would do here's one diagnostic and unfortunately and windows tenants a different way to do this but if you can start windows ten in safe mode and you would then not load\nThe majority of drivers your screener would look terrible because you'd have a V. Ga display driving over\nLast night I got into safe mode\nAnd did it run reliably in safe mode\nWell it did but in safe mode is when I was trying to do these correct\nIs yeah you know I mean you know what he wants to stay in safe mode\nBut if you can boot up in safe mode usually that means that something that's loading some drivers loading not in safe mode is causing the problem is so so if it was completely reliable in safe mode\nAlmost always I look at the video drivers so the first thing I Would do is is get newer video drivers for your machine is is your machine from a major manufacturer dental\nOkay so go or you might need to do this in safe mode or another computer but go to jail and go to that area for specifically that computer you know you have a Dell um service number use that to get to the exact page\nAnd download all of the drivers for that system and re installed him sometimes that that will think make it say a stapler because any replacing those drivers with something more up today um I Would bet that is the first thing I Would do and I would bet that that's what's going on it if you are so safe mode ran okay\nIt it did until I started you know trying to do some corrective actions and I was following instructions that I I got\nOn the Internet [laughter] I don't know I got him from Microsoft okay good that's getting to that is a job in itself I Know voted that\nAnd then I transferred it under chrome on my on my own my own book so I still\nHave that available yeah but\nI kind of thing where they have and you do\nIs you know I was confused I'd have to go it would take me a long time to them all and\nYeah there's the problem with doing stuff and you don't know what you're doing [laughter] you know you can really get all sorts of mischief that way um\nWell no I I appreciate that and and it's you know my wife is that it's time for you to get a new computer and I said well hopefully I Will get this done and I was thinking\nIt might be able to here's a here's the real thing to do once you go in a safe mode\nType uh you know when I was skiing type recovery and go into a recovery mode that will let you kind of re install\nA windows it'll keep your data there's various levels there's one level that will raise your drive and you'll lose all your data but there are several levels that will let you refresh windows without racing any data and that's and windows ten has some very good recovery modes I Would definitely try those you can do those from safe mode\nUh so I I Would see you know see if any of those tools\nYou have a reset this PC which is which is pretty good if you do the reset this PC and choose keep my files it'll refresh the system without a getting rid of anything you want to keep you have a backup of everything\nYeah just yeah all my data I'm not worried about my day to have all that\nWell worst case you can wipe the drive and start over she's got a good backup\nWell the thing is I Want to replace the drive anyway within is\nWell now's the time [laughter]\nI was a great time and if it now the only problem is if it's a hardware problem other than the drivers if it's you know maybe your mother board is your whatever\nYou you might be replacing the drive in the computer will still be problematic for this than it's much more serious and your wife is right and I think given spousal approval buying a new computer is not a bad thing\nThanks for the call I appreciate it I Want to talk about remote PC before we get on out of here\nEasily and securely access your PC or Mac at home or office anywhere even with your mobile devices\nLike teleport ...

to do we kind\nFun the we get together just rip off as much as we'd like to\nGo right now with my very good friend longtime friend rail and a former competitive shooter a an icon of the firearms industry a federal cartridge that loophole you've consulted with a whole bunch of the companies in the business\nYou've been around guns pretty much all your life or about fifty years time actually so far so good you worked in a gun store did early on\nThrough college I worked full time or forty five hours a week through college at a sporting goods gun shop mostly gunshots\nWere there any lessons that came from working in a gun shop the kind of helps you through your whole career in the farms industrial\nAbsolutely a learned so much about consumer demand about merchandising uh when when ... after a while when you walk into a store you start saying things that that most people don't say oh yeah and and you understand how\nThe layout should work and what types of in return they they manage and\nAnd it's a it was it an extraordinary learning experience and then we traded to insult so many guns that I ah I just learned such a wide variety of guns now from owning them from dealing with the Manhattan passing through your hands and having to no answer having to be able to answer questions\nWhen people ask you questions it's up to you to figure out the answer so that you're just always doing research\nExactly yeah and ... it was just a marvel to start end of the shooting industry\nSpeaking you know if you're a a gun person man or woman really like guns actually getting a job at a gun store probably would be kinda cool\nWell I I have suggested that too many many people who have aspirations to be in the gun industry they're shooting industry\nSo if you weren't like say I want to work for a gun company maybe a background of a few years working at a gun store be a good place\nTo start absolutely it and so many young people that I interviewed a that that were wanted so badly to be an industry said oh I just I just love the ... well ... there's more to it\nYeah so do I but that's not the job [laughter] very well we had a a fun time yesterday were out er and for those who don't know we've got a little place a cabin up in Idaho we're out here playing right now and\nUh we went out right now are four wheelers and your TVs and we took was close to forty mile run yesterday's man just thirty seven miles and miles up in the mountains and all that and\nPretty much I Would think if we had five I think that five vehicles I pretty much everybody there at least in every vehicle I Know there were firearms and there may have been far enough arms there for everybody who was there I Believe so more than likely so what were you uh what was it that long case that you had\nYour salad I told it was a four thousand five hundred and Seventy so that's what I call her some people call it a forty five Seventy but that's a they don't know what they're talking to you know of course I have I'm Marlon all over again and a\nBunch of stuff strapped on the stock was all that that was that was raised my head up I've got a scouts go up on it which is extremely fast if you have never shot a a scouts are so\nQuick it's both eyes open rifle scope that man you throw that thing up and it just pops into your vision\nAnd and it it's\nIt's a marvelous dangerous game rifle because it's so fast and you'll ... you'll acquired the target so quickly right and and so I ... yes I did put some are betting on the stock to raise my head up so that it's in the very second it touches my cheek touches the stock I'm looking through the scope\nIt's kind of like having a shotgun food to the voters would know rabies shot a couple of got targets in his life like [noise]\nI Would say a couple of hundred thousand but that would be short by about a factor of ten million yeah a little over ... over a million or so when you put the pat on the stock you raise your head up so that when you put the rifle through your stock you're not having to move your head around to be able to see through the scope exactly\nIt's very much like shooting a shotgun instinctively and uh and I you know tried it out many times until I got just exactly the right fit so that the second that that stock touches my shoulder and my cheek touches the the stock I'm looking right through the scope it's instant\nI'm just thinking you know a lot of people don't know about that and they get a rifle scopes like there'd be a rifle whatever and then when they showed rip a lot of times your cheek stock and then you have to pick your head up to be able to see through the scope right exactly\nExactly and that's why so many people have a problem acquiring a target they see a target out a hundred yards they see it through their binoculars or whatever and they put the gun to their shoulder and then there's ... that I Can't find it mhm and ah there's too many\nVariables that got the head moving around trying to actually see an image to the scope as much as anything exactly\nSo there are a lot of ways to go back if it's all first of all in most cases tried all manager scope as low as possible exactly and have the action work right okay and if that's not working then you can raise your eye\nWith the application of mold skin if you need a little bit just over the top of the stock or there actually are like strap on pads and things you can get precisely\nAnd and here's another trick a lot of people aren't aware of that I've taught countless people if they have trouble acquiring a target in the ... first of all you got a little power clear ... always start low power and that that same that should be more obvious than it is but\nThe other thing is you bring it even bring the rifle up almost to your shoulder and\nHave the target directly over the scope\nOver the top of his job you're looking over the top of the scope and then you just bring the scope to your eye and there it is both\nSo a deal is you don't try to look at the ... you look at the target and left the scope\nIntercept your vision very well but that I've been working on that [laughter] that's exactly what I'm Talking about yeah and I've tried I've taught people to do that and I said oh wow there is\nJust look at look at the scope intercept your vision just bring it up to keep staring at the target don't try to look at the scope ... that's when it gets hard to find something out exactly yeah but yeah to your point if you have a variable scope keeping on low power\nPretty much all the time until you absolutely need the higher power exactly\nAs always always always carry in the field on low power right so you can find a dark you know he's crank it up if you have to write you got to find the target\nBecause when you stop your barrels that's a hundred percent guaranteed you ... [laughter] every time\nAnd that is the number one I if I had to pick one thing that people do it was a mistake shooting a shotgun on flying targets uh-huh then I stopped again they get to their their rifle shooter so they want that target hold still\nSo if\nI see some of the ... or ... or follow for ... and that is that a way of making sure you keep swimming a\nBarrel three mile a part of it is I don't teach that\nBut no but I you know what do you do need to find a free\nBut yes absolutely positively and and ah and if some people are very accomplished at that and and they've got that system down for their particular style I don't teach a surge at the right or some some people do right some people do teach that\nOr the other thing is a good week shooting instructor can make all the difference\nDo it and you're just you'll be amazed how my home I guess we're going to change your whole your whole life if you changed your life just like so much for me for asking for later on the

to me how\nWe have forty thousand plus people there who are all well behaved and well spoken and polite and respectful and then when we get the gun banners that guy's command\nThere me and nasty and rude and our three and dropping F bombs and\nWe just never seen that from the gun owners I made\nMe wonder what makes me wonder a lot of things are beyond our time available to talk about that right now I mentioned that we are two days away from the anniversary of the nine eleven attacks on the United states of America it was a turning point in a lot of ways and for a lot of individuals who looked at that and said you know\n[noise] sweetie we might have to think about getting a gun\nAnd for a lot of people it was I a changing point it really was one of the people who have seen that in his work as Ken Campbell he is the director of operations to hit ... out the gunfight academy and Arizona and joined us right now and how you doing\n[noise] always good to be on the airways are\nExcellent appreciate appreciate everything you guys do out there [noise] uh [noise] it's interesting I mean and I know what's your extensive law enforcement background you may kind of sometimes wonder why would\nWhy would it take an event like nine eleven struck happy ... realize what they need to take care of themselves but sometimes it does and sometimes people just kind of need that wakeup call to alter\nIt take that away or talk about that for many years on being prepared whether it's a mess preparedness lecture\nOr going on it to you need to be prepared for better or even going back to the air ... unfortunately some odd that they get older\nMay not be a pleasant apply as I watched thought it was that there's a couple from Phoenix that come to mind there are many many many times over against white students and they became ... you will or a good friend of theirs during a robbery was murdered\nAnd a husband and wife are multiple guns I grab what their their regular competitors are matches both their sons are are a regular clients of our students of ours and they also should competitor late but it took that\nSignificant a bat I haven't got good rant murder 'em to really get them to wake up and that's been gosh twenty five thirty years ago\nAnd I know that happens on a regular basis where you get people that\nCome to gun site which for those who don't know gun site is a training academy it's a shooting school it's a gun fighting school\nOr in pulled in Arizona where the north of Prescott a little bit or you can learn to shoot pistols rifles shotguns or it teaches you an awful lot not exactly marks from ship although that's a part of it\nIt's an awful lot of pieces of parts but all I Want to say is\nI Know that you get people who come there where\nThey have been assaulted or somebody they know what's been assaulted or somebody who's been murdered\nDo you see in those students the difference it may be more of a sense of purpose perhaps than what the average student\nWithout fail a they found that to us to learn how to fight to change change how they look at things because of the world as their world has changed so they come here with that dedicated mindset and they leave with a big smile on their face here at but daily\nWith that empowerment that sense\nOf wellbeing that if something happens to me I my awareness to know seven principles or partial to pass my wearing it should make me alert to that I may be able to simply walk across the street and avoid it or if the why does why I can face it and deal with [noise]\nInteresting you say that because\nPeople who don't know people who have not been to ... one of the good trading schools out there and there are a number of them they think well you're going there because you really want to shoot somebody you want to learn how to shoot somebody and then people would come out of the first five day class it's been my experience that\nThey will work harder than ever in their lives to avoid that situation because now they have a very real world appreciation for what it's all about [noise]\nWithout fail a ... that\nThat Wednesday morning lecture on by that is probably the most important the lecture you get it done site because it teaches you that color code in those seven friends over the world as it makes you alert nowhere so again instead of walking down the street like so many people are what their head in there I followed\nWhat I'd like to say anything other than that and what their head of their iPhone\nCompletely unaware of what's going on around them and that criminal is out there waiting sitting there thinking that's got to be an easy target when they come out of gun site they're headed up their alert or looking around and that criminal nothing else thanks you know all white\nThere'll be an easy one for our people see this bad guy or recognize something that is that that says that women's intuition that air stand on the back of your neck they recognize that I think I Need to go across the street or all white and go out to her and knocked later\nAnd you got to be you got to trust that and when something doesn't feel right pay even more up to see what that is until you got a reason to stand down or you got a reason for that to relax um or you for\nThe ... gone way because you moved out of that environment you got you got that bill\nI put it in another way I tell people is a hope will get you killed\nAnd so what do you mean when you're walking down the streets there sure hope those guys aren't as you know bad I Hope they're coming over here I sure hope they don't mean to hurt me oh I'm going across the street they cross the street kinda I sure hope that you know at a certain point and I would say early on\nYou have to just say okay that as you say that doesn't fear right now I'm going to start taking action immediately and a lot of times the action you take is simply to remove yourself from the situation\nAnd it never becomes an attack or a life threatening situation at all but ... it's because you had to write or running\nAbsolutely and when when the dismissed ... sees that you've seen them and you're giving them some attention again I've got to think they're going to thank you know there's another one white\n... yeah they're they're they're wait for the uh the easier praise that comes along\nGearing up for the the five day or two fifty class at gun site I Know you guys running a whole bunch of them now it's one that can take you and I want to tell people you don't have to be a gunfire go there you could be you could actually have never fired a gun and start with that class cancer\nAbsolutely you can come with a brand new got it a box or or rent one from us and I'm not saying that\nTo make some rental income I'm saying that is if you don't know what kind of goes back to you if you can rent one from us by the end of the week you'll be an informed consumer and that way you can go on ... and you can find the gun you're looking for and get that best price as an informed consumer\nSo you come here with a gun in a box and we'll we'll make run faster and jump higher and you will come away stronger and better shooter certainly say and a\nAnd B B are empowered and ended a comfort zone and we're seeing more and more folks that come like that they never would have been gone people because they're recognizing the world a little more dangerous quite\nYeah and it probably you're getting a push it even split of women these days I Would guess\nA woman or a large percentage of what do we do so we do some ladies only classes here huh back a ... it's only because some women don't want to learn what man and honestly man you may want to plug your ears hair the women are better students getting that we are because we've got all that ... to get past that you go\nYes exactly very often they start off behind and by the third day they passed up the man at for only one reason they're listening Ken I gotta run ... everything you guys do gun site academy I mean it's a\nIt's the happiest place on earth for me the gun side G.
