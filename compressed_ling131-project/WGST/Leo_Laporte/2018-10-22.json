A. Y. N. E. S. versus United States\nIt's actually ha I guess I'm starting to crunch and you're right you're right I'm Sorry I Apologize and go ...\nSome nail is is\nYou cannot hold criminals legally responsible in other words you can't prosecute them for\nNoncompliance with any little gun control law you come up with because that violates their Fifth Amendment right against self recrimination\nSpecifically you cannot require big criminal to register his gun\nBecause their registration of it would be admitting that he's not not allowed to own it so that would be self in combination in this case in this Nineteen sixty eight case it was somebody with a ...\nA a prohibited something you'd have to register under the national firearms act got prosecutor and the court says will actually if you if he were to register it\nThen that would expose him as a criminal and that self incriminate nation and we have a law that says you can't require somebody to incriminate himself so no registry gun registration laws do not apply to criminals\nAnd when they say to people that it's like their heads explode\nYeah that's also why you hear about a I'll use the stereotype Chicago ... gets busted with an A. K. and they say in Chicago you can't have that but what are they charging with felon in possession\nThey don't say oh you violated the anti gun laws no no no no you're a felon with possession because the cop and the da's office no we try to do it for this all his lawyers to say hey incident there goes that\n[noise] yeah it it is an interesting thing when you're ... percent were you know we need to register guns and said we're sorry are you do understand that you cannot require felons\nPeople who are prohibited from owning a gun to register their guns there weren't so they're really the only people you want to require to register guns are law abiding people that tend to stop ... and they go well no that's not right and they were just telling you hang versus us Nineteen sixty eight\nThat says that itself from criminal nation to require someone who can own a gun to register a gun\nSo you can't require that so the bottom line on it is that gun registration laws apply all new to the law body and then their heads go just spinning around like Linda Blair and The Exorcist", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "22"}
