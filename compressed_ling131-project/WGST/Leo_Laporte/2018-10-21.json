I don't know all the details but on basically the question of if I get the DVR replace\nAdult replaces the DVR and please [laughter] that's going to cost you so much money for a sub optimal solution\nI I think she's got a uh she should\nWrite the whole thing off a the camera records to a DVR\nVia\nSome cable that she's got attached to the camera that comes into the business is that it\nYeah and it's all connected on it I mean her network I mean her home network and everything so she was able to heal it remotely [noise]\nSo I just want to know is there some kind of like a like an app or we can have our own home set up\nAnd be able to do it they're like a certain apps without having to go through other services [noise]\nWell if you're going to do it on to that over the Internet it's got to be stored somewhere [noise] um\nIs there if is it a privacy concern or is it a cost concern\nAll the above okay\nUm I think you could trust nest they're not looking at the video\nI'm the\nAs far as costs are I think it's it's considerably more Ford we've already spent more money on this thing than you will spend over you know five years on a mess a the picture is going to be better I just don't know the brand that she has a I'm not sure he again what you\nKnow name yeah sure what you're trying to do you say you you ... the guy says well if you could tell me the era message I can fix it and she can't see the message because she's not seeing the video is that the problem\nYeah because it has an H. T. M. I. L. L.

I don't know she didn't mention how many cameras they had on them but if you're talking like one of the DVR we're doing like eight to you know twelve cameras there\nYou know as somebody who's been a liquor store you'd have like maybe ... ...\nYeah that's a different story you're right that's expensive to do that with these next ... consumer cameras\nBut yeah um 'cause you have to pay for the storage for each camera that would really add up\nYeah I Would think that so I was going to be cameras here would you recommend like the ... camera for that\nAre a lot of them a lot of them yeah absolutely\nAnd that you know there's a subscription they give you a deal you should you should check to see how much it costs per camera\nOr and you don't have to store you know you can store months worth of data or five days worth of data you get to choose\nAnd so that might be another thing to you know check the pricing on that but I think these are really good and and they're very high quality cameras\nUm there are cameras if you go to the wire cutter dot com and their review there are cameras that have no subscription fee or they don't store nearly as much but maybe you don't care right because\nUh maybe if anything happens if you have three days that's plenty yeah so that's another thing to look at their work cut her if you look at their security camera reviews talks about some that have no like the ... that\nThey don't unfortunately do an outdoor camera but the wise camps don't charge you for storage uh you're responsible for your own storage in effect on camera storage or the one that has no subscription ... circle to will only do twenty four hours of storage free so you just have to you know you have to care only about the last twenty four hours\nDo any of them have an opt in for a door gunner on a device like a a USB stick or yeah\nOr there's a memory the wise scams or an amazing deal W wise III\nThere twenty and thirty dollars thirty dollars just for the pan tilt zoom you can control via the Internet they charge nothing for storage\n'em and they ... but you you if you want storage you put in a little micro S.

and line one Daniel in Long Beach\nHi Daniel Daniel yeah I mean I'm like oh you're Daniel let's make that clear okay\nOh you are you familiar with Web design a yes I Am a know to get what ... what are the minimum wage there's all the different languages like what you want to become a Web designer Daniel is that your goal I'm thinking about it and yeah I something on the site\nSo in the early days of the Web or a Web page and actually it's still true today when you actually look at this what they called the source code of the Web page a Web page is composed of a couple of different things HTML\nWhich stands for high protects markup language is the kind of the fundamental the route language of a website and it's it's markup language which means that it's very simple it says this text should be bold this text should be a tell us size this tech should be big\nThis is an image this image should linked to this when you click on this text you should go to this Web page that kind of thing that's HTML [noise]\nAh yes CSS was added later it stands for cascading style sheets and the idea was you could encapsulate information credit for it in a way it's like a macro language you could say whenever I use this HTML tag what I mean is this ... this type size this kind of thing\nAnd see us that's been used it increasingly to style pages the whole idea nowadays a website as you want to separate the contents of the website from the display from the layout of the website and the early days we pushed it altogether you'd have\nYou know HTML tags followed by text followed by more tags and you could actually do that in the text editor we've gone way beyond that so modern websites almost always have a data back in which has the text the images the contents of the site\nAnd then information about how to display that which will include three different kinds of things HTML is still there\nAre CSS the style sheets still there and then the third and nowadays most important part is job a script almost all Web pages today use of programming language called job a script to do the fancier things animations sliding menus hidden things\nAre a lot of that is done in job a script\nNow in order to so really if you say what language should I learn to do Web design it's those three HTML CSS those are the fundamental things you need to know those\nAnd then job a script is the ... is a true programming language\nThat all Web browsers understand the job of script typically stored on the server as his the HTML CSS and the data and by the way the data's usually started a data base right that things like the text the links the images those are stored in a database so you need to understand databases a little bit\nAnd if you want to get into Web design a day you're probably going to be learning\nSomething called frameworks these our Web frameworks that help you design a interactive pages the most one of the most popular widely used ... came from Facebook it's called react that's a job a script framework so you'll be doing job a script but you'll be using libraries from react\nTwitter has its own a Google has its own\nAnd there are many languages you can use in fact you know for instance when I write Web pages I generally don't write directly in job a script because\nFor years job a script was a nightmare languages actually settled down quite a bit but for years it was just awful\nAnd so I Will use a tool that will then it'd be interpreted as a job a script something like closure you could do that with goer python variety of other languages and then you don't have to write and java scripts but if you but you need to understand those fundamental technology so if you and your spare time you'd like to say yeah I think it would be by the way a great skill\nUh there's there's kind of three groups of things you need to do one is that programming thing job a script CSS HTML you need to understand those the other is the database you need to understand database design how you call databases how you interact with databases 'cause that's where the content is stored\nAnd the third part and often these are different people doing this but if you really if you want to do a Web design if you want to become a Web designer and I have a little shop you know people hire you the third part is designed you need to learn design you need to learn how to make a Web page look good had to make it usable I mean design includes not only\nHow it looks but how people use it and we spent a court I'll give you an example here we spend a quarter of a million dollars for my pod cast website which you can go look at AT T W. I. T. dot TV\nThe company that designed this is in Austin they're called for kitchens they had a designer was a graphic specialist he helped choose the ... designed the logos the lay out things like that they had a programmer actually they had three or four programmers who did the job of script and the CSS\nThey have we have a database that is a back and written in a in a totally different content management system you're going to hear this term a lot too and Web design C. M. S. called triple word presses a C. M. S.
