{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "Upgrades and guns that you already know in like\nAnd they're going to be even better I'm I'm trying to be careful here because we don't we're spill the beans we we get a chance to play with a lot of these these ... have the time I'm One of them I really got huge\nWe had a ball with a shot some video I think you're just going to enjoy the heck out of the question is Hi this is kind of the question\nBeing near new gun do any of us do any of us really need a new gun thank goodness need is really not a factor for us\nUm yeah I've got ... and I have forty five forties it can be said what are you what do you need to send me out of four I'll fortunately I don't think I absolutely need\nOne but if you're really into it gets not difficult at all to find a gap an opening however\nInfant testimony ... small it might be oh well that would fit right between this and that\nAnd I don't have anything that fits this gap that I have just cruise [laughter] yeah I Know and look we we have to\nSelf enable whenever we can't find a buddy a friend who will help us enable All right so that's something we have to do I I'm looking at a some news reports here one of the alerts that I have set up as for who invasions\nAnd look at it went out of Dallas [noise] man knocks on the door women opens the door man and woman Russia's in and they do horrible things to this woman sooner money attacker Salter get the PIN number from her cards run around town steal money\nWhich the core baseline of that and it's just I Want you to incorporate this into your lessons for your family your kids your wife your sons or daughters she opened the door well somebody was not going to the door to my room ... how about your news over I don't care\nDon't open the door if you don't know who's on the other you here's the deal basically do not open the door to find out who's there that's backwards find out who's there before you open the door always middle today oh estimate of the day I don't get blocked that you're damned you're damn fools\nFeels that you keep doors locked that's where a lot of these phone was agents have kidney ...\nHopefully the doors you find out who's ... find out who's there before you will the new health care if you put out a bleak care welfare for the whole or whatever it is if you don't know who's out there do you judge Joe worth settlers of your family [noise]\nMy shave them I have [noise]\nDamn three point eight compact Springfield Armor yeah\n[noise] that gives you a he could fix all done or just call Tom tall guy that just gives you a obviously a lot of things going on in the news\nWill come back on that later on the show I Want to talk a bit more about judge Kavanaugh and some specifics of the cases that are very likely to work their way to the Supreme Court than where we are with that what was she he could mean\nThe wild card and just the courses that we don't know what chief justice Roberts is going to do he has been considered\nHome the conservative side but there are some who say maybe he could end up being the swing vote he may be well he may want that role of being the decider we'll see we'll find out about that like to mix with us out of Texas hey Mick you're on TALK what's up [noise]\nYes Hi where are your questions I Wonder how the Marlin three thirty six\nYear thirty six four portrait deer hunt right over there to hang on to extract critter [noise] gun and then all showed the uh now I'm Wondering if you actually have yet to be called cobra that they're they just came out with it they're going to make a hike on um\nI don't think there's any thought of doing a python\nThey throw away the way the drawings they threw away the gym bags they throw away the machinery for making the python you know Thirty years ago and every once in a while they'll make noises about maybe we could do that again\nOr if they do it won't be the same guy and it'll be something different and looked like we all python but it won't be the same but I don't think so uh so now let me ask you you mentioned I I'm more than three thirty six thirty or six\nYeah I think that it might be a trio wait one I'm looking at is the one at Walmart and\n... are you sure it's not chamber for the thirty thirty\nTwo thirty three year right after ... you are totally correct yeah\n'cause I was going to say if that came out in the thirty six I missed that one\n[laughter] sorry about that you're totally correct okay All right so what's the question about that\nIs that a good value to it not just for deer hunting with my boy or a ... a but also to hang on to for critters said other you [noise]\nOkay uh this is where it gets a little tricky I won't give you a quick history okay a Marlins I always made really good guns or they were purchased the company was purchased some decade ago by Remington who move the company and there are a lot of people who say the guns were never as good after that\nUh I don't know if that's true but I have a lot of reports of that\nIf it were me right now I [noise] I like old ... some day I Would be I Would consider looking for an older Marlon as opposed to a new one\nAnd I don't know how you feel about buying a used gun older gun versus brand new but it for me I'd be looking for an older one just 'cause I like him so much\nWhat would you do that\n[noise] um well obviously in a gun stores around the cell use guns you could poke around you could actually just color he didn't have to drive cholera under areas hey do you have any ah older Marlene ... thirty thirties\nNow there's also a couple or three Web sites that are very well known and very well respected are probably the biggest of them is called gun broker\nGun broker dot com\nAnd you can find guns there and you can buy them and what they do is they ship them to your local gun store and then you do the background check their and usually have like a three day approval period if you don't like it you can return it but you check that out with the people there who you're buying from but you could check gun broker dot com\nOr however if you go in the store you like to look to the new Marlon there's nothing wrong with that just by it and get you know I think it's going to be fine I Love them I Would offer if you are not aware there's one or the company at least one of the country making really nice lover actually just repeating arms\nAnd they make very nice liver actually now a major us she might check out him repeating oranges well compare all\nOf those and make your calls you're not going to go wrong\nCivil ever actually thirty thirty something doesn't last forever so I Wish you luck with if you're going to have to pay when we come back to talk about a new book ... gun rights to the United states forces me to a huge today [noise]\nAt the intricately tides patriotism in America and I think that a modern historians often purposely actually ignore that fact\nNow why would they do that\n[laughter] because they want to bank you know they want more gun control and to do that you have to sort of push this myth that ... that the rights of the the right to bear arms as a collective right you know for people in militias and things like that and not something for the individual such do that you have to\nHave to basically revised or throughout the history of the gun in America which was a an individual right from the beginning reason they didn't talk about it all the time was because it was like\nSuch a nonstarter it was like breathing the air or something like you know we're going to church you know people on them and had them and no one really question that right until probably the Nineteen thirties\nIt's interesting you put it that way because it's your right way back the idea of you have a gun you have a gun for self protection for providing food for protecting your family\nThat was trying to explain that to someone would be like saying we're here let me explain to you that we need to breathe like everybody would go ... or yeah why are we even talking about\nI mean we wouldn't even and people on the sort of outskirts of society for instance I mean they wouldn't be able to survive without guns would have been impossible for them and [noise]\nUm you know I mean I you know the idea that that some government person would calm or the state would come and say you have to ask for permission to defend yourself\nIs the antithesis of what the whole constitution is about in many ways I think how people treat the second amendment tells you a lot about how they think about freedom in general and that's why it's so important and that's why it's the first freedom\nWhat's interesting you say that I liked that one about how people treat the second amendment tells you what they think about freedom\nI find in the discussions we have a lot of people in America who and I put it in my armchair psychologist role here\nI think maybe they know that they are not protecting themselves in their family they're not doing everything they should do\nAnd the fact that I Am and others are stands in stark evidence in contrast to what they're doing and if they can make sure that we're not taking care of ourselves than they do have to feel bad about not taking care of themselves and their family is that is that going too far\n[noise] I I think that that's that's definitely the case with some people I think that's definitely part of it I think the other part of it is that a lot of those people that you're mentioning and others um\nIt was believed justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation will help GOP candidates in November\nAcross the board and house and Senate races or thing now in that generic ballot has narrowed it was that ... that\nRun around me McDaniel tells Fox News Sunday Kavanaugh's confirmation will help Republican candidates in the Senate races and hurt house candidates in swing districts and the Kavanaugh hearing just highlighted how important this election is for them\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the confirmation of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh is his proudest moment as a senator Kentucky Republican said he believes the most important thing to send it is involved in is\nLifetime appointments to the court Senator McConnell refused to rule out pushing through another Supreme Court nomination and Trump's final\nYear of his term if a vacancy arose beam you Tio NBC News radio\nAnd I saw the envoys list\nPrice dealer probably still be happier

print falling in line pay overtime [noise]\nHigher up and down the train or something\n[laughter] let me ask you a question did he ever bother you again\nNot that aren't car\nNo I wouldn't think so thank you so much for your call Joe I think you're right on point there Roberts on four out of all curse California hey Robert or severe from California\nTo here I'm On the right side of the state anyway I Want to congratulate you though\nOn the coming around about the Democrats I remember hearing you and I watched your uh what's your growth and I have a sister who's a Democrat and she's pretty radical too and and I've seen through it for ever it's like the Democrats the Democrat who supports the second amendment I Can't think of and again you\nKnow the ... you get something to give you a little bit of Joe Manchin has probably as close as we get and you never know there but yeah but you know my whole thing harbor bounce off of you is there probably are still\nDemocrats that I could agree with on some things little grass I'm Talking about elected politicians now the problem is though every elected politicians you put in who's a Democrat\nIt reinforces the power of the below sea Feinstein a barber you know the whole ... ball if you will of the ultra left is so that even if you say well this is a good Democrat a vote for that person is actually a vote for policy and Feinstein\nAnd they're all from California and ... were were towards Venezuela [laughter]\nYeah exactly well I I appreciate the call and yeah I I don't like that this is where we are I Wish we had\nA [noise] a system where you could say let's just choose the right person regardless of party but that's just not the way it is and to do that to vote honestly if you're a person who supports gun rights\nYou can't you dug sorry you just can't\nVote for Democrats even if that person individually he's okay on gun rights\nThat person helps below sea and Feinstein by simply by being there and being a vote beat a person on the Democratic side and gets them control of Congress and they get to decide who heads up the committee's they get to decide which laws get our bills get brought up for vote\nAnd they get to decide who is going to be confirmed for Supreme Court justice as I said every single week leading up to the two thousand sixty election\nThis election was not about Hillary Clinton and it was not about Donald Trump it was about the United States Supreme court\nWe now see that coming to pass imagine if you will\nIf Hillary Clinton was president just just\nProcess that for a second let's say a Eric's on the line one out of Olympia, Washington Eric Washington state because you're in the middle of it there aren't you\nOh boy yeah no idea yeah it's unbelievable [laughter]\nWhat was your take is you're watching these hearings\nRecoiled in horror I really got a good glimpse of what these people are capable of their color Kerry ends at heart [laughter] they'll stop at nothing again and keep power and they're the same type of people who destroyed Venezuela\nFor that reason I Will never allow them to take like that you cannot\nDisarm yourself in the face of people like this\nLet me ask you a question I might put you on the spot okay guess nobody knows who you are really when you say I Will never let them take your guns what does that mean\n[laughter] well that means if it ever comes down to the point where they're collecting guns it's time to use your guts\nAnd I think that's what it means for millions of people appreciate the call thank you sir yeah I Love the me myself I said oh let's see there's three hundred million gun or a hundred million gun owners we have three hundred million guns and we have a trillion rounds of ammunition\nGreat so I go back to a vote for any Democrat is the vote for policy and Feinstein\nBut it's also a vote I for a an anti gun jurists tarnished bringing court\nAbsolutely because the vote that you just place for ... for Feinstein and below sea\nMeans that they get to choose the jurors they want on the Supreme Court today all goes back to any Democrat who gets elected is a a piece of power\nFor the Democratic leadership where whether it's are posing Gorsuch Kavanaugh or supporting Kagan as sort of my or or all the rest of it it's an excellent point down appreciate that redo your right and yeah I Know\nI was coming to it and I get it [noise]\nDon't like the way it is but you know what something is not the way it is just foolish she's tried this mature kid is counterproductive in this case that we have to figure this out and say okay\nThis is real simple my ideal is no Democrat\nNever\nDamn three point eight count that\nNeed a home technical thing that's by is here to help them starting with

...\n[noise] I'm about to go and get you and your line on Jim's with us out of Nebraska hey Jim you're on TALK what's up\n[noise] yes [noise] a judge Kavanaugh uh I'm Glad that he was confirmed ... um I could not\nListen to a Mrs Ford I just couldn't I couldn't I couldn't listen to her couldn't stand her voice uh I knew she was a liar but Mr\nKevin I have reservations on him or he is a person is from the swamp he spent his whole life in Washington DC I'm afraid he's going to be more of a Justice Roberts and a a one of the\nConservative judges the more Roberts than Scalia\nOh yes by far by far and and that's that's my fear [noise] well\nAnd I understand given the background let me throw this actually though I'm looking at what a judge Kavanaugh wrote two thousand eleven\nAnd a case where he actually descended on with the district court\nThe D.C court he said that quoted would strain logic in common sense\nThat the second amendment would allow semi automatic hand guns but not semi automatic rifles which has not traditionally been banned in common used today\nAnd us are protected under Heller his point was there these assault weapons so called assault weapons bans they don't ban semi automatic here in guns he says I'm Sorry that does not stand that doesn't make any sense at all\nAnd Heller says anything in common used cannot be banned and so we actually talked about that during the the hearings as well\nThat speaks pretty well for him from where I ...\nI I just I just don't like his association with Bush is it's\nA nice I I don't disagree with you there because ...\nI voted for both them and I voted against the Democrat was I Would not have voted for either one of them had there been some a conservative choice\nYou know I I I agree I didn't look here's Ronald Reagan was not a friend of gun owners\nMine regarding the way back there people are all wrong Greg Milner he did not do us any favors does get better than he just happened to be better than the alternative bushes we're not friends to gun owners they were just better than the alternative\nIn this case yeah he served under Bush should work there I I Am more enthusiastic perhaps and maybe a little bit less cautious than you are in this one\nI now understand I I don't think you get an absolute rabid you know Second Amendment person in any of these folks\nHaving said that his history a decisions is really good really strong in Sacramento but I I think we're going to be OK\nJustice Thomas is probably in my opinion a most gun friendly other justices what do you think\nI agree completely I think you're only my he has several times invited to\nA cases to come we wish we could get some of these and then when they were turning them down he would write you know it looks like we're we're turning the second amendment into a second class a law or our men that are white and also saying that you know we're basically turn our backs on ... so Thomas has been strong\nI think you're going to find that uh the Kevin Thomas connections going to be strong as well\n[laughter] that's right you know we we deliberately when with products that people are familiar with I'm In this case you know read outside of open or close right outside for handgun or a shotgun or an Amish are rifle um it is not a new invention from us I'm like a laser sites have been over time but\nWhat what we're good at is making things at work or make\nIs that have been thought through from an engineering standpoint um and also from a quality standpoint um if you're putting that on your firearm dislike are laser lights for personal defense you're really needs to work when you want it to so we took that same approach to the engineering and the acquisition of these products as well so they\nThey're not um they're not anything different in terms of quality that you would expect from ...\nWell that's interesting that's kind of burying the lead as we say because to say well you know they're not different from what you expect from us except that what you expect from criminal trace is the very best you guys have always been I mean you're so top of mind when somebody thinks laser site on weapon amount of laser\nThey say ... price because\nYou're ... your category\nSo you're\nThere's a real responsibility I mean you're the guy the top and you got to be looked at this and thinking you know one we are now asking the firearms market to trust us in a new area because you have an enormous bank of trust there\nAnd that's going to be a daunting when you're thinking about bringing out new products\nYeah it's a big responsibility and one that we take seriously and as you say is the market leader and really the innovator in laser sites um we went out at at took our time a way that it with the\nThe idea that our customer who trusts us for what they notice for today is going to trust you know we hope is going to trust us for something that they don't know as for today but that\nThat goodwill that we've built up over all these years and the expectation of quality of customer service you know I think our customer services as good as any ones in the industry um if anyone ever has a problem with our products\nOr thinks they have a you know any issue with our products we're here to stand behind it all of those things\nAre being brought to bear on the on the opportunity for the new products for example a rifle scopes a lifetime warranty\nOn those are our electronic sites that same warranty as our laser sites you know three years but really if you have an issue with it and and you know it's a product problem just like we do all the way through will will find a way to take care of your show\nIt was a a big responsibility for us but you know is what we do every day so um we didn't really need to change our our philosophy we just need to focus it on a new set of products\nDid you were able to tap in because I mean I've been to your place there and you've got some really really smart folks there were you able to tap into that brain trust on what to include and what to do with these robots\n[laughter] yeah you know we were fortunate in like a lot of companies in the industry where some of our engineers most of them and a lot of the other product people in particular and customer support people their users their power users of our products um you know Gary killings worth and different people who have been on the show\nFrom time to time um he's actually a gun site right now are putting the products through the paces so\nWe have that that brain trust of engineers and product people in customer service people who also listen to the customer uh we we you know it isn't it isn't always what we thanks very much for the customer wants\nI'm an over the years we've heard when we've asked you know what what else might you consider from crimes and trace and products that were coming out with work we're always on the top of the list and um you know now is the right time with\nA new ownership and and really just a a kind of a new chapter for the business to go after those markets\nWere teaching it also comes an interesting time of course you got products here for three gun which is usually pop your uh obviously for rifles but I Am seeing real the increase of serious increase in people who are willing to put a red that site\nOn their self defense carry customers are you seeing that are you hearing that\n[noise] you know we see more and more of that um it's it's interesting to see different manufacturers glock and others who are is our parent companies are the key from Smith in Washington and come comes out\nWith a slight that's already a cut for these kinds of optics so\nYou know it's something that they are the consumer is asking for it used to be a customer's Asian and sometimes not a very simple\nCustomers Asian but now as you say more and more people want that I'm not just for the three gone in and the other guys who are helping using these for years but for concealed carry product a laser sites are great not everybody may want to lose your site and so these are as a ... or cited in low light but they're they're frankly a little better during daylight\nYeah exactly so All right so ah are you calling this anything special a different name or they just call cribs and trace read outside\nYou know so they're they're branded crimson trace a wave after you know almost twenty five years of using the same brand in the same logo on it made sense to upgrade an update our logo so you'll see a slightly it's the same name you know the tea\nOr his are kind of marker brand park but we've we've changed a little bit updated it\nAnd then also added three ... three focus categories kind of sub categories protection tactical and sport\nUm that that moved to send expands us into those other markets so a today at least all the products are ... are coming out in the crimson traced brand um we we felt like you know the boundaries of the brand can extend to at least he's proud of categories\nWho knows in the future you know what that may look like 'em but these are very much you know crimson trace products with again everything that a customer would expect from concentration\nAnd ... with the completely own said but more to come\n[noise] I Would say that's right that's right [laughter]\nWell and congratulations it is and it's a really cool chronic lodge a whole line of products from crimson trace and obviously a\nBrazilians of people have your products on their guns already so they're going to want to take a look at this and maybe incorporate into their their packages [noise] well\nWe certainly hope so uh the products will be starting to flow in the market come November and into December uh so you know we're talking about um first in this case and then start delivering them in a in a month or so but yeah I'd I Would invite the customers you know and even those who who may not to take a look I think there'll be pleased with what they said and I think you again for a let me have a chance to talk about\nYour bed and then all the information is right there on the Web that criminal
