unless you get one with a cellular ... minutes to sail your shift as a single chip that has both radios for GPS and LT and so that's the problem precisely is that the ... the er I pat I'm In fact I'm kind of impressed and the cat get kind of figure out where you are\nIt's doing that by triangulating why fi access points and if you get out in the country where there's no wife I won't know where you are\nA little slow sometimes you miss the terms before you really yeah\nThat's you know we're really in your phone is reliable 'cause it's using GPS for a pet is not okay\nIt does it does do location is actually clever a trick that ah ah apple uses Google used it was a company called sky hook that pioneered this they drove a lot of cars around with GPS as\nI said I noticed when I was Fifteen feet from wife I access point a twelve feet from access point B and a hundred feet from Asheville point see I'm here\nIn a mate literally made a map\nTriangulating all the wife fi and almost everywhere in the country and then selling that to Google and apple apple and Google not do that themselves with their own cars but uh that's a very clever technology but it's not perfect obviously\nInteresting so if I bought on I didn't have the GPS and a wife or ... you wouldn't\nBe your trick is your next I pat and good news apples probably coming out with I passed this month for a get one within LTV chip then you don't have to I mean you're still gonna have to pay for it out to eat connection that's a pain for us uh but you'll have that way you won't have to Paris to the phone for the data and you'll have GPS will be accurate\nOkay sounds like a solution I thought maybe I was missing something or you're you're it was\nYeah too bad it's just the way it is so you know the problem and the reason is Israel is right ...\nThanks for the call is very simple added that to chip that apple puts in\nProbably was from Qualcomm nowadays I guess his friend tell a is a dual purpose chip is GPS and Internet or and so they just don't they just don't put that and now they're gonna they're gonna release I'm almost certain lots of evidence that they're going to release\nOn on and on the Mac or rather the iPhone I have some very strong choices like hey lied or which I really like um obscure camera obscura on Android let me look what I got out here because uh I don't think they're quite as many really nice choices are out there a cortex\nIs the one that I probably most often go to instead of the built in cameras solution or it allows you to do some\nInteresting a processing\nWho's including remove motion blur enhanced shadows things like that\nThat would be amazing emotional or especially yeah because it's very easy and a lot and they're always looking [laughter]\nYeah exactly and and uh what camera phones will do without telling you is a is a ... they'll in order to gather more light\nThey'll open it up or they'll slow down the shutter speed and you won't even know you're going to get blurry pictures until you look at him and go wait a minute those are all blurry yeah they don't really warn you so\nCortex is a good one I'm actually I'm a I'm going to ask the a chat room or if they have any camera recommendations for Android I actually use the or on the Samsung I now I replaced my ass nine with another nine actually use the Samsung up what is it too complicated to many widgets is that what bothers you\nYeah they're just like too much stuff there I just want something that will take the cells photos without the having the constant motion blur and if I take a photo outside it doesn't and it ... it says a little bit too dark all actually use the flash automatically inside turn it off it says\nThat I get a dark stone outlets horrible yeah so that's the reason I watch that China will listen you know you it'll use the light that's there um\nAnd uh you know we'll get rid of the ... that's the biggest ... lotion or that's what we'll\nTry try that then uh cortex and then another one that I've used for years and I haven't tried lately has a camera F the five it has a lot of\nManual controls they may not be you know they do have a light version you can try for free it may be a little bit more um fussy\nThen you want if you don't want fussing is I did this go is still around VS CEO ... for a long time was the best camera out there I get another one I haven't used and while I pretty much stick to\nThe Samsung camera or or on the pixel from the Google Camera and then and then cortex if I knew\n... yeah cortex Kim yeah awesome thank you somehow there there's a couple of good choices for you and if we anybody has a suggestion\nI'd love to hear from you know you can either call eighty eight eighty eight ethically although we're in the waning moments of the show so you might want to go to the website tech guy labs dot com and you can leave your suggestion in a in the comments\nFrom lots of lots of good listeners out there no a lot of stuff I think if the five I Would try um I I I I Would certainly try obscure but I I haven't been less motivated to try third party camera apps lately because I think they just do a great job with the Samsung up\nMy only complaint is is that there's way too much stuff in it\n[laughter] there's lots of filters and you know beauty filters things for ... you know selfies and stuff that I just I just don't you just don't use a show that they brought you out by our friends that remote PC remote access is maybe something you never thought about but I can bet you there's times you wish you had it\nMaybe you left to file

this before\nI'll never\nVote for a Democrat\nIf you are a good Democrat you need to change party\nThere it is because you're a leadership is despicable\nWilling to destroy people to get in ... retain power\nWilling to smear willing to make up stories willing to promote stories willing to lie willing to\nCheat\nI Will never for school board for dog catcher for city council for any level vote for another Democrat because those people end up going to Congress and helped bring\nThe ... the Schumer's the Feinstein's up their\nRetain power and do what they do I know you're thinking well Tom took you a long time I get it I understand I just didn't want to go there and and if you are a good if you're a politician or if you're a political appointee or whatever\nAnd you're a Democrat and you're embarrassed by what they did you certainly should be\nChanged parties to easy to do it\nNow the good news is we are up Brett Kavanaugh\nSupposedly that's a five four majority are not so fast Charlie Brown and it's a four four plus question mark Warner yes\nThere is a very good possibility that chief justice Roberts will slide over and take the role of Kennedy as the swing vote don't count your votes your decisions before they come in\n[noise] however and I know a lot of us have already gotten ahead of ourselves on this\nWhy do you\nWhat if we can hold the Senate and the terms and what if Donald Trump gets an opportunity to nominate another Supreme Court justice\nThen we really are set up fascinating fantastic so what's going to mean for gun rights while we talk about that in a ... a there are a number of cases headed to the Supreme Court there were some that they've turned down because they basically been turning down cases gun cases\nIt takes four votes to accept the case but just thinking as we don't know for sure what happens inside the Supreme Court thinking is they've turned down some of these gun cases even though they probably had the four votes to accept it because they knew they didn't have the five votes that would take to win\nAnd rather than say well that's reinforced a Supreme Court precedent\nThat your gun rights should be diminished where does not going to take those cases until we know\nWe can decide correctly\nAnd so the Heller decision for ten years ago his sat\nAnd sat and sat in a big\nIn because the Supreme Court won't uphold the lower court

us sometimes talk or these lectures or gun owners\nAbsolutely 'cause you know I talked to said yeah you know I really need to do that but [noise] I'm not sure where to vote or I'm not sure where my

where you can type in you know where you live and it will tell you a candidate at where they stand on the gun and and just like it was a few years ago in the presidential election\nThis midterm election it's got to be crucial as to what stands for you know who's going to get protecting our rights and what we can expect the next couple of years so when it comes to fires policy in America\nIt's interesting you say because it's the finest policy I'm not sure people say well you know I Know yeah we want to win\nAnd I want to stop and say well let me explain to you what this means because right now the Republicans control the house and the Senate and the White House\nWhen the Democrats get control of the house for instance that can control what bills are introduced that can control what bills are voted on if the Democrats control the Senate of course they get control of the confirmation process on Supreme Court justices since we're just seeing that battle there\nAnd of course the Democrats also announced that if you control the house are going to try to impeach a President Trump and also they're going to try to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh chief justice now Supreme Court\nThey can only do those things if they are in the majority of each else am I right\nYou're absolutely right about that song so like we have control the house and Senate\nAre those are for most politicians from our elected leaders are or you know listening to their gun owners are voting for them then they're going to make sure that these are the best occasionally pointless hearings\nAre bonding down the Congress and getting a court in a policy issues ... and pushing back the ones that are truly going to be detrimental to us on our ability to exercise our second that\nYou know and are\nJust so people understand what we're talking we're talking about the everybody says well we need a national reciprocity\nYou're not going to get that with Democrats in control of the house or the ... you know we want a the hearing Protection Act you're not going to get that where's the Democrat Party in charge of the house and Senate not going to have some physical\nLogically impossible to get those what you are going to get a lot of efforts and more restrictive gun control laws which means stripping away or infringing on your rights\nYou're absolutely right um but I'm also a national character she was introduced in the last Congress but still pending out there the Protection Act as a bail is still out there\nUh in in a joy so overwhelming support but because of the difficulty in the math because it only takes one senator filibuster goes builds up we haven't been able to or those two issues for which we are crucial issues to our soldiers say they want to see these things passed away last year in the OJ exercise their right\nWithout any kind of impediment so even when we're talking about having control these houses are still ... that we have a majority to be able to do this we eat chicken ... senators to filibuster occurs to be able to see is that right now we have a razor thin margin ...\nSo we really need to make sure that your voters out there are educated as to why they're kind of stand they know where there's issues are and they find a gumbo\nOther work [noise] you know market cursed me also one of the things or incest F works on a lot of things that people
