{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "This is a very unique program now there are a couple of other states that have been talking to us about may be creating something like I told him to ethics so we'll see but in terms of how unique this program as we have to mention Robin Williams who really was around in the beginning\nUm in two thousand and one well actually the conversations in the late Nineteen nineties\nA wet that led to the first class of two thousand one Robert was the main facilitate all five ...\nFor a number of years he only really retire like two years ago for her um where are these two ladies bath we lock and recently signed have taken over as the main facilitators they have the you know we've had the Wilson as a part time facilitates we've had landed a scientist as well but Rob\nReally has given um I Do a lot of its flavor and created this unique program um and he he's just he's how George a whole lot in fact the Georgia conservancy gave him the highest award I'm On the ... uh but you could benefit a couple\nA couple of weeks ago so we were very lucky and blessed I fail to have Rob be so involved in the program for so many is still really appreciate all of his efforts so I'm going to just\nAdd to that I think one of the things that makes this unique and and we've set it a couple of times is that this is an experiential program\nBut I think what makes it unique with the Robin Williams flare is the ability to be ... so for people to kind of check\nTheir egos at the door to be able to listen not just here but actually listen to each other to be able to understand and put yourself in the shoes of others either from their background or where the state of where they are in the state or what they're dealing with in terms of their company they're a nonprofit their\nGovernment and I think that is what actually makes this program so amazing\nWell we'll said um [noise] er during the ... coming arduous coming up\n[noise] absolutely um so we are working with the Georgia Alabama water resources in economics conference that is coming up a later this month October twenty third\nAnd I have a date next weekend with Stacy I'm with sat at a to be at at re day just on the radio that there and be um it is focused on bringing the\nThe legacy of re Anderson I'm to the state of Georgia and so there's going to be us with our two thousand um neighbors and friends\nAnd so we hope you'll you'll meet us there ... and that's next Sunday the fourteenth next Monday the fourteenth ... and then obviously you know we are also been involved in different places different parts around um the state around ... which is the Georgia outdoor stewardship act\nSo that is a man that one I'm coming up on the um the ballot coming up in early November\nTalk about how important that is a ... for people to really do vote ... wanted to do\nThat and why why so\nConservation and stewardship of our land is really important is it one of the biggest economic drivers to Georgia into way Georgia environmental stewardship act allows for is allows for money to be allocated to conservation and to land acquisition and the conservation of that land\nUm over the next few years um but it kinda gives a a stable income source for conservation of Georgia and that will allow us to continue to drive business to drive tourism to drive conservation of a force land and and uh some of our other pressures natural resources scratch while phone\nBill yes I Am at one yes definitely or or will you guys going to be rated I Can't wait to see you there because it is it is going to be Americans are always a spin yeah is there any other place where you guys are going to be speaking or where people can get you shake your head you know get involved would you do\nWell you know we this is kind of new jobs so with having five hundred alumni\nAnd wanting to make sure that we keep the diversity there and have a balance class if you will ever you\nThis sort of outreach has kind of new for us so we've not been on radio shows before um we have not been to the just and then she summit in past years but we did have if you want to call it a boost they a couple of weeks ago so there's going to be more of that and um we'll look out for opportunities but this is kind of a new era ...\nYeah I think the only thing that we have consistently done over the last few years as we've always attended a the Georgia environmental conference which is typically in August down along the coast somewhere um and we always not only having a a either a ... and you know a panel but we always have an alumni event\nAt at the George ... conferences well sure yeah engaging alumni again especially not that we have five hundred voices they they want they want certain things from from the program after we finished the class and so that's something that we're exploring as well\nAlso or a man this is this is the very informative uh if anybody did not know what ... is a very we do know so\nAh are up for murder with some of the members are that have come through the eyes you'll\nClash and there's a lot a lot of great people as you guys have been talking about and I appreciate you mentioning that I could possibly be involved with these these were all you definitely should I Do know for me but in in the rye\nOr a dirty word for the last the last minute of ... for for ... I mean what can we expect to see from our bureau in the future\nWell I'm One more thing that we said that we will try to work on the outreach right um so like today's show like reading we haven't been reading in the past so we want to continue doing more outreach we also want to um improve like I said on north Georgia and our presence there I'm an attracting more minority applications\nAnd we're also hoping to secure some funding to do some strategic planning and so to answer your question what to expect from Idaho hopefully the strategic planning process will give us a little bit more direction and to the future\nUm but you know like Andrea mentioned we are a nonprofit and so we accept donations you can go to our website ... dot ORG with one L\nAnd um you can give a donation Dale or if you're a corporation we also accept sponsorships from one of ... and any of our five sessions\nOn the tuition that all students pay we should point out is only is less than half of what it really costs are on the program so we definitely accept gifts and we hope to end this new era I'm do some strategic planning and see exactly where the organization is going to be doing in the future but we definitely have a strong past and\nI Know Andrea and I both very proud to be a lump of this program and we look I'll look forward to the new classes that are coming\nWell lose his eyes is are you guys are welcome any time or the ... for him to talk about the great things that you're doing and how you guys are helping the state of Georgia\nAnd about the mortgage and but you know we're just chime in obviously I got a question this week that I thought just was really interesting and um it it it got me thinking and I'm like well maybe maybe our listeners are thinking this\nAnd or am I just gonna get sold in this process for something I'm not ready for it I think a lot of first time buyers think about that right like and they don't pick up the phone or they don't send email because they think they're going to get quote unquote sold and so I was talking to somebody and they said well when\nDo you ever tell somebody know did you ever tell somebody you're not ready to buy a house right and I was like well yes um and the the typical side of that is you don't qualify right there are certain qualifications you have to meet on the mortgage side that you you don't qualify and that that kind of easy ride it\nYou know I'm Sorry about your credit score isn't where it needs to be right or your income doesn't qualify or your assets don't qualify that's kind of the basic\nWell you know is it sometimes that type of employment like and not for long enough period of time yeah yeah ... ... and ... it's a good question 'cause my second part of that answer was it's usually not a no forever though we usually maybe a no for now and let's get you ready\nUm and then why writer or how do you get ready\nAnd there's also this over aligned component of oil rates are rising so if you're qualified now is it better to wait and get you know more qualified better you know read it those kinds of things or you just going to be treading water because by the time you do that rates have risen a little bit of a target keeps me then yeah you just offset your gain right so\nYou know it's kind of just an interesting question and I said that you know in shall we say it a lot to on the show we can't give tax advice we can't be financial planners you can give legal advice but we can\nUm so you kind of have to you know watch out for that but most first Tom pot buyers don't have you know attacks guy at that point they might not have a financial planner so you really do have to help them\nAs best you can without kind of violating rules and laws that yeah you know you can't so\nUm when I was thinking about it I said well outside of the ... you know the the nose right and then it's the no for now but let's help you um you know the one we ... I used to talk to my clients about the most with because I think it does get looked past sometimes um\nAnd you know without going to technical you you run everybody through these massive underwriting engines that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac produce called ... and there's a big algorithm and you kind of put all the information in and spits out an answer kind of a yes\nIt it it's not a yes and nothing else it's a yes but we've got to see this documentation to support well yes we ... yeah with conditions um or if they know right from um you have this thing called ... you know whoever or for and that's really where they want the actual underwriter to make the decision and they're kind of cautious about it\nAnd it's over and we do some of those but not a ton right so we you know most companies out there really rely on these engines just to start the process\nUm and so and they're pretty well tuned machines at this point I mean they do a good job of looking at the credit they do\nA lot of times when we get 'em in if it says yes we agree and when it says no we oftentimes agree and we tried to help the customer ... you're talking about a lot of a highly objective criteria that you really use that are used for when you qualify for mortgage yeah yeah I mean it it it's pretty well pinpointed at this point and\nPeople say well why did it all crash you know ten years ago then right because those things were still asleep throughout the criteria window exactly we or they you know they landed are opened up the credit box to say okay well we used to ask for this and now we don't want to see it anymore\nAnd then you've got these you know the the the liar loans right the people at home where his stated that they made a hundred thousand a year\nBut yet they make twenty right in in without the documentation the engine can't tell you whether you're lying it's not a polygraph you know it's it's a it's an underwriting engine um but with all of that said and just this current landscape\nYou know my concern or or where I Try to God folks or talk to folks really is a is not about what you're putting in and in the exact at that point\nBut more of the what is right because um yes you qualify now and that's wonderful and we love to help people buy 'em but let's make sure you have reserves and I think that's the biggest one that that we try to think about and help the customer through because just because you can make the required downpayment say three percent or five percent or\nYou know there's some great downpayment assistant programs out there and all this kind of stuff\nThat's all wonderful but if if if you lost your job today after your clothes unfortunately and you know that's kind of stuff can happen\nUm do you have a reserve account that you can carry the mortgage and some other your cost a lot of the underwriting engines are are you in a kind of have that calculated in they want to see two or three months reserves you know a lot of times um and that's in that algorithm already\nBut I question it sometimes and or I say is it enough right and you know it's it can be a dog chasing its tail though too and so it's not an exact answer for everybody because well if I have to save up for six months of my monthly payment\nI'm I'm you know that's six months more I got to wait to qualify now and you know now pricing has gone up and now I've got to make more of a doubt ... you know so it's like a you feel like you're treading water too so\nIt's never when we say you know hey look we can get you approve but I don't agree you're buying this house right now right a bill you probably have to be careful saying that kind of thing to ride on the real estate's\nI absolutely am my discussions more subjective yeah than objective like yours or from the data yeah it's more a lifestyle thing does this fit your lifestyle yeah does this make sense for you right now yeah\nIt is you know when it comes to like the reserves and industry\nYou know if you're a nurse right now you can get a job anywhere anywhere in two seconds to get a raise and it's a it's a really hard profession so you know kudos edited out on her than Iran I agree with you know ... yeah exactly\nUm so maybe reserves are a little less impactful in your role because even if you something happened with your job you could walk in another hospital the next day um but if you're in an industry that's may you know\n... you know unemployment so big blanket it doesn't segment industries right so unemployment could be low but your industry might not be as hot and so\nYou know you just again to bill's point it's it's a subject of conversation rather just saying well you got too much reserve you qualified don't think about anything else right or it could just be for repairs happened I mean you know lo and behold\nYou know something happens with your house three months then it's not covered maybe in a warranty or something that you bought and you've got to deal with that and you know you don't want\nFor that so that's you know the long answer your question is yes we have to turn down just giving a knowledge of things to think about water may be [noise]\nWe'll continue the conversation will do is show when he goes back to the guys are listening to talk radio [noise] and the radio [noise]\nAs the [noise]\n[noise]\n\nTalk radio six forty build

talk radio for\nYour GST of the great conversation this morning with Bill golden ... metro city side\nAnd Sheryl as always uh we we kinda left in leading into this from from the break about statistics and really kind of\nGetting out the noise or when you start working with a client whether it be buying or selling um what are the what do you pull out first right like what are what numbers are you really focuses days on the market or where you where do you start the process within bill\nWell I mean it depends on whether it's by her seller but let's just say a seller and we're trying to price their house and you know they've read in the paper that you know the average days on the market or such and such or you know people are getting\nYou know Ninety five percent of their asking price and so they're coming at me with those statistics that they read\nAnd it's my job to drill that down which you know as a realtor I've got you know all the statistics and dad at my fingertips and I can show you that well the average days on the market in the metro area may be\nSixty two days in this particular neighborhood it's seven days so that makes a big difference and where the average list price to sale price is Ninety five percent metro\nIn this neighborhood it's a hundred percent yeah you know it it really does kind of statistics are really important in in educating people how you know what the real market is those those numbers look you know I'm old fashioned I read the newspaper every day the actual paper newspaper\nUm and I read the stories you know almost every day there's a there's a story about\nStatistics in real estate or the market's doing this to mark is doing that and you know they're great but they're just not that general and it it drilled down so far from there when you get to area specific neighborhood even specific streets within the neighborhood\nYeah that's that's a great point and and kind of what I was thinking when you were describing that one you know the the newspapers use these additives that always trip you know it's always funny right it's always\nHousing prices you know sky rocketing yup point nine percent or you know what I mean I you know but that's what sells ads I get it right\nFine feel free they feel free these days to predict not only not only to describe what's currently happening debt but to predict what's going to happen in the future which you\nKnow if you listen to some old school people from from media you know it's sort of frowned upon um but one of the reasons that they're willing to to you know pull out of crystal ball is because\nThere's so much news out there it's very rare\nThat anyone remembers when they were wrong and if they happen to be right they'll just to their own horn a little bit yeah so there's a lot of you know there's a lot of noise with all of that sort\nOf ... and let's face it you can form an opinion and get some statistic to back that up\nCorrect me if I yeah I can I can pull out of statistic for any random statement I'd like to make and and it can support it I use a spreadsheet by the way remember where you\nLive at tables I'm so\n... you know you're you're describing like neighborhoods in streets so you know if you're\nSelling in Virginia highlands as an example and Amsterdam's the dividing line between the schools right in the schools are wonderful but you know maybe that's a a price difference between what we can you get that\nYou know honed in absolute ... saying Andrew or San Antonio cells different than al ... and I mean they can pull up I can\nDrill down to specific streets ... specific school districts you know you have to pull out things like a house on a main street is not gonna sail for the same thing that\nThey'd row house on rose knocking to Zach right has\nIt and if you buy it you'll never be able to pull out of your driveway ever because I'm not lightly out [laughter] live down there for a decade I never let someone else or the\nDriveway but yeah we we have the ability to really drill that down and I think that really helpful I mean that's a good reason to hire a real estate agent because you know you just don't ... the average person doesn't have access to that type of specific\nKnowledge yeah and do you find that there's any whether it be neighborhoods are are kind of areas that you find that the the noise is a bigger gap and the reality meaning\nI Know what I'm Talking to somebody like Claire there's a big gap between what's real and what's not or is it you know fairly common anything kind of stand out",
