conversation with ... and I started off by asking him how the U.S is going to fare with beer prices [laughter]\nAnd who are the countries that are going to be affected by this the most I Know Arlen like I said could see triple a prices of beer but the other countries and where does the U.S fairness\nThe northern Europe is gets the biggest hit because they have to report that most barley to make the beer and\nThe U.S consumption drops in price goes up but not as much as other places because barley production starts moving north into Canada for there so we don't lose as much supply a barley is imported and exporting widely and that was the corporate as a model but you know it really helps in terms of price to have a stuffed nearby\nWhat's been the reaction from other groups or you know beer trade groups I Know the brewers association was one of them that said hey you know the does the app academic exercise don't believe all the hype nothing to lose sleep over and then they also say you know that farmers would be adapting as things that happened you know the shift\nBy the growing to other parts where they can still get good yields so what's been the reaction out of other people outside of the study\nYou summarize the beer industry is ... pretty nicely yeah they said were on top of this thing there was a drought in the Pacific northwest last year that affected probably production and so we're all aware of this and worrying about it and that's all nice but some of the people who look at sort of large scale farming say that you know these are changes are going to be happening on continent wide scale and\nThat is going to affect drops when you have drought and heat waves we can engineer\nFor things like drought resistance but that actually might change the nutrient profile with a barley which might change the taste of the beer\nOr you know it's what's in it and you can editor for drought resistance but hate resistance is a tough one and he is the thing that's going on with the time of climate change and that might change these very basic chemical reactions that are going on in our late ...\nEarly barley and so that's why you have to move it to harm it and you know you run out of north after a while and it becomes more expensive to do that sort of thing you're competing with other crops\nSo the people who study these things on ... agriculture economics basis or not as sanguine as the industry on the other hand you know people like beer and the industry has a pretty innovative one in some way so you know maybe they will get on top of it it just shows is not cheaper though than like not having to worry about it\nYeah I think it's just pretty funny how quickly this story went viral you know obviously climate change a lot of people are always attuned to that but you throw in beer at one of the authors of the study even said not sure what to make of the fact that in one day our paper on climate and beer has garnered considerably more attention than\nAny of their previous work on energy transition air pollution death anything other than that you know it's like this you know you're messing with my beer and you know everybody's interested in it right away Denver got a science reporter for buzzfeed news thank you very much for joining us thank you\n\n[laughter]\nAll this month of October I've been putting in little stories

villa they said it was about the size of a shopping mall if you can think about like that they found a body of the ten year old child who died more than Fifteen hundred years ago ... was lying on its side with its mouth open and stuffed inside was a limestone rock\nAbout the size of a big egg and like you said they believed that child\nDied as malaria\nSixty miles north of round and they said that the way that they buried this catalyst they ... they ... already dead they opened\nAn ounce for ... to the rock inside and then failed that extra spots with cement so that they can be sure that the Iraq wouldn't come out right and they were able to determine how old the kid was by looking at the teeth depression\nAnd that's how they know that the rock was put in after he was dead 'cause of those

thrush showcasing back out you're a show we're going to die and everybody's favorite topic property taxes\nThere but there's an all seriousness there's a lot going on right now that are buyers and you know this is you know the un sexy saw the business but that's what this shows about keeping it real and giving people information that they need to know not necessarily that just sounds great and\nYou know a lot of this is a good of you know there there is not major problems we don't want a freak people out but there's just different things that if they learn and could do a little different it's just going to help them out and it possibly answer some of their questions so\nPhone county what's what's going on\nCertainly as a Fulton County resident and closing attorney sitting at Fulton County it's been it's been interesting this year and I walk into my house at the end of the day and I hear taxes on the news and I have no idea whether it's\nLike national tax reform or Fulton County chaos that's actually making the news usually it's a combination of both so what happened earlier this year at the beginning of every year you get a notice of assessment for your property taxes and it is what the county thinks your property is valued at\nAnd gives you an anticipation and ability to file a tax appeal if you don't agree with how the county's assess the property\nWe have um we've had a good market the last few years we've had you know an increasing market it's one of the reasons that it's a seller's market the values of our properties have started to come up and I think quite honestly at a at a pretty healthy pace\nI'm you know so\nWhat happened was the assessments came out high and from my personal experience with it as a Fulton County homeowner it was a six figure job in my assessment in a single year but I Will also tell you that it really hasn't come up in the last\nTwo or three years and as somebody who's in the industry I'm not sure the assessment was unfair at the end of the day but there was an enormous outcry a amongst every one of the homeowners anyone related to the industry\nUh there were there were massive movements to appeal every single tax bill in the county which quite frankly terrified BSS are and what they decided to do in the middle of the year was to freeze the two thousand and sixteen assessment\nGo back to what the properties assessed in two thousand sixteen completely throw out the new two thousand Seventeen assessments and build based upon last year\nThat caused a delay and the tax bills the Fulton County tax bills are normally delinquent October fifteenth\nCity of Atlanta which half of Atlanta is in full and the other half is in the cab are usually paid in August by August fifteenth of each calendar year so those dates came and went and we didn't have tax bills yet\nUh at the end of October we were all notified that those tax bills and this is something that we were never really aware of but the counties have to submit those tax digest to the Georgia department of revenue for approval\nAnd what ... or said when they looked at it is you've increased commercial property taxes and you have frozen residential property taxes and that is disparate affects of residential and commercial property and it is illegal\nSo full and you cannot issues your tax bill\nThey scheduled a temporary tax bill hearing for November the third\nAt that hearing they did get approval to issue a temporary tax bill for two thousand Seventeen it is based upon those two thousand sixteen assessments and there is some plan to come out with a supplemental bill\nWhat people need to understand is a lot of what this tax money pays for is our schools\nSo Fulton County and city of Atlanta the actual cash flow that comes from these taxes are what pays for our kids' schools so as a homeowner and as a parent with a child in the Fulton County school system we receive notifications that they were furloughing staff\nThat they were canceling children's activities and that the teachers December and not just teachers but all the educational support staff all the employees of the Fulton County and city of Atlanta school systems would not get their December twentieth paycheck\nUntil December twenty ninth so we hope that they did not need it to buy their last minute Christmas gifts for their family\nOf four new trips they might have been taking during the Christmas holidays\nFor their meals for Christmas for all of those things\nAnd that's that's done there was no turning back at this point or\nWhen when a a tax bill is issued it
