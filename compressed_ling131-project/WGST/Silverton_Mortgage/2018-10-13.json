silver mortgage filling in for our fearless leader Josh I'm off at 'em and as always joined by Sheryl ... founding partner of sparks king watch and Reddick\nI'm also joined today by a couple of read Barnes finest we've got Scott Martin now managing partner red barn real see a real estate as well as Melissa clay new home sales specialist for red barn construction and we've been talking about ... states in Woodstock as well as some of the other projects that you guys have going on\nUm as a new construction portion of red barn\nSo we said that we get into a little bit of the financing options at least from you know the the mortgage perspective which I Do hear on the show do run into a lot of people coming to look at new construction that have questions about financing for the new construction\nWe do and you know with it being a little bit different with being new construction boutique builder the price point that were at you know we\nWould like to offer different programs for them so you know the construction to permanent construction loan I think a lot of buyers just don't know much about it they really need educated and I'm\nA little hand holding and and information from the loan officer in detail so that they understand exactly what they're getting into and what their options are so\nToday I wanted to really take advantage of having you kind of explained the construction to primer construction loan process to the buyers out there because a lot of them are just used a straight conventional clothes\nAnd they don't know anything about a sea to pee or construction month so I Would love for you Jerry ... explain that to the buyers out there\nYeah I mean at least you know I can speak to the construction of our program that we have it's silver and mortgage and I know that you've um partnered up with some of our loan officers Amy will come in and I'm Kerry powers out of the ... branch\n'em and I know they do a ton of these we can do 'em with as little as a ten percent down payment until you start getting up and to you know the the big low numbers but from the\nThe purchase price range that you're talking about can be done with his little is it ten percent down payment\nThe loan approval itself the loan approval process let's just say for the borrower themselves as very similar to just doing a regular conventional loan your qualification purpose of the documents that you're going to have to provide and things along those lines is all relatively similar to what you're going to go through on a regular conventional mortgage now of course\nYou're not buying a built home yet the collateral there is not established at that point there were going to be lending on so we it's silver tend to go to partner with you guys the builders to be able to provide all the other documentation that we need in regards to the collateral portion of things\nUm it is what's referred to as a two time close so you're going to get your construction loan at the very beginning\nUm and then at the end of the process when the home is finished we are going to do what's called the takeout refinance for you\nAnd we're going to get you set up into a conventional loan would be a Thirty Years' Twenty years Fifteen Years whatever fits your or the bar or the buyers you know kind of long and short term financial plans that's what we always talk about is where at the end of this process\nDo you want to be with your homework so that you're set up to live in this beautiful home for the rest of your lives if it's your forever home so that's kinda the way that the process itself works\nUm you know during the building process they are going to be different stages we are going to close on your construction to Peru alone at the very beginning um and then they're going to be different\nTitle updates as the home is being built they're going to be different inspections in ... as you guys the builders hit different levels of the build um we're going to hand out more money and more money and more money that you guys need in order to finish the building if I'm not mistaken there for different draws\nMeaning there for different milestones that you guys as the builder have to hit in the construction process to get your money for the next portion of the bill we don't give it all up front um because these ... construction to parents or for a lot of different builders and really it protects the buyer and the bar word to know that the builder is not going to get their next\nTranche of money if you will in till different milestones have been hit and that you guys are doing your job to get there yes correct yeah so that I mean that gives I think the borrowers the level of comfort I've done these with silver to mortgage it's a great product\nThat's available out there and again I think the key to all of this is the ten percent down payment you know a lot of people I think think when they are having a home built for them or they're buying a new construction home\nUm I think when they're doing that new construction financing they're worried that they're going to have to come up with this massive chunk of change whether it's to buy the lot that they're going to build on and use that as their equity in the home I just think a lot of this misnomer is that they're gonna have to come up with a whole lot of money up front and they have to be\nFilthy stupid rich in order to get one of these they were you know understanding of ten percent down payment and your ability to qualify for conventional loan is going to be very similar to what we do with the new construction", "show_name": "Silverton Mortgage", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "13"}
