business icon and founder of earth acts in the larger served a uh yeah in the world or are they celebrating\nA man next week make sure you tune in we're going to have the college sustainability some serious back next week Notre Dame the fighting Irish are here on TALK of green God's show and tell us what's ah what's going on on that campus in South Bend Indiana and uh all the things sustainable uh at the campus of Notre Dame\nAnd a man we got some great people coming up in the month of\nProcess and you are dealing with it when you don't necessarily um when you kind of have a lot on your mind and uh we deal with it a lot within our office when we have a sales of real estate says sometimes the entire reason that the house is being sold is because somebody has passed away\nAnd it is extremely important I always recommend for the lifting agents that we work with that we get title you know earlier on in the process and we've talked about earlier shows\nThat not happening sometimes until a little bit later on people want to get through like inspections and you know not bother us and you know regardless of how can I say just bother me um but but with these sorts of things I've got a I've got two files going and going on in my office right now and um [noise]\nIt gets even more complicated when they don't even necessarily have when it's sort of deals with the extended family\nSo one of them is mom just recently passed away\nA she had a daughter and the sun the sun ... or so there is a child at that and he's an adult needs an adult child\nAnd um the aunt his aunt is uh the executor moms estate so they they did the probate they did everything that they were supposed to do\nAnd a deed at hand the property so that he could sell it 'cause that's part of what he was getting out of out of his dad's share and um and and looking at the title\nA which luckily you know this listing agent does send me stuff well in advance um it was one of these where yeah mom's estate had been probate it totally correctly but dads who had been dead for several years never was\nAnd they thought that they had really taking care of everything I'm there had been a deed that was signed\nThat um where she gave her titled or the property the problem is that\nI'm the mom signed it to herself and she did that using a financial power of attorney that an attorney had prepared for her and I believe that same attorney helped her to prepare the deed\nAh but the problem is you can't use someone else's power of attorney to take their property away and give it to yourself that's that's what we call self serving and ... there was absolutely no bad motivations from any of this\nUm but now we are now we are dealing with the fallout of that which luckily this family gets along and we need even more time when you do have people that are disputing and fighting and you know don't agree in this one that the ant and the and the son get along really really well\nAh so I think we're going to be able to solve it but we also have to go back\nBecause there was no probate on dad and get affidavit signed by to at least two people who knew dad and they had to have known him for a number of years and obviously they need to still be alive\nUm in order to to you know sign an affidavit and they have to swear to who the heirs are because if not we got to go all the way back into probate again for dads so there are ways around it [noise] be\nPrepared I read her hair mentally you're the moral of your story is be prepared before any eventuality\nExactly and maybe have some conversations because the other one that I have right now uh that I was working on last night actually is one where um she told someone that they were inheriting the property uh she had no children this is like a a nephew or it's one of those like along the side\nOf the line of descent and ah so she told him that you know you inherits property should do this shit all that she took a lot she took her accounts and she took care of the accounts and a with a paid on death and so her bank accounts and things like that are fine\nBut with regard to the property\nShe told him that he was inheriting it she apparently like printed on line or someone did something for and and drew out some sort of a will ah she signed it but it wasn't witnessed it's not the original and it's it's all of those real technicalities that we have to deal with so\nI'm at this point where she probably thought that everything had been fully resolved and these people are ready to put the property on the market\nUm were starting out you know we we have to we're going to have to go into probate with this thing so um it's it is a it is one of those animals where if it's not an attorney who does it a lot you can really you know you can really matched yourself up\nI'm Jennifer jak in our office does that she's been a great addition over the last a year or so just because this is what she does and in terms of really understanding the the technicalities of it and and explaining to people like this original a copy of this thing is not going to do us any good it really does need to be an original and filing\nThanks so you know you mentioned having to go back to ... and that they're prepared to sell the house already what kind of timeframe as probate and is there any Expedia to process for families that do get along\n[noise] uh this is where again you need an attorney who knows what they're doing so or you know the the timeline that it takes to probate is going to defer a little bit county by county and it's going to depend upon you know who's out who just quit who's a brand new hire\nWhether it's vacate people's vacation time you know things like that impact the courts ability to operate\n'em you know but when you've got one of those situations where you don't have a lot of infighting that I think you're probably talking about you know a few weeks and not you know not something that's like months or years or anything like that\nUm but it's why it's important to to pull this title I'm and look at the stuff ahead of time because you've already got a buyer on the hook\nI mean can you know I I hate when we had these situations where there's a buyer sitting there and we go we're gonna we're going to be going backwards on this thing so um it's important and I'm sure are Christian\nYou've had transactions where does that mean is there a lot of properties like I said are being sold just because there has been a death in the family so um [noise] you know no one no one takes the homestead and lives in it any more for from their sunset years luckily by the time fast\nThat they've already got houses\nBut we will continue when we get back we are on the radio or a tail and talk radio forty

feels\nYour Saturday mostly cloudy skies in this\nNew show or I'd like\nTo hire only fifty eight degrees but then by late Saturday nights guys clear and someday will become mostly sunny and Seventy degrees I'm CBS forty six meteorologist Alexandra steel\nHello Atlanta is Glenn Beck joined me every weekday at nine oh six on TALK radio six forty W GST [noise]\nWe are on um radio ACL on TALK radio six forty BGSU time Cheryl team joined by Jerry ... early silver ten and Christian Ross with village realty\nSo Jerry you're about to make a point as we were leading into the break because we were talking about race and I think it's an option for for a loan programs based on what the market looks like\nYeah I just wanted to go back to the orange the adjustable rate mortgages and you know any time that there's no\nI'm involved in a financial scenario I'm just not a big fan of it you know the you know I kind of you know unknown and we don't want to get into there so I have a lot of clients and will say to me when asked that question about how long you're planning on staying in the home\nThey'll say we only plan on staying here like five or six years of starter home or going to have different jobs are promotions and we want to get into something bigger but we want to be real estate investor so later on down the road when we move out of this house we might end up renting this out to somebody else\nGoes or again things you have to take into consideration if you're on an adjustable rate mortgage 'cause as you mentioned the five year the seven year the ten year yeah after those fixed periods of time or over in the race can adjust up or down on your most likely up considering the rate market environment that we're in\nSo you have to prepare for all eventuality these are thinking about holding that property long term even though you're not going to live there is a possibility you know do you want to get yourself into a position where that rate could rise to seven eight nine ten eleven percent whatever it ends up being\nYeah cause where it can usually go is usually five points above whatever it starts out so it's got an absolute ceiling but but it does have it\nThe other thing that I had seen over the last few years because you've got people that are selling houses\nAnd buying something else and putting down like a decent chunk of cash is uh if you're one of those people who wants to do that and and you know look at what you can do with your money so in in deciding what you're going to do for a down payment versus those things that you can do [noise] um\nBut I've actually seen a lot of in my area of the Fifteen year fixed mortgages because they can afford a Fifteen year payment so they get the lower interest rate because the term is half the the normal term but they don't they're not running any of the risks of of it fluctuating on them\nI Love the gene Europe always been a fan of it you know number one what a lot of people don't realize is on the thirty year mortgage about sixty seven percent of your payment is going to go towards interest for the first ten to Fifteen Years have got low on a Fifteen year that flips around sixty seven percent roughly goes towards your principal yes\nSir you're paying it off quickly\nAnd you know it may be a little bit more expensive each month and you may have to excuse me tighten your belt a little bit but remember starting and you're sixteen you can start saving in banking that monthly mortgage payment because you're not going to be making it any more from your sixteen to thirty\nTo tighten your belt now own your house outright accumulate more equity and then start you're heavy savings process and you're sixteen as opposed to your thirty ...\nAbsolutely so what are you seeing Christian in terms of what people are looking out on the financing side of things do you think they're asking enough questions are really going through their options I think\nThey are and I think you know to your point it just goes to that loan officer who is really about educating and empowering their client around with this decision so you know hopefully they just have a great loan officer that explains says options to them and to your point with rentals it makes me think of condos [noise] um you know it was condos if you're thinking about renting it you know that's\nThey tell you hey I Want to write that in five years\nYou know some kind of buildings now are restricting that you can't even rent until you've been there for a year most of the buildings in Atlanta\nHave five to ten year waiting list so that's I get on the rental that'd get yeah I mean once you're on there will be five to ten years before you can rent and then you had this other section where now because they're in the mode of changing their bylaws right now because Aaron B it's become so prevalent when they're not supposed to do it um\nI got so many questions this week about changing covenants to ah to eliminate air be and be a few opportunities and neighborhoods\nSo between that change in the area and be at the same time they're looking at\nUm should we lower our rental cat\nTo twenty percent versus twenty nine of four buildings looking at that right now\nAs well as um for The Mentalist should we just go ahead and say that like you can't come on for a year so lessons I lost my clients as soon as you close get on that rent a list you never know what'll happen you might get relocated whatever at least journalists but now certain buildings are trying to eliminate even coming on the on that list for a year\nWhile and it's something it's something that people that invest for a living like hedge funds and things like that that are and some of some hedge funds when they buy investment properties\nAre are by improve and flip purchased by hold and flip a at a certain point but there are other of them out there that are really acquiring actually quite a bit of investment property that they are holding and renting out and they are banking on the strange revenues\nThey are they are checking what the companies say on these things um individuals who decide to become investors\nReally
