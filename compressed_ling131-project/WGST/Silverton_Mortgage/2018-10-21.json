find\nWho's going to help you purchase your home and find your home is find a lender\nYour realtor is going to always help you recommend they have people that work with and that way you know what you're looking for you're looking at the right price range of ... was that you don't get your hopes up or you're not looking too low\nWhat I'll play devil's advocate just for suck it right and I'm a homebuyer and I say I looked on Zillow why do I need or what do I need a major below tells me everything about true with\nNo that is not true um I like to say they use a dart board\nAnd they just kind of throw darts at everything and they can get some things right some things are not right tax records are not right um why they need someone as you need an advocate through the process is not about just finding the right house and getting a contract is everything after\nThey keep that contract together the negotiations and all the little hiccups it happen they're going to happen\nBut you want to have a good time and a pleasant experience through this and having a realtor will definitely help that to the effect\nUs interesting people say price some numbers [noise] um but they're so much more

good time and their area and also take a look at the house and give suggestions of improvements and need to be made repairs that need to be made and some things that they may not want to exactly like

T\nKelly thrush showcasing back out you're a show we're going to dive into everybody's favorite topic property taxes\nThere there there's a at all serious and if there's a lot going on right now are that are buyers need to know this is you know the un sexy side of the business but that's what this shows about keeping it real and giving people information that they need to know not necessarily that just sounds great and\nYou know a lot of this is a good of you know there there's not major problems we don't want to free people out but there's just different things that if they learn and can do a little different it's just going to help them out I'm an impossibly answer some of their questions so\nFull county what's what's going on\nCertainly as a Fulton County resident and closing attorney sitting in Fulton County it's been a it's been interesting this year and I walk into my house at the end of the day and I hear taxes on the news and I have no idea whether it's like ...\nAll tax reform or Fulton County chaos it's actually making the news usually it's a combination of both\nSo what happened earlier this year at the beginning of every year you get a notice of assessment for your property taxes and it is what the county thanks for property is valued at and gives you an anticipation and ability to file a tax appeal if you don't agree with how the county's assess the property\nWe have um we've had a good market the last few years we've had you know and increasing market it's one of the reasons that it's a seller's market the values of our properties of started to come up and I think quite honestly at a at a pretty healthy pace\nI'm you know so\nWhat happened was the assessments came out high and from my personal experience with it as a Fulton County homeowner it was a six figure job in my assessment in a single year but I Will also tell you that it really hasn't come up in the last two or three years\nAnd as somebody who's in the industry I'm not sure the assessment was unfair at the end of the day but there was an enormous outcry a amongst every one of the homeowners anyone related to the industry\nUh there were there were massive movements to appeal every single tax bill in the county which quite frankly terrified the assess are and what they decided to do in the middle of the year was to freeze the two thousand and sixteen assessment\nGo back to what the properties assessed into thousands sixteen completely throw out the new two thousand Seventeen assessments and build based upon last year\nThat caused a delay and the tax bills the Fulton County tax bills are normally delinquent October fifteenth\nCity of Atlanta which half of Atlanta is in full and the other half as into cab are usually paid in August by August fifteenth of each calendar year so those states came and went and we didn't have tax bills yet\nOr at the end of October we were all notified that those tax bills and this is something that we were never really aware of but the counties have to submit those tax digest to the Georgia department of revenue for approval\nAnd what ... or said when they looked at it is you've increased commercial property taxes and you have frozen residential property taxes and that is disparate affects of residential and commercial property and it is illegal\nSo full and you cannot issue your tax bill\nThey scheduled a temporary tax bill hearing for November the third at that hearing they did get approval to issue a temporary tax bill for two thousand Seventeen it is based upon those two thousand sixteen assessments and there is some plan to come out\nWith a supplemental bill what people need to understand is a lot of what this tax money pays for is our schools so Fulton County and city of Atlanta the actual cash flow that comes from these taxes are what pays for our kids' schools\nSo as a homeowner and as a parent with a child and Fulton County school system we received notifications that they were furloughing staff\nThat they were canceling children's activities\nAnd that the teachers December and not just teachers but all the educational support staff all the employees of the Fulton County and city of Atlanta school systems would not get their December twentieth paycheck\nUntil December twenty ninth so we hope that they did not need it to buy their last minute Christmas gifts for their family\nOr for any trips they might have been taking during the Christmas holidays for their meals for Christmas for all of those things", "show_name": "Silverton Mortgage", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta",
