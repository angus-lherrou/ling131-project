you can't get away from the environment here it's in your face was big sky you know we don't have tall trees that you have in the south East I'm which are beautiful but a cut down on the panorama the scotch you have a big sky the west\nYeah the mountains in your face I mean the flat irons are literally looking down on the campus is huge slabs of\n'em made of stone that\nUh overshadow Boulder and then you're on the front range the Rocky Mountains is it's hard to forget about the environment here 'cause it's just all around\nYeah no man if people need to see that I mean it it is it's breathtaking really I'm alright they tell us about your team that helps you you know implement all this stuff out there at CU\nYeah it's a it's it's the best I mean I'm I'm you know in the latter part of my career I've been working in environmental Rena since I'm\nA college in Nineteen Seventy six or doing research or back in the days when we're trying to figure out how to measure pollution but during that period of time I work a lot of people this is the best\nCrew of people I've ever worked for a in a way up it's a fabulous it's with team as a solid or bend the all been there for years we'd all those people very often\nUm you know usually like challenges but a virtue\nOf folks want to move on to a better job 'cause I'm not sure there are a lot better job so we we attract the best and the brightest are everyone's mission driven everyone's got a great values about inclusion of our students and what we're doing in fact we you know the philosophy of the center of we're here not\nUh because of the students but for the students yeah we exist because of the students and uh we do we translate that sort of my motto all of the great leadership positions are activities that\nA few Bulger has come up with over the years has been because it's too caught up that idea\nOf students you know for whatever reason we attract all these great students and and they don't know what you do what you have to do so they come in with an idea and you know we wouldn't have thought of it because there might be a bunch of barriers to it or we're just too busy doing stuff to you know take that creatively\nAnd they come in with the idea that our job is to shape that idea I make a pragmatic make it work ... to it and so you know first like I said first recycling program a diverse student church group\nStudent body in the United states to say hey you know what we're gonna we're gonna run our buildings on a rule renewable energy or we're going to tax ourselves in our wallets to pay for it but I remember where I was sitting at University of Florida mhm when I got a notice one day and Nineteen Ninety nine the students were going to vote\nYou tax will sell about newborns you'd really care about and they did and now everybody does that but it was it was the person I'm Down to live a long list that I won't bore warrior the talking points but\nUh that's the attitude of the of the staff there they're told us\nNo man that that's why we do the college sustainability some series day so that people can hear around the country you know what's going on on these different campuses and you know maybe adopt best practices right um so that we all get better that's that's what this this whole series is about sharing\nAnd um you know that this series exist that you're doing such a great job I've been listening to your shows and listening to other folks that you can learn from you know my colleague with other campuses and and you know that's how\nYou're going to cross connecting us cross pollinated well there are and inspiring so you know we all work really hard every day\nOr whatever campus was good to hear what's going on down the road across the nation\nBecause it keeps people going and keeps the good ideas coming in as people that were not allowed to where we're we're um we're being mean time machine\nThere you go hey how many how many students are on the campus of or to you by the way ballpark or they're you know a\nBall around thirty two thousand\nOkay All right um hay and lead since we're talking to you man we got a shout out to and you Gilbert on your team began to shut up to hey man yes hey man brother oh my goodness till the ... brigade that tell tell everybody by and you go over\nWell first and foremost I don't know how we landed or how do we land so I mean I can say as a bomb went off and on and it's it's ... ... is typical typical of all of our staff I don't know how we got such talent\nOr Andy had been working for ESPN gears running their college game days they asked me the X. games in terms of uh she was with a boat sustainability specialist in other words every time there was a college get game day\nOr anti on Monday or that we could be flying to that place and setting up that stadium yep a these are away then and the state of all\nHe did that for years and asked me the next game same thing uh actually she hired a lot of our students to go work walk storms or your or both will come around when they won the ... winter ones tend to show up in Colorado but ah ah\nSo she was getting around and you know she and a lot of the inside of an airplane\nAnd um and developing a lot of skilled and talent and so we were lucky to get hired her to do that same job but does Ross ah she still sidelines a little bit with ESPN she she knows they Nader\nBut man what a house on fire but he loves Angie she will stay at work overnight and that would make the day after the ball game to make sure the stadiums all squared away recycling is all put away and uh that we just simply couldn't be successful without it\nWow All right hey day look man ... I I really appreciate you being a part of the series a blend in your voice is what's going on it and see you and all the great work that you're doing out there man but we need another hour\nTo talk about all this stuff that's going on out there I Know but you know for the last with the with the last maybe minute I've got for you man just just\nYou and what does the future of sustainability look like at CU\nThe future's bright I think we've got a lot of this was in place now that we're we're fixing to take it all the next level key to that yeah integrating all stay cold\nAll the stuff that's down there a way of life oh my gosh is awesome I keep a mountain bike in my office at all times so just in case just in case you never know when they're going to go ... go ahead I'm Sorry no and uh and then we just\nDecided to open one down in ... as well so that is I'm being told home of\nThe walking dead down there so I just uh went down yesterday and signed a lease in there and I'm just a great cool little spot down there so I've got a team of five agents that are going to be building a down in that area and uh Roswell coming in November as well to\nSome very nice so why are people from the Woodstock mega office going to be moving to some of these other branches are all these new rate agents that you're bringing in most used\nTo be new agents that we're bringing in I mean we're going to have open concept to where people can go to different officers at any given time so I mean it's going to be shared space so people Woodstock agents over in Roswell needs to use that office they can do that but\nMostly they are going to be for expansion hum you know the biggest thing for us is since we do bring in Leeds for agents um you know we want to make sure that we're opening other offices because if we just stay in one area you know there is a finite amount of leads that are out there to be had so we want to make sure expanding that same things we're doing in Woodstock we should be able to do in other areas pretty easily\nAnd you know you'd mentioned new agents all the way to experience agents and longtime agents you were talking to me a little bit about this before the show about this a mentoring program that you guys have I thought it sounded pretty interesting yeah\nI mean we super excited about this this program and actually was the way I started in the business\nAnd so when I became an agent\nUm you know a new sales I knew people I felt like I'd be pretty good at it but uh I didn't know real estate and so I found somebody has been the business Twenty years I'm ... to deal with him where I said look you know just make sure I don't look stupid out there and uh be my mentor be my coach\nAnd ah you know pay a percentage of ever deal that I Do and what ended up happening my first year was I learned so much because I had a twenty year veteran the excitement of a new agent with a veteran and it just work perfectly\nSo it's really hard for you know there there's only so much you know education they have to do in order to get a license and you know whether it's real estate or law or something like that but you really learn by doing\nAnd uh and what you don't want to do with flop at the very beginning of that so if you've got someone to to steer you in the right direction at sort of a you know success through apprenticeship sort of situation\nOh absolutely I mean and and we feel like I mean I've always felt like the industry should be doing a better job of this for the new agents because when most new age is coming to the industry in the first thing they don't realize they hear it but I mean they're not going to get a paycheck for Ninety Days I mean at best very rarely even get a paycheck and Ninety Days so\nThey come in a lot of them need to close something quickly they were maybe used to having money coming in you know once a month every other week whatever it was and now all of a sudden it's their first shot of owning your own business and so you take the fear of not getting any deals and\nThey seem to just stay super busy they you know I always joke I say you know they don't know how to win the day 'cause they don't even know what game they're playing in so for a new age and we want to put a veteran with them and that veterans going to walk them through things that need to be doing but our goal is to get them we say get them out of the film room and on the playing field is really our goal\nAnd what's what's the most advantageous part of this mentor relationship versus kind of the advent of the team that we've seen in real estate over the past\nFew years yeah so I mean the biggest thing is um you know and I and I could talk for days you know for teams and stuff but the biggest thing about this is that we want to give agents to support when they need it and we want to support them and what it is so when I look at education or industry\nAlways say that you know it's pretty static and real estate is totally dynamic it's always moving each deal is totally different\nAnd so I see all this education where new agents are sitting in class and they're learning how to write a contract labor contracts totally different and so what we want to do is the magic of this program happens on a Wednesday night at eight o'clock so new agents in the middle of a deal something comes up on him to address concerns\nThey call their coach their coaches walking him through with their veteran advice that they have\nAnd all of a sudden that person goes back to their client with that same advice and therefore the experience is going through this new agent in the new agents learning as they go so one of our goals is we always say I don't I don't want to teach at a red if they contract I Want it to generate your first contract\nAnd you're right about when things happen because I you know I communicate with a lot of real estate agents or you know via text messaging since all of the deadlines in our contracts are midnight\nMean that the the magic ours are like after seven o'clock pm on on the last day when you know you've got your right to terminate it's about to expire and things like that so\nWell is have you been on either side of this mentorship program since you've been there\nI actually came on board for the new construction sided it okay well I've worked with a lot of the agents through red barn bringing their clients to me that are going through the mentoring program and it just is a world of difference when you've got that agent that has that support I'm\nWith you know that with the program so it's it's been great for me to be able to work with those agents as they're learning and and watch them grow with the company\nThat grade next segment we're to talk a little bit about red barn construction and talk about what you're doing with that Melissa we'll talk\nAbout one of these projects but you guys have it and we'll get to kind of some of the nuts and bolts about do we do construction in regard financing the property taxes that we talked about a little bit of talk about the price ranges and all those different things so we'll get a little deeper into the construction aspect of what you guys are doing coming up\nThere on ... radio ACL talk radio six forty WG of the Jerry ... silver to\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt received news radio I'm John

[noise]\nMorning welcome to um radio ACL on TALK radio six forty WG is the um Jerry Allen gr from silver to mortgage filling in for our fearless leader Josh I'm off it um it is always joined by Sheryl ... founding partner of spark skiing watch and Reddick\nI'm also joined today by a couple of red barn fine is we've got Scott Martin now managing partner red barn realty a real estate as well as Melissa clay new home sales specialist for red barn construction and we've been talking about ... states in Woodstock as well as some of the other projects that you guys have going on\nI'm of the new construction portion of red barn\nSo we said we'd get into a little bit of the financing options at least from the mortgage perspective which I Do hear on the show do run into a lot of people coming to look at new construction that have questions about financing for the new construction\nWe do and you know with it being a little bit different with being new construction boutique builder the price point that were at you know we\nWould like to offer different programs for them so you know the construction to permanent construction loan I think a lot of buyers just don't know much about it they really need educated and a\nA little hand holding and and information from the loan officer in detail so that they understand exactly what they're getting into and what their options are so\nToday I wanted to really take advantage of having you kind of explained the construction the perma construction loan process to the buyers out there because a lot of them are just used a straight conventional clothes\nAnd they don't know anything about a sea to pee or construction line so I Would love for you Jerry tick on explain that to the buyers out there\nYeah I mean at least you know I can speak to the construction of our program that we have it's silver and mortgage and I know that you've um partnered up with some of our loan officers Amy we'll ... and I'm Kerry powers out of the ... branch\n'em and I know they do a ton of these we can do 'em with as little as a ten percent down payment until you start getting up into you know the the big low numbers but from the\nThe purchase price range that you're talking about can be done with his little as a ten percent down payment\nThe loan approval itself the loan approval process let's just say for the borrower themselves is very similar to just doing a regular conventional loan your qualification purpose of the documents that you're going to have to provide and things along those lines is all relatively similar to what you're going to go through on a regular conventional mortgage now of course\nYou're not buying a built home yet the collateral there is not established at that point that we're going to be lending on so we it's silver tend to go to partner with you guys the builders to be able to provide all the other documentation that we need in regards to the collateral portion of things\nUm it is what's referred to as a two time close so you're going to get your construction loan at the very beginning\nUm and then at the end of the process when the home is finished we are going to do what's called the takeout refinance for you\nAnd we're going to get you set up into a conventional loan would be a Thirty Years' Twenty years Fifteen Years whatever fits your or the bar or the buyers you know kind of long and short term financial plans that's what we always talk about is where at the end of this process\nDo you want to be with your homework it so that you're set up to live in this beautiful home for the rest of your lives if it's your forever home so that's kinda the way that the process itself works\nUm you know during the building process they are going to be different stages we are going to close on your construction to Peru alone at the very beginning um and then they're going to be different\nTitle updates as the home is being built they are going to be different inspections in ... as you guys the builders hit different levels of the build um we're going to hand out more money and more money and more money that you guys need in order to finish the building if I'm not mistaken there for different draws\nMeaning there for different milestones that you guys as the builder have to hit in the construction process to get your money for the next portion of the bill we don't give it all up front um because these ... construction to friends or for a lot of different builders and really it protects the buyer and the bar where to know that to build there is not going to get their next\nTranche of money if you will until different milestones have been hit and that you guys are doing your job to get there yes correct yeah so that I mean that gives I think the borrowers a level of comfort I've done these with silver to mortgage to great product\nThat's available out there and again I think the key to all of this is the ten percent down payment you know a lot of people I think think when they are having a home built for them or they're buying a new construction home\nUm I think when they're doing that new construction financing they're worried that they're going to have to come up with this massive chunk of change whether it's to buy the lot that they're going to build on and use that as their equity in the home I just think a lot of dismissing dome or is that they're gonna have to come up with a whole lot of money up front and they have to be\nFilthy stupid rich in order to get one of these they were you know understanding of ten percent down payment and your ability to qualify for conventional loan is going to be very similar to what we do with the new construction", "show_name": "Silverton Mortgage", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "14"}
