{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "You know if you're if you're a buyer out there and it just kind of get your feet wet and thinking about it and and maybe you're you're you're you're younger or you're not tied to a school district or something like that what are you seeing where where where's the hot or what's come in or you know you got and anybody into any different neighborhoods these days when when they want to\nYou know catch the wave well\nI I'm you know the belt line is still a big part of that yeah I mean it really is I think we're still on the upswing with that um the belt line anywhere along the belt line and now I Would say the next wave is the west side that line yeah because you know we're nowhere near as built\nAlong there as we are on the east side so you know I think there's a lot of investors buying on the west side because they see it coming they've seen what happened on the east side so\nThose investors gonna sell it sell it off to someone else and make some money in the middle are they gonna rent 'em out or a little bit of both\nI Would say there's a little bit about than some of them are just renting it out until time is right right um but yeah the\nCash flow right now and then\nAbsolutely absolutely but I mean the belt mine still um you know draws a lot of attention it just just one of those things that does people just have this vision of it as as being the utopian place to live so it's it's certainly thrown a lot of prices up [noise]\nUm you know there's um a lot of different ... and again I can speak really mostly for in town neighborhoods that um\nOr you know some of the the east the south east neighborhoods as well are getting more and more built up I see more and more flippers out there now and again I Know that's a whole nother subject [laughter]\nBut I Do see more of it now than I've seen in a while\nThere's a ... that used to that as a clerk which of the world are they exactly ... no no I I mean it used to Atlanta Kirk would but stretching aged Atlanta okay you know a stretch and ... where it was the trendy east of Atlanta to\nUm you know other areas and I see a lot of flipping going on there\nAnd I think you know because when you want one of the things that's unique about in town Atlanta is um you know other than obviously location and all the amenities that has is\nJust that it's not like buying in a neighborhood where everything was built by the same builder and the same thing and you know so you got a lot of properties that that may have never been touched that I was in a renovation I was helping teach at renovation lending class recently and they were\nAll lifting was talking on age I was talking about a house not in town but that still had the the old like a Nineteen fifties like you know kitchen things like that you can come back to the Nineteen twenties obviously and and a little bit earlier with some of the things we have around here but I Would imagine that's one of the things that that effects\nAre trying to tell a seller whether they can sell for trying to tell by or what they are going to have to pay as you can have two houses that all things being equal you know same school district you know only only twenty five feet different Santa walking distance to a certain bar or something like that like you really have to completely different properties\nAbsolutely and you know that's that's definitely one of the things that's more unique to in town I wouldn't say because it it's more you know the housing is more diverse it's easier to do a marketing analysis for a house\nOut in the suburbs where they're all basically the same and all you have to do is look at the cost per square foot\nAnd a I can do that in a way that you know artificial intelligence is going to have a harder time they may be able to get a few things with permitting and and some other things that are public record but it's really ... everything is very very unique in town\nIt is it's I mean and again like you said you could have two identical houses one is totally renovated and one is a dump [laughter]\nYou know they're going to be priced very differently and but the stats look the same which is one of the issues I have with things like Zillow coming out with what they call there's this summit strike which they don't see the houses so they have no idea yeah\nAnd you know have you started taking ... into the I'm kind of the southwest part of the belt wind yet do you think it's too early over there as far as\nYou you know where appreciation can go to is that still need to be kind of determined that although I I went for a quick little walk kind of tore through the rock quarry pork over there that's going to be just amazing I mean it it's going to be fantastic but or you know what's what's a conversation with your buyers right now or are people interested in and move and\nI'm just really haven't had that much interest in that area personally but I Know that I'm sure that there are a lot that due to um\nThere's just not the market as I tend to work I work with more move up buyers so not ... right exactly and move up buyers are that's not where they're headed generally\nThey're you know headed to a\nYou know more comfortable neighborhood they're not as much interested in prospecting yeah um you know when I first started and I was younger and so my you know the clients I was working with were younger they were more looking for what's the next thing\nThey were willing to be pioneers they were willing to be pioneers in I was a pioneer yeah I Lived in him in part when it was scary [laughter] um but you know the the moving buyers that's just not really their market but what they're doing now\nIs you know uh I live in live as depart near Emery in my neighborhood and Brookhaven which I Do a lot of work and it's all about the tear downs I mean they're all about the ...\nYeah 'cause I mean that said that the properties in Brookhaven were built like a little bit or they they are a little bit newer then some of the ones that are or am I wrong about that I may be thinking about the areas where I Know really know people in\nYou mean the newer ones are just\nThinking I'd ... I'd rather build that you know I'd rather ... down in the fifties or seventies house than I Would like a Nineteen twenties you know like that sort of thing\nYeah although honestly it's getting to where a lot of times it doesn't matter I've seen some beautiful house torn down yeah well then it doesn't have the best reputation for that year they do not um but it's just part of a city growing and and yeah we're we're\nWhether we like it or not we're in a city that's gonna continue to grow at a at a fairly rapid pace and uh that's just part of it um\nYou know but ... and we can do a whole show about\nTearing down and building and I I could talk for eight hours about the the financing side of that which would be incredibly boring for every one um but yeah that's a whole different thought of\nYou know if you can't find are you prepared to uh you know buy something and do either a massive renovation or a full on tear down and have a measure of you're having lots of those I have a lot of those conversations with yeah and there's you know the financing piece of that a whole different animal\nUm I Know it's over did we do those type of loans are called construction permit our business but it is really a a different deal and not for the faint of heart [noise] definitely not for the faint of heart\nAnd you're not even just talking about the financing it still living through it\n... it you know where you're married survive I'm so ... you know I Know you've got a great PR firm right I've heard the word on the street as they do every day job [laughter] um but I tell folks how they can find you and and you know a truck you know\nUm my website is bill golden homes dot com I'm On Facebook is bill and gold and homes on Instagram at pill golden homes\nSensing a theme yes\nAbout that and again or my ringer which is for oh four to nine five six to seven zero so for great advice tons of intel knowledge or reach out to bill and hill\nRenovate your kitchen for two thousand dollars\nYou know who are recorded a thank you guys so much for joining in uh always appreciate you listening on Saturday shell and we'll be back\nHopefully together again next Saturday we'll see\nYou guys or listen to ... and this is talk radio six forty W. E. S.\nT. [noise]\nThe time I didn't have that much light in my life\n... I'm also interested today I touched on it very briefly before I'm\nOver the years Alabama excuse me has not had the most six trash cans stifling tight and [noise]\nYou know it'll mess we all you know we we have always had some very very good tight and send them an environment has yielded a lot of ah you know effective miss their ... and so on and here they had to sprinkle a Germany sprinkle and then other great tied and\nThey now have sports tight in Cedar\nThe smallest of which his six three and they got six three or six for six five and six six tight and\nAll four of whom I've received passes already this year it's going to be interesting to see how much they do and how bam a handles the tight end because as the coach told us a few weeks ago he said the tide and as a physician I can get lost out there on the field and write a\nThat's going to be an interesting element to this game to see how much a coach Maurice throws to the titans in a panic and keep their eyes on these big guys\nSo there's no question about it because you don't have to look the further than Alabama and the success that are Smith has had been in the middle of all of the office of weapons that are there\nAny he's gotten lost a couple of times to the other teams defense I mean it is a it is is there a block or is he a pass receiver and particularly when ...\nYou know patting this costs five passes can trailers cost for a Gunther is caught a pass or Brady is caught passes or in their uh they they are a regular part of the of the Razorback off\nAmong the things we'll keep an eye on us over the course of the day will let you run you got an appointment with a ... year ... just a bit don't keep\nIt ... no I never do one thing you do you do ... you know we as the folks know that this is an interesting man\nWe record our pre game show two hours before kickoff with every other coach with whom I've worked dating back to bill curry we would either take that show on Thursday or friday and ride get it out of the way\nThe coach wants to do with two hours before kickoff it I'm telling me a folks this is the truth when I say two hours of we're clinging on CBS\nAnd the kickoff his at two thirty seven coach said but and I do not meet at twelve thirty we meet at twelve thirty seven days tick off eleven old too\nAnd he and I going to sit down at nine oh two at nine o'clock is more than two hours before is what will I'll see it two hours out it's amazing the punk ... see I'm a schedule that the man operates on and then when I with him\nThose Fifteen minutes I have is total undivided attention and he's always said he goes this is the most important interview of the week you said I'm Talking to the families do right before check off\nBut the second we're done I mean literally the second we're done he's up and out of the room and on to whatever's next if it's a home game is seeing recruits or whatever it might be\nIs on he is the most stringent schedule oriented man I've ever dealt with\nKids so most successful I guess so successful are the are the things she guys later the voice of the Crimson Tide Eli Gold with us here in the booth in stable is we're just getting things

and that the well I tell you that way we make sure we we handle what we can and that is that is one thing we take care of as a good ... before let's let's talk about what college football fans can feast on\nToday and in addition to our early ... there's also an early game of eleven AM central noon eastern over in Columbia South Carolina and Missouri\nAnd South Carolina big game for both teams because when they're looking at their schedules these are the type games they point to and go hey we can or should get winds but only one of them will\nExactly right Chris I don't think you can say it any better than that and this traditionally has been a really good football game they had games have gone down to the wire\nLast year if you were able to really think about it for Missouri they were up tend to nothing in this game and then they\nKicked the debo Samuel and not only the game change but their season really changed after that\nThe tigers have improved a lot there three in one right now drew lock needs just twenty two yards to get to the ten thousand yard plateau we expect to see that done today only nine other SEC quarterbacks have done that and for the game Cox Jake Bentley obviously has hurt but they still have a lot of weapons\nAnd they're good football team as well this is always a good game and important\nOne in terms of being in the top half of that eastern division race because George Kentucky border clearly the three baths at the moment but South Carolina wanted to Missouri I wouldn't want it FCC play both in need of the victory today should be interesting down in the swamp today as LSU\nTakes on Florida it's amazing how much different now Bryan gator fans are looking at their team as opposed to a couple of weeks ago when they went to Lexington and\nLost that went to um [noise]\nTo Kentucky but now a or excuse me in Gainesville they uh they lost to Kentucky in week number two but looking differently I think now is Dan bottom and their squad after when and start all last week but this one will be much more difficult challenge\nMuch more difficult but I think you set it up extremely well and that is the fact that both of these teams especially Florida have really Chris over perform they've done better than people kind of expected that Florida game against Kentucky a lot of people really didn't respect Kentucky as much as they do now obviously Kentucky is for real\nBut Florida is four and one that's their only walls and that and you look at LSU\nDominating they are a five and ... right now she went on the SEC it's only the second time in school history but they have had five wins in the month of September the only other time was back in two thousand and swelled\nDoes such a heartbreaking loss for one of the teams there were two minutes to go in the ball game the home team drove the link to the field and got down to the to yard line lined up for a game winning touchdown or a field goal rather\nPlay was the Phil do was blocked everyone on the defensive side was celebrating the whistle had not blown ball stay behind a lot of scrimmage and the home team was able to scoop it up and take it in for the game winning touchdown place went hysterical there was heartbreak obviously on the opposing side line but it just to teach them the right there you know the rules in\nCollege and high school very not tremendously but one thing and interviewing that young player that kind of stuck out and and it's kind of a lesson to be learned for everyone playing football is he said I didn't need to know the rules I didn't hear a whistle and coach taught me to go until the whistle was blown so exactly what he did and then ended up giving his team of victory\nYeah border with Jordan Wright did get to win in that one at home\nThat is correct and it would have extremely exciting ending there yeah it was a\n... the the final clip somebody posted that on Twitter this morning I went\nTo one where I Wish I had my private jet so I could have done both there was a heck of a way to finish it not expecting the same type drama\nHere in this one which can make it a challenge for players over the course of the week when you got a game like this uh in everybody in class just talking about how good your team is and maybe how the other side is struggling that's part of it focused and stay locked in on your task in your assignment to coach said but always talks about\nYeah and the point being kind of drill from those coaches exactly what I just said about playing until the whistles over regardless of who your opponent is or or what you think's going on over the course of the play I think that's important for this Alabama football team won that they've kind of taken to heart\nWe saw him jumped out forty nine and nuts and last week in the first half so it didn't look like they took their foot off the pedal at all there in that game and hopefully that trend will continue again today they understand that they are probably more talented than Arkansas but still have things to improve on it as you heard from a couple of coaches rent this week\nThey are going to be focused on not necessarily just the game itself but on improving their play\nWe'll talk more about that at a bed when we come back\nOn the other side of the break we're going to talk about what's going on in the SEC from Tyler
