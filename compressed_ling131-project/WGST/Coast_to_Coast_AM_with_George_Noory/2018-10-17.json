out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately what was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called my gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and he was hitched it he's the one will probably pitched it to the network ...\nAfter that was such a success he pitched it and they ...\nAnd mutually pitched each other and and so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode we say ah you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell never a novel he did write your questions of short stories\nAnd George George sure but I'm getting the\nClosest he ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary\nI'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer she ... she was so busy with told me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away a for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThat there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nOr is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for it where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to watch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be reenter reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't a rod surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a surgical credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of\nYou know what did he really right you know what what did you really could\nContribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's\nAnother thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was that gallery or twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol certainly was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe he had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of\nYou know the crop circles and you know they only visitations and UFOs sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got a interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays with thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod certainly could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes\nYou know he he often a complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\n\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said they're so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season\nA episode about his kind of archetype all you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know we live as youth and go back to a easier less stressful\nLife was that will be the uh it's just like really as kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its well spent\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among the favorites\nThat was that was a big theme for Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic uh\nYour hand is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still note to this day they know that anything it's a cookbook you know they that's ever [laughter]\nAnd uh they're just so many good Leo what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine thinks is taunting him\nAnd drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah for the next day\nWith us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas

you say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restrooms reading obviously we talked about some of the censorship but not on the issues but also the language and and just the the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there's so many shows that are that are are so adults and\nScope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think he would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and have there's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but\nUm but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you for sure he he would hate reality TV on the\nUm he and and I don't say that just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television for its time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody onto the show at the normal you know regular everyday person and they will trot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the the show or you know I thought it was just the invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality of it and he would have but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWill an old time television to knock a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows where you gone back\nOr even the comedians\nAre the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in in I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm ... older white guys [laughter] where did the television you know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example ... thinking him\nHe was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field has has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know and you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know I'd be in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know have on the contract to CBS\nCBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I have to some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nThat's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of the SATs which to me it was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the semi talk for the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish what I was wondering\nIf he knew how many cameras used during the actual shoots okay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with Kurt that it that's one of the striking things about the series is is that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships or shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set\nAnd the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern um he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room\nBecause it was going to be cheaper to make you know young actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like I have the holder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kind of got the budget back under control\nHe jumped started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to be Robert\nRedford yay yay has read\nFor actually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling you'd written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on TV [noise] uh and that was a great great show and he was very good in that too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to say what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah it was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered\nEpisodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin offs person you know a says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery a because everybody thought she was ugly in a she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there's a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above the fallout shelter\n[noise] yeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yeah it was a that was a terrifically a well known episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know um there's an episode that's a very rare episode but it was finally or at least ... years later and it was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas deal\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great and you know great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half hour I'll rarely yeah okay\nYeah and miniature was one of the hour long episode and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nOr in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has horrible horrible incident I'm a yeah helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set a it was yeah yeah cats they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead you're\nHigh like a couple of questions or\nOne would be the first one would be that seems like it was very escapist boy that may be someone stay back in the sexes I'm just speculating if you had to write for a job and it came home and watch the twilight

that I couldn't tell from that from that description of may have written that\nDidn't one step beyond pop up after twilight zone\nYes uh yes out the outer limits came after the twilight zone as well but no actually one step beyond I Believe actually perceive the twilight zone by year I'm Out of limits came afterwards but I Believe a one step beyond which started in fifty eight I think\nNext up we're going to end in Tulsa, Oklahoma and were taken away ...\nPercent of Georgia and Nick you know starting man he was he he had the ability to be able to understand human nature because if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know every one of these shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of his experiences at a combat soldier during World War two which I you know it was all about uh the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes is hard to say which is my favorite but I think it has to be the one that's the twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber\nComing home from Italy crashes in the desert the cat that airplane didn't go on a mission for whatever reason which was Robert Cummings Bob comings I'm Sorry and Bob comments just having me walking by and seen his newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd he went back in time what you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd we live the experience even though he didn't fly that mission you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him to add a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock of seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and when they when the show ended close to the ending of it\nThe nurse bodies closing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes and so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time and be twenty five crashed you know struggle with those shows that ... day and\nThey had a time machine you know one of them this guy you know went back in time three different times and he thought he would try to alter events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that well he failed you know at one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that\nSo I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany that already ... thought he could alter that event\nOf course but a man I don't know we it it'd be hard to say which be my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story\nThe guy that played art Carney played the Santa Claus in a department store I end the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a shrine\nHand when he got a break from the department store he went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was two grown man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down and he went in the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became public gifts just did it uh you know empty cans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy who ran a department store\nThey found call well given these gifts out at this a place like a John free sixteen mission type place you know at least when it comes in there and goes where did you get all these kids to get a receipt for all these gift blah blah blah and he goes no I just\nI found the bag and the gift rent it and I'm just giving them out looking at the police station and the department store owner came a nurse yeah there it is there's the merchandise call well you're the bah bah bah you know\nI end the guy's name was Mr done department store owner right and uh and they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but empty cans in Iraq\nAnd so they had to let him go of course the store owners sent your scratching your head the policemen scratches it couldn't figure out where all those gifts for coming from but they were coming out of that bag\nSo just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he reached into the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it to Mr\nDone the [noise] you know said married and this is and uh\n[noise]\n\n\n\nBan will come back to coast to coast great joke for you coming up here waned Maddox with us some noted expert in the areas of American

now and does an awful lot of good for the blind and for a students who need scholarship jumped\nSure does how did you get involved in the collectibles\nWell I got involved in and take away a lot of people do I just felt that everything else [laughter] I'm not really but you know I I was a middle aged guy I was\nIn a restaurant business I was a stock market forecaster\nI used to ... that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked at a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut and ended up in the antique business after a restaurant shop didn't work out only things usually working life\n... that's true but people of color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball cards from the Nineteen fifties\nI don't know where they are I've asked my mother who's eighty nine years old mom checked the ... where are they she says George ... we gave them away what I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle Kurd pose a whiz in great good shape your real good shape right\nWhat would you suppose your attacks yeah All right you're running around out there in a city angels\nCome across and old I don't know how the Hundred Years' old big coup all out there and as a farmer saying I just sold the house I I'm just getting rid of that stuff so right away you got a feeling that this stuff might be a legit tag sale where some facts you guys can outsmart\nRight right and you look around and it's all real stuff that's been handed down for years the fifty two man told Aaron excellent condition ask them a few questions you find out it's right guy says listen I've been told that where the porch and I won ten thousand bucks for the bite you buy it\nI don't know I don't know until I call a guy like you\nKnow well that's worth a somewhere in the neighborhood of ... you know two hundred thousand dollars you know yeah oh\nI had al ... mental saying Willie Mays mantle him all to\nMyself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes\n[laughter] I had to duplicate so we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally your head like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie card artist\nI ran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cards have been worse if you'd given them to him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value very much probably it would hurt the value you don't want to do that with you know you're better off having 'em sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff are they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right everybody's on the baseball cards that nobody's buying football cards which means you should be playing football\n... interesting to\nWrite basketball cards I once saw a guy who had a complete had Michael Jordan rookie card that before the cards it's called the big plate he had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie cards on oh I don't know what the heck that'd be worth the\nCheese average basketball card but nobody collects cars and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be you could get yourself like addict but his rookie cop\nLike this car right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think I threw away a wholeness Wagner card was worse than\n[laughter] than I did have a an honest Wagner card\nDid you really just like a million dollars isn't it\n[laughter] yeah it thought two million if it has a a a a a Piedmont back\nGosh yeah that's that's the most famous uh collectible in history\nWhen what makes these collectibles so expensive and so\nI always say you know the way to make money in and take the jets instead of sitting around and saying well this is rare this is exceedingly rare there's only one of them in a world and it's obviously a four hundred years old and\nLook at how dusty it is right that's not the kind of what makes things gifts things value is what I called marketability ask yourself who's going to buy it you know everybody loves baseball\nGot its unamerican the love baseball one of the reasons Mickey Mantle baseball cards are worth so much as it sounds like Mickey Mouse\nYeah you're right by the name the named beautiful [noise] um and he was he may be right there is also
