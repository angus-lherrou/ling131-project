your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know what I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it\nIn the last say seven eight years and focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about um something that looked like ... when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and\nI hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I I I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us and it's been documented in and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago when your first year can you be kept the project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight uh I was working for technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the fear of\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave we you have Twenty years of a police officer ... years investigating an HR

California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to report which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approach them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how odd while or giant human bones found\nIn ... that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions in the articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred ... who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a snake long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to really deep and and find out what maybe some explores wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an explorer\nFrom the latter day church was coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explored notes that\nThis thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I I actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy by peg he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with the latter day church butter de saint church and it's in there so to say that these things happen happen ridiculous\nOn the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass landed in a field releasing a huge here Hubbard being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nUm big foot people who think it's an eight just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... a book on or about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this almost fell over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this\nAnd uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a stunner I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear this\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um

years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nOr these look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's the general consensus that a\nThird of matches what other tribes have stated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to the to find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson ... film and it's you know if people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings of in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo when I did with ah the given one film it and one thing Harvey has the ability is let's say somebody goes into a bank Rob the bank has a beard on as a hat on\nAnd they're caught on camera leaving larvae have this innate ability to take the beard off the face seeking the with the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad\nIt's in tribal Dick for it and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAh in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take\nA variety of photos of Amazon tribal members ah people from northern Ukraine or of people from China and I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different human look\nIf they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you were a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from its because we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I ... I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited ... at ... in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just sign of playing with fire\nSo think about uh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is\nPlaying with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California [noise] uh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter they knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nThe um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods of the nice things doing an unusual things other times they're they're seen them awake\nPlaying like kids in the water um it's again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book off to look for a of a big put that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I never found a big foot nowadays that\nConclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things [noise] why because I've never read it credible article\nImplying that they did and since the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source\nIt never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em cramped up\nSo when you hear these stories are these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and to say at the time they say if it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I Would have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though no no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who shot and why aren't they name there and if somebody's writing about it than fat\nSeems to be a there are instances where and in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they describe them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them it's not going to happen\n... big foot wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your on coast to coast am\nWe\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\nNBC News radio I'm Liz Warner the former Soviet who signed a landmark nuclear treaty is warning the president not to tear up the deal Mikhail Gorbachev\nTold Russia's intersects news agency that pulling the U.S out of the deal would be a mistake\nThe foreign minister of Saudi Arabia says the people who are responsible for the gas of Jim ... acted outside the scope of their authority representative Adam Schiff told ABC's This week he thinks the Saudis may be influenced by President Trump's family finances\nThis is the the very problem with the president not releasing his tax returns it leaves the American people wondering is us Saudi policy been driven by something other than national interests\nFor Floridians are get after a rafting accident in Costa Rica the group was rafting down the neuron yo river when their raft capsized the jackpot\nFor the mega millions and Powerball lotteries are topping now a total of two billion dollars Liz Warner NBC News radio\nAtlanta Jean along twenty Eighteen presented by capital what happens on December ... former arena starring Sean ...\nWould you see\nOn right now is\nJanuary ... presented capital line ...\nRadio show every Monday through friday at five pm on TALK radio six forty W GST more streaming live on the radio at\nThe ... show Monday through friday by GM talk radio six forty ...

worst disaster in us naval history there to authors are Sarah ... and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nRight here from George\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen most teenagers are Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was the ship that carry the bomb and sunk [laughter] and\nHad to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter] imagine that and you know\nThrough looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I I Will someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could say that you know someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it and yeah flash forward graduated from college and then we'll know ones pulled the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to me of the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so\nThey have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd land for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project from either way I got involved when\nI had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic for over a two story and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this\nEmail from this young filmmakers named Sarah ...\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that I'm being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she fits the two major\nProduction company and they said hey this is the best thing we can find a better\nThat we only they many theories on foot\nSo you're getting ready for a while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write so very family and friends he raced out and and make contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I Am and maybe a veteran who didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise]\nAnd\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help rewrite the book [laughter] so um I ... that I had to figure\nOut how to manipulate or in a way to help her but uh eventually over the course of several\nMonths we finally met and then uh\nWe agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest into twenty four ... um and then when we did it for the project tickets and a half\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely part of what I wanted to tell but\nReally I mean the major objective was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nThinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more ... you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift is less than what she did um besides being sent [noise]\nBut I'll tell you grab ... my father was a at open now and he ... he drove a landing craft from those ships took us troops on the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned more with the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm a small part that a lot of people don't know if that she with the flagship at the battle of half an hour where your father drove

chapter on his voted Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality alive\nHe was a

left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in the you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers accounts because by the time that they're a rescuer arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening\nThat point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and ... attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported there were so sick they could walk on their backs you know from shark to shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them there's want to kill you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down the stretch they oh there's food all just reached grab some boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and ... and by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then if you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was\nNearly out of his head at this point and put his talk back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship that everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines the\nUm and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a\nSixteen rap between there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case there were four groups\nOf four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any water that was available was only available\nOn the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know the second day in and the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the de hydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nSo some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't and then others would you know take small for it is that the the water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels first\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks most of them\nGone away or you couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it it stunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them all\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal later a un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we've got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a bart Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With friends and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who were wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit within minutes late night ... just after midnight\nAnd they see that you know kind of explosion coming from below and\nThere's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action do you think well maybe this is true or something of that nature but yeah I guess standing kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it and he did actually tried to report it a couple of times\nAnd yet the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nC. A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com or call\nOne eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five [noise]\n\n\n\nWind been since I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined or conspired to make things worse is if things just sort of ... through the cracks or they made their survival you've been more improbable\nWell at their mention there with the the um\nDeparture message that didn't go through from ... to the Philippines there with the tenant on the Philippine died who had received a message saying that if\nAnd if the combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well\nHe wasn't the brightest guy in the world and that as a matter of fact had received a fitness report thing as match that he thought well if I don't have to reporter rivals of that and shit I guess that means I don't have to report non are rivals either\nAnd then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the pending invasion at the Japanese home island so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combined to make it said the Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until I pd one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm ... happened to be flying over the area that the survivors just find it in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the book Sarah ah about these pilots that they dropped all the supplies and trying to uh give these uh guys in the water or something they hang on to and they're they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to head back and there was one guy who's swimming way out\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I I don't know where he was swimming too or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness yeah your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left an airplane to help this loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to leave men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected than the rest of their lives they they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they you know\nWho do we take if we're in our ship or else the VP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive and you know that was the burden they carry till the end of their life\nYou know it's wartime as ... said the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and um there's a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but uh [noise] is it an accident that this story was kept all out of the newspapers until BJ day I'm In well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the time they've not believe it was an accident though the rat to occurred beginning on August second\nUh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August fourteenth between the time zone fourteenth fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not and now the Indianapolis had been found in these papers did not release it Washington not fit in Washington did not release it\nUntil the jade de until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war with over stuff you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headline\nYou know Japan quit the war is over and then maybe below the fold in a very small article you let the Indianapolis cruiser sunk\nAnd reporters that time believed that Washington and the Navy's specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that with\nYou know resulted in a lot of almost nine hundred men on the very brink of the end of the war\nSarah talk to me about a captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and and was the court marshal inevitable could let him slide given that the war is just stand did or did they have to pursue this\nPoor really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating this on the streets but their family is now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial it would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who is involved and who knew\nWith the original ...\nMy road trip but but then you know and the truth that camera that it is offering that to another level there's your camera has smart aged ER\nThat's holding corps
