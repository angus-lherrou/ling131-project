toast everyone throws a piece of toast at the screen\nOf people have call and response where they're yelling things up at the screen or you know there's rice prone during the wedding and I think it's an immersive experience but I also because of the sexuality of the film you\nKnow people who are sixteen Seventeen years old and are kind of emerging into their adult life it's kind of an ... thing

I'm going to I'm going to close my eyes in yes you'll remote dealing now that you were on telegraph road Mm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear Michigan viewing skill near Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your back here my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nShe'll do this all ... really steer you in the direction where you are now I mean you've got a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected a vice president of the Psychological Association will get into that but is this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and what time versus the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no um [noise] well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Kuhn book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolution and that book that that we live in a paradigm or a world view I kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitch all the Apollo fourteen\nOut you're not ready and\nDidn't apply for the job at no attic sciences but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and\nWorked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal cycle what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of\nNotion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough the understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is really really\nWell you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually strollers brewery what she'll remember\nRemember the Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThe ... which we're you know I don't know I haven't really ... yes all Hampshire\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\n... ... what have you know what did you learn a bold\nNew experiences of all the other side what to do what can you conclude at this point\nI Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste a sin that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your a culture that accepts\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nYou people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intentions of very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to ... you know make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any doing much do ... [laughter]\nEvery day more and more [laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures expect from the world and you\nThink so too and I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism as the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses\nYou got it Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nIn our ... our next hour we'll take phone calls about this but I also want you when we come back to talk about the story of reincarnation about a little child that was born with three words march\nAnd we'll talk about that it's an amazing story so many more Dr Merrill Lynch blitz were those were website is her name and we've done it linked up for U.S Coast to coast day I'm dot com that makes it really easy\n... literature out six days a week it was a great way to keep up on all things coast\nWe detailed program recaps was fascinating to me in St Louis upcoming didn't bow and weekly free audio groups must have caused resign Oklahoma goes to goes to um dot com ...\n\n\n\n[noise]\nIn the news radio I'm Liz mourners\nA letter with the names of more than twenty four hundred law school professors across the country is being sent to the Senate to oppose the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh President Trump is taking credit for solving a problem the NFL was having with Canada broadcasting the super bowl the Obama\nThe jury weighing in on the fate of Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke will resume deliberations tomorrow\nA judge ordered the twelve member panel sequestered for the night noting they had been in court since seven AM Van Dyke is charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Seventeen year old look one McDonald in twenty fourteen\nThe jury begin deliberations around one PM following closing arguments and instructions from the judge Van Dyke faces a possible life sentence if convicted of first degree murder Brian shook NBC News radio\nLizards or NBC News radio\nJohnson's Homer wrapped up in an amazing come from behind run to the giants the giants went on to lose the series of the Yankees for Thompson's miraculous home run remains one of the most memorable moments in sports history referred to as the shot heard round the world\nThis week in Nineteen eighty Larry Holmes retain since W.

the work of Ernest backer who wrote that great book a denial of death\nAnd they have found that if people are you know functioning in a in a normal way and they get triggered by some reminder of their mortality it can lead to very pathological types of behaviors\nBut if you can bolster their sense of a personal worth their their value in the world and you you enhance their self esteem you'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more optimistic they care about other people\nSo I think if we can approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI think you can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no did you did you know agree Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked\nWith him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for death makes like possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find [laughter]\nUm but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nWe're descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death if you are like quarter law ... knew this was challenged ducked was challenged could you prove that there's life after\nThis would make a great one\nYeah ... show and I love Ina courtroom\nLet's do it [laughter] so you have a judge and jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses that common goal\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences\n... put it right there\nThen you get into this question of what\nOne shift people's mind about that question and is it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and\nShowed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting you know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something\nYou know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after ... let's talk a little bit Maryland and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it plays a role but employees with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness and also\nOur lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts we live in a paradigm or a world view and\nThe interesting thing to me about world is is that we don't even know that we have them and yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectation\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of the functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation and to expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness Lou ... outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting it is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because every ... is filled with light and with that intention\nTo manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain I don't think it's an ... the phenomenon of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like\nYou know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the
