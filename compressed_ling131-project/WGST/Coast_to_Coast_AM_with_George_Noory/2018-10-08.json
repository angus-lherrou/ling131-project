the flu for six years now and it gets even more confusing or the big flu virus now is called age three and two and the ... it's the big hitter especially on the the elderly but George\nThe numbers fly all over the place so the CDC is scaring us that a hundred and Seventy five children died last year but fifty percent of those had preexisting conditions you look on the flip side twelve thousand

vaccines on the market and the CDC has picked up the shop gun and fired away\nToo many hey use any one of these vaccines I don't like that do you oh no not at all because\nYour drugstore may be

coast\nAm shooting them before I even did it [laughter] get out of that that that\nSounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology are going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that place turned out to the area fifty one\nFrom Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada and um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up\nAnd then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas and area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd so it seems to me that there has been a space for us all ready for a long time and that space force serve the dual purpose I mean it can make\nA the defense of earth against other earthlings\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them that are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would've destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country then why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent\nBut still why don't we do with ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case you don't you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving us to be\nSafe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but on here this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this\nIs a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a theorists talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel [noise] um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again because a lot of people\nBelieve especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here\nAnd modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever if their goal is to come back here and in slavery was it might be a better fate for us to commit to global suicide in other words\nAnd again I told you this was going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know callers on us and and work us like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan I'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made\nA one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un you know if what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people who are banding together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to raw as well and um you know the the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep I mean there is something\nTo this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some uh beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology\nIn order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do and so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your

say who knows the secret word if you reply and you stay Tesla I'm going to take\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George ... with you again I'm going to give you a little Halloween trivia here Halloween is an annual holiday ... celebrated each year on October thirty first originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Saddam Hussein when people would light bonfires and were costumes to ward off goes\nIn the evening before was known as all Hallows eve and then later Halloween there's an interesting Josh\n[noise] yeah it absolutely is I mean did it goes back thousands of years and um I I think foul and was the original pronunciation and they would talk about this being a period of time when of course\nThey were ... you know reaping the rewards of harvest but preparing for the cold dead months of winter and so they believe that as the world was sort of transitioning\nInto the cold dead time\nThere was a period where the the bill was so thin in fact the Europeans often talk about what they call thin places the boundary with so thin between where we are and where the spirits are that we can encounter each other for at least one or two nights and ... and interact with each other\nAnd the good part was well some of your loved ones might come through but then there were also all of these creepy evil being sticking them through and so you'd you'd wear a mask so do you blend in with evil ones and they'd be like oh you're one of us\nYou know and and they they wouldn't harm you but from a more um I I think updated point of view George this also happens to be the time of year when a here in our part of the world\nThe earth is shifting away from the sun and so uh that means not only does it get colder and darker as we tilt into that mysterious back a black void of space\nBut furthermore uh we are not being as\nA strongly bombarded\nBy the the radiation coming from the sun and therefore subtle things\nThat might otherwise have been sort of brown doubt and the noise of the sons radiation could pop a little more so for example let's say a I shine a flashlight at towards you outside on a bright sunny day\nWhile you're not going to notice that as much as you would if I did it on a dark night right and so what happens in general\nBut it's still there but it's still there it's still there but it's just not as prominent a noticeable so this is\nThe time of year when we shift away from the sun and a lot of these subtle energies electromagnetic electro static and otherwise that are associated with the spirits another pair a moment that these are suddenly more distinctive\nAnd a play more of a significant role in in our awareness and of course we're we're also it Hansing this because we're we're paying more attention and we're looking out for it more\nLet's take some calls here with you Josh as we continue chatting I Want to ask you about Robert The hunted all in a moment let's go to Charles first time caller in Asheville North Carolina hey Charles go ahead\nYou're with us no\nHe's not let's get John in Virginia Beach Virginia trying hey John go ahead\nYou're like gosh I won't tell you the story that after they back in the nineties\nNow I I never believed in those spirits UFOs eighties any things that ... however ... Nineteen years middle nineties uh I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a little little showbiz pointed at church\nAnd I was in that close to the way but I just said you know any way I Am I went I was late getting there so I had sent me back treacherous act\nAnd the service is going on and all of a sudden I felt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the push you a check and I looked up and it was my uncle they just passed away\nAnd he\nTold me he said John ... your car and I wish I was shot at it and what to do it again you said John don't value car when\nI was so scared I had to get out so I get up late and what he was gone\nStill I was ... and ...\nAnd so I got it right on our friend of mine in the next morning I called my cousin which was the son named it that way and they asked ... bringing my car to me and I get it right back home he shouldn't matter though\nSo he and his belt and get my car and to let a cage for them that\nAnyway he um it was that in my car when they pull that it should talk a lot and they were hit\nBy a truck and they they want to but they were extremely you know injured correct I mean they had ... votes and\nBut I never told me by this and I was really a lot to say anything that when I did tell two of my close friends and um\nOther leg and not with the show they have the\nI guess you know up until now I haven't told\nMe in the in the warning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the\nCar you know what I didn't want to go out and he told me down and\nSaid you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat they engage in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a time I had to think like a safe stage ghost you get all the same thing for them they're seen\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all the time it was happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like that song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here and this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little\nA minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on but once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate of humans call the presents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one especially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm that person may be I found it\nThe fact that he or she can now see\nThe future to a degree that you cannot or it might almost be like comparing the perspective of enhanced to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see that the aunt is more sensitive to what's happening I'm On a lower level so anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who Passover might\nDefinitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this case John it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de hunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and and and this is very funny because\nHe still does ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there they were taking him out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations on him\nAnd it was when the shock wave of curses\nAnd bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this call here and you know\nRobert who is fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that uh he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people\nWho were going to see him now\nLet's come back and just a moment here on coast to coast am it takes some final phone calls with Josh and the next hour we're talking haunted World War

for Katie Hoff or log in\nAnd I'm cleaning it on ... it's called the day room you know where the site people come they do the activities and all of a sudden I say this will nine year old boy I Would say\nMaybe ten eloquently I couldn't seem directly straight you know just that core I perfectly and he's looking at me and I start mouth and they continue mop like okay this is kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering\nIt seems like since I've been working there for about a month like he think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit to really show theirselves or and he wasn't supposed to be there or was he I don't think so but I talked to see in a\nIn a couple of the nurses and they told me\nThat they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone to watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys think because like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because it's full moon I could tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\n... do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no owned have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf the ways in hospital where do you think Josh\n... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy filled being\nMagnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world and the northern hemisphere most places have a colder drier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touched the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nA in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source a creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro static charge and yet\nYou go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there regarding how that the non physical realm\nI'm a spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm\nAnd that reminds me of how something like a magnet has some visible build around at that creates a physical effect\nBut then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the higher likelihood of experiencing something go sleep spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nInsurance don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of that goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nAnd he writes the anti matter column which looks at\nFringe science and the paranormal for the online magazine he uses his experience in journalism\nAnd his interest in both go slower and the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard talking about some hunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that way\n[laughter] on Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up yeah\nThank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't\nInterested in ghost stories horror movies and all like so I just learned ah I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a of a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or didn't Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best\nAbsolutely in how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell I after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nA and that people have compiled a numerous books\nSo I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural so I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple goes stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two it turned into beaches to really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two where these goals stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular kind\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll ghost stories of country music there was there sort of a light hearted aspect of those stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and\nWorld War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know uh all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring a what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research haunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories\nAnd I think go stories are are one way that people help preserve the past but sometimes they're not perfect in the history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these stories\nAnd trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct a you know I've been I've never looked for whether a a ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went through the little big corn oh we're customs less than was\nAnd you know he's convinced that wanted to Gettysburg Reno was fun to write I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting visit because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um [noise] in their ... essentially two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war\nAh causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that you know\nThe shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one playing to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what\nThe skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most talented a bowl\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say ah Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourists there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of French for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when\nThe daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunker ... they didn't really talk too much about it but then later the daughter said that when she was in there she saw these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe\nTheir uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff immediately ... uh recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that away from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what\nCould have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences\nEngland was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any story similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handles hundreds of them were going

fighter pilots for a night I'm fighting a squadron were documented some of some of the most startling run ins with these UFOs\nThere's a story of alone be Seventeen crew that watch to UFO track them for miles I I think almost a about an hour and then of course a lot of people consider what's known as the battle of Los Angeles\nWas a great story of a ...\nThat's an amazing story and a and usually I think the was the story was the moving Nineteen forty one with John Belushi they made it seem\nIt ... it was just based on what the war department called war nerves in other words this was\nA shortly after World War two I think er I'm Sorry after the bombing of Pearl Harbor I Believe it was in February of Nineteen forty two [noise]\nAnd aircraft gunners anti aircraft guns started firing in the air there was all kinds of pandemonium a and the war department just said the the people were nervous but I found it very uh an account from a very uh good witness\nWho are actually it was ... a professor\nAt occidental college um later he was just a kid at the time and he said that ah what he witnessed was a huge object\nThat was pretty much just standing at ... sitting still in the middle of the uh right above the ocean that these guns were trained right on it and it didn't seem to have any effect and then it drifted it almost sounded like it drifted right over his head so it was a\nTo me that was more of a story about something weird happening in the sky let alone a war nerves\nAll and and they shot against the Matthew people could hear ... sounds yeah average eating something\nRight this this person actually said uh some of the shells were landing a few feet away from them and they had a the spotlight trained on it I think there's a a pretty dramatic picture that shows that\nIt is dramatic Matthew swing with us his latest book haunted World War two where do you get the book after you\nYou can get it at Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com go chi or a a local bookstore and see if they have it in if they don't shake 'em down and try to get it in for me I'd appreciate it\nWhat about haunted ships from World war two\nWell I didn't want to just I didn't want to leave or our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside well\nYeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so\nThe interesting thing about uh after World War two was you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got all them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports\nThey brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness there a shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call them shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing this shadow creature around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship base a haunted sites\nUh there there is a story about a man dressed in a white naval uniform who uh wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on their\nUh and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those are and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved them and have him back here goes and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seem to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy ... for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\n[noise] [noise] yeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but uh when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of\nOf country these tragedies just seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed\nUm to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew ... we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of your a haunted rock and roll stories those are those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites\nAnd they just keep coming more and more and more they just never stopped like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks

[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast Matthew swing with us Matthew I'm Adolf Hitler as sick as he was was also interested in the cold did you come across anything that the dealt with that\nYou know I did and I came away with a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler in the cold\nOr you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life but what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial when I'm sure there'll people have\nDifferent ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too but it sounds like Hitler's early\nA wash a fee was influenced by a cone groups like the full society in the real society very prevalent in uh\nPre World War two Germany in that area but what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not in a coal theorists but more of an incredible sociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power and so what you see later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of those so called groups he starts to go after fortune tellers\nAnd astrologers so I came away with a little bit of a different opinion on the cold in in Nazi Germany\nUh likewise I was sort of fascinated that the occult played a much bigger role in my opinion a among uh\nThe side of the allied side so there were\nThe wiccan in England who uh try to get together to uh spiritually\nOr go after the Nazi regime or they held a meetings and the ... got together with the express purpose of trying to to stop 'em Germany from invading England and likewise uh and I really picked us up from a frequent guest on coast to coast Mitch Horwitz\nYes ah the allied a new thought ... a movement those a lot of the practitioners for that group were very involved and to try and use spiritual techniques a cult techniques\nTo stop Hitler from uh from succeeding so those were\nA different ways that a ... you know when I tried to write a book I'm I'm really I Know a lotta people write books because they know a lot I like to learn a lot so I go into a some of these stories with really preconceived notions\nAnd then as I delve into it I find twists and turns that that I tried to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\n[noise] well the theme about haunted rock and roll is that I really when I started writing hundred rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times ah and ah\nYou know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special cult power and maybe people that were into the Cold War attracted to it\nBut after writing of the country book and then revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll what a ... a ... I came away with is the thought that music is really just to consciousness raising tool it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also\nA key part of a lot of um historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the listener and and the musician that I think makes either people more open\nTo things like the supernatural the cold or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of of visions so that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of those book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that have faded a haven't shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\n... yeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of\nThese stories in these tales in the supernatural usually start out than to than musician to musician\nA person the witnesses it talks to another friend and then for me it usually bubbles up on line and blog posts and in newspapers will investigate I'll look into it goes counters will be attracted to the site so it takes a while I'm I'm Still waiting for some good ghost stories about David Bowie for example\nJames Dean of course died young in a car accident and was in his car chopped up into little pieces and they saw all the parts and apparently they were haunted\n[noise] yeah that's a ... ... the name of his car yeah he um he had a car was a poor spider or was involved in Iraq and then\nA pieces of it because it was really a race car um pieces of it were salvaged and [laughter] I Know there's one story about um uh he uh one race car driver used a piece in his car and a car fell on him and I think crushed him to death [noise]\nBelieve it or not there's a parallel to that in the haunted World War two book there was a\nI think it was a beat twenty four that crash landed in the desert of North Africa pieces of it were recovered a veteran now in the national I think air force a museum\nA and pieces of that plane were reported to be cursed in that uh I think some of the pieces went went into a\nA a a plane that later crashed I think a couple of planes crashed based on and so so there is a connection\nAll right let's take some calls for you Matthew let's pick it up by going to Frank in Hollywood, Maryland again to start in any Frank\nI'll be back with you when you made any subject India I I I I think they had to pay some hard things at the uh uh and not the Nazi\nGermany but what about a place where people were murdered by by not see a\n... I watch a film where they were just shot three hundred shot down over what did they get that they were shot down a credible la Salle was found\nAnd I'm Wondering if any any hunting and in a remote places where you're\nNot you're not take my answer off air okay ...\nThanks for that that's a that's a great question and I believe I Know exactly which\nWhich footage you're talking about and believe it or not one of the stories that I came across a is I think from that area because I I Believe that might have been taken in Poland Czechoslovakia\nAnd there are stories about some of the victims of the Jewish victims of those atrocities um that still hunt those areas again I I I found out of a difference for those those people that I Would leave them out of the book and and wouldn't try to try to um\nYou know be looked at like I was making any money from that so I I left that out but yeah definitely those stories crop up and I guarantee you if you were in those areas\nYou would find a lot of go slower a lot of folklore and a lot of good stories about those places\nMatched up we go to Charles Elgin, Texas St Charles go ahead\nEither yeah well I was a ... at the uh me and my dad were uh uh right I was riding along in a pickup truck over in a at a\n...
