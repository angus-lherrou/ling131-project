the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day as good as I said oh my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked it uh uh uh later on or\nYou are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group of science reporters people who actually write nonfiction\nAbout science in into very accessible way um I put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a lot to really tell me and\nPlay you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars and was she ... she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is just love it you know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into these subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approaches the sciences there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students should be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I did you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you huh [laughter] well first\nOf all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America corny corny Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I get in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life of you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not that big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's it's\nI met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it and so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my faith very very seriously and so when I say

science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nA carcass if you will but pretty well preserved because it was getting ice\nAnd they were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryer and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on from DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raise\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before and\nThat is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're drawing a traits in other words we're flying\nIn the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure\nWe're defining the natural flow where to find the natural order of thing and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice ... nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none I I forget what it was the original was\nFor margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right\nNow and we all know margarine is not so great for exactly what\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature\nWe've got to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you\nKnow a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we didn't do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a ... year peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen\nRobots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story\nAbout this guy I think his name is Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuits are stealing industrial secrets and focus on but he\nRecently applied to the area and was granted I'm\nA tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence [noise] and you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing that he's he's basically\nSaying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on it it it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robot powered\nBy artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect\nGod because they know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because he did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the chance that the you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around\nGo yeah yeah I probably am someone smoke right an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or her you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in\nI mean it it's pretty clear that these computers are not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations ah but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very\nGood at that well you know like you they're ... they're putting it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small but you know\nOne day they're general like he was forced seemed to be even greater than\nOurs that the day of the singularity that's for the day when all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so [noise]\nYeah and it and I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right if we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get then the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I used to go to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains give ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine so\nI like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose it you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how is raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile than people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future we'll get back to that thought with Michael ... shoot you the number is coming up and about thirty minutes for you to join the conversation

I Know several people who have a ... who has a trouble walking or they lost their ability to walk in the spinal injuries and and the this to them is a dream\nI mean the I ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... your muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually\nA movement a call the trans human movement where as you say ... or the idea is to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there so there is usable there's where a ball and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms ... them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses\nBut see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat requires you to wear harness and you have to ... you\nKnow these are these are arms that he can move with his paw so they're they're wired to his mind\nAnd I ... a fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you and even even and um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there\nWhere you know write it just it just it it you know so so for a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pound backpack you know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella Scott what's on the take some of that load off of their own skeletons\nI I think that's a\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not\nBeing facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's what it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence yeah from\nThe ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about\nMaybe some of our advancements should not be consequences free isn't it I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me that I see that politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death\nBy having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but [laughter] and and that leads a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right and then I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go run there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter]\nYeah I Know and and now and and the ... group you know I quote him in the book in Russia is\nVery upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not shoot another word to give them complete autonomy\nAnd and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment ago you were going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight yeah ... it in some ways you know\n... that I often I often think to myself you know\nYeah all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we can't are just still the same you know all our faults in our ... our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would\nPropose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum not the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor tuna under which means if you can't win a conventional war\nBecause you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism\n... you know I mean that that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending some terminal but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nAnd his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story about the the\nScientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hat on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay well we had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now there's\nThis is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with it I could understand if somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then\nWhere does that end in how far along are they in the pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it or just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have so up the\nThe the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy and Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nIt started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was cleaning one thing he said there was an intruder and how they came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang onto the thought

I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [laughter]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it to his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing the these women wearing a fit with the one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey don't have soles God didn't make them they will have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have it spent ... million right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because\nBy that time so bad since you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into I D I F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense that it's a fair and ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be on the ... the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will yeah but yeah I don't give it a little plug for an up [laughter] they're I think you can you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation talked about in mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of upon and find it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the the mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this area that you're talking where we've achieved get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\n[noise] well it it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse or some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating ah and and so I I'd I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or\nA mental experiment that people talk about a lot ... ... we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and soul yawn\nThat you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\n[laughter] you know it's like the sky net running it's like running\nOn on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's a horror from saying or from the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting ... getting some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right happy I haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know [laughter]\n... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so Jack Lew bad actor is exactly where I'm living and by the way to somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal\nOn the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast saying David\nGoing hey my question for I mean it's terrible and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good\nQuestion [laughter] yeah and I think he would just leave them and we just love them [laughter] uh\nNo Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nI uh

kind of\nYou get what kind of machinery and he's on dialysis is on ... and ...\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very helpful um they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight it's still not crystal clear she can she can make out fate than it's given or an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that or is already working on a second generation\nA that will help actually restore sight to people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that

want to play the story I Hope you went to coast to coast am dot com and watched this video of the Oregon pot shops and the moving jar if you didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote down\nDowntown Oregon City there are very funny at least that's the theory behind\nParanormal activity witness that science erode treat a candidate dispensary what's going to happen now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy ... next to it\nI thought it was happening and I felt like somebody was standing or like somebody right\nHere suddenly the jar bombs on the level surface that just happens then Andy remembered the surveillance camera with others I\nNot long after that this happened watch the Penn it's completely still and no one's around when suddenly the pans begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law ... certified ... GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with you as a farm\nIn ... so so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there's no real explanation for why there are going there\nBut that video ... especially in the fact that we were really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it you want to jump in an open lines of the ... let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina coast to coast to get us started might\nBring good morning hours\n[laughter] we're good thank you\nYeah Halloween all out of the night the hills run with the animal shelter\n[laughter] yes well I Am right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's now going into the are going to

download action match by robots now but it all again because you\nCan't so [laughter] I guess some of the feelings and the personality of the word I I'm with you in your it I mean we're the answer to that\nOh the Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I I [noise] it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's bad enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that so peace though is a little more\nComplicated so a lot of people would say then it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were why wouldn't it have a soul if other people out there have you know\nUh other meant if there are other people who have problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease\nYou know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology on soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about\nTest tube babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I'm In a world power guys first of all for not let in for five years I don't want to get too much into it right\nUm after last night I have a couple of things to say on this in March ... her and I'm a revival manner or would it have anything to eat ... that were to survive\nI mean we even know what to do and I said environment now and furthermore our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people to sign up for survival situation\nAnd there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiling surprise for\nFor years to come for for them is families with multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple multiple and um\nAnd we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not\nWe are usable and we don't know even with training we don't know if the supplies which says ... somebody in a cave\nOr in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt it or you like to um volunteer myself not to a consuming somebody's\nSupplies but just chew on my cell and my child you then I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even\nHis they themselves and interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster and you don't know who's going to survive it could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid who haven't had any training on how to year the supplies that are stored\nUp with ... or or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I I just wanted because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just would be a clear\nFor people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix or there's this series called like the men with three wives zero three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade\nA Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife and they are they following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab\nAnd um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having you know food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what it even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nA ... but uh yeah so we're willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only thing I ever get to bring your kid a done is in a in Kent, Ohio I knew well until ... am done\nRather a I'm happy to have\nA you know I got a kick out of your

I'm always thinking along spiritual line or when the decline [noise]\nUm [noise] I I take great quality very seriously I'm interested in a book called the ... river theater yeah I'm\nFrom the from the turn of the last century right yeah\nYeah I think it was published or and or like you know eight um apparently with what they say according to the the introduction of ... it was kind of crowd cried out written transcribe by Levi Dowling who transcribed it from the classic\nRecord or no also known as a book of remember if another way of putting it [laughter]\nI'm fascinated with this book because it is her role in many ways for for for gospel um and and describing like Jesus and also covers like that so called missing years of his wife\nA highly ... ... years or so [laughter] um but it does talk about the different ages and that that the pope before title of the book is very current gospel of Jesus karma Christ of the highest in age\nAnd somewhere and I'm not I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ that I'm not in a lot of conservative Christian I'm ... I'm more in line with the Quakers and I'm fascinated with the idea of um\nThe beginning of an age where they've got to be occurring age began if their disagreement about\nThat oh yeah is is that I'm going to determine oh go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're ... I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or and this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism impose modernism Marxism and neo Marxism and you know it all\nWe could ever do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what's something that just otherwise it'd be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I ... I ... I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible 'cause I looked it up several times and and it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any arguments for or against it just sort of like it it's sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time the missing so called years\nUm because there's a lot of different books that address that and we'll do they all tell the same story though do you\n[noise] I don't know I'm not familiar with all the book when I'm familiar with recovery ... last year I did want to wrap it up quickly a lot of could go ask you about this book I wanted to say um I I agree with that guy kind of what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier with a caller\nI'm Talking about the liar along the line is is\nIt your your creative freedom we have\nA we we all worship something you know whether it's money or ... or whatever God him or her so that we really appreciate that great of if you if you're if you're working your way I I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside to that for\nSure but I did it because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use it responsibly\nOh yeah we have heard about it you're not quite so individually but can we cut her collectively\nCouldn't agree more to have some kind of shared values\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political you're I I think what holds us together as a country is\nA I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance or security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut what people talk about each the border that makes as a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona and write or soon to be a a a cans and isn't a like didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have ... ... there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we've got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to young philosophy should be where every education starts I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country I think that's what we need to always focused\nOn that's the that's the most important thing to other things are also important but that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot\nAh for people who don't find it interesting pardon the blather but gosh darn it those great thank you so much for jumping\nIn an open lines and look forward to borrow night so the most elusive serial killer\nIn history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case\nPolitical make that decision I Want to think a George ...

know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean yeah I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America corny corny Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head a frozen and uh with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories are thought and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in a in a sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth and saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a supercomputer and downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is the artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the Ford has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[laughter] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's\nNo what's on Michael ... list [noise] next on coast to
