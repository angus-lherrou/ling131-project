fourth age if I were in Ilan mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time\nThat will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nWe know these technologies can do an enormous amount of good they can they can feed the hungry and diagnose illness and do all of these things and I'm not sure they're introducing an element of like it may turn on those uh that that may be more\n... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine would do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\n... and it was transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could out of the airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people think when you got the copilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer fly a network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were\nA few years back [noise] what is fueling the grows in the ... and just really the incredible grows on this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the human being\nThe main thing that feels that technology is it's actually finally working a\nHey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that was very interesting reason which was\nNew and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did that being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nNeither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can if if you out of business that can make probably any department in your business than ten percent past ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some really cool things if there were no more advanced ... and I ah we probably had twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is uh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever had a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nA it's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said uh it was a camera and it can make sure\nSomebody wearing a puppy or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it was up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence\nThat fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a ton of his killing systems I think it's disingenuous the\nDebate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I was the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic gun tour it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions have require people to make killed decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think that we're going to build\nA a weapon systems it's going to have\nFor for three very easy reasons you can argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you then argue that you\nWill be saving lives of soldiers ...\nA ... and whatever country you are and and and third you know that they will they will work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost going to war which\nIf you're

five nine for nine seven two three four\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nWelcome back by Reverend Reese with us survivor and do you think technology will ever replace pulse still people who deliver the mail to our houses\nYou know um I I have a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it\nI mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make a human do that job there's a word for that that's called B humanizing mhm because if if you just use a person for stand in\nFor a machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in we only need you to be a machine that that we invented\nA is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine young machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years has ... has had unemployment between five and ten percent\nAll the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years of the jobs vanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ...\nYears right and we had rising wages and because so why are we able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out of everybody she says it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity so whatever\nIf you can self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city\nIf you are I mean like\nIt's hard it's hard to necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's gonna be this ... billion people are going to use it what do you think there's going to do their jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were gonna vanish she would say well that's going to be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you when you see at sea air being be Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody every time technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do\nA what a way to do you know they use spell a drink you know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming that you have a special order and you want you want to send your food back or something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the Russians were I mean there are so many\nThings it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah\nSo well correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nUh people are going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movement generally going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch sure well out\nTo run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I Am happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that um but like you said that oh you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it and let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we have these by ... which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain because there's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you've got three hundred and two neurons in his brave they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain that three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so\nThere are so many we we are so\nSpectacularly amazing\nUh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine is\nYou know ... leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages beak already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick\nHumans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do and and we used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for all of human history there's just never been enough for the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig it knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know do man of was not tourists anymore because 'cause we could all communicate and the ... couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave his prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened uh you invented the nation state and that's why I dozen years ago you kind of shut your clock by it all over the world\nA giants decisions emerge ... America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we're the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what that's gonna what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called them robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with a mass production I mean they they did things faster than humans can I'm coming from St Louis\nI've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bond will be er a by the thousands in the bottles\nHumans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that is already Fishell intelligent hid it in that I had to be frightening\nIf if you saw if you were a skilled crafts person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how terrifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are filling up bottles by hand\nHope so I I don't know that I Would say a blanket thing for every single person on the planet like because you can just ...\nCareers that you you can't like the electrician or a ballet dancer or anything that requires a psychiatrist or anything that requires a kindergarten teacher requires you to be president in any in any way but for people who are the information industry then yeah it was just\nThere was a series of commercials on I don't know if you remember it in the nineties that someday you will you know should the box from the beach someday you will and all of the things in those commercials\nKind of thing for the army did really stay with us by Ron you're going to come back and take some final calls in a final trap next on coast to coast than\nThe coast website is no streamline for mobile devices Greek news if your ... simply want to enjoy our website on your moon visit coast to coast am dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or\nNBC News radio I'm Lisa Carter police and the NTSB searching for answers after a weekend limo crash least twenty people gather in upstate New York\nIt's a question everyone here is asking hounded an SUV limousine headed to a birthday party on Saturday plow through this intersection taking the lives of twenty people\nNBC's town Staten Island New York police say Eighteen died in the Leno and to pedestrians were also killed tropical storm Michael is prompting a hurricane watch for Florida's panhandle and Big Bend regions\nMichael's forecast to be near or at major hurricane strength quite reaches the north eastern Gulf tomorrow night in when state senators Susan Collins is elaborating on why she voted to confirm chances Canada now to the Supreme Court\nSpeaking yesterday they made Republicans said she believed that Dr Christine Blasey Ford was sexually assaulted by someone but Collins isn't can than it was kind of non lethal Carter NBC News radio\nHey Atlantic ... joined me weekdays from ... pm to get caught up on the stories of the day the Dana Barrett show is live and local and right here on TALK radio six forty W GST\nTo learn how you can help paralyzed veterans visit PBA dot or\nGetting ready to be in the new view streaming edition\nNew to Netflix this week's check out some new stand up for Moe armor with a new cooking series called salt fat acid heat for the kids you got new seasons of so few of the first ... back in business and I do not there's the Netflix Original twenty tutor\nOn TALK radio six forty build U.

first and then made my way to San Francisco and then maybe the way down to Los Angeles\nAnd here you are and here I Am talking to you\nWriting stories about ghosts and interesting things\nRight isn't that the craziest title who called their book that goes for dogs for\nWhat some of your peers say about this the fact that I mean here you are you were corporate executive doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ghost photographer\n[noise] get out and this it's it's a ... a great question I I think because what I Do day in day out is you know rooted and data\nAnd and I'm and I'm now ... you know within the organization of being in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories and they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you make this up\nYou know you're that you're that nerd when you went [laughter] and you don't and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people and have kind of gone with me on the journey and I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent\nAnd you know they they just they can't make their way over right to our nine that's right and\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could they interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realize you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet that they\nAre afraid to tell the story because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one reason the actual on the right the book was so you know people could feel liberated it could tell they talk about their experiences 'cause\nIt's so many people have had him and I also wanted them to yeah I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who has gone through the same thing they open up\nMy gosh they talked to Iraq and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd they mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead because\nI you know when it started happening to me and I didn't know about it you know I didn't understand\nAnd a lot about what really anything that goes for ... a little bit of that medium shift if you get a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe in God if there were almost the majority\nAttorneys were barely a minority and that's grown I bet and\nAnd you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that would be over fifty per se\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and every two seconds\nTo say it again for everybody every two seconds\nSomeone in North America is Googling the word ghost not all thing yes every two seconds\nSo none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey either way I barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide and you have nothing to hide\n... journey started for you because of a personal situation\nYes did you did this started\nFrom me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I lost my mother to all timers are and you know I I you you're not only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing post and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I opened a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes work holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand but aggressive if\nYou have been doing this show me things what kind of cameras [laughter]\nAn iPhone\nI used in what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sampson camera on the phone but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're ... not that ... you know are unimportant in special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nYou know\nWhen this was going on for the entire journey looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through the journal and how did I start to heal from that you started to these strange thing\nYeah I um you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the street so Sherman Oaks scream in you know how do kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so so I had some guides I ... you know that that were helped me understand it and and now than we investigate and um\nI I started you know the ... after I saw the first coast and the photograph I um you\nKnow I kind of panic was intrigued because I I got to be honest with the Georgia I was a little bit of a skeptic before a skeptic as and it's not true\nA skeptic that you want to know\nRight right I ... it was an atheist can't possibly be true kind of person but you know it was like really really take pictures of goes\nUm so I you know I I read a lot\nI investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I did what any but he would do is just trying to understand what was happening and you know I I think\nLooking at the underlying aspect of it is I I I think when people are in grief and people are experiencing grief I'm wearing\nChaos and when you're in chaos\nUm you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this\nI'm with a lot of ease because you're looking\nYou're looking for something right you become a seeker and I think for me I became so incredibly interested in it and I would spend hours taking pictures and I would spend hours um you know putting them through a photo lab on like negative mode or add some color because you different things would come out I became\nSure and the big lesson gift\nIs about paying attention people say what's your book about and I feel I can tell you a lot of things but the number one thing I'm going to tell you the pay attention\nAnd trust yourself when you take your picture ... mhm are you aiming at something or does it just how\nIt's both\nI learned early when I started staging everything one day I set the stage pot down and I started taking pictures of the smoke because it was an ad and all burned out yet [noise] and um what I learned was\nThat smoke as like a canvas for goes\nI was able to see them so clearly in the smoke and they would like kind of pull the smoke around them\nI could see their shapes either form\nIt without the ... they were up there you could not see them\nWithout the smoke I could still see goes but not as clearly and easily and as reliable as with the smoke\nWith amazing gift you still with us Julie we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about your work is the ghosts will talk refer in our second

sure many people have talked to you about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and it's like
