O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carp and cash is ah we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines instead we just released into the atmosphere\nAnd we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm bars by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh [noise]\nAnd if you wanted to Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the uh the soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and it was thinking the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and\nThis was much Clinton freshwater in those glaciers is there is a North American oceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um but yes\nThe waters on Mars that's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain then you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and\nI'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the full but if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient\nAnd in in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be Tara formed within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the rubber what country but\nThe Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves no when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they launch those those are you assess and they bring us back\nA well most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of their cosmonauts an astronaut that had to abort but I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well ah here's the thing\nI'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia are going to both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launched companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they\nMoved away from command economy um but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and uh because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean\nYou know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise]\nAnd uh the the uh and so if if if if they are going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they\nSign up no go zone or ... ... email newsletter needed today it goes to goes to um done um\n\n\n\nThat's the ... radio show every Monday through friday at ... pm on TALK radio six forty W GST more streaming live on the I heard radio out the ... show Monday through friday ... talk radio six forty WGN\n... presented by capital what happened on December ... would you\nOn right now [laughter] and your ... presented by Capitol line\n...

I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power of attorney\nOr you have to be first class in space um Russia's going to have to change and it's interesting I mean\nYou know a a reason is still coming in a certain I mean ... ... the reason why the um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century you illiterate armies can no longer cut it well\nThey're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that ... for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact of the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm a I I Know I I I don't\nThink they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll of us who you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well it's it states that one weapons okay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists\nWell ah the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near\nMonopoly on force and um the you know um but no I I don't think that means ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just the uh the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and\nUm and also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars\nIt will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiff full okay to go\nAnd um you know he once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets [noise]\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds uh they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not to feel\nIf you can get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows or\nThe you know the next new kid on the block them a a a ... you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion too are but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel [noise] um [noise]\nWell um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets um than is using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen to your show like anyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show delighted though it and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars\nI'm Wondering I'm going to get there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like America do like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay All right well here's the thing\nUm [noise]\nThere there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay they may be microbial life and for people to say ah for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and you can even make an argument that what we did\nTo the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nTies in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed

I Believe we should uh I Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nGood point Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah Hi I'm ...

to coast to coast George story with you in our desk Brenda ... with us Brandon is a clinical therapist author perished psychologist residing in the northeastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in political constantly from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on E. and maps environmental sensitivity and grossly donors\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy gunshot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a goes in Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist ah yeah so I actually\nI actually got a day job and then I study the Paris psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit\nBut we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when apple was here in the at that time it was just the booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports why\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies for what he was an overview of what you've been doing brand\n[noise] well um [noise] you know I uh I have a degree in Perry psychology or when I was at University of Edinburgh I've studied or I'm basically it the environmental sensitivity and goats countered um and then when I got back here to this day I got back into the political part a thing\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with a goat studies\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes by encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things the way to lose the nation interpretations are overactive imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than jets ghost stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes the encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights and the cause of these\nThrowing encounters um it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know ... you know these goats I been taking our interest for millions of years\nAnd if and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several first hand account of goes way encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts going to anyone he would talk to me about goes yeah an awful conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that but I came up with some of these new theories\nAre and that's why I came out of the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research to clinical interviews I witnessed the cows and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories of five I also review the right the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters above\nWell then you bring a dose of real science to the picture your brand and then I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder\nUm the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some great you know I'm narrow psychology of fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and I'm In tangled man and non locality\nOut electricity affects us and I'm a ... and what it does outside the body so there is a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find in a rate of research article it kind of like a of boring and I don't know what's going on but\nI'm a lot of great research is out there are just a matter of finding it\nWould have you concluded today Brandon about what the ... experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of it goes they encountered that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to counter it's such a complex process and there's so many variables going on\nUm you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on um but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine\nAnd um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them really what did they help\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them or a ... view on goes\nSo that I'm In size basic wave 'em philosophy extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot it goes way countered that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um ... the or I'm sort of 'em are coming in being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment\nPeople on my main theories in the book over um what I call a a tele Patrick distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters a so I really think that um people's collapse of the ah is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way encounter\nHow important then is the person as opposed to the vet or something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghostly encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm\nA death or life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these goes way encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happened after that event um and I think when you have the advantage when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happen after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening or going to have all these emotions that are associated with it and it and that leads to sort of these bio energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to\nSend a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is that the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you\nKnow my aunt passed away right on time that I had that\nAnd I and I and I think\nThat that you can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with that my aunt she was dying I somehow she sent 'em a Taliban distress signal thing to me and\nI picked up on it and they showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um what environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics\nSensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nNBC News radio and Brian ...

something else and a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nDo you ever when you're doing these ah these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even scared to death\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm a I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio and um [noise] oh one morning a\nNew my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenalin and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah\nWell you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it\nYou know and I'm like you know what I'm going\nGo ahead and I'm going to follow through with this so I open the door the dog and me and went outside in the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I thought something like in the pond floating and I started walking and then I started running\nIt was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in there by\nYou know building upon you know all that stuff [laughter] but I found myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd with there's some sort of like the stress signals that to me with the cat and distressing that kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know but that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really amazing experience\nHow many people are normal experiences occur Brandon because the person who died ... comes back\nNever had some unfinished business and had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghost encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the death of a father or something\nRight you know I'm\n... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nThe the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion a plan that sort of kill this\nPsychological wound through with other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional me you know and if you have collective unconscious and there are collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like
