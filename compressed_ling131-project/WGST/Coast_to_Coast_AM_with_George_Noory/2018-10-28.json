back then I mean we know that this I saw it on TV a gigantic oil washed ashore where\nIn a foreign Oregon\nFlorida coast huh and so somehow I don't know where you entered the picture I mean did you see the whale and know about the well before you know what\nWhat happened the art is the at that time I worked for a national company and we had a plant here in Springfield, Oregon\nAnd we were planning to build a kind of a satellite plant and the foreign the area to utilize all the way from the middle of in that area down there\nAnd why I Want but Florence in the workplace\nWe didn't want anybody to know we were down there we were down there looking for a property\nUh we didn't want to uh you know property goes when I Know you're looking for bribery all we found it becomes a lot more

oh so\nGot the logo air pollution guy run at them from him I had a realtor by mark ...\nTwelve year old son and we had an appointment with Wilbur nine o'clock in the morning so\nWe got in a car and we drove down to Florida and we went to the port commissioned officer and\nI walked in and announced that we were there and they said well Mr currently gives them here I said what do you mean he was mayor we have an appointment at nine o'clock right and we were by the way with all the time that we were going to promote a port revenue bond that the reason we were working through the port commissioner\nSo they I says well wherever they said well he's out at the north Jersey I think there's a lot of the oil washed ashore out there so\nWhen we got all the information we thought wow what they were here let's go see the will will sure\nWhen we drove on out there and it's quite a ways out there\nWith a large pave parking lot and you can't see the ocean because there's a very a huge boon

fortunately get down and they were kind of keeping people back but but the vernacular than the Appalachian guy knew Wilbur quite well and we were able to go right down there too and actually when I when I was in the smell you couldn't believe the smell of this thing I don't know how long this thing with dad but\nIt came ashore and and uh it was just it was just awful\nIt was on its way very

I'll tell you what I said about it at the time that it could've come straight out of the White House press office now\nDo you have a copy of that letter and if you do what you read it to us please\nA\nOr have I caught you by surprise that just a matter of reaching the cross here okay well I figured somewhere you'd have that\nI'm I'll tell you what I'll tell you know I mean\nLet me read it I have it right [noise]\nMaybe I should look at the table of contents\nAnd and I'll tell you what this is a good place fine I'll take a break it's that important I'll just give you a couple of minutes to find that\nI got it you got yeah go\nI made mistakes from ignorance inexperience nova work I did not knowingly violate any law or standard of conduct no one in the White House to my knowledge violated any law or standard of conduct\nIncluding any action in the travel often there was no intent to benefit any individual with specific group\nThe FBI lied and they report to the eight eight\nTo practice covering up the legal benefits they receive from the travel off\nA GOP has lighted misrepresented its knowledge that road covered up a prior investigation the officers office

without consequences\nI was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life and want to be are ruining people it's considered a sport\nAnd that's it that's it [noise]\nThe part that really grabbed me was they I Am just in a suicide note it I don't think you would say the public would never believe the innocence of the Clintons well\nIt was interesting missed all up and said you know he said any time you have a note that suddenly appears went in there needs to be such a duck and then it seemingly benefit from ...\nIt's just the immediate cause for concern\nAnd of course here you have so many destroy the state and federal all the experts bleak statement had been taken from other documents that he had bad maybe had Britain and other contact and had been put together\nA good word you're will always try to imitate known writing\nSo er so they're trying to port of course of course so you what\nWhy the letter doesn't mention suicide or death because it's been foster apparently didn't right I'm going to kill myself for a good by world\nYet that sounded like kind of a summary note nevertheless I mean some are rising everything to this point and with some something in mind without having that suicide it did sound kind of final estimates\nAnd the failure or however you want to look at it\nAt the press conflict there were a number of reporters the number of TV networks I don't think the brand on any of the television network\nWill there we've come to a very interesting question now Reuters ran the story he had been ... to me all day long there's a lot of excitement up about it out of their writers ran the story you say the networks were their\nCBS and NBC\nOh really yeah how could they possibly ignore evidence of this sort I mean I guess CBS to choose to ignore it or protecting its sixty minutes division\nBut what about the other is and what about the Associated Press and ... you know I mean the idea of\nPreference the major news outlet the country and they didn't send a reporter\nAnd then they got a copy of the report and they said they were going to do a whole new story here at least the dispatch I mean here Reuters did a major dispatch twice the length that they usually do on these type of story\nAnd the a P uh editors when Washington were telling people yeah we're going to do a story and it ends up they do what the classic bury the story uh they said was the coup paragraph literally at the end of a long story on white water hearing but nobody's interested in in Washington\nA panel of experts to declare that the foster noted through it by the government can bother why blah blah blah\nBut this is now doing all of three international forensic experts and they are saying apparently now you tell me without qualification it's a forgery how do they come to that ...\nWell before they even get to the issue of forgery and they're also saying that the FBI and the park please totally manhandled that that nowhere and forensic examination do you ever come here a note like there are any note to one document\nTo make it certification which is exactly what the park police and the FBI did\nFor the big question mark is why did they ban the normal procedure and I quote my article was to have the FBI crime lab assistant director and the former head of the question document unit at the girl thank you know he wanted a minimum of ...\nWell the only they what's funny that you know the out of their own vi crime lab as as we all know is now\nClose scrutiny there's going to be an international a panel put together to look into the FBI crime lab\nWell who knows they may be a lot of crime going on there\n[laughter] well sticking with the note for a second the declaration than it is a forgery he is a blockbuster I mean if that's a forgery then the whole damn thing comes apart\nWell a couple of reasons why first of all there was a great quotes for fishing because the note\nIs found in a briefcase the search the police said that they were suspicious of the fact that that pre K. search by empty but\nNot looked at it second it um benefited a people at the White House that took the onus up proving the third ... was born and apparently the experts at any time you have a a document question document that is corn\nMutilated crumple from things build on it it is often times an effort to make it come power that\nDifficult for sure\nDo already you have a primary ... case that the English experts at\nA physician then you look at the no\nAnd the first of all the note if you look at the no which we have a photocopy of we had a huge blow up a write in comparing you can see that they do not match that the way he the stroke structures are done the flow the slant of the letter is not the same\nSo then from a clear handwriting expert tease point of view which is a good science it's a forgery\nWell it is a forgery and the other thing is what they were able to show and large blow up was that certain letters like when you write a letter let's say to let her be right you might only write that letter lower case B with one stroke start at the top down at the bottom\nYou've rounded out and then the last stroke is going over the next letter the end of the stroke but\n... born here will not do it that way he'll write the line down he'll stop the stroke it might take the bow of the letter B. and start from the top of brain around and you can see that from a large blow up and that's what they were able to show that the letter of beef for example\nUm was done in three stroke structured\nUnlike officer who had a very tenuous the style of writing uh-huh which you can all we had a dolphin document that we compared to ... three different fourth I'm feeling\nVery very clear that we ah that that that he didn't match\nYou know uh this is starting to get very dangerous for some people Chris at this point\nLike you like me like anybody who's got anything to do was saying what we're saying right now but\nNBC

earlier this makes Watergate pale by comparison there you're talking about a third rate burglary for some the various political purpose\nHere you might be talking about the least obstruction of justice in the body was moved in a story was manufactured\nOr murder\nOr whatever it is it doesn't it even the even at ... this was the bird and the FBI to use their proper procedures and investigating that belief used an examiner to certify the documents that never ah would certify the handwriting expert\nUh\nSo obviously\nNo one really cared to properly investigated\nMr ... one of the experts formerly with the New York city police department was on the house committee for assassination and he was the one that ... that are found the palm prints of we are beyond all on the rifle um he is an expert in late fingerprint\nA note was torn for the audience the reporters twenty eight peace ...\nAnd they were shown how many fingers had to come in contact with different piece of paper Mr we said his statement that this is consistent the fact that they had no bigger print for don't leak impression bumpy papers it's consistent with the person to toward having worn gloves\n[noise] [laughter] so it's a forgery so we've got a gigantic story so the Associated Press now you give me what you can I knew this touchy territory Chris letter\nWell the eight page today\nPromise the number of people that call on the media world here in Washington and elsewhere that they were going to do a dispatch may have been you know short story but it would be a story\nAbout a witness that was important mafia on the night foster died he came in he was the first one to spot forced his car and he told the FBI and the park police that there was a Hispanic man sitting next to his car watching it a menacing him with very menacing locks followed him if he weren't edited the park\nAnd it's a witness left immediately um\nPark police never went and visited him to to be with him they spelled his name wrong in it the police report or when the FBI visited with him the guy said well who was the man they gave you manage thing look at the Mexican American man\nAnd the FBI interview statement states very clearly that the witness was unable to identify would be unable to identify on the line up or a composite sketch who this man was\nWell there it is from the London telegraph this Sunday a composite sketch of the man he saw the park the FBI\nOut and out lie in their report\nOut this would maybe be a mistake if it happened want when we have so many instances in this case you know there were two witnesses later in the park it's thought to man and then around forced his car they set it on the record one guy was standing with long blond hair in front of false does harm to but the hood up\nJust before the body without\nAlright look Chris you're pushing this one to the edge and ah you're beginning to now camp you know even in other words if the worst case scenario is true\nAh which seems now more likely than ever to me based on the forgery saying then you're tampering with forces that have already\nGone an awful long way here in in ... an awful lot at stake and even though you're a big time reporter\nI'm I'm not convinced that you're safe um\nRisk involved in anything you do I've taken those risks and will continue to take the thrift because this is a very important story and uh uh you know the trip will have to pull away they may they fall on me that I'll just take that\nTake\nThat the when it comes\nYou know um I take it you've given some amount of thought to this though I mean what was\nSo look if in fact a this was a murder I Am one of the prime people behind expose again yeah I guess that's what I'm saying well look and look what\nYou know here Mike Wallace ... their teeth and I think I that that to you on the last time you know my brother called me up after looking for ... you know I've known you your whole life you've always been an honest person you've never won a lot of money never want it to a big job on Wall street type\nAnd I just watch this and it makes you sound like you're a ally or be or Charlotte and trying to make money yeah I took a pay cut to continue doing that story\nUm\nSo what do you say I mean how do you how do you argue against that Mike wallet knew that they knew that I never reported the foster with left handed a first that with the Boston Globe but I was going to be held responsible for every era that any newspaper ever done in this case\nI'm only indicates to people out there that to look into it\nThat I'm On the right track and only indicates to me about the right track when they have to make for ... a ... near when Mike Wallace seems almost eighty years old at the dean of American television journalism has to bring down a thirty year old reporter that's how old I Am\nAnd try to destroy his reputation\nThat shows that I'm having an impact\nWell ... if we look at it from the other direction\nThe implication is that I'm not making the charge but the implication is that the administration has control of very large segments of the media and I'm not making that charge but\nYou you could almost begin to believe that could be so because of the Associated Press under reporting because of sixty minutes going after you as they did\nI'm an because the news now is so shocking\nThat it just it has to be out there and well I it's not so so what does that say I mean if you look at what it says it says a large portion of the media is in bed with the government\nWell or the king media I don't know if everyone but again media the leaders on sixty minutes the lead program you know Don you it has gone on the record producer sixty minutes saying that he helped get Clinton elect Clinton elected\nAfter the Jennifer Flowers thing that he edited that tape and such a way that he remained recast Bill Clinton candidate\nUm you know ABC News is a very close association with the ministry of former Clinton campaign advisor\nOr we've added to do for a while Rick Kaplan\nA you know you see these these connection with the\nClintons are not good at governing uh but they're very good at dealing with the media handling\nProceed in is spinning and [noise] All right look I'm going to end the interview here and I'm going to give out the number to the Associated Press again Chris watch

not have put the you know even if there'd been a car in front of her which some say there may have been\nShe would not have hit the gas if necessary pushing not car and her ... into the intersection rather than collide with the train that was doing fifty miles an hour and had zero chance of stopping\nWhy didn't that bus move only she can answer it I guess\nA but just an absolutely an unbelievable

winning a lot of a straw polls and that kind of thing but I'm telling you know it will come down to Clinton\nDole and I think Powell Powell is going to run how\nIs for all we don't know about and we know a little bit about him\nNow he is pro choice we know that what else do we know about ... he's a strong leader we know that\nHe's brilliance I think we agree on that he\nTalks about some gun control or sensible gun control laws I Would have to hear that define before I Would um be able to make a judgment there but in a number of areas he looks to be a fiscal conservative and a social middle of the rotor\nMoore a Republican or Democrat but it's getting hard to tell these days you know so if we get a Clinton do Powell race I guess it might begin to be appropriate because I think that's what it's going to be to ask you which way you would be inclined to go\nSo which why would you be inclined to go [laughter] [noise]\nI really think that's where it's going to go Congress are

um so what it's not exactly a cavalier attitude I mean I have thought about it believe me or\nIf what seems to be true is true then obviously powers that would do what they are alleged to have done or now seemingly have done because where does a forgery lead you\n\nTo one of two very destructive paths for somebody\nVery powerful\nAnd there's been a lot of pressure and there's been a lot of

than who is going to have sixty minutes doesn't do it as they should then who is going to\nSomebody should and um there are um\nFar less noble things to die for if that is what it comes to then I'm exposing the truth or chasing the truth\nSo there you are\nBack to the lines west of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nHow are mourning mourning\nA you know it's interesting the way the press is covering this thing whether that foster deal when when I was a service during a\nA a breaking of a border gate story I was overseas Germany I was reading a European newspapers get more information sure and I was getting out of the magazines that I was driving to\nThere are there are certain similarities in the way the Washington Post had just doggedly pursue under criticism um the story now that is what is happening here now how long is the press been in this condition I don't know if ... is it laziness back in\nThose days I think ah you know nobody want to report on what Kennedy was going on because it was a ... guide to the the spirit of the times in those days was if we\nLeave the president alone the dirty things about the president won't go our way back to to uh\nNot not quite true we leave the the woman is aging or the bruising or the personal things yeah out but not this kind of thing\nBut over time the the scrutiny torture public officials\nThe ban hell has has gotten more and more you know we we kept FDR's wheelchair out of out of uh many people didn't even know he was in a wheelchair and nowadays you know we know what kind of underwear ... where's\nMy hair yeah like we're supposed to care as wrong\nBut it was interesting I used to have to give an update to my friends back in the states about what was going on with Watergate ... out because I got it out of the London paper and I got out of the uh uh English a printed a German newspaper\nI don't know what else you do this look you don't ignore it that's all you don't ignore it I I guess maybe according to a lot of reports on getting of the Associated Press may have switched off their phones or they may be so overloaded that you know who knows I Hope it's true\nYeah this whole thing just thanks pretty badly it has for the whole time\nOr have had quite an air too quiet there's too many unanswered thank you know ... to ... ah there's just I guess at the age of unanswered questions like who was a bump on the back of cables wall will always be the unanswered question you know and who was that a late that's foster out with no blood\nYou know it's almost tiresome sir and nobody wants to see another presidency falter and fail you know as Nixon did nobody wants nobody wants that for America nobody in their right mind could want that and I know they're on\nClay feet I Know this is going to be seen as art bell or Chris Ruddy are both you know going after Clinton with an agenda but damn it that is not what this is about\nNow it's not about that at all I I understand it's not about that at all but ... you know it was on ... on this tasteful as it is if it is something that needs to be dealt with it as something that needs to be dealt with\nWell Americans have got to sit down and have a conversation I think after something like this with themselves and say are we still Americans really\nUm do we are we still the country we once were do we still pursue the truth or do we not care anymore yeah and I guess we'll find out by finding out how many people call up the Associated Press at ... area code too old to seven seven six\n\nAnd another one coming back from a second home in Oregon to Danica heading back to California and I never learned to comment I guess that it came nine and it was interesting topic and ... and it was a young man who\nHad flown down to LA to ticket can remove the powder that was put out like thirty Oh yes oh did\nYou hear about that no that direct\nCalled toll free one eight hundred six twenty eight to five five\nAnd he's making a movie\nOh well I'm sure than a ... organization being very sensitive to that sort of saying I'm there will be repercussions but I I was very interesting um\nBut I Can't let me tell you what let me confirmed that story and I'll get it out All right\nYes All right it's a very interesting guy because Disney and the way\nI can I I I Will know what their stance would be man thank you let me please investigate that story before I ...\nA because that is a very a very very serious charge and I'm not down in your word but should you be wrong about something like that there would be very serious a legal repercussions so let me find out about that\n\nUh but uh even if true uh it is it is certainly an isolated incident I'm not significant compared to what Chris Ruddy seems to have come up with here\n\nYou know Charlie's reaction of course I guess I you know I guess it's going to be typical of the liberals and I guess there is going to be no way no escape from the accusation that I Am and Chris Ruddy is\nAre simply going after this president and maybe it is that the midget liberal mind the myopic mind to the average liberal like Charlie cannot react in any other way even too serious\nOr not mid level but high level forensics expertise that absolutely demands an explanation demands an explanation and they can talk it away by saying that it's I'm a conservative ... ball rhetoric\nIt isn't even close Charles ended really reveals a great deal about you as a person that you would approach it that way I Am quite surprised quite surprised [noise] first time caller line you're on the air\nI hello\nYeah I can barely hear you there you're gonna have to get into the phone and shout out is\nOh okay I'm In here and yes ma'am\nAnd that last night at someone Carter\nThat the um hay on Bob\n... comment yes right and they had a piece that allow it did yes\nAh oh I don't think you mentioned that last night but there are\nNo idea I mentioned it on several successive nights\nRight but that you had asked well we get a warning\nI did well well I mean in in sort of a general way I have yeah sure if a common where to hit earth would we know about it yeah\nWell I'm On a\nApril twenty third on your program can't plan was known\nYes and has a topic with Catholic [noise] ... I think yes correct\nAnd he said that the boy the end though warning with the great act of mercy and now by car would appear and the guy that\nMight have wrote them\nUm well All right thank you it may be man it may be and uh there was\nInteresting you should mention that because of course I'm assuming you heard the facts I read last night about the a piece that broke off which by the way is not in the shape of across or anything like it right now there is a\nSpiral um and that has been noted by recent Hubble photographs a very strange spiral shape to the debris there is a piece that has broken off that is not thirty percent of the comet or somebody worried [noise]\nIt is a piece that simply is reflecting probably because of the amount of material burning off at you know you take the dirty snowball if that's what it is your break off base and you've got fresh snow\nAnd so then that begins to get bright the question the good question is why is it bright at All right now\nIn other words it's out beyond the orbit of Jupiter and whether you're talking about the nucleus of the comet itself or abuse that breaks off there should not be enough energy from the sun to be melting and scattering debris as we are now see\nThat part of it does not make sense and again we will question a Richard ... about that when he's here friday night Saturday morning I don't want you to miss that program\nFriday night Saturday morning she's got a lot to say I'm not so much about the common but we will again ask about that because there must be energy to create the burn off that creates the reflected light that we see\nAnd where is that energy coming from east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning are called compete can um the lady just called I didn't want to do about the British are directed outer yeah\nThat's the true story I've got a copy of the store right here by an Associated Press writer\nUh-huh paper to\nThem [noise] I'm a young man it getting in the theater at the\nEnd do me would you do me a big favor yeah would you facts that to me\nI'm not able to do because\nAll right um the vine let me just ask that somebody fax it to me and I guarantee they will and as soon as they do\nWe'll talk about it okay how's that good\nSo somebody out there with a fax machine God Knows we've sold enough of them a fax me that article and I'm Glad to cover it I just want to be very careful very cautious I'm sure it's totally on the up and up [noise] but [noise]\nThe allegation and ball is very serious allegation and um [noise]\nI Want to be careful and have my ducks in a row before I open my big mouth [noise] having said that we will be back\nAs saying the minister Louis Farrakhan leader of the million Man March in Washington DC told de stunned the crowd at a Washington Baptist church the march was inspired by an extra terrestrial vision he had ten years ago\nA UFO he said swept him off to a spaceship where the late ... larger Mohammed told him that President Ronald Reagan was plotting a war\nFarrah Khan was then beamed back to earth you said quote I really don't care if you think I'm nuts and quote he told the church without elaborating on how his vision was connected to the march\n\nWow\nWell maybe I'd been pursuing Louis Farrakhan as a guest in the wrong way and maybe he would respond to an invitation to dreamland\n[laughter] what do you think are the Vince Foster situation and I think this is good advice for everybody\nHe says if the truth\nShell set us free than a lie whether blatant or a sin of omission she'll keep us bound prisoners of those who would have us in darkness in ignorance so they can continue to control\nThe Vince Foster a scandal could very well be the tip of an iceberg when further investigated could revealed to the American people that our government is built on a mountain of lies\nWhen given the truth history has demonstrated that people will rise up even in the face of the greatest adversity in danger to preserve the human spirit Republican or Democrat conservative or liberal female or male young or old\nWe deserve to be told the truth\nMost sincerely is your program appreciated by this one side is a Dora there is a name for you in San Diego ... that is exactly the way I feel about it I'm not afraid of the truth\n\nI'm just not afraid of it and I'm not afraid of where it leads and you may or may not have noticed this about me yet but I Do not respond to individual items presented to me it logically\nI just don't I respond to them I Hope uh directly in pragmatically\nUm and examine each one for its worst I don't know the words I don't I Do have I Am basically ... fairly moderate conservative\nBut I'm not a reactionary I look at each thing as it comes along and I'm not afraid of the truth I'm just not and if it ever gets to the point where I Am then I Need to walk away from this job and I'm not going to do that\nUntil it gets in and hopefully it never does\n\nI mean if I had to come on here and in effect serve my masters you know whoever they might be\nI couldn't do it\nI'll just leave it at that I you know I'll just leave it at that I couldn't do it and wouldn't do it\n\nIt's not what this job is all about at least not for me okay east of the Rockies you're on the air high\nArt I'm white job yet on I'd fall by not sixty minutes\nYou're talking about Chris Ruddy\nUnlike some of the guys got everybody's got a ferret out there right I mean they got to admit it's pretty uh pretty funny\nUm I saw the peace yes and um then they not only to bunk gyms are but

restaurant saying they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and throw happens the biggest one is October\nWhich will never go away well\nI Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state fair and they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open so I I I Would never guess shops that are just open for one month in in Salem\nYeah but but but what the realizing there's so many tourists coming to fail him over the course of a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened up the monster museum ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round to stay on grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem would it ... or their rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want the truth is just to be in in Salem\nYeah and they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that especially in the year round if you're on the other time of year there's not that many curbs\nBut in October for instance they are the barrel round which was the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there and fail and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting overrun and people were like using the graves as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over start start cutting the train and start having their cars for their that's\nReally ... in ... at ten pm\n[noise] yeah I Believe it's a ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing that's a hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight nobody around an aloe lean on\nAs ironic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was [laughter] it just gets bad really bad there\nGot to get them up before the ... or maybe the two and the real wishing happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and mayhem Halloween and Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket list things do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list\nOf things that are in every night in fact I'm checking off one when I go to Ross will in a couple of weeks\nAnd that's what I study and one of the things I learned that sets true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy and proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers\nSo the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment\nYou know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\n[noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the census right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before a trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird or white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law\nAnd journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the tree\nUp but [noise] this is the same reason I Love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting\nCan go where true crime story can tell something crime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime before death I interviewed I'm\nA true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or to satisfies the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham\nAnd not run for your life by all because of a story seemingly that had been told about\nA Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell in the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories\nAs well I'm not waiting and do a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rest some of the trigger finger of today's shooter but take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's so many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happen not everything is die hard to that everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up people who you believed to be\nGuilty of some thing stay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and they keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get justice next on coast to coast am

I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to\nFor five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur in the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in that and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last last\nAnd the theories so uh we\nIt's just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argue that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of them at\nThe end you so you found the arc type crime before the pros or type to crush right he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then excessively after that it is is the years went forward and yet\nThere was kind of a mixed media right I mean there's sometimes there were some times or were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about nine to five the ah I think that he while he use an ax who\nCommitted murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and confronted him but um it was not what are you trying to do but it's way we do if you have to do\nI Want to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do\n... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was it that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to cold late all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answer the question is the crime stories are fascinating to us because they they\nCome from the parts of our of ourselves that we don't like to talk about\nA all crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but\nThey're they\nAre part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we covered them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of\nThe uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader ... by the way the last book I read what the real crime but with the real world leader a it's a book by um [noise] that the white stuff a lot of weight of Weinstein I could have a life name her\n\n[noise]\nBill James works for the ... advisors the Boston Red Sox\nAre ... and a ... and ... ... so it is that he spends a lot of his time in the sports world news is talking before the top of the hour about the difference between being in that sort of positive place with very positive energy\nAround people involved doing positive community things and writing demands from the train 'cause he likes to write about crime so do you want to finish that\n[noise] you're you're fading out here and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nI'm fading out no kind of that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day and writing crime that night\n[noise] the thing that crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves that we'd all like to talk about and don't talk about\nAnd that sort of the man the train I didn't make a deliberate and taught poll entry into the subject I got hooked like\nA I was I was a documentary about the murders and ... called ... it's an extremely well I'm a documentary and far above normal levels of crime documentary\nI was in that and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing with you that it's relatively obvious\nThat the ... murders are a part of a ferry and so I started\nI was just going to put an hour and to and to trying to learn more about fairies but the the our became a weak the weak eventually became five or six years I'm ... I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can\nDo you consider this a a true crime booked sure yeah yeah you know and that's the interesting piece too is is that true crime\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit writing preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day of somebody's execution\nAnd they would do a sermon just before the execution that we've tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed and why the community overall would benefit from his or her death\nAnd it became\nBecame an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the preachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then he thought what this all just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring it even though it's a hundred plus years later in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved\nBut for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm [noise] there would be very that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a a a great great aunt had been\nWas one of the victims of crime ... always believed\nThat uh uh the man who or whether to her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released\nIs that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book that in our book that uh uh\nIt wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to it yeah\nIt was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a ... he said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that man had actually gotten away with it was this other fellow at I don't know why it was important to him\nToo well I understand the understanding that said there was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know that there's a lot of different\nBut it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book the\nBook is about is is that all all books all good books are search for understanding and a lot of the book is is try and get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and ah I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these ... that these murders occurred to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them\nAnd that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically\nPrimitive it was a whether he ... well what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful\nLie is a ... ... people in\nUrban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that happened ... who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they died terrible Beth\nI'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live in and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think the change of the interesting things about true crime in general is that just the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling a story\nIn proper journalism you could spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the town or\nThe um the things that people age or the way the houses were constructed ... communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism contracts that too and I really liked what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThe ... and then there's ... there's one incident that always sticks with me that illustrates the point you were just ... and that has to do with the the taco in the case of soccer and then that it\nUh one of them I think it was ... co were had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty fourth of I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um\nA he had a witnesses who said that on that particular date\nHe was delivering\nA to his neighbors and Italian community um a\nPickled ... because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou'd never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nThe a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right that would not never survive\nI mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way that the Taliban American communities lived a hundred years ago except that it's important in a crime story and that's what kinds of stories are they're these\nLittle there's a flash of light that illuminates the details of uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYeah [laughter] but I think that brings us very effectively to militias gun\nIowa I'm and did the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that

look at the the stories of the dead and that's what that's what the bill James did in the men from the train and he took a a an object view this giant\nLook from thirty thousand feet at a series of crimes Ninety murders that happened\nAnd started to see the patterns and went back to the earliest one and we'll find out what he found out about the name of the men from the train next on coast to

daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so sorry I got the wrong [laughter]\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all get together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nUh you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the men from the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove it\nThat we we we have a tendency to replicate um circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best [noise] so\nSomebody who might have grown up with a very dysfunctional household\nTends to cleave toward dysfunctional relationships not go the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act and so they keep re creating that until they break the habit [noise] um so fractals theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you saved\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment ... thanks so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various ... of America\nWell ... that\nThere is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was a his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to him and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nSome variation but more specimens specificity as it got went along so you know the early patterns or not that type but the\nLater patterns get closer and closer to the first crime it's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that's\nThat's who he was a that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr ... had been the victim of terrible abuse as young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nYeah tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and have it he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd it's a terrible abuse replicated itself and his anger and his outrage is not that it in any sense of justification for what he did but I don't doubt that that was true of him\nAnd the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the corps if that's what happened um speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just an barking and come to the United states\nWell I don't know and you know there is speculation\nIn the book has a lot of things we don't know about a year are you you're going to have no after you can have a speculative after it's up to you I wouldn't speculate\nThat he had never killed anyone before he killed the uh the Newt and family and ... in Eighteen Ninety eight I I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt that he'd ever killed anyone before that because there is a hobby of lack of planning and\nI'm preparation for the of at ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see this very much which respect that he had been adding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while he had it had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't but like a nice guy enemies that he ... his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried a it carried a tanker pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents through and about his life\nThe uh uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\n[noise] but it still and that's that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know\nWe don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in yet um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victim of the ... range but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm the nurses just sociopaths which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they they just you know they it it's a ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut uh it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not a ... he didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken truly\nMakes a good up here and he didn't do any of that he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear\nOf Arab ... norm had do not have normal fear and one thing the apparent about this the ... the ... from the trade is that the from his crime is it ... it was not\nIt was not acting in fear he was he was calm in the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with his for so long I this is probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller and ... from the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten years or Fifteen\nAnd going to say well here's what that James's myth they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed this whole\nStory about ah this this crime and it when that guy Illinois [laughter] and uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they are going to do that and and there'll be right\nBut we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity Filippo dawn and printed book but there is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions so sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers are coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer or you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also [laughter]

very good writer a and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot in the ... he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was I tend to rent longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about this we will just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they good to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks at a\nBill I got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me it again over shame eight and ... like what will the act\nOf every what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe ah I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand they act with which the whole let's go murders were committed they ah it it's still\nIt's still around and and the has been definitively guide to the to the murders and the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right you know what the palm will buried by nature\nWe don't it disappeared ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be but he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured he might have worked for the world rode out he got to every place that it did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but a thank you for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThey give you that hey you know actually that's a really good question too about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\n... ... what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on weekends is is taking to be a sign that he's going Floyd a if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will who committed murders on\nWeekends or the or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to\nThe um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working I'm self into the perhaps stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that if the law this talking\nBut the the just war himself into frame of mind that he can get where you needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or was do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you\nKnow he was he was just it it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen a ... and ... and he came into town may no contact with anyone spoke to no one and ... that was part of his\nCriminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so ... if his crime and the underlying crime and Eighteen Ninety eight they did buy a ticket to leave the\nTown and this this led\nTo a trail forming behind him and place followed his\nWhere he had gone on the train or for quite a while but later he was just it was his job as white used to railroad he always was used at the intersection of two railroad so they were trained came by the middle of night he could just hop on and they wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to hell rode your last chance the year\nYou'll be you'll be stranded waiting for trying to compare\nYeah that's an interesting question forgot what it was you know that's an interesting point\nThen it by the way when I told you about the the people that were murdered\nNext to the railroad line in the town where I grew up they um that was the shoe sure the shoreline it was it the the train no longer existed um after like Thirty years or so but he used to be the major commuter rail road between\nMilwaukee and a Chicago I think or maybe even went further up north up to delay Green Bay or something or\nThe other point that a question I was raised in there up until Nineteen away or thereabouts\n... a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes there that area after night in a way he started just morally more or less trapping it it it became a Nineteen Nineteen awake at night and Kenny transition to just\nRunning loose across the country bought an interesting thing is that he never stole money at one of the ways you know with him is that why this line well up here in the newspaper story about it\nMoney and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there's a hit he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah and that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that\nUh that that guy little was accused of than it was a a robbery and and it yet you know in the same time the let me ask you about the acts so the ... why do you think he would leave the is this the murder weapon at the scene I understand like\nIn the godfather right when you wrap the\nHandle and you drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever but it would seem like even then that would be some evidence just to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nA fingerprint exploded\nAtlanta jingle off twenty
