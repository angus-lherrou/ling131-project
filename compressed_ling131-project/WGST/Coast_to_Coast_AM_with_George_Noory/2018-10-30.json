should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing niche you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely [laughter] it it it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't take about this because it it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nI Hope they're releasing those trees or are they oh I don't I don't know [laughter] I Hope so yeah I\nI'm sure I'm sure they're they're done in a in a very careful manner very logical manner\nI mean that's not what greeted another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of uh the men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\n[noise] yeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and ... no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout it really isn't that high on that ... that sort of slip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said listen you know what you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it but we wish you had to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things\nThere's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into the c._e._o. positions\nAnd they're good one yeah oh excellent and was absolutely Exxon once and and uh\nSo we're ... we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\nTom what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\n[noise] that Generation Z was born ... being born right now it's actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there uh but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different than Gen Y ... that they're going to be this the same\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially he's the parents of Gen Z a but it\n... what we're watching is is is a a a new crop of kids and and I tell folks and he said listen you know people say well these these ... they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complained about the millennials they caught complained about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and I said let alone let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be find is just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed themselves\nAnd and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that\nI don't care listen it is what it is [noise] what ... listen here's here's how it works zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby\nYou want what you want when you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a a liberals or the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on and all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah would you tell me\nThat makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we not it's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a name for the enlisted I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president takes takes\nOn a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah\nThat's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter sock than it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nNo knowing when when you think is a mind to people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know is\nWhen you talk about the trends and change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't you get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad to have you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know\nYou know people ... ... I I Can't tell you the number of people at George that say to me I you know why don't we run our our government like a business and and so we you know you want to have these huge deficits and we won't make all these mistakes [noise]\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like the government a diplomatic government or a Republican it's based on a constitution not one that's based on business principles we used to have that yeah we used to have that but now we have a government\nThat's essentially run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no\nUh you know we just take it on the river and moved the rules with what we've taken away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat\nWill what's going on with China\nChina's enter freaky position China right now are they\nRelaxed they are on their their child law to write how many people many children family can amp\nYeah they can have really as many say

China trendy not trending down\nChina's cooked and it kind of I'm Sorry that but that's that's just like I Can't think of any any other way to say what they've done is they've they've committed the biggest\nDemographic blunder and a history of the world with that one child policy they did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy let now they're letting their populace have as many kids as\nA novel desperate for uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies born is that do\nNot buyers that's for sure\nNo so what what you have is is they are missing and this is a real number or a five hundred million people that weren't born five hundred million\nAnd a half billion so so here's here's how it works any country I don't care if you're if you're a a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people\nThat make big incomes but have you know a big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax I mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nAnd the the the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is\nStarting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years to what's going to happen well that will it cooked himself because they're going to have is actually a quarter of a billion elderly if they've got to support that can support themselves and now\nThat they they have a whole new crop of of ah kids that can't support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah what what whenever a country gets in trouble um ... with\nA their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's right and then go to war\nYeah they well they may they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI I don't know what's going to happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is a they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not much to take some calls this hour come ruin in here for the guinea let's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi jarred jak off your well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have\nI called because I have a bone to pick with you I'm just here me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war um he's not a diplomat so all of those politicians that have looked us in the I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to see two things Tio first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the porn star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that warrior here's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he would he put Ron and possibly win\nA presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold but we're self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys said and all they had was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or tried to bring down this man but more importantly Batman has had actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one buddy young wife and crude and catch white and\nWe had a president and did something so by all it can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I Will pay for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature and the second thing I disagree that is sad\nIs that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm the I'm not that old guy there\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than I think that's now\nAnd it should be run like a business I have started to successful business as myself is that men and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal dies we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that are spending our money and\nSo the fact that

to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think he did to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay you thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet a fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run is a business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste\nAs a nation yeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that uh our country is a republic with a constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I ... I I don't disagree with with um the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThen we'll do but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas\nI'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says but I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them about what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that would in their punishment would be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise] uh I I don't know I think what he has done is dignify but it it the argument and I and I don't think there is one\nThe coast website is now

be alive it really is I I'm I'm enjoying this I think the best days are ahead not behind us I think the United states is going to see an economy that it doesn't understand and that that's going to be a just launched\nBy generation y that this monster generation that's fourteen to thirty three years old that it's going to start households and by dish soap and and by vacuum cleaners in furniture and automobiles\nLike the old days\nYeah incidentally ... in talking to the you know I talked to all sectors in talking to my automotive sectors are cars that drive themselves they're not going to happen\nGood good they're already killed several lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks\nThat we don't have enough truck driver you know what that what we\nWould you like to have a truck behind you with no drivers sitting\nOut or you're not going to do it my ah you know we I have many you know what I mean he has a little tiny mini Cooper right I have a may ... which is a heart ride and I'm thinking to myself but by the first time I pull up next to a a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know what if there's one tactical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me the people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nThen a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck has park there and the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nArguing how's how's he how's the driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please okay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about\nChina right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and the it's the there there is just a ton and and ... that that is what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another major war breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South American\nOr we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil\nWe got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking where\nWe're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water\nIt it just it I don't know I\nAm one of those always missiles alone\nGuinea [laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for ... for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a king John hurt on and on North Korea I don't see that happening\nIn the in fact I what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north in the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children\nThere for her that I don't like about one to\nHere's my concern although not from a country but from some terrorist group that obtains a new ... or something like that and they do it and try to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is that the one child per couple\nYou cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you know possible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen there with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina Michael go ahead\nYes Hi George and higher against um Hi my question is that is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and west because like Florida is now the third most populous state\nOut raking New York state and also in Phoenix has become the largest city out raking or it will do here people are moving to the warmer weather ...\nThat that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the pound demographic shift the head we cover every single state\nIf you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada Arizona and a New Mexico\nOr the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million while or buy real estate bite in Florida now\nAnd just sit on it yeah it said I ... the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens of Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to be going to ask what if it meant when will it began to\nYou know shopping and I told her I said listen it hasn't started\nWhen it does it's going to be huge\n... it's going to be off the charts which the same thing is happening with healthcare elder care and death care\nFor a Vegas is that a good market\nOff the charts huge can't believe it I it it said for one or if it's cheap there are plenty of jobs or or I go there all the time my brother has a house there uh yeah Vegas is is unbelievable\nWill show ...

marshmallow Libyan reincarnation either on everyone right now on\nHe also served as a Fulbright professor back in two thousand three at the University of Trump's show in northern Norway Bruce founded the veterans' program at ... college and co founded the boots to books transition course\nNow that's the first college course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans Bruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's ... the paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experience it was an angelic experience a near death experience\nAnd just from that point on it just the the things had been happening randomly but quite frequently and uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then start talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or family doctors but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college\nI'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lotta people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr where that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was a\nA a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\n[noise] you know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal Andy activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian\nUh but uh it from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community butter butter reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean rate and who is\nChief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said there's Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there is only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there were still the ... Institute thank God yes to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I think there is an eye\nConfirmed this with with dean because he's doing and don't you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting or on the Internet uh there are other podcast she was out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places I\nI I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that ah it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building that night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in in their support I think it's going to it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce old sol high in his latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in she tells me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well\nIn fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control or just happened randomly these things\nAh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and the and the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point at which they do this\nFirst one did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you yeah that\nI was very young I was four but I was in a weird traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for live there about nine months so it was a winter time and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanting to take a little map and was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nButt relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence and it it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never question did I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that would open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic\nA right to see 'em there's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kinda passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry boat\nThree people including two brothers

dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know an a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event\nAnd later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific than mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there is my daughter had those two we didn't know what you're saying yeah we didn't know what it was bruised but ah she she she had the vision she was ah in in a city where ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep\nUm but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was a you know some people\nHeaded that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who have a\nVerified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this this the ... that people had since that and and I'm On a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think a dean rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but you know he does talk about that\nWhat are you seeing ... the [noise] I\nI I think I've had experience with with ... with the with my with my mother and she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was a younger a preacher a camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips\nOn the uh uh Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would ah tried to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a card she'd look at it and send me the you know try to send me with what the card was\nAnd a wet well above chance we would get the the suit right we would get the sometimes the number or this or the the you know whether it was a king or jak face card a very often we get we get it a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he say when dad said stop if we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it ... it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but\nI think I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big split experience\n[noise] I I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this was a ... near Oric\nWhich is northern California and the red woods highway there and are driving south and uh my girlfriend was was asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's\nVery ... and as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit\nAll of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark but it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was\nWearing a hat and a ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd then immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said\nI I think I just saw big foot and and she ... she said what what are you talking about big foot I said well I think I saw you I'm gonna turn around and go back and then she she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep drive me and I said well we got to find a hotel there is one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going you keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later I found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nPaterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking with all of this we are in fact\nThere's been yeah there's been more sightings there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh the reading that I did about it\nSo now if it if it was a hoax or this guy's taken a big chance by stand right on the on the edge of the highway and the dark total dark\nYup uh and then you can get shot out or anything she got\nRun over crazy you know whatever or\nYou know the alternative which which you know they're so that that was my my one and only a a big foot experience\nOne of all the uh thirty four episodes that occurred with you which is the favorite for you\n[noise] well I I don't want to you actually like\nYeah I I'll have to say it all the connections with my my my parents with my mother ah when my mother came to me in innovation after she had passed away and\nAnd uh and told me she she doesn't say much when she comes to me but she came to me and said and she was golden you know she was herself but very healthy she you know she died of cancer and she was very healthy looking she was gold and had this golden glove\nAnd uh she came to me and said you know there is a heaven that's what she told me and then that was it\nThat was that was one of the parents so that\nWhere she was that's always a good thing Bruce stay with us we're going to take a moment for a quick break but we're gonna come back and talk more

so many different kinds of paranormal stories you've had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket or\nThe title alone kind of makes you shiver\n[laughter] well I grew up in a in a I'm In a region American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know that that all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and\nHe was home to me and he said ah\nAh Bruce it's it's it's OK I'm OK there is nothing to be afraid of\nUh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut uh I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and that but I was looking at him and of course he no he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um\nIt it it was kind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird when it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just this check everybody out\nSee what the suit was they're very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was the that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like\nFor college transfer credit but it is not for adept\nAt the college and I am a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they say well we've never done this before but we think it might be pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get but ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could've accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California or younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it ... they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple that are a little skeptical do\n... including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the nurse seven weeks in the course into the corps\nUm and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience of really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomena I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fine ah that's ah a hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes geo Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in a ghost
