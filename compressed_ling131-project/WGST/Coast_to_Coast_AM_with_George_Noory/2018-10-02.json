all\nIt's completely free dot com or download free [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYeah Jordan already back could you hear more Lerner the astrologer with us mark how long would it take someone to study astrology if they wanted to become an astrologer\nWill I\nOkay it took me one year it was kind of like my graduate school where I was twenty two I was studying metaphysics people like Rudolph Steiner George ... of a a ... ... the Alice Bailey teachings and so on\n'em and I found my mentor Dane road you are who is one of the great astrologers of twentieth century and he had studied not just the strategy but philosophy psychology and metaphysics of sauce [noise] so I read all of his books and kind of memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there\nOf the planet mercury which rules mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly at the same spot where mine was and I knew what his chart was and when I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and off and underrated was on the same spot but any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got a study much more than just an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits and progression with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into a all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of the psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home and just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book\nWhich I mentioned TV for astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people had studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes ballet or and so on they were all ... but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault the world when to that\nSony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand you know why why was the greatest scientists before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nYou know how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nWell what they didn't realize is that it was a science it was taught in the universities of Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt Rome greet you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's birth the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay more than one forty two in the afternoon now\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of\nGet that information pretty quickly and would\nYou want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them and we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nJared show or\nGood welcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I did that\nYou okay great you're you're on with mark Lerner of given mark your birth date you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say\nUh of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon\nAnd tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour people don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctual eight so within areas moon\nComing from other lives and like instinctively\nThis individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful and this and kind of an aggressive personality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in otherwise particularly in the last life\nAnd now with the sun and Capricorn is kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so\nIt's an extra kind of a this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he strengthens his immune system and stays healthy that um he doesn't become pessimistic about things\nUm but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle over the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nBond you have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books\nThe philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics astrology the power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I study that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess uh how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there's a whole field of esoteric astrology there's a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere's a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic lead people who ... who can meditative sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of the things indefinitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and our incarnations\nLike in the chart we're looking at the like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan of higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon and the planet from the configuration that we have\n... under ... reincarnation I asked her laundry please speaking you were born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before\nThat will were they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing\nYou know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life [noise]\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light work are kind of work at this stage and twenty first century\nMight come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from fellow man and a woman being able to come into the world of north ... time to take advantage of astrological vibrations they're to me absolutely in other words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses\nParents and family based on family karma\nDharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing when to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it I Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go out to Cleveland new Donna's with us welcome to the

January twelve you know sort of know a lot about that that vibration so one of the things\nFor Capricorn again a Saturn is there okay I Do know anything much about astrology yourself missed or a little bit yeah okay so ... I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have a once in a lifetime Pluto\nA movement towards your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign them Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand Nineteen two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of linked to higher spirit so what the universe is saying is do some big time\nStudy psychology philosophy\nAuthors or so it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything a a hobby a craft an activity though that is deep and significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo and on the line called the trying which is flowing to your son to be an organizer this is what you've you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or a doctor or or a student or you know a libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong familiarized but the big things next couple of years\nSo it kind of deep seated study headed trading into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your Carlos next one may fourth Nineteen sixty nine may fourth Nineteen sixty nine were going out to California so\nWho is with us welcome to the program for good\nYeah I think you are my question is about Korea money and should I moved to a different state I'm a toy I was born in ... city court\nYou know where are you okay ... what's the city how do you spell it who wait city oh okay in a way to us and he's a ... I'm just\nPutting six AM here unless you give me another time I'll put around sunrise ... do you know your time birth or know\nAnnoyed okay no problem [noise] okay you said money\nWhere what state to live in which they deliver using Kelly right now\nOkay well first of all there is an even on my website it's called global hotspots ... where I Do part of mundane astrology but it's also individuals [noise]\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years and astrology\nIt was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around from like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere in the planet's understand what's good and what isn't that California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as a son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist son signed tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where you're fine and California's earth fine\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you if mercury with Vesta\nWhich is one of the foreign made asteroid Vesta has a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to you know something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that and you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a a moon\nTrying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lyme into NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously\nOkay in in the near future um and because you emerge reason it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection but you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde the power of Venus which is your son find ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there's a planet X out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nIn fact uh the I have a whole thing about here is which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on said no when President Trump took office it's an article on earth Aquarius news\nIt was very strong at his inauguration and has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half\nAnd therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids little plants like higher on ... the chart gets over populated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously not overwhelming the chart with a whole lot of them but sometimes they
