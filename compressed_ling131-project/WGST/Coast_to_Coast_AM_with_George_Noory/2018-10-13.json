research foundation by making an inside guinea hen skinny\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is\nAll of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThat work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative\nEmotional energy drugs or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel ... and the accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies\nAnd sold to minors spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments and generate huge amounts of energy that is\nNegative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises difference from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not you know ... you're not a priest is Adam ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say Sean than priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all\nPeople call me who are agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion so I wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really\nIt's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a distance\nOn a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where

has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOr both or just a few years ago um I did a three nights a\nStand essentially a legitimate haunted mansions and it's very famous I won't mention the name but um it's something I was against for years and years and years for fuse all invitation I finally they talked me into it and said fine actually\nStayed over in one of the rooms just beautiful you know and\nUh so uh it was essentially set up for ... to go in and uh with\nReal quick and then in and take a look around and everybody everybody found something that people who didn't believe in ghost had you know one couple said their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest ruined too but\nAh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and there was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bat I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she it was called the gold room and\nIt went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention to it and you know\nThere's places really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch\nMe don't bite need yeah followed people home negative spirit just they will get\nJanelle to get your later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and uh\nOh four feet above me was the miss shape the spirit just terrible looking now I'm used to ... spears can assuming the shape they want I don't react to this you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately or what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's grain possible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil law by\nIt was right above me and the spirit was the ... you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick we and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific\nSong slowly and I just I you know ...\nShot up immediately got up out of my bed it's kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long it had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I had to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up\nImmediately went to the chair sat in my room and he said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at the at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after her night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room\nYou know you you just felt is looming\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy\nI get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople face so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely on their clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away a you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the\nCalls come pretty quickly and the only times\nImmediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clearing that do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world they don't have to travel everywhere Skype telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals that just work in a negative environment\nAnd they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they called up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and no longer coming out feeling dreamed because I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious and so people don't know they're getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them are on negative spirit and Philip people call me families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get a\nCaller an email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really helped you know\nVery very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I helped or the last almost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do\nI make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty\nFive minutes how you've thirty five different things than forty five\nMinutes already five different things so remarkable and it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing as different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround six people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with\nMy eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on a business or a house\nAnd so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family lore arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attract negative spirits and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep\nMeaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy and also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school ... elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful\nBut I mean think of the moon energy dinner\nElated and so people will be calling on comfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy regenerated you don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session it all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes for a standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's a good mix costs just for you know most\nAll energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I

sometimes\nYou know and and sometimes not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness\nA overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across in damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is it's not so much of an immediate uh but actually\nThe working on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries to even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time and I was getting up\nYou to work out doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power\nSuddenly of light shot out from it hit me right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know have looked at in a you know get some light medication for it is it the demonic spirit had pulled the muscle so\nIt can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all of the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be a physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and especially that is very connected to the physical realm physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to Jim in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirit to quit being evil or you know the true pet turtle like I go to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen Ninety is asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens in teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steer still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for these ...\nThat actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are hold with but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore to a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is good that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy and the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's disaster anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual is safe this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them George\nI Am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kind of things in past life helping people that to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work\nBut the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreamed that it was a dream and once in a looser tree but\nAfterwards I woke up right after and sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all that she has been consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a ... dream sure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that\nYou can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ...
