of administering the program\nWhere does the lending money come from Alan Paulos before these loans\nAll the money is used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans uh today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out [noise]\nUh and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education [noise] uh and it sort of\nCrony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that essentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this was a federal program money ultimately um comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit [noise]\nUh and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair to collections actress\nLaws federal um a fruit than lending laws [noise] ah and these again are restricted or it's completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of\nThis the genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway ... ball of bankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes\nServed on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprises to a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord\nA bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system [noise]\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] ah like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent who use child has a ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give up this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treatment lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank guinea private line of credit [noise]\nAh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can\nGuarantee a year I'd per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer tapes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad is now six point two year what happened well again\nThe colleges are sitting in the cat per seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices\nBut also really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're\nLosing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this\nReally hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um have to charge a huge amount just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie ...

Yankees when they're first world series feeding the New York Giants' games that you didn't\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to close to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans game what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three reason engineering and um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into a\nIs a system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is ah what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add a and so it's sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later\nAnd Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credit or have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that kept the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time\nYou've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy are these um secondary car market a lenders\nWho will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Won five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you bite on line and say you know look it's great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks\nYou know uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shots and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans\nAnd it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the ... system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq crazy what's what's the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the\nThe number I mentioned for Syracuse early as probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple of three or four\nYears I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight\nAnymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has just\nGotten unreal um this is not this is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job in a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen I got good thank you I\nGot good news for you too man a Trump rally over there and laugh at it on the other day\nYeah there was a big fine they throw at least a court sealed and he looked right at the whole ... oh\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I drive a little bit of a trade school there a way out there used to work or I got on egg wildly and when a company went under the owner of the night a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now\nYou know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I ended up her the job I own here and I found one but they wouldn't even let me make this fast or as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without doing\nWell and I think well you know\nYou probably in Lawrence you'd be had more experience than most people\nYeah and I loved it\nThe local school there and they want to import dollars that go for oh I think it was a two wars there is no and say well you know there are way\nSo I ended up going ... miles in dollars on a grade school are learning to drive semi truck I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that it's not an avid priced out of\nA let's get your reaction to the cell and where do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there\nAnd so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\n... born in sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages credit card lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the lungs especially the taxpayer on hug 'em it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college dead\nWas going to say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bankers that set up the officer federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're going to come back

I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to get other than\nHelping us fight for eight or twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy right back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third and third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of your loan is probably either a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education [noise] so\nI mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent of the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know some you you can do but certainly dealing with a question of you know like like what you describe how did\nThey get the information out one lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this or a public start clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government so so the information they have is good\nUm but I can tell you the dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of or if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with the company that went bankrupt you\nNever heard from them again well you\nHave to be very careful Desert Storm beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may

[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nLet me tell you a little bit about Nick Pope those viewers knew the show Nick worked for the United kingdom ministry of defense ... and other mysteries\nHe's been called the real ... has been working as a consultant or spokesperson numerous easily in the movies TV shows video games as well and tonight we're going to be talking about aliens at the Pentagon and Nick welcome back it's always great\nTo have you great to be back on the shirt I don't know how you doing these days yeah good thing [noise] where do we last\nSee each other contacted the desert we were there ...\nAnd I'm now with that before off to your life event in ... city which we did\nThat was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you\nGreat job indeed aliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all off and leave and taking\nYour credit Graham care but to take your life that story and and really to try in one document tree detail as as fast as I can ... the entire story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with the\nPhenomenon or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single wherever they are in the UFO community for I think that case I the only story that I think comes\nLife and I would say this is the de classification and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off two decades have to know and the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm an Asian feel but the day and and you're like hey for years they said no no since project three ... we haven't been doing this with knowing trapped there are no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focused on in in the new film alien for the end again to try to train on tango the numerous threat to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nMistreatment both they're all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of the robot big yellow a Senator Harry Reid charmed along I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff neck it 'cause it's coming from all different directions these days\nThink the answer that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with the story\nIn one fan for years people have said the problem is the particularly with the album we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the eight story with with these revelations we almost have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's just about okay for the deep specialists ah it's a difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just the confusing man if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they're landmark story on this on\nThe sixteenth floor chair and then the the free videos came out to for them to benefit one\nBut now the public have been absent people bought it and they're thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this guy and then this millionaire businessman\nAnd I'm struggling to see how it all fits together so that that's what I've tried to do to take that back\nAnd and give people a few of the [noise]\nMy incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we live in the course tonight Pentagon tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seeds and and you've done this of course civilian times yourself you know you sit in the ... said\nA direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and\nAnd also the question is this when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I've got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put that but at the end and I wish they'd taken it out and I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon ... did they fight teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so scripted the entire movie I ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together um micro loan I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that same\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFrom me and they took completely new role to me I I there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy called ballot costs have just made a a a great movie but um\nYou know I I it was a departure for may so took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with the\nFirst lady\nI as I say really to try to\nGo through some of the the confusion about what's been going on just how the complete story\nFrom from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is\nIt we know young people are interested in in the subject but\nThey don't go to many conferences and ... and ... ... you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand\nWe go on to the platforms\nThat the young people the watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take the subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but too young to get people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since ... had his press conference\nWhere he\nGot together with the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I Do than to ah you know in some ways the story I think has fall down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon don't want to reignite the S. and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat we're waiting when you say the organization I'm E. E. T. I. O. right yes I Am\nWell that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has had all the way says in the soil situation's only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and\n\nNBC News radio I'm Liz Warner President Trump is filing his two thousand Seventeen tax\nHouse press secretary confirmed that the returns were filed before the deadline and are automatically under on it she said the president thinks that's unfair\nHaving prevailed against adult film star Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit the president has called the actress horse face South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and others were put off by the remark\nIndustry I don't [noise] elevating him does anything good for the country\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell is suggesting that this Congress may try again to repeal Obamacare after the midterm elections residents in central and south Texas are on high alert as floodwaters threatened their homes Texas officials are warning residents to steer clear of the water\nJust stay home watch TV's check on your loved ones and and just stay home\nLives Warner NBC News radio he Atlanta ... joined me weekdays from ... pm to get caught up on the stories of the day the Dana buried show is live and local and right here on TALK radio six forty W GST\nAnd linen ...

I mean it it's more about DOMA Nineteen future of space\nWell are you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's attempt to give the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of a alien or intervention yes\nAnd he certainly made of course the those remarks are\nVery famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally thing how quickly would we would set aside our differences down here on uh if if we face some alien threat and and of course people read\nAn awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read read a law into that to my own personal view is but that was much more about just trying to ... when the Cold War and find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair and exactly the way it pretty much\nPlayed out oh that's right absolutely there's been there's still talk disclosure\nAre you you know I I'm\nArguing Steven bass and all the time I don't think there's going to be the kind of disclosure he expects do you think that the things that are happening now or governmental ways trying to soften us up for governmental disclosure or do you think it's never going to happen as\nI yeah I agree\nWith you I don't think that kind of Steve pass it um disclosure with a big day my fellow Americans people at the world we are not alone I don't think back\nIn in here they are bringing them yeah\nUm and and we've discussed this before one of the big problems of course is is not saying that they're extraterrestrials bought a if it turns out that we've known about this was Seventy years they can be awful lot of questions\nTo answer about but no I think it's more like play and I don't believe either this is a kind of softening up and a climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about eight tip them through the classification and release of the British Government files we are seeing government say effectively will lick here is\nOur data or as much of it as we can really you know without compromising sitting\nClassified information I'm ... and and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely government don't really know what they're dealing with either I'm which takes me back to the mountain reef\nQuite what if we are dealing with some things so above and beyond comprehension let's say it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics tuition and say\nYou never know you you never know you know when you look at Leonardo da Vinci's works or he depicted things that we have today I'm not sure you knew what the what what do we drawing though when you say\nWell he was clearly a visionary genius [laughter] been a time travel [laughter]\nWell I'm not sure about that but um I guess there are there are a handful of physicists working on that Ronald Merrill it comes to mind yep\nBut I think there are some some others or you know I I had a job and the ministry defendants where I was paid to think the ... so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved in remote viewing or anything like that like you work with the ministry you did\nYes I absolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself\nThe the focal point for any thing\nWe saw that any in any one kind of comes to to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they were like cakes and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well you know like Kay\nSoviet ballistic missile submarines are on mosques by some trade ties that bind sort of thing so we lose ... this is a classic low probability high impact scenario probably one way but if it does the payoff is so big wine on so\nWe actually did have a program the U.S government of course had three over the years that we know about grill flame\nSon street can Stargate the ministry of defense going into this briefly and about two thousand and one\nAnd do the study which which was classified I think the ... only it's now declassified and on limited she defends website actually or on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it's out that it wasn't a very good study I have to say\nIt um didn't live in the last ... some of the U. S.\nPrograms and and because it was an intelligence program the age old problem they they work so much in silos that they didn't go out and talk to the people that they probably should have talked to I some of the people involved in Stargate and real fame and some trade\nWhat do you what do you think rumors about a congressional hearing on your phones ... ... ...\nYes it has I mean actually this this is a big breaking news story literally just this week it it turns out it's more than rumors I'm only know from\nReliable sources that the Senate Armed services um Services Committee has already started looking at the two thousand four main incident which of course was the focus of of some of these\nThese the classified videos that we've been talking about they've interviewed at least to the pilot and I think one of the radar arthritis so so we have the Senate\nArmed services committee involved we also empower level have the house armed services committee involved and if you look at the congressional record\nFor the house armed services committee dated\nApril ninth you will see a paragraph tucked away and I think it's run through about forty three forty four pages but All right there on the second page paragraph for three I\nWon it says that the CIA ... supply the committee with a briefing on basically what I did Nick\nWhen we come back we'll talk more about these rumors of congressional hearings and then we'll take phone calls spine law were just they had with Nicole goes to goes the mind them more about tonight just log on to go to ...

these talks of congressional hearings would you think could happen in could happen when\nI'm I suspect now it'll be next year because of of course we've we've just had the bruising judge Kavanaugh um ...\nSong get we're coming up to the midterms but as I say we know the Senate Armed Services Committee and health\nUm Services Committee have been looking for the war it have been doing and secondly I think that interest has waited until the whiter question off you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy para I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of the uh science technology and space committee\nAnd the space subcommittee that could actually be a little bit of a don't fight about that I mean that's another\nPoint if this congressional interest which we know Israel evolve into formal congressional hearings\nThe question arises well where should those hearings be as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the spice subcommittee or the the science technology and space\nMain committee I think I think it will be difficult to get it away from the military frankly hit with a military and intelligence program and I I just can't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks and it terms of reference about unconventional threats well if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay a mystery it's it's bad\nSo so you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact that there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I I supplied some briefing\nMyself and I sit and they said that I'd be I'm happy to to testify\nIf my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things\nWhich I think it's it's bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been um national daily newspaper reports that I've actually gone into the fight but yeah there is this\nCongressional interest in UFOs and you know all four of those articles or in British newspapers\n... one us I don't know yet no\nNo thank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcast there is also doing what they do to get the word out there\nI absolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunately he got the ... one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself\nAh it it's kind of like like we said with alien and again you know if you don't like the way that you you are portrayed on TV sometimes when you're writing documentary well I I take the same view newspaper articles\nAnd this this week I had an article published in the guardian newspaper which is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nAgreed on line or two\n... yeah I absolutely as they will have to be these days and and my my own if you go in the guardian basically um I expose the Senate Armed Services Committee and ...\nCommittee in ... and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it it's it's staggering but have before articles I've seen about this all for it and I'm a great ... one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line or I'd love to see a survey of a twenty five to thirty year olds in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean of course all of the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in my hand and we'd only write things you know I I used to get disappointed like when somebody said oh it's it's certainly ... but now I guess my my reaction should be well great like\nGets
