that's why how he won he picked off\nThe far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult it the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are polarized this Kavanaugh thing it was just pure partisan you know the

the Republicans for defending him in and installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really\nI think that that social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs in soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and do all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate enough and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war\nThe social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south was read this time\nWith

next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover and zero hour\nAnd ... and our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes\nAnd this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boomer and global his\nLaw you know here we have had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and if I did or didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position we're coming into a truth outlets that kind of marketing gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made it finally comment and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump had that surprise when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look\nThis is a river so this is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that um and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to say\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea\nWhich would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so are there were peaking now or best Trump holds on and noticed that there were going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash and history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting path\nNext to the end of next year but there is there is a fifty fifty chance of happening now and you don't want to get hit by that forty percent\nWe know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit and China made the biggest was the only stock market that violated a critical point yesterday it went down some more but came back up to even but it's still\nViolated

now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble in the economy starting in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation where they would predictably spent and when they would stop spent ... so yeah what we see\nIs it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight will be over about about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst\nAnd and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states is kind of the best house in a bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics or we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing with the biggest Boston bubble burst all ready has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty per se there's going to be another big commodity boom and Bob all which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more money there\nSo you could buy these metals and things like that everything from goal\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah but next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only the\nOrange or just a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boomer so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shelters should want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today a massive way in Japan and places like Germany there's more people dying and selling homes and young people at the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like hell\nSure it will do better than other sectors so\nIn our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be ... it'd be the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens when a regional

World War two\nThe disruption a around the world that makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and ... and it's a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThat they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much 'cause they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter in ... Arizona to get things started with a side Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think you're right\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and I think that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging but they also tend to have you know capital they raised up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk or two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take\nYou know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits and we're going to hurt them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms\nHave have it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen in people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's something we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr debt I Want to ask about

with them they go to places like Texas formerly all red state which is now only purple\nOr to sum this up uh these people when they're left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are letting\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with the Puerto Rican example\nA and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas have been struck down because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote in a herd instincts Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times and like\nLook to hurricane was

that it's not going to happen and I don't know I kinda think it will but I I don't know I'm optimistic and I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few legs and because I when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent account\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare they're on a run and win when that guy too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes a changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nAnd two thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in a voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell here's a I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent quantitative easing just for birds the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks\nWho got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they sent everybody at twenty five every household with twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger\nOnly made the rich richer is only benefit of corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main\nSteal the reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to a check areas because I wanted them to be forced to spend that rather than being you\nKnow right if they don't spend it or do they get you're right that that's much better way to the point is to get every day people some relief and and to have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron hello Harry Good them\nWell hello there Georgia in that area that question you mentioned earlier about the banks and you're making it again just now but I'm the taking the money I'm typing in my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been there was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems with farms\nWere over expanding and borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do with bank if governments have to ask for money or pull accounts they are going to do for the more fluent towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with ... Hi Barbara North Carolina\nOkay thank you\nAnd I think you just answered that part of one of my question but when I asked\nA direct and I can't even buy a car and my parents were flying a lightening up I'm like oh hey humiliate crumble combat line\nRight yup they play all about timing\nAnd all of that tiny one of my guiding lonely and she just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nI mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of off the larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever's scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major clubs but the smaller towns it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money in your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus\nIt was a lot of rich Russia's big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they did and of course when\nWhen things go bad people going to hit on the positive Iceland went down and basically all the foreign depositors at foreign loans and protected their own people so yes smaller accounts domestic accounts\n[noise]\nLet me tell you about Dr many ... she has forty years of experience working in the mental health field a medical degree from the University of Manitoba is a diploma in psychiatry from McGill University and all throughout his entire life\nHe has had many close brushes with that as well starting in the womb\nYeah you said a number of paranormal or anomalous experiences visions breed cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message Barry nap origins is well welcome to the program Dr many meat is on the coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences\nThat started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders for normal first came out many people ask me if the book was based on stories which my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nA doctor's bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by patients and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nThought stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I had the experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many ... that that [noise] um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience\nBut the um term near death experience you know it's going back Dr vehement moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right\nI think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how my clothes brushes\nWith death effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\n[noise] in other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then they and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual their first um couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of ... the ... you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeeze\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the um anonymous stem cells donated pollen allergen it transpired mhm with more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nI just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOne of those super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia rule jeeze um yeah\nAnd I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um like transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said we can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body\nYeah was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that fight against that they gave me the parents find huh [noise] now the person who gave me the ... with an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed the contact mhm and I did read him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy [noise]\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [noise] so he was flown\nBack into that don't you send for Washington DC and a team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I find that ...\nHave you still in touch with him did that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life\nAnd they hear all for them you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and now is required is that she swab type that's it\nYeah that that takes a lot to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bang and then I'm ... years later and came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know\n... we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave me the injection for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live\n... yes we've become friends and I just I'm not too long ago\nDr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psyche grown has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the if the ... [noise]\nHowever since I have that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's a psychic experience in a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person see something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed to the last ... I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of ho staff contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased husband in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel we've touched on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common\nIn fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one even if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know an atheist and agnostics heaviest experience as well as religious people\nYou see that every one is like you and I I tend to believe you can agree with you OK but\nUh when you said that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory\nYou know it includes things such as ESP or ... or the or the cognitive beams and other things have talked about such that stations hundred voices and so on death that vision is near death experiences\nSo certain types of fake experiences such as ESP until after the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person and then you say oh you must be ... I was just thinking about\nYou right now is that very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the site to grow out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better rather than the others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ... runs in\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the ... more Dr ... is

Mandy let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely calm and don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he thought his late sister he mentioned oh they don't you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nSo she got on the plane and sure enough that's what happened so sometimes people have these experiences have these beams and they disregard them you know and I've heard of other cases like that too\nSo as you say these people are going to Venus can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that I've been up another subject which is sometimes people see messages in dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit world\nYou know but some of these messages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear\nMhm you know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the ... the studies that they mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know you know and how how did we know\nIt's right you know um so yeah that could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um it wasn't a pay cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear\nHey when I woke up this is the message I got I I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion\n... and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she'd been that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate ignored pleas also with the favorite told Julius Caesar it'd be where the march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their permission stole mini\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't leave their intuition\nAnd then they do the ... after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened you know [noise] that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregarded things which could be dismissed that superstition\nThere's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was above horse racing and ... one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't back on that horse built on something else and lost\nIn ... in the movie screaming at ground you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your ...\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fair I think people don't believe it [noise] they don't believe and also\nThey were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth will have another body experience during surgery and then when they\nRecover from the anesthesia and they wake up the evil to tell the doctors nurses um what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies with one patient who is blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the parent and on his\nDoctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded\nThere was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his statues and he wanted his teeth back\nRight yeah have you\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wild yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual\nI mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... and people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical are mysterious Israel different words of being used to describe the same event\nBut I think paranormal event can have a spiritual component\nYeah\nBut I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who was having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our routine nine to five eight you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls your goals your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many other things\nYou were just talking about here on the coast to coast they find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to go to ... am dot com\n[noise]\nThe ... radio weaken sports time capsule\nSports fans of Sandy West and I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history let's start off back in Nineteen fifties where Woodrow Wilson becomes the first us presidents who attend the world series game\nThis weekend Nineteen fifty the Cleveland Browns played Pittsburgh for the first time in the Steelers thirty Seventeen why\nThis week in Nineteen fifty six Don Larsen of the New York Yankees which is a first no hitter in the history of the world series even better it was a perfect game\nTo this day no other pitcher has had a no hitter in the world series this week in Nineteen fifty seven the Brooklyn Dodgers announcer moved to Los Angeles Los Angeles agreed to build a new stadium something to Brooklyn wouldn't agree to the Dodgers played their first four seasons as a Los Angeles memorial coliseum\nBefore opening Dodger Stadium on April ...

I was out of the body travel and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been in for child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there is a really intense suffering like when the Israeli people and we were hiding under the along with sewage canal yeah what was that the fifty seven more\nNineteen sixty seven\nSixty seven yeah um I I go to places that are are really really bad\nWhy [noise] I don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat do you what do you think of as many\nWell I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you were weight\nWhere I was little they were when I was sleeping [laughter]\nUh ... the other ones where I'd been out of body I'm just waking up okay between sleep in and awake but it's the most interesting experience I think I've ever had is what I was looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed\nBecause I'm In physical form and there is no we're on earth\nThe love that you feel when you were in that particular place of knowing what all the incumbency love is and what I was during meditation or we think and\nI could see if you know what glitter looks like in a in a like a a helmet for a motorcycle helmet yes how different angles\nWell this was alive light and the whole screen of my vision was filled with is glittering youthful different colors of orange and yellow\nAnd I couldn't hear the voice saying this is love and I was\nTotally engulfed in it and it was just a beautiful experience but I found listening to people talk about near death experiences mine near death experiences aren't when ... I'm Out of my body and I'm seeing what's going on and I\nThe last time it happened I was in surgery and as I came back into my body I could hear the the anesthesiologist saying we're losing her and I thought\nA regional thing I'm back here yeah all\nRight [laughter] you know that type of stuff and that's the reason I I called was the question about what is the difference between schizophrenia\nHaving these types of vision is because I've been up\nAll right that's that's kind of a fine line isn't it many\nWell yes and no like I said with had steady where these patients were misdiagnosed because they reported hearing voices but otherwise they were fine so the question is whether the person can carry on with their daily life\nOr whether they're able to function or whether is an illness that's interfering with their life so it you can make a diagnosis or just on the basis of the fact that person is hearing voices are always having other body experiences that would lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia\nBecause someone with a diagnosis gets feeding has to have a thought disorder as well have to have problems with their thinking and with their emotions and you know with their parents with their behavior it's all encompassing so the types of description the description of the types of experiences you you've had doesn't sound like schizophrenia to me\nWhat about ... nations compared to the actual psychic things what's the person they're\nWell there again like police nations can be found in a lot of different medical conditions not just schizophrenia and it can also be released nations and also be found and people who are mentally and physically healthy\nSo you know I guess ... each person has to be assessed you know in terms of you know what their symptoms are and and you know how how much they're affecting that person's ability to function [noise] but I was just going to say about your caller I was thinking maybe one of the reason she goes to places when she's out of her body she goes to places of pain in\nThe dark and places that are dark maybe he's trying to help maybe in some way she's thinking on a on a spiritual level she can help these people\nYou think she's doing it on purpose\nI think so I think there must be a reason why she's going to those places\nTo go to Joe in Monterey, California Joseph go ahead\nA Ninety charge a
