when you wrote this book did it surprise them\n[noise] and it's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think as I told people about the evidence that I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up at the pre cognition tell look as a psycho couldn't he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be researched it knew\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture show\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chose videotapes of various anchor people and the the one that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired or they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nOr that type of technology that is being used in pre sentiment experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no psycho Comey says\nIs the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at like ... which is disability for the mind ... matter\nThe classic study used this random number generators\nThese machines that spit out the heroes and one in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have if you present heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more one heroes again what do we find is that there is a mall but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators more just went ballistic\nAnd and people do people have that ability or yeah\nThat's right George those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines where they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experimenter had done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world around event\nThat we know are produced heightened emotion and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant trip basically in a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike\nAt nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a yellow her you know that name of course an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor ... says she had the ability to use have been spoons keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say doll which trickery its magic but the the if you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught ... be taught\n\nI've heard of of spoon bending parties which\nSounds ridiculous but I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind in a way to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator which actually\nBending metal for example and early ... as an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw ... than\nThere are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gallery\nVery interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about ... abilities but not in the context of spoons ending up in the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say in the direct quotes from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is\nBack Margot over with us we'll get to your calls as well this hour mark ... near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into the tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought that up George this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was the nation perhaps it give that into a window into a reality that we typically don't eat with our eyes I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have their in cardiac arrest ever stop potatoes and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences\nThat are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is\nFrom doctors and party up in a care of your journal called resuscitation two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nIt was later found to be the defender later and we know that that's happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamp and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinct gets down and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body\nThey see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard\nAnd it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make that according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have a conscience experience memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual study that the med school and looked at the very closely and Dr Bruce scraping his one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary\nA perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes fill a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality\nThough I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show up at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut candidate Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational a gift and the material left\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think\nThere is this phenomena going I just think regarding and the ... ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are cottages goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil\nI Would call it an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be\nSeeing you ... you know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically I liked it\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications all explained psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded than than\nEx her aunt antidepressants or major tranquilizers ...\nSack chemically the brain and their work they do affect\nChemical you the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even an aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain of the truth that headaches the going back to psych ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively [laughter]\nThe mind and that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious as the minds it does seem to show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that if\nThe mine in the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill\nAnd this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise] imagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene we know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related\nTo the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain of highly related to consciousness you damage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna\nReceiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer\nOf consciousness when ... what do you think mark of reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories to people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's the chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another often simply\nWe have Monique in Southern California was assigned Monique go ahead\nI George and yeah I have a question for your gas sure how I thank you for a ban on the show so I'm back in two thousand and one I experience [laughter] act I told comment was set and believe actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week\nOn unfortunately it ... me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh

surround us all I mean we are electric chemical beings but at the physical level we have our molecules moving through an electric field are nervous system\nThat's magnetism [noise] okay that's electricity it's just the same thing when you were in\nFifth grade and you made a a little dynamo with a wire wrapped around a a a a close pen and made all that traumatic or something same thing only we're talking about something at the fine it's fine it's the frequencies she will\nMean everything will be ... everything in the world can be defined by either it's density or its frequency\nOr ... or maybe all this theme theme thin film of organic life\nOn earth which you know is is thinner than the skin of an orange on an orange\nOr as some old you know the whole guy is the whole you know it's very complex very very huge being that exist sits on its own timescale our lifetime of Seventy eighty years but but what a brass\nOf the earth which you know again if everything derived from consciousness that's the same thing that Michael ...\nTalks about with consciousness wounds\nAnd I'm like you're open to the possibility that there's something very unusual going on\nI guess I'm In my work it might work are often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks on doubting\nWith water which in yes okay I've seen it work the at work and then feed the drillers calm and drill right to that same to adapt\nAnd there it is the war and they're you\nKnow again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that there's something there that we don't fully understand\nThen can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that ah the cows are that are seen that with three different methods brass Raj wheeler sticks and penguins over a map\nMhm okay I'll watch pendulum over a map which was the most strangest one of all that somebody could could could find water and yet there it is up comes to water [laughter] so\nAre is the Dow is there a particularly sensitive to the electromagnetic rocks and the earth caused by the water moving through various layers of conducting semi conducting insulating properties who knows\nWhat she had scientists we need to we in science cannot ignored cannot ignore\nGoing all the way back your your your guest mentioned William James\nOkay all that whole period we went all of this a lot of his early early research started\nInto shall we say five ... ... and other other sorts of things and I I I I've never seen the U.S I never see what I could call a UFO the night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw it when I never did before but I saw two\nYeah so I Can't I Kevin put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to when the rain\nComes within within you know maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know that feeling yeah\nThey can feel it it's it's they're reading comic but to the to the to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time just clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin say the things Steven just said we're on her way using it\nYet even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomena much more to understand the nuances of how it all works\nI don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things I've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field a physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one\nYou affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now I Albert Einstein did not like this at all\nHe called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fact that that anything could travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant particles that there are things in the ... the average of reality that are totally counter intuitive\nBut we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do tactically this it opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to think like altruism which if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again in one more time do you bought your website and where people can get your book in into upside down thinking\nThank

where we talk about those stories that we are going to talk about them now the name of the book by wrong collecting Maureen would more goes chronicled stories from the wrong with the unknown the unexplained it'd be unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic trench medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe has communicated with the deceit shut the age of Fifteen she was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Maureen under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to doubt only understand but also control this gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adults to say on says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me looking forward to the Fifteen Years old all this happened for you\nYeah I Know as you're reading that and thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nMe about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very a a wonderful\nWoman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was barely renowned and the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is in Salem and he'll often when I was\nYounger I see her walking around town you know dressed in her her job and very regal looking very um you know she's big presents for a person and ... at\nThe time people will come or rude open arms you did they go oh my God loser which\nYeah that's a\nGreat question she you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but\nLet's just say the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seemed to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of season and it's you know go to Salem um so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a few generations psyche trench medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you should disability what\nYear who do the start with\nNo my um\n[noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought just those girls insane [laughter]\nUm but I Would come to her and talked to her about spirits I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she's normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in the metaphysical in that spiritual realm and one day I mean she was with talking you know in her sixties she finally told me that she is you don't want Maureen\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and do readings for them and\nShe said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio so\nWould you see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew her\nUm but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that\nYou know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judged by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDo the overpass dome stories from one to the other than you could carry through\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know\nThat was her true so she was very unique about what she said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say\nI'm about spirits anyway\nNo you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me\nTo tell the story but he started this story after I'm a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took to try to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he started cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing on goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would\nFocus on but it's a team of individual that you know over\nThe years I've learned is you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for things that go on for the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nTo want to look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and um people were getting a little freaked out and they need help\nSo it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigation so people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just so off the wall when you go to their house and then just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\n[laughter] I'll show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\nUm you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred and investigation is um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent\nWould we find something active going on at the time but we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise]\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it\n[noise] um so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street you'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWould it be clues about what may be a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been you know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or\nMaybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass 'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there are different you know event like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just\nDie as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stress from the stairs\nOn you know all these\nOut she'd have something go on in the oven like she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in foil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look and the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nAnd and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want to hear and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary hey we'll be

the\nLibrary there are a bookstore I guess it's a better word for it and I'm a member of the man came in and she told all about uh how they used to come in in the morning and sometimes they would find books in the middle of the floor and they couldn't understand why it happened so she finished her little spill\nOn the side and then I get up and began to talk as suicide began to speak one of the books from behind me came\nFlying into the middle of the room in front of thirty five he sees\nAnd there's no way they would just fall\nNo it didn't it was like just fall down behind me I mean I was they come flying by the end\nLike somebody was throwing them at you\nExactly they and like I said with thirty five people started I didn't see and unfortunately because my back was started to it but I saw the but go by and screams [laughter]\nDo you think there was somebody back tossing them at you\nI'd certainly looked in ... so you know but that was just the wall where\n... what has for you that you know on the cases that you've been in have you ever felt that your life was in danger\nOr ... or did\nNot find it in the Bible leaving me\nAnd I first book uh goes chronicles is ... is the second book on the series\nA marine and I didn't investigation that was the daytime and investigations jumped him and called me up and asked me to check out his house so I gather ... now that we went to his house and the places that massively looked like it has been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... ah and ah they kind of got us for a while after we did have thing and\nUh one of them move separated me from the other one and the other one talked marine we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and ah so he won the marina comeback alone but that didn't turn out so if there was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's it's one that's left an impression with us I think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring with you\nA very on on on the particular case uh the you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more pieces equipment a small case the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know tried to ah bring the proper equipment that you wouldn't eat for instance if you have reports of a ... be unseen\nYou might bring more video equipment are and you're like thermal or I or whatever that you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies according according to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across that I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization of a goal visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations ... probably four times um but the interesting part about it a judge is that they weren't really well I was ... times in the world while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nI work with a a lot of White Houses or a funds for him and we do you know public go sons and that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions or one that I Do these goes to his cause I'm On board of directors of course on top of a White House so we do these hunting tours and one time we were in this um\nIt's ... uh like an observation tower where it's a square building with glass all around you\nAnd say he's windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and those who want to do it in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to him I'm doing my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the ... the a side of the wall you know it's going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself who she came and then they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for ... I saw her continually walk all the way towards the door and I waited\nAnd waited and yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the the rock out there and there was another one by the ... inches of snow this there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my ... to wait for her to walk in\nAnd yet there was no one there and oddly enough that said location is where the coast guy 'cause it's on the coast guard base\nA coast guard report and she and women walking on the wall in that same location so it's it's kind of intriguing I'm an I'm perhaps in the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public or goes times on uh\nWhat island lighthouse in Bedford pool meals Maine we were in the White House ah keep U.S House it was under\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on a picnic table in the in the room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen I saw a dog will cross the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how he drives do you hear that\nWell I was on the yeah yeah the the was it was all about\nSo I jumped up meal you're in the kitchen\nAnd it will go out the door was closed\nSo I came back to the woman is she says why would you see that's that's our dog she says described much sure absolutely absurd squares date\nLike described the door she just stood there and shook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know there was the White House keeper here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be released them we the island\nOr the dog wouldn't go so all the White House keeps us after we took care of them to a dog actually died and I don't she says the dog you describe pretty much mattresses\n'cause she has a dog a dog and I did see a picture that looked like it but can I say that was it though I Know but so I mean there's two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it certainly saw it would appear to me that the upper Russia\nWhen it's still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back in both a year old will take a phone calls next on coast to

collect Ken Maureen would with us and we're going to take your phone calls as well more goes chronicles Maureen say hello to run\nA Ron How ya doing she never touched me in the morning there you go [laughter] so how often do you get to calls Ron for ghost investigations\nYou know it it's funny when we first started we we ... it was quite common but there are so many good so like when I first started I always say there was\nA ... you have to do was knew it was like twenty four in the country and all this like twenty four and any city but the judge I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael this just an image now of the ... center right now has got what I don't know if you've seen that yet or\nYou know I haven't seen that yeah it's pretty that's you're already it's on MSN dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate in Britain that thing down from a four to nothing on\nThat that would be good [laughter]\nI think we've been able to do some of them so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence or\nI I have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go to big location you have to know a where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noises coming out of the technical area you might want to concentrate your audio recording\nIt for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and so if you ... you have to have a little bit of it I Try to get too much into the details with tour for the the client is for lack of it or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for a strictly investigate\nThat the popular question 'cause then that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know you know what were they doing you know they're not going to release his parents and you know do the things you hear from people but\nYou know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to
