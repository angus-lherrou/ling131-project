A. dot com call now\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether the global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve New book outside the green box told me about the titles personable\n[noise] sure well that's a this is a book that tells you what's your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxer sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nAre the ice caps melting or not she\n[noise] what we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years and so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and I'd Greenland but the amazing thing is the ah the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody to come up with a right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nAnd they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts it's seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is in the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice and falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities that one renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure uh some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the a cost of their wholesale electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is\nLucian out there actually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about on my book you know I talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes or no they uh all modern landfills and\nIn Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way um our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants rolled down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so busy or as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches yeah\nYeah it is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite\nA climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized them do you get booted no I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible it man made climate change and\nThat we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so so a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles\nThey cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example and a regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying well water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign

to hey buddy a many many years ago the founder of coast to coast art bell and his buddy Whitley Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm\nAnd that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and while I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming in Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies that very well happen\nYeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their young to call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a the a a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean currents\nOr which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sink Senate it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian or the Pacific the the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a\nCause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop that current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so uh there was there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that\nThe no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh they'll make had\nStill doing its thing whoa okay go ahead John\nYeah but in the army who ah\nWho quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're\nTalking about wind bills when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind whales that they had and I think the out in the meal that they had a big fat and it was about twenty four black\nBlue flame you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas or where he now why go to put a generator on\nThat and we'll do ... you know Christianity they'll come back and they said no no no it's going to cost too much you can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that\nAnd they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Wonder why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills a but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext on let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi George and thank you for having Steve von Loor spoken to smoke into several times are\nHurting on many shows and he has a breath of

when most of the world was uninhabited we at all for us and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to\nTo NASA or their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nRight now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician hotels you he knows how to stop sea level rise to hold onto your wallet\nUh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a if you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast but the ... it used to be a big court or a big port on in in a\nNorthwest Italy an excuse\nTo be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what they what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce Steele before I I I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a dimension or perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumb what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is abrupt climate collapse and we never hear about\nWord climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over Seventy years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this a lot of ...\nHeart technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all any time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why\nYou're not seeing the real no a weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon\nBut there's a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood\nThat this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps on him is his name but he is showing actual weather satellite maps but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm fronts hurricanes tropical storms low pressure zone coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up\nThey're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricanes they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zone and this is what's happening this is not\nAn act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex what's happened our with our weather\n... ones don't hear about it and the new\nOne skin Steve's reaction to that Bruce IQ\nBruce said something I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he did go ahead [laughter]\nWell as you go to that man just said is exactly right I Want to these conservative it happens to believe that\nThe way to add on is being Gail engineered the camp trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on a show talking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy\nAnd the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the boycotting out son where people have so much more hectic\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to earth science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to Wall Street and on the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes that they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the show on the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything\nNow I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't man ever come up with man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing\nThat Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham meant they weren't they were doing a stripping the oil industrial nations away\nDistributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China it's over there with their sky completely with pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America but it going to play the oh I Know now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time

William welcome to the program\nGeorge thank you so much for having me I feel like an end to the living room with an old friend\nYou have my friend just as a I'm looking forward to this you got to tell us about this a young age encounter with big for what happened\nWell I'd never had an encounter with big foot uh my first ah a realization\nOf the character came with uh the Patty film probably somewhere in the late sixties early seventies ha ha\nAnd um I've had other encounters in my life but not with the uh the hairy men and after I saw that I said to myself my God this type of thing is roaming around North America\nAnd ah unlike other people who thought it was a hoax and still do to this day I was a I was sold on it from the beginning I just said to myself this thing is real it's out there and ah these fell is ah have seen it and got in on film\nYou convince people William or seen something very strange and unusual they're not making these stories some things out there and there's some kind of creature\nI have no doubt about at George and are based on um the encounters into testimonies if you think about it what would make a husband and wife sell the home that day love if they hadn't had something that scare them off the land exact\nUh what makes a hunter\nSellers gun collection and vowed that he'll never enter into the woods again\nAfter having encountered a something in the forest [noise] uh to me is everybody a lying is everybody out of their minds I don't think so I think these people are having real uh encounters a in most cases they've been frightened half out of their way\nAnd a ... as far as everybody else is concerned everything's a hoax right from the get go\nWell will come up with a number of different theories and what we all think big foot might be we'll take calls next hour I'm going to ask you this because I was raised Catholic what is a Catholic blogger where do you do\n[noise] well basically I uh talk about the things that I Believe a troubling mankind and uh try to get to the bottom of the heart of the matter if you will um [noise]\nUh the things that plague us you know the things that are troubling people in life and living and marriage and and work and uh try to expose these troops to the individuals by using my blog\nAnd I I don't blog ... I'm a ... you know I'm not on the blog every day I kind of bloggers ... to do so\nAnd I'm I'm getting some good feedback from it you know people seem to enjoy it and um and pretty much that say you know I mean I think we all have a responsibility to have a voice in this life\nUh especially if it's for the good of you know what I mean that's why you appreciate the coast to coast you know I've been in and inside for a long time\nWell thank you and I'm when I'm at my desk at work I have a little I taught and one of my abs is coast or what is he listening to [laughter]\nExactly you know people are always ah getting your near what is that what are you listening to over there and uh I I tell them so I tried to promote the show as much as I can let's\nThink he is a tough being a blogger ... religion and spirituality and also a believer that there's a creature out there we all called big foot\nNo not at all to me um as\nAs far as a big foot goes as far as you opposed go as far as angels go you can\nPick the topic [noise] um\nI Believe all of these things for me for the both of my faith you look at the universe is just a vast and wanting to research thing\nAnd ah even our own planet continues to amazing baffle us with the discovery is being made day in and day out\nAnd if you just think about something like the dinosaurs for a moment or if it wasn't for one guy who is out there looking around and places where your normal person does not seeing a bone hanging out of the hillside\nMhm we wouldn't really know about them but we know from even books like Michael ... book forbid knock allergy there have been a\nPeople of civilizations or animal life here will be for us and yet we're given the account biblical leave from Adam and Eve on wood so to me it's a test of faith uh what do you believe what I'm giving you from this point forward in spite of knowing what we're going to discover after the fact\nSpeaking of books I got from you too volumes of books he was on amazing but I was afraid that you sent me originals\nWell here's what happened to George and this kind of humor is um when you produce that had contacted me uh I had an order in four foot they're actually made to order\nOn Amazon and I had given all of the copies out I had and I had what\nI mean I I had an order in fruit punch bowl [laughter] either that or I have nothing to send George [laughter] so I said\nI could make up some copies [laughter] uh and put them in folders and send them out there and she said oh that'll be fine\nOn as I was telling Tom tonight I said Tom oh my God I think I think bill sent me his original book before you got it wrong [laughter]\nNo no have I have no fear have no fear\nThe Senate and want to send it back\nNo no that's okay and as a matter of fact uh probably within the next few days I'll have some and I'm going to send them out to you and me a ... and the crew to ah pass them around and ah enjoy them what\nIs your instincts tell you based on your war the big foot might be because this is what I hear I hear it could be an extraterrestrial it could be physical creature you could be an ape it could be dimensional we hear all kinds of things what do you think\n[noise] well [noise] uh [noise] my my own personal theories are on that or to fold a number one in the physical realm\nThis is a creation this is a creature that out there uh how many of them all day yeah we don't know nobody knows but\nBased on the fact that they leave print from both the hands in the feet a according to some testimonies they bleed having been shot\nA and they die as well and getting into a little later on a which to me makes them a living breathing entity like any other creature a B the greater small on the planet\nA I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart any way that they do exist and that people have every walk of life or in countering them uh having said that uh we\nWill get into a little story later that out of hand picked for the ...\nAnd it's a and I have a couple of them are that do involve a UFO phenomena and my take on that is that there may be some mimicking going on here\nOf the natural okay the UFO suits so I think\nI think

with William ... author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a break on us\nOff and on this particular day he was standing there in the noise or the falls and on the opposite bank the creek which was loaded with toll kind of pointing ... uh pines\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee\nSo he's watching this thing going up and down and thinking to themselves what on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here now he couldn't cross the river\nAnd when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees that surround again in other words there were like low boroughs ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high treason could see it\nAnd went to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and one position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees some ... in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you had mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a there's been a number of people that moved to the house is a\nUnited sooner aren't and rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story a\nInvolving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talked about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the ...\nRisk of New England combined\nAnnual exam Ninety\nPercent of it is on inhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd all these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine\nOr the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them we're gardeners they will gardeners\nThis was like a match made in heaven well as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of using the gardening tool the wife is saying the husband was to shovel wisdom rate was so finally the husband get the idea\nThat they're going to gather together with the tools they have to an inventory and then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hands spades\nFor having accomplished that they realize they were missing some tools\n[noise] and they started they left to hand spades\nOn what she called the the wife called the heat stroke table on the patio and they were using them for partying plants\nAnd no sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn they it actually called the police report on the property of you know tools and this and that\nNumber and understand who would come on their land and take tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel\nYou're going to Rob the place Rob the place well crash [laughter] bright ... and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods they found one of the shovels leaning on the tree and the wife spoke out nine feet off the ground one of these you know what one piece\nHand garden trials with a rubber handle on it showed into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up show they went back to doubt they got a right that gets an iPhone ... took pictures of it they brought a latter route the husband couldn't Bush drifting was buried under a tree several inches he couldn't budget [noise]\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop shovel when the ... everybody was baffled by you know the turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was\n\nThe cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives\nWell\nAs I said the long and short of it was a couple of days later they came outside and the guardian behind the house\nHad been trampled down there were huge footprint in bed or tomatoes were taken the head of lettuce one mashed and whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot\nHad stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just step right over the warrior\nWinning had it's full of feed and then left they recall the uh the police over to see what had happened that would have transpired\nAnd he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports periodically of people saying they show these big tall creatures coming in their property of walking now so it\nIsn't John convincing yeah it's not like it's not like these things on being seen it's just that they're not being talked about which\nIs a very odd thing you know you know George think back to us to\nTalk

the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of was told to me by of all things a Russian professor\nWho was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time nickel and they formed this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership\nAnd they had run across a couple of big for its\nMessing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was on familiar with now this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with [noise]\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in ah the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing and Minnesota and they talked on a\nPulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought the look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they were on scene by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ... and they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and a Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the uh the uh uh yesterday and the abominable bull a snowman I have no idea uh I have a senator since ... book the bomb Rose Bowl a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading uh an encyclopedia on the creature\nA and yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff as a whole ... all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax\nThe film is a hoax or was he a a a dirty little ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of ... what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast\nYou know uh we all\nTune in because we're hearing things that we can get in Oklahoma ... nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos and big encounters where's the Tania\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the ... falls incident but one night I'll share with you a ... was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys got while working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being saved so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words held than SOS are using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green vows and that night they decided to go on a night hike\nTo see what it was like a navigating around\nIn the dark are now during the day they had climbed up\nThe sides of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation\nAnd they had gone up into the same area right night for the ICC well when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision\nA by knock you lose your own monarch you'll or\nA that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail\nWanting to the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed in the distance of light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a you know battery operated lantern but then they realized that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them there's just no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even close to their butt trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but\nIt was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it right so that that passing a it\nWas that bright yeah I mean it it it's a glowing orb of light darting around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world [noise]\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's still something really weird\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he describes a globe ... coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow a bubble through want as a child okay\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this war and making its way down to the ground [noise]\nAnd what blew their mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times for thirty times the
