Institute in Virginia and William cells as a certified therapist and he guide you\nTo these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that they exist from my experience they love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the show thanks for joining William\nHi how are you feeling good aid\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such assistance such an eye out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then there should be impossible but I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and\nI decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him\nSo I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so\nI explored them and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first fully conscious out of body experience and it was it was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a\nBeliever but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your family who had actually the your entire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience with sales induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise or that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a hit\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your hope he will get you go what did you experience how did you know it was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently [noise]\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you reach the arm out\nOh no I was nonsensical I I didn't realize it was that you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them standing in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nBut they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I at first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that's around as you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience I'm In other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the sort of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhen I began to experience was or not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA ... than at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them\nYes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not couldn't jak sure or belief system mhm\nI always think you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't have stopped here I mean with all the intelligence that we had a year and with all the information to human beings why would the universe just create one type of human being and that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional [laughter] and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human\nThere has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they feel real you know he was playing the because usually not a language to really clearly defined what another dimension is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd the all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere was no um when I teach my classes are there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say\nTo go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they\nFeel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow you're listening you teach them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called it an afro tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great invasion him only twenty four people can attend it's\nA world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I each person is in a checked unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um what is that controlled holistic\nAnd suddenly your entire body it's called ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that so there was a lot of people that we're shifting those are\nPeople that died and this is a\nThis is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's it's functions and different names and different cultures but and then I went to ... we we presented in\nThink I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can ... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented\nIn a very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own experience and all that\nI Want to find out a little bit more

within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people are going to be\nOf all the experiences he mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered state there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nAnd matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery were twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly out a remote\nView more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the mind near\nThe online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain waves which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to [noise]\nBut that's that that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and talking\nTo someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with their higher self with are multi dimensional fell right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and let's say by the way it's asked ... into a restaurant in snow dot org and there are great resources on there\nAnd I and I found the civically ways that you can take yourself into and it will be in that you want to go

think great that you really help and give the information freely so people can\nPractice especially if you have something going on in your life a problem or an illness\nYou can connect to your own answer Ken you connect with people that their loved ones that um can you help them with the answer\n[noise] well you can definitely contact loved ones ah it depends on whether each individual was open to whatever information you want to share but we have the ability to contact\nOur loved ones face to face\nYeah amazing experience that is incredible and and we don't need a medium to do it\nThat every medium we'll give you a second hand information filtered through their own mind [noise]\nWell it's interesting 'cause you can also sounds addict but we talk about that in a second and how you can do that or maybe even connected to strange relatives and so forth we'll be right back I'm dying to cook and [noise]\n\nI\nDo agree to use six forty WG a stew you\nCatch the ... radio show every

the mineral Institute sedative or sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the OB e training at than than real Institute Virginia\nAnd he's come up with a common reported phenomenon associated with these obese Cleveland was wondering if you could explain some of this to our audience [noise]\n[noise] yes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute\nFor the last eight years oh okay but I've been\nStudying nursing practice you know for forty or to just to go on my website ... dot org I included a over a period of ten years I did a a number of surveys\nAnd our receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nThey're kind of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance um [noise] a floating or um vibration high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people ... buzzing humming are roaring found as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally\nSpeaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nOf Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through ... if you're seeing through your clothes die lives at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you have and it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at\nA for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body right is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that that I ... on because that happened I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles ... are you saying that now the money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found and what many other um experiences I've seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nAnd what does it look like image or looking at\nIt's amazing that same applies to animals by the way\nAlso do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream began or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that\nOut of body experiences are is natural was breathing and think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're non physical ... temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological ... machine and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people are only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awaken into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and that question and have you ever tried that and I'm curious how would you know the difference between now and imagination\n... that's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience or income\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance\nI had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning\nAnd I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar but then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification\nAnd I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my\nLet's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when a Austin will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just a download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOr what's going on and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own\nThat's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated over there and like many ain't anyone other than you are\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification is\nEssential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAnd very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always have somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left of specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh ... it had been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience a menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it

I mean has there ever been reporting of that and not a good experience similar to be is that you can't not right you know it's like\nThere has been an end to ease\nAnd nightmares in ... in your fear\nBased if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a double a or Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have like you made likely have negative experience your own fear will create it\nWhen we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space\nAnd that's what people forget and I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers of non physical reality we're participants\nEach thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energy is around us we do it in the physical it's slowed down here but when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do she experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs\nAnd see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative entered its you are going to create it\nWhen your mind is going to mold of reality around you if you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness in a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that as well well\nYou are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had we had long lines where I went it was a dream I guess I remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got the motorcycle and took us a helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that\nI'm Brian ... owns a motorcycle and it was and it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was when I was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak be honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because we can't each other you know I don't know if that's an added well out of body travel most likely\nMhm well it could have been but it was it a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there was subject to I there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is non consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist and in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to look search them learn these what is essentially the rule\nAgain dial pound to five zero it'd be the key word re bottle [noise]\n\n\n\n\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am so my guess today her website is called managed to legend dot com and I love the beginning of it it does [laughter] welcome to the blue moon hunted history tours Ruben probably scaring the public since two thousand two Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie Lisa\nI'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nMy gold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan I'm going to scare the ... out of it was lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial saying can you really say piano or is it is that there's a sharing anyway go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nOn so will you send me your book and we do our you know constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's very unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience\nWhere we are normal\nWell this is this I've been seeing\nGo since I was neat a knee high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding\nAnd after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago it was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and the unite the paranormal couldn't even community and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a fence\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado mhm\nAnd so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community\nNow we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we've we call it a ... feast because every year\nWe try to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go on and the night supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I got particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them\nTo see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that's what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to shift for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGhosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through ship ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to die of cancer and how you how you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child what do you mean seeing it you you know I see it and I actually feel it I just\nPlain like humans to my examples that\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny that I can actually send things [noise] um I'm an impasse\nI think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I Am very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was that and we went back in there it was so\nI'm able to do things like that um\nBut I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to just singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while\nAnd about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast in managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nHe'd you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is the way through I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansion sight unseen I Swear\nThey because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast and I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband lives in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so he was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this\nAnd everything but we actually have this a bed and breakfast up for sale and ah if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts style I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\nExtremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we passed the house and five years\nAfter five years we could do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you well after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going roe [laughter] yeah so I actually\nCalled the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest as fate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything\nLike that while I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you know things fall out where we\nEverything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till the ghost\nOf surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nLike their innate sense that they're ready to find their way true north or south was gone\nAnd you know they had birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and it was the he was saying he wants the lady that maybe because of the magnetic anomalies the Brits were hunting confused because they were actually\nBehaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and and like ... how the pilot [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about manatees Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am Lisa guardian listening to coast to coast am\n\n\n\nWhere my\n\n\n\nRadio six forty WG as the\nNBC News radio I'm ...

you when we were just talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nKnow I'm I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nNo longer being hunted because the ghost was set free by it the truth and guess what I went up there on our birthday me and the first day which is October seventh I went up there to the theater and that those just gone it worked\nShe'll be manager confirmed that snow\nThat all of this

big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning\nBut I find the best time to actually look for those of you wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night ... ... that is the best time\nThe transition time why it's\n... it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so\nWell many call it that we can't see and when the lighting is just right than ... an artist and oil painter lends itself to the shadow does that make sense\nYes it does it make strapped when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast right now and then\nI got like it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have a youthful because of the way that bounces off the rack and that led to the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now hunted or
