Woods Lin is one of the central voices and the new consciousness movement she's the author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment in a way to the power of age Lynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention\nExperiments and she has conducted many Lynn won't come back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I did an intention a bit when the several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or the other groups you know the category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down in the ... a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens at work so they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now\nWe've run about six piece intentioned experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment\nTo lower violence in the most violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri ... and we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor of statistics look at it from University of California\nAnd she saw that climbing up the St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis as a whole property crime went up went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is what are the people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the books to feel but what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our thought everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster\nTo purify water to healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effect\nDecided the trend of the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know new pharmaceutical drug has is good or record is that in terms of studies so so as I say what really seems to be the case his\nThoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective\nField that seems to be created that has great power to change things\nNow maybe he'll think the experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had these cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy like the Deepak of the middle east\nAnd also a very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jew\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world that we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence\nAnd we chose it because it you know the seat of all the major religions we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they can talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arab we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the ship your upbeat and positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individual for instance we didn't intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide through self off of forty foot\nStructure after his he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he broke and everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community to start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid [laughter]\nSo it worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\nLynn which these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I know\nWork with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona the noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica too is a very well known professor statistics and has been doing working consciousness research I worked with the late ... rural I I worked with people from from U. Penn State university water expert\nUm I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an odd kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like we've Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientist didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results and the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's going on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd do you know loom the title of your newborn the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will tell me really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups is you know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel\nIntention experiment and the ...\nSign up for coastal zone or free

last two hundred dollars and she\nSuddenly here from Lloyd's of London to she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue so this happens so often that it it has convinced me it's not just look it's not just happenstance\nAnd you see universities are studying the power of what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found him as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all ... state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel\nLike you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander um and again we've looked at it compared to other\nUm mystical states and its\nIdentical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this the ... largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nBut one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism\nWas the University of California Berkeley\nWho did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments and they found something incredible that goes on\nA with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest nerve the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we\nDuring for babies and then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system that when we do good or feel compassionate or some something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending loved to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group\nThat Vegas you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant people not like a ... so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together when that\nOh that would be ... to ... that would be an interesting experiment\nWill you know we're doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in ... county in Florida\nUm we're gonna do something about lowering violence but we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next\nNext spring um we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou talked about a mirror affect what is that\nWell the mirror affect me with the biggest\nPiece of this George because you know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers that stuff and the receivers of the big intentioned experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me with what happened\nTo the participants in these intentioned experiment\nSo when we started doing these these experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and were they able to get on the website and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly\nI asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like that um I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek remember these are people who are participating\nIn their own home in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy\nAnd the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful they were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses and they're co workers\nThey were and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nIn a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to those people need changes their lives being part of it\nWhen we're going to come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but we'll take phone calls in just a shutdown on coast to
