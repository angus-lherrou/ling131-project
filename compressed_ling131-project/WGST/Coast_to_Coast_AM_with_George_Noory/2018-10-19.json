I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not\nYou should not ask the person who's receiving the rating\nAny questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that or why you're here you should be able to tell them that's the first half the legitimacy of what you're receiving\nThe iron ore retailer on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers of others who are critical of him say that he's just a great magician and and I told them I ... I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons magically if you're a magician I Can't see the trick\nOr you know we're we're you do the switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed him down a gun frame by frame you can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real jail I Believe he started out doing magic trick that many of these wonderful psychic do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a they're six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately\nAnd then it kinda well close together you can't tell the difference but it's wonderful that you're you're falling down frames and did you learn anything from that we're able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and clocks that haven't started in years\n[laughter] to say that when you were growing up you didn't magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nI did a little magic when I was a kid um you know wasn't I was really good at that but uh you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven uh which really I think steered me into the field\nThat I Know I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed you know if I was a trick I was visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and\nThere there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking so restrictive limiting to higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and beyond\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and other financial interests or very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because we're supposed to be and growing and a consciousness other kind of a\nDigging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers and listeners your birth month in days\nTo have a birthday and at first name possible short\nThey're asking about I'm a fellow man to a lot about love and [laughter]\nOkay and try to keep each call two minute nap for ... you can project out his cause we have so many will\nWill cut it short would try to get right in there as quickly as\nYou believe in reincarnation\nI don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have\nIf we weren't more and more than one time in either on the earth or another dimension so I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions or other\nPlanets I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say I believe in reincarnation as say a variation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and the religious voters\nAs a psychic is there anything out there that bothers you the the the you feel very strange about\nWhen you see a very strange about like um\nAre you picking on them are you picking up weird feelings or anything like that\nBut I don't like going the cemetery I I don't like the energy there and people who are ... are they go to the cemetery frequently are pointing that person back to their\nGrave site and they they really want to go into the light they wanted to be elevated themselves and yet the grieving process is really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know about grief\nBut you don't dwell on it you said you know I Love this person good luck God Bless you and try to release them and\nAnd I always think about them right here and\nThink about them you can wish them well if they're going through like God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had together and let them go I was going to the cemetery is very bad ah you know my my parents were big cemetery ... hours as when I was growing up is that it could work ... hours [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of the generation that went to the cemetery a lot you know and I found myself a cemetery great you know growing up and at one point my parents were pointing to a muscle am as we were driving through Greenwood cemetery and my mom said she I think we should get one of\nThose oh and I'm thinking well at the time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here they'll play no I'm not going to stay here on the back\nOf the things I started crying and I think what's wrong with you I I don't want to live here and they said no no no our from my mother explain more about that to me and that was very

back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I call psyche a\nVampire ... but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of healing\nLet's take some calls are

traveler\nSince doctors pronounced him politically dead in a hospital in Tasmania when he was three years old from his experiences and many worlds he created his school of active dreaming is original\nSince this is a modern dream work with the ancient some Monica mystical practices for journey to the realms beyond the physical though he leads popular workshops all over the planet including\nThree you're training for teachers of active dreaming an online courses for the shift network a noted the author he's got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back my friend\nGood debate dreaming weaving with you joy joy\nLooking forward to this and would this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell festival my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we live in West distributed to see her on the upper thing I Am the psychic media ... mean ...\nAnd she looked in the ... the old fashioned way and she saw my that she didn't tell us she went out and came back white face well she was right that when they had me when my father had been friends for the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died and help build the held my parents that I had died pronounce clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so the fact that is why the the experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books\nI must tell you George I don't remember anything much what happened when I was out by buddy age three members rather hot living under the afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions for this is an appendectomy in an operating room in that time I remember what happened it sounds like the cuts the NBA to begin with up onto the field they look you put the ... of the scalpel in the third and not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to living a pack a fountain pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go in the rye or could go and if I'm addresses\nSo I'm going to learn a pack eight nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I don't know that goes straight maybe I'm drawn into another world and when I received by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bed\nBack adventure the opposite seeming to live a whole life of Ninety year old so and I'm shocked to find myself in the body of a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding there will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about is you try to talk it out that the medication\nYou're hallucinating or something\nWho could explained to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition but you know yeah we do that we get really sick we got to live with the spirit and then we come back and sometimes we have the same and sometimes when nuts so the gift of the experiences with shrinks by coal dissociation\nBoth the buildup to either travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic without drugs quite easily at an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are like the ...\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell on the phone not lonely little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the ... moving all the time I'm Brett situation I'll tell you one thing that kept me going is it amongst mine does the bulk companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was the big man and a lot of white airing upping face\nCome and sit on my that you'd say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know go and they'll like you and one day all day you can't kill your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubbing younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his youngest filth and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe have time travel in our dreams and when we developed the out of conscious or active treat me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleaders conflict to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a wide itself who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten I could help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream traveler\nWhat is that well it means that it's one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality in two of the world we traveled the parallel worlds for example\nBut it will lead in parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis to do in our living right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it for now dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that part about dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survived physical test so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreamed travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious and that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding and lived in my life and told stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my employed cleared the loving family members around says to the spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of known local mind that science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information on the old ... and also proud of this is that we are definitely a time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes them down will notice that a dream events before they happen and one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we all said traveled into the past from this my mother lives you learned about our connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods in the multi dimensional universe\nSo this is the key to the U.S tend understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experience as pop the dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history a valued dreams and dream of St believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest salt so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our time is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions an attitude from Baton and more objective perspective than we can manage for ourselves an indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious reality is that the one called ...\nAnd ... which takes a look at what that might begin to meet and if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience\nHave lost the sense of a deep up to ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding oath on to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we remember something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell them\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially or what he can bring a dream to the table and then to the very simple fall step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes it on you can get it done and minutes you get some help feed back in your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our opinions I mean bad habits of pots and that is part of it to be let out so they rushed out at sleep by the alarm clock but then you get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in this in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch a good time to embark on loosened dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed to 'cause they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and say no more dreams so sometimes

way you do ... safely and in complete control my combined secure communication with pride at ground zero virtual credit card at a security features that you can search for life outcomes on I think I think\nAnd he hasn't reasoning them so I'm getting on a plane somewhere and I actually say when I arrive at the airport\nI don't actually need a news story today because the best stories that sometimes the dumped when something goes wrong I really just one of the road trip part at lunchtime I sit down at the airport by have a beer on the straight and I have a beer with I can\nHear me read paste man next to me as you looked like a fellow you'd like to hear a story and I look at the interest he introduces himself he's a former cop he's a former detective from the East Bay area all interesting it looks at me and he says Robert he's let my name I have to share this with someone I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd did a graveyard I'd never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk and I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I cold she'd never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head thing he says what do you think about it that it's a great story the very great story I mean that introduced this whole thing about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my call them to a certain\nGoal is to a certain place might even be an age of ... but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attract like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and ... these examples proliferate so\n... you don't remember what it how it works is that the the the attitude of the energy you of caring again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life shaping wanted waking foot waiting fuel round the next corner which\nIs a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check or to play you know when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras of limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body what how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists are telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind or not to into we at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us about a matter of reality as a dense of consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own message to the discoveries that the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experience a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time ... example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it's surprisingly high\nAnd there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gosh are my blood is bode again it's all I knew lived in pants\nAnd after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she ended up trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen can but the white queen screams\nBefore she put her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure in that before it took place and the doctor said my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating the symptoms but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was diluted you well you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know thing\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know you're not Bobby outside medic responses we pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's a good story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\n... active dreaming is a way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of elusive dreaming you would call it shut medically dreaming we ... my favorite way of ... will do some dream adventure\nIs to start at least a dozen state loose it what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming and the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay this romance and adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is and I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try like state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic and intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation and if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming of the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look at ... outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program on the method all attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think the dreams themselves misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think that didn't think the dreams in themselves to ever deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't watch around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that is truly our own can be worked in the service of health inhaling it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible based\nBut by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on its own ground you might find that behind something that's scary you know worrying\nYou and your tree is a power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or a life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about to be very misleading\nYou got a rubber we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and take phone calls and continue chatting about your latest weren't

to coast to coast a dear friend Robert boss back with us as we talk about dreams will get your calls as well Robert you write about Carl young a lot in he even had some of his own situations didn't need it didn't they\nWhat do you mean he's in situations Joe in his dream life\nOh yeah he would do you own your own was inspired by dreams I mean he said\nIn memory streams reflections but he has interesting thoughts every day but he takes up in his work and study only what comes to him\nAnd dream so here is a man I mean a titan of scholarship in science who is driven all his life by his dream of the stories in my new book mysterious reality is ... volt humans passage into the afterlife and actually what he might be doing now it's pretty interesting title\nBut the part of it that it didn't the previous documentation is that Yom dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake on legs Oric\nWhich was called bowling get out from the nearby village\nIs living in another bowling on the other side of death and those closed him said that he lost old fear of death you felt absolutely confident and so he knew where he was going to a towel on the other side of death on the lake and in a story in a mysterious round who's cold the other ball and gun I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlives situation actually give some insight\nWhere how you'll miss mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books or in the off the life I mean some people might be shocked and surprised\nBut to Rob it is crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from the other side of death but you know you'll himself to a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the deceased he talked in his in his memoirs and in his red book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the deposit that shaped your view of reality and he was one of those are always understood the one of the key things about dreaming is this it gives the U.S had the ability to understand what happens to mind or consciousness to death because it dreams as yoga understood\nWe receive visitations from the departed I didn't dreams we make travel into the rooms where they are at home but very briefly one more thing about him\nAnd his relevance to this book is my approach to everything he came late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you continue to live\nThe reality is that we perceive and dreams so I'll dreams maybe memories of ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else\nBut we visit again and again when we when we slip out of the body and go into dreams\nSo this is a great a dream Sherman of the west he knew and the manager of a Sherman because it negotiated through a deep and horrifying experience\nOf an under will journey and he paid the price of surviving that and coming back and adding his science and his scholarship to what he knew thirst and about deeper realities and giving us an incredible model of understanding of all the things we're talking about some of the great admirer of your\n... wasn't young slows who'd Sigmund Freud and then eventually they broke often had the disputes\nFreud regarded as his air ... young was joining us Freud favorite apprentice but they broke because young because Freud although at tremendous scholar and pioneer of understanding dreams in his own rights who made himself is number one a study which\nIs what you need to do to listen to to anything on dreams from someone who's not a dream of despite all that Freud adopted rather narrow view of what's going on in dreams around them that road theory and he tried to apply to human streams\nAnd you had famously a dream in which he's in a house that has on many levels and the basement area far below the comfortable Bush ... upper level is is a a floor and bones and skills and something primal\nAnd Freud insisted on interpreting the dream to young as something to do with you know a mother complex and the desire to see somebody dead\nAnd you didn't break with him at the moment then eventually he did because he felt that Freud was putting his dream experiences into coffin of narrow understanding\nAnd that breakup was very interesting because the company by synchronous stick phenomena you talked about the body and Matthew in relation to these things and one of the conversation with yoga and Floyd approaching that pops up there's a tremendous crack in a cabinet to\nAvoid stop so how scared and confused and and and and you wrote in describing this he felt something boating and his belly like a son is a new is going to happen again and there's another huge bang for the furniture sounds of blowing a pot\nSo what we're seeing in that episode is something that goes on in the phone this phenomena ... which is the thoughts and emotions we are carrying strongly\nCan have a physical impact on the world around us\nSo it's a very interesting thing in my story about you'll you'll says from the ... the life that Freud has changed at the beginning he's of all he's got a long long way since he died but they don't have much contact together now\nI Love it in your book mysterious realities the subtitle of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm what is the imaginable realm\nBut imagine round is a space between time and it turned the TV whether a palaces and schools and universities and pleasure pox that are designed by human imagination in concert with intelligence is from a
