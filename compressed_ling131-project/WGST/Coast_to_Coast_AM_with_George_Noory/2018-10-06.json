uh but he really couldn't help set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do is like when we were in one of the studios\nAre doing a um [noise] a something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a\nA myth barber stand with standing there [noise] and I I looked at her and\nI in my mind went totally blank all I could remember was Victoria bar only from the Valerie are\nExactly and what she was classic actually\nAll while she was a little clip of a thing she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd uh and she was found and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in ... the mistake of one of the cameraman said who is\nThat and James Mates mistake of saying some old time movie actor oh no oh yeah\nI mean you know better than that of course he\nDid but I think he was just\nLet's get this you know let's keep going I literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it and I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you\nAnd she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went to the light\nAnd she said huh and I said have you talked to other people like people\nShe said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go that you show up and talk about it in she went in the light so I\nHope that one of the people that when I get up there she screams\nYou remember that movie pulled guys in the the little ... little lady just shy of all I was little I don't go on and why why why why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nThought that they possessed or tricked or something some trees away it changed your personality\nOr should I Know they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when I go with ... with being shocked\nFor somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a goat to their house and so\nIt turned out that they knew who the gold was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go to you right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the ... whore house he\nSays and and uh and I helped you know ... walk on that and I looked at him and I thought the ... when did my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you\nAnd he looked at me I says why did you put flies in the attic what would that have to do with anything and he said we have ten seconds to kill\nI said flies had nothing to do was go I you needed to exterminate or not a gold person I says why did you even do that it's like people just do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of the I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous Marie I'm to dabble with the other side if you really don't know what you're doing\n[noise] I'll tell you one of the biggest pain than my side

that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well now he goes well you might as well get up and\nMove around on others as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with maple ... little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably how no it may be\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there\nAnd ah of whatever and I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a\nWintertime and we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into the bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like everybody in there that was in that bar we're focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck stuff about\nLike a bar full of empires from something here exactly as like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or at the swatter bright and sign up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go\nSo they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old dad gummed see bar yeah and I went in there with them and to this\nPlace and that was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that hard enough and the air\nAnd uh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they've found comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I worked with him um and uh yeah there are to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car\nAnd they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a war off on the farm and the caller won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven I was in the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people and and\nSo I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was uh are farther art in heaven how it'd be named\nLeaders are doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this do that I went up her where\nShe looked at me and I was an honoring a word she says are you pray him and I said yep [noise] and she goes we better\nShe knew what was going up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walk up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like\nWow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb when we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that bothers the lord and Jesus in my
