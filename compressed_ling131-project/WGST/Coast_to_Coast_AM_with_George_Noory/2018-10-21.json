one they are asked who is honest and only a third of the people say President Clinton but\nThen they're asked who are they going to vote for and two thirds of the people just about say President

to be reelected if not in a landslide than by grapes margin\nRepublicans will hold Congress no I'm not sure about this one but I Believe and I will predict the Republicans are going to hold Congress by a very slim margin\nThe Senate will remain safely in the hands of the Republicans are within a seat or two at the most\n\nWithin a year after the election the Clinton Administration is going to in my estimation be buried\nIn scandal so that takes my prediction about a year out from the election I Believe Bill Clinton's going to win Republicans are going to hold on both houses of Congress and

victory\nThe fact that means that I thought that the electoral college where what what\nElected the ...\nWell there are people who feel that way that it is technically that way but um it's it's really not and they really do follow the electorate and I've heard a lot of people say well you know they could go and do one thing after the electorate has done something else but I've never seen that

ABC CBS and NBC mhm\nI I think they have a very big buyer and I don't know there there's all kinds of newspapers and they're all ... all kinds of different media and all that but uh most people I mean there's all kinds of polls that also say that most people do get their news from TV and they believe what they see on\nTV that is true and I I think it's a shame\nWell I appreciate your culture and we'll see what others have to say\nI'm so you think that people are taking their cue from the media it is true that more people to not get their news from the media from the major media\nAh what do you think what are the rest of you think the uh ... taken by the ... campaign of late has been to attack the president with regard to the donations made by the Indonesian company\nIf he was on the

again\nUm I don't know uh it's a good question he may allow another candidates or to have the reform party next time and I really think it's it comes down to that that he will allow because if he runs he will be the candidate\nYeah in my opinion so uh if you set the reform party lose we may get a ... another candidate next time\nOkay [noise] and just one thing when you had the the two candidates from or the other parties like uh the libertarian yes thing I'm scared about that\nThis guy gets in there and see if they have their way you can imagine that the sweatshop Thirteen year old girls are

moment\nOf all by all means trip actually turn it on whales yeah there you go\nOn a regular phone\nOkay um yeah I I wanted to know you can answer a question for me that's been kind of bugging me for the last couple of weeks um I was reading an article about a high school student that would ban it from school because she gave a classmate might all\nUh I don't think it was mine all but it was an aspirin yes\nI'm not just kind of um you know kind of throw at me and it didn't why in the devil did they tend to forget given enough\nWell they're rule was a no student will give any other students any drug over the counter or otherwise that was the rule\nOh okay I just did it affect you train at all [noise] yes\nYeah because I thought I read something that occurred to another student in a different school that are either Tylenol or an Advil or something like that and exactly\nThat that did that too they oh well I think they found it in a locker ... and I thought well I can imagine you know doing it if they found pot or heroin or something like that and there but um\nI Know aspirin seems radical yeah I'm On the other hand uh there there's a reason for the rules thank you for the call [noise]\nUm it it does sound a little rough but suppose the other students had had some sort of allergy to that medicine then there would have been a real problem there would have been a real problem and I suppose that's why they have the rule\nOr a little bit strict yes but probably proper and they wanted the school nurse to dispense any medicine west of the Rockies you're on the air hockey\nOh about yes that until at Albuquerque New Mexico border on fine\nGood I can do a couple of factors off and on the past month or two I don't know if you have done a better at any rate

you know I I what worries me is even if they've got it right and they've come up with a virus that will kill caps how can they be sure they're going to keep it in Australia\nYeah that's another concern who could very easily I Would think it can be a [noise] a liquid too I'm On it because we thank you very much for show\nAnd all of this stuff is getting very very scary to put together what thing says a trickle but the ... which I caught the first hour it's frightening frightening stuff\nWell it is in the sense that so many people from so many disciplines are all saying the same thing yeah any one of them you could probably ignore a chicken together a I think you ignore at your own peril\nTrue ... maybe next time you have a guess of that ilk on if you can ask them a what we can do for a little hope right now I have a Thirteen week old now and it's a scary you know it'd be interesting to say there any hope for the future at all\nWell look I'm I'll tell you how I deal with it and the way I deal with it is\nOne day at a time and no matter what anybody predicts for the future I Am going to continue living my life and enjoying my life ah as fully as I can for every day that I

I I wondered if you would get a guest on who would be opposed to it and you said you were going to have their priests on friday afternoon to the whole program and never came up the subject of reincarnation\nOh I see well I Would I Would have been obvious so I mean he was a Catholic priest\nA while I Wonder yeah but I think there are pros and cons to the subject and I would like to hear somebody um has the argument against it\nI don't want to excuse me what why don't you go to make some now what do you think okay\nThe people who believe in it they say that we keep reincarnate ing and ... and coming back because they said that the way we learned yes if you remember they always say that they say that how we learn yes and yet on the program friday night\nYou and the priest agreed that\nThat we are a lot I don't know if you remember that but\nMy own and I remember it clearly\nYeah well if if we have three inclined to come back to learn at issue I think we would find our way by now we would not be alive\nAnd well in other words we will become wiser in wiser in ... which is that we're getting dumber and dumber and dumber ... and ... there's another problem with reincarnation and that is that there are constantly more people on the earth in other words yeah more souls\nYeah right so maybe um those who are learning and becoming ones are because of reincarnation if it does exist aren't being in effect outmoded by the ... coming along who don't know a damn thing\nI Do know that I like [laughter] now\nWhen you first came on this radio station when you left the station I remember hearing you say that you intended to have a master's gas and I don't know maybe you changed your mind but I Would like to hear him talk about it\nFor you know I haven't changed my mind at all I had the ruins several times as you know\nOh and then I must I meant I hear you I I seldom Misha program but I I never heard him on your program\nOh mine I'm now\nA boy and then you must not catch 'em all I can say 'cause I'm not really on I Would say over the years probably\nAt least a half dozen times\nI think you've been on this station [noise] well I don't know what station you're listening to the one year on now ah I'm On three hundred stations man I Know I mean oh I'm In Las Vegas\nSo that helps you mean it'd be easy or maybe not since we've been on TV you gee that's right\nWell that's what I mean you know and uh I I Know you had him before that yeah home or would you consider having him of course I think he's very very interesting and ah or him or any any I guess who would give the argument the guest reincarnation\nDo you think he does not believe in it\nI I'm not sure but I think he does not\nAnd what did surprise you if you are found out he did\nA yeah yeah that would I think I heard him out a lot I've ... I've listened to him for Thirty years in a long time ago I heard him say something about that that this would be something that never would want\nBecause people could keep messing up their lives ... each time and they say well I got another chance I'll reincarnate an opt out do about it the next time and they never do it in with an argument I heard him give a long time ago\nI see oh right oh well maybe I'll have them on how about that\nOh I I'm going to make sure I never miss your ... because I won't know ahead of time you announce it\nWill I usually do announce gifts ahead of time I thank you very much are\nYou welcome to share a glad you called and that was Las Vegas I'm indeed used to the Rockies or on the air hello\nMike in Nashville I'm Mike how you doing fine let's not try to get through friday when your headphones Martin on us her identical to you know\nA\nHad a couple of questions I wanted to ask him but I Know this had to be pumping through your mind did you catch all of the ... I mean almost right down to the ... of the things ... you saw in the next three or four years they'd major teams there's already talked about\nStumped me cold man a\nNew to the audience who listens to my show I really didn't even have to say anything I knew all of your attention to\nA guy label I mean it was it was right down to the tea but he said one thing that jumped out at me when I started talking about the anti Christ is yet to come or may already be here right he'll be the one that will present the problems to us and then my show show the solution that's right\nAnd uh that was that was scary but I really enjoy that interview with him I you know he did say he would come back anytime and I'm Glad he said that I Hope you have you back more often\nUm well I Will and and uh the uh the but but but the parallels there with what I I just can't wait to to look at times comes back after he has spent a month or two with putting all those resources into this next three and four\nYear young well it was so obvious uh the things that just went click click click click not just a games but so many of my other guests yeah yeah and then somebody of the uh the church on who I just stopped me cold and I just I was on I don't even need to call attention to this uh they're all getting it\nWill tell you what art I turned fifty years old I was first and I don't know whether this comes with getting older or what but [noise]\nI Know that something has changed in my life just in the last four or five years I think when you get older you get more spiritual ... are you getting more introspective within you know looking into yourself and I've become aware of what a lot of things that are happening around me and around the world\nThat I never have been concerned about before Saturday you know concern myself about him enough to put these things together\nNow I hear you on the one years old and I have I'm beginning to awakened to many of the same things or\nIs it uh it is really an adventure and uh I think that the we might see a wave of lower this but ah if anybody was ever the conduit to bring the science to the attention of people I think you're doing a wonderful job\nIt's a matter of fact about made a special machine [noise] I look I got to run we're at the news here already you take care of my friends premier network\nThat was art bell who's the coast to coast a out on this where entire\nGoes insider is normal ... you can wake up requires knowing them laugh my show is waiting for you with vaudeville as a member you'll have access to our monthly line ... with George ... and special guy because insiders club is a must be true for all goes it goes a um was\nIt was it goes to goes am dot coms who signed up today\nYou view [noise] who's to ... do you still think too that the way things are going up the global elite still want to dominate the planet and that they might succeed\nWell I think they didn't dominate the planning for a long time until Seventeen Seventy six because the founding fathers decided to form a new form of government one that was based on the laws that were eternal certain rights that people have ... the ... ball or the people that have ruled the earth\nTo whom they didn't like that so for two hundred and forty two years\nThey've been trying to get it back as we America has risen to that's the fight that we see going on right now\nDoesn't still feel out of kilter resolve to you there's something wrong\nThere's a grand force that's out there that need not just wants the means to capture the soul of the world but I don't think they're going to when I Do think they're going to win\nSomewhere in time with art bell continues Curtis the premier networks [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nAll right um since I tell you folks everything\nAnd I try to I'm going to tell you something now because there is about to be a change on the air\nUh since before I went on the air this evening my wife has been having a severe asthma attack and it is a particularly severe right now\nSo I'm Sorry a but at this point I'm going to bail out folks and I'm going to go and help her she's having a difficult time breathing so if you're listening up there at the network on my mark a pleased roller tape\nThat's it folks ... [laughter]\n\n\n\nRichard Nixon what I'm saying is that on a morality level than the American people have decided that Bill Clinton is no angel buddies know Richard Nixon he's polling place in between which is correct that's about right and they\nDecided that that although it's not\nMaybe ... or injured Nixon and an angel and there's a lot of territory in their\nExactly and you know Clinton is acceptable on a morality scale and then has he done the job the answer to that yet\nAnd that's you know if Richard Nixon was zero\nOkay and an angel is a gym where would you say Bill Clinton would be\nI Would put I Would put Bill Clinton ... port more toward the uh the uh you know toward the lack of morality it's got to let me let me say this real fast I mean like to read his real fat the best executive and a psychologist or\nWait wait a minute I really want to be better off that Charlie Charlie Charlie I Want to be clear on this is ... is is the closer to Richard Nixon or an ...\nIt's probably closer to Richard makes but let me finish wrote that the best executive\nTend to be sociopath people with sociopathic personalities\nWho actually are actually they tend to be great to mass murder but they but the thing about it that people who are executives had was to some extent the ruthless and be heartless and so if you look at some of our best friends that morality thing they haven't been very good people but they've been very good executive\nAnd that's why I think that actually helped Bill Clinton hurt and it helps him\nWho would you like to be smoking cop\nOh what a

religious anti abortion people we can get some we can get a lot of things done because those people even though I hate to cut\nThose people know know what to do we got some people out with signs who

in a line you know I think Richard Nixon which somewhere in the middle between Bill Murray and the angel [noise]\nBecause you know we had people who went to jail for three years for looking at one or two\nFiles or the Clinton east does\nHave had nine hundred fought count of folks nine hundred file of FBI confidential files of people that they had been looking at and it's not going near the whitewater scan that he was wrong and\nWhy do you think there has not been any similar rockets or even greater considering the number of files are raised\nBecause the media is run by the the liberals batch why\nWell yeah but I mean you don't even see a sound clips of a Republican screeching and Yelping and jumping up and down\nNow if we had a real true conservative like Pat Buchanan who is running

only applies state by state or I once asked I interviewed judge Bork and that's what he said that's what he said he believed\nIt could be the tenth amendment does give us that\nSo I wouldn't be too much of a hurry especially in the present climate\nYeah but for for the last three years the Supreme Court has refused to hear any case on the second amendment\nThat's what I said you may you probably

the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind which is run by yes BCC\nGraham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the months for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and his\nArticle Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease\nUm how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he was almost a hatred of for\nThese people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychics but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these\nFake psychic\nOr talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know richer he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I'd have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time with this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles weren't for this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems than his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit it\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic\n'cause that was all he had the strength for\n'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know if they aren't where they're whatever we the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and and the you know the fake media would be totally surprised they were you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very sick and\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a ball of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it would just I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circle sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet a Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that\nHow did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting it around Nineteen twenties for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how

I was a car accident and his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is a more of the and it becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later you know the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on hum with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian and so there is another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it and I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the ... with all the secret do you think is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on his Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe\nUm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James ... this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on a Canadian TV [noise]\nYes and and he does a little up front research brings it into the sounds as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way\nWas discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the say odds and that's why people say this so this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water for this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is in his exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his a medium abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just that it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once\nA year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits anyway\nI think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years as long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kind of make it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends in and breaks the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through or are there for ... been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that you wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and\nSo I'm now someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that

Mussolini at first it was an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing\nBut you know again I'm history books being what they are that tends to be able to be a little lost um [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed the night\nFor more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham a very interesting stuff so um I was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way [noise]\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're really have anything to do a stone at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England came to losing the right one they were lined up\nOn the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go in late on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill\nSo we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits now all of a sudden\nWe get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them I'm of course to admit previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church so it was the one who got the two\nTogether but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar at the time that style and in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we went from\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um church show like that for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a style one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand we weren't\nGetting things from Russia we didn't know much about the rape purge I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times where they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure communist I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ...\nMillion FDR it seemed a bit from reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we needed style and Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and it's and Stalin had to pack well Hillary violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on their march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march\nAnd then you know it was ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leaving under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was\nSuch a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission\nAnd they were just says well I don't care I Want it will do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little harder to get and he certainly was so when we really had to go begging ... style is table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think in\nA was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have an even at this point they have their eye and sort of carving up the post war world a instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still looks pretty robust\nOr you know he you know by by standards in Nineteen forties he was an older guy by by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\n[noise]\n\nTalk radio six forty WG honesty [noise]\nNBC News radio I'm deem you chew the c._e._o. the Washington Post is slamming the Saudi Arabian
