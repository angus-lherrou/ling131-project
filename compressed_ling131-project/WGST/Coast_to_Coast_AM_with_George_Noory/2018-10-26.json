them\nWell first I look at him for a while and I try to figure out what might resonate with someone like that but I often start with\nI happen to believe at this point that the past and the president and the future all exists and the infinite realm our human senses only perceive a small slice of what exists in the infinite world\nSo I don't view that I'm a good judge of what exists outside of what I can see with my eyes or ears you know the the basic human senses and so I generally try to start with that and I asked someone well how do you know you were seeing everything that is how do you know that\nQuestion no question\nAnd often that stop someone\nBecause you one can take a book with a pattern on it and move it in such a way in front of your eyes that it goes through a blind spot and then you're I technically can't see it but the image is still there\nTo your to your brain\nJohn do you believe in God\nI Believe in a higher power I Believe in a higher wisdom I Believe in a higher form of energy that I find that there's no other explanation for all of\nUs were you angry with a higher power when this happened\nYou know George I'm I wasn't and\nI really have had a hard time getting angry I have found the most comfort and accepting the flow if you will that has come my way\nAnd my hope is and my sense is that this flow has a higher meaning that I don't have all the details for but if I go with it rather than fight it it makes my day is a lot easier\nWhat message would you have for somebody drawn who's going through the same thing you went through\nThe message I Would say would be when it gets really really dark that where you find something that's really really light\nAnd it sounds like you have devoted your lifestyle to this mission of getting the word out about what happened to ... the dangers of some of these medicines and of course what's on the other side don't stop right\nI don't intend to I Am I Am definitely devoted to communicate\nWhat happened to him but at a higher humanistic their George there are a lot of people that have a lot of pain and in pain my message to people is there is a lot of white you just have to look for it\nOr John thanks for getting the best job John's book of course just called in for needle twenty to his Web site infant needle twenty two dot com linked up for you that coast to coast am dot com up next investigative reporter Linda bolting how joined just which stories of strange to\n\n[noise]\nWell one of the few people who really doesn't need a major introduction to mold and our Gore's award winning journalist\nAnd she's been with us since the beginning of this program and a website as replies dot coms tonight she's got a series of very special programs starting with planted acts story Linda the just just fascinates everybody doesn't it\nDoes and eight people becoming more interesting it was nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen I reported her files dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcast then that a new ninth planet or planet X.\nWas indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the art cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shape residue of rock dust in ice left over from our solar system creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto\nTo about fifty astronomical unit from our son and the crowd of mostly ice and us go\nMuch further starting where the type rebelled in and extend for three point to light years from earth\nAnd us fear a co shape that surround our entire solar system including the ...\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at my your files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because to date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena here and now it's back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth\nMoving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nPreventive brown simply calls at planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades and\nIt was twenty three and professor at Brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called era out in the type rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that Pluto should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to adore planted in the ... belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWell when I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote\nIt is like chasing I'd go to whatever is out there it's math\nIs so great that it's gravitational field pushes half a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side\nOf the planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits\nClose quote now that is why so far it is an indirect discovery it's now late twenty eight team after several tries at the tech and Subaru observatories in Hawaii defined planet nine invisible light and or infrared\nProfessor brown says that it is quote tail like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this on the planet to be only seven times more massive than the earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update\nOn his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is\nIt still trying to mind and he told me that he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because\nThey've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculation place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than napkin a good way out there but they had narrowed down the focus\nSo you deliberately going\nOn November first started another search because the new calculations predict that planet nine is close to a constellation\nThat can only be seen by American eyes in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California\nIs astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion\nIs a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most to we have to wait until the solution is up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part do we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected also the upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky once once we find planet and looking at it in the infrared to study it will be very important but it's probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing\nOn this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even see yeah\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look it it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it will be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean\nWhen we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might just have come from why is this massive object all the way out the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud and you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or\nAnywhere inside of our solar system where Neptune and Uranus are but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but until we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with this now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like that too we think it's a ... a tune like planted just a little bit less massive than Neptune and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clouds it's probably too cold have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think it's about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year oh no it's not even close to a quarter light ... it's about two and a half light days\nWell the idea that there could be a massive plan it but when you read like say about the ... through scholar

like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so there's really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what her computer models showing to do is have you worked on the id cc report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to do\nIt could be substantially worse than even those that stuffed up\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included my adding coal now\nTo an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nUnfortunately you've put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe unfair out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which was or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with\nThat shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem with that cater to decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people\nWho are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned both on the east coast around the Alaska duty rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level of forced to migrate as their\nCities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you get you in the such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of Monica is coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises\nSuggesting that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut it has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nSo global climate change and increasing more could definitely bring more wars\nYes there you go\n... well it it's a

YouTube channel audience on September twelfth anyone had young childhood memories of flooding out of body\nThat typically I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone that's before and this is what I was talking\nAbout when the next morning on October fourth or a Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something\nYou were to happen in the video of the a stream the live stream [noise] so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video analyst I worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a come like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was that he thinks this is truly anonymous\nAnd uh then I asked\nA that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office and believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are\nCame between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me emails about their own experiences\nWith the smoky fog is it like act applies them\nI Do not know this is the extremely a translucent and uh\nWhen I started reading the letters I began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never\nMentioned any of this parent to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent and his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City Center for the but what you're going to hear\nTook place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office\nWhen I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard uh talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida ...\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age\nAnd I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn string the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facilities and things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside that leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see and then suddenly I just\nI was getting ready to close my eyes and Fenway open them again and through the window I can see this misty grade ball\nDrifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was in this dark bedroom it was luminous and I could see\nLight within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head\nAnd I was just raising the fascination of I didn't know what to think men as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted hire a glimpse passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was feeling of euphoria and one is with this living thing that was surrounding me and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all being answered at the same time like all of these answers becoming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it\nI didn't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of a high regard is that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of look kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word

at the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download information that was so quick that I was not\nAble to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was just super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any subjects in your mind or your soul about who would be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may because in my
