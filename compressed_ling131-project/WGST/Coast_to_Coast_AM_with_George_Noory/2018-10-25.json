is coordinated or something that is organic but I can tell you this I Want to get to the bottom of the thought when I hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things he he's create an environment so somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities in intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas\nVigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate\nFormer presidents and leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you want unless there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to an end hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you're giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person\nTo say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears\nAs you know a little culpability and is we got to stop demonizing and looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre ... one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who send these packages out ... maybe they'll go to the public if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer\nYou cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep this keeps their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nIn our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWhether it was somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag\nIt'd be somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight\nShut up wait let the intelligence officials do their job then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America you know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the way empires are established and America is an empire and ...\nWe're going to get stepped on what you have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt or go out they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most ... more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody up\nFront um they sure did in ... and ... and when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this at continue and less top this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy the gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you\nKnow stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAre owned by ...\nJoy we will talk this week and see the rest of the story unfolds hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon as described the killing of ... as a heinous crime in his first comments in some of his closest aides were implicated in the Saudi journalist death\nSpeaking edited investors conference in Riyadh that has been overshadowed by this crisis been Solomon said that those responsible for the killing would be brought to justice\nFacebook could collapse of it keeps being dogged by scandals or

seemingly endless controversy over misinformation privacy and fake news\nListen to this new development and fiber optics could make Internet speeds up to a hundred times faster by detecting light that has been twisted into a spiral\nThe research published in the journal nature communications can be used to easily upgrade existing networks and significantly boost efficiency let's check in with our expert Warren Weinstein on the Internet boy this would be amazing born\nBefore I comment on that I like to make a typical comment on of the of the day um I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this thing track down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time of being very very high\nUh Korea I mean these are all unexploded devices that mean oh kind of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the U.S at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the empire you if you network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the sorting\nOut and got pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office camera\nAt the post offices I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days or certainly in a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this some of these questions are are going to start to be profitable\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left or optic story really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it's more involving a ... of the communications rather than individual I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet\nIs are we going to be able to afford it already ISPs going to raise the bad with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes [noise]\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs hip tend to put the high speed a new advanced system in the uh high rent urban areas they haven't shown a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas

spirits I mean are they pulling your covers [laughter] you know when you wake up in the morning and what how how serious are these\n... it's ... it's like I'm a wake up in the middle of the night and you're ... you're talking and then when I go like into the causes no one's there\nOkay so you probably have what what is known as a a called an earth bounce spirit so it can be someone\nSounds like a mischievous spirit [laughter]\nSo it's probably not like a dam and it's probably just that maybe someone who lived there before and they passed on but they haven't really passed\nOn to use it possible would curse or that you cannot get rid of the shirt and spirit but uh just lingers for ever\nWell it depends I think all spirits you can get rid of them because you can appease them as well so what happens in that case and that's a very good question George I'm Glad you asked it and there are some black magicians who will send an earth\nBoundaries wanted me ... [laughter] very well written on edition or a girl that I Know I'm\nSorry I didn't clarify so in addition and it can actually send you an earth bound spirit and what they do is they will go and um [noise] look for spirits at the cemetery\nWho have an crossed over and they will make the calls to spirits who are very disgruntled you know they either killed someone or they raped someone or and then they're willing to do their bidding and so they can send a spirit to you and if that happens actually quite frequently\nAre they under the control of Lucia her shaking\n[noise] the dark lord\nI absolutely I definitely have dark lord exists\nBecause when you should somebody's sons though that's who I think is sending them\nWell it depends because the always the the evil magicians are

with our executive producer Lisa lion on our senior producer Tom Dan Hi sir we kicked around the idea of\nDoing a show once in a while that was a little different so we can have some fun with him we came up with the idea of who's behind the secret doors senior producer Tom ... or has been picking some guess how do you select who I'm going to try to guess who they might be tonight Tom\nUh I picked people that the audience will know in that you will know because the whole idea of\nThe show is to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they try to trick you aren't really creative fire remember when the late Roger leader came on and uh I could not get him at all he had you and I think in honey and\nWas glued to the end he won't even was very good too so I'm looking forward to this we've got three guests will take phone calls with everybody up to half on each one uh in the snow will go by really quick in one more

open up the first secret door\nI tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on and then let's see who you are hello there\nAnd to me how you doing\nOh boy this is gonna be tough I'm fine how are you\nKnow not in my ... month\nOh I Know I got older things get tough for\nAids didn't want to eat in a mortgage stance in Friedman\nBoy am I allowed I guess [laughter]\nI I

and yes you are an ID we need\nWe need you on this program my friend look I heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring or I Am a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and these um January November and December\nI Can't believe it two months without going anywhere a fence my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you we love your stand that I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan\nMy very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw a little clip being in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder out I went to interview stance and Friedman had a great interview and I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast\nStance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you an alien fest the end of January up near the big bear and I think\nSo at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo they just stand telling me telling me what's going on in the field of view ... these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about you ... talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research [noise] well\nI think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a

you for already endorsing the book\nYes uh it it's something that is a little different for me because I'm used to writing about my own experiences in covering broader spectrum and writing about some other folks\nAre absolutely and and build this ... this officer of course has no reason to lie has nothing to gain these are the kinds of credible witness is you have to have Harter\nTotally agree and I didn't know about this matter was Mike from Mike super who it off\nFormer police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer God's one and went actually

about this\nIn a lot of these cases there seems to only be one\nFoot print there's never really very rare that you you know here about a lengthy trail of of these types of friends and I've thought about that and I thought okay\nIf if it's not a hoax then perhaps\nThis creature may take one step before it becomes invisible as crazy as that may sound but they're sure seems to be a pattern here of

R. and now I see I'm a ... yeah I'm thinking that writer and they said it ... has been called Jeffrey ... was never called Jesse\n... and it's a shame some matrix cracking that it's not just for the Mandela rag anymore\nWhat do you think of that bill\nWell I mean she's writing what she's saying but again I think there's intent behind this whole and I think that it is evil intent because\nUh when you are making such changes to some of the scriptures in the way that they've been altered and changed I mean it is it is absolute mockery of God and Jesus as well\nAnd and just foul I mean here's one for you that I just discovered recently this was full of being one birth date\nFor God is my record how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ in the vowels of\nI never heard of that it used to say I miss\nAll of you with your faction of Jesus Christ that now it says how great the I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus\nChrist that so yeah it's unbelievable to grow his now Hulu mock it is rod his truck driving in Oklahoma City they ride go ahead\nI got a great topic a juggling stories once again not Jane Ninety One July twenty third Nelson Mandela God our ... our dopamine\nGood jazz and asked about it and then he got kicked out large Jane other one\nIn the ads I again on the JFK's assassination that was the one the car by John Connelly was never in that bar there was never six people in there\nThat strange I'm trying to remember bill a there was John Kennedy and Jackie in the back seat there was a secret service agent in the driver's seat and then other in the past and there was another in the past it was only four I remember right\nWell no I I remember governor calmly and his wife ... cars well because supposedly governor apparently was head off with one of those bullets well\nNo you're right the governor's convoy was in front of him because he ... he had one of the bullets\nMagic bullet\nBut we're was a were was his wife\nTo laugh so Conley with the front of Kennedy\nAnd his wife was to his left\n... but the the car was a front seat back seat right or was there a third seat their third narrow\nThird seat there and I can't remember if the if the seat was um [noise] with Connelly and his wife faith\nWill use well you know them well you said you know I think con Connelly if I remember the artistic sketches of the shooting were they track the bullet ... Conley was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got he but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president or the way I like to run generally I think he was in the front\nAt so the so a governor currently and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they were in another so it would have been a row of sitting there and and the driver\nEarly or the other Secret Service agent who was on the passenger side so you would have had six people\nAnd that would have been six strange route and Tom is looking at it and what do you do to ... to can you turn Tom's might come for just one second Denny to put your speaker downtime and tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up to the ... film and I'm watching them come over and what you're describing unity back with his wife right and I'm hoping you can hear me 'cause I'm I'm looking at the film are now I hear you [noise] and uh and then a congressman front there I don't see a third row of seats\nI I didn't I don't remember seeing the third row either belt thanks to all\nThe ... thing and and again I'm that's why I always thought that it was too Secret Service agents at the front seat\nAnd then a second row with Governor currently and his wife and his wife was two years left and the president at Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nThe trend I mean I definitely do the secret service agent was in the front driving because everybody accused him of turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut I you know again now think about this and I I studied that as well because William Cooper is one that was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had to have been left handed if that's the case and also [noise]\nHe's driving so that means they'd have to take his eyes off the road to\nTurn and then make the perfect shot you know with his left hand and everybody wants to see that yeah so I you know I go by that\nOne everywhere Bill thanks for uh being behind the secret door you've given us a whole lot to think about when the new book comes up get back on the program for a full show up next one more gas behind the secret doors\nTo find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to go to ... am done\n[noise] ... present capital what happened on December fourteen and a former ...\nMarshmallow I like to go on the wrong

you have you read Karen\nI have been doing great George how about you are great on the gather we just did not live\n... not for people who need to know who you are curing doormen is the weed you board person is that fair to say\nI think that's fair to say yeah we we just bought a lot of tools I like to use and as you know I'm now director of the talking board Historical Society\n... so we diversify and all things talking boards fair or the ... board\nMarlon I'm more ... believes the you're the greatest we'd you board personnel to her\nWell she's very kind let's say it that way she's very ...\nKnow Geron dome and maybe one of the only people we know who loves the ... as you know I'm opposed to it I don't want to use it or cheering feels very secure with it I guess one could say Karen it has to do with who the user right\nYour dad has to do with\nThe use your your intention that has to do with the reason why are you the number one and also what people forget it has to do with your own perceptions beliefs and what you think about and how you view yourself with in the world I mean if you have a lot of fears that you're going to draw to you but when you're you have common sense about yourself and uses tool for the place of love\nA from a place of light from a place of wanting to explore to discover then the whole the whole atmosphere around the school changes\nSome people believe that the ... opens up a portal to allow these evil spirits and introduced to come through what your thoughts on that\nSure ... and this goes back to what you believe or your perceptions of the world and Sullivan will believe and that they're earning power that they are just the pond to their world\nAnd what my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strength then and that is found by remembering recalling who they are the divine bean and that they are an extension of source incarnate when you come from a place of that kind of ... and beyond\nThat kind of belief system those kinds of intentions then you get what you desire you get you get a whole different\nWay of communicating in communion with the unseen dimensions I mean the work that I Do with this tool is no different than somebody who channels or works with a K. two meter and paranormal investigations or read stroke cars are using ... arrives to name a few it's really similar principle you have your intention set\nYou use it only as a tool you have ... there's no hidden spirits in view or power inside of these chunk of wood or of cardboard or glass or whatever they're made out of its within yourself the board is strictly a permission to allow yourself to access your own internal abilities to work in Israel\nHave you ever had a bad ...\n[noise] no I haven't had bad the worst I've ever had with somebody cussing that and he wants more and this is many years ago this back in Nineteen\nEighty streamed through the board they were costing\nThe board but let me tell you this George I people write to me and asked this question all the time you don't continue to engage\nIf somebody in life if I'm if I'm standing in line you know maybe get a check out the grocery store and somebody gets really rude I'm going to not engage with that person I'm going to move away walk away or not engaged 'cause they don't you just make it worse and so the same thing with this tool you don't engage and\nAll I did was say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored you might have board on\nOur dog had going good and going and that's it and it works that way now works that way because of my own beliefs\nAbout where this energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything's negative and I'm fearful\nOf everything that's one of the draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had the empowerment with me that I could really a strict in myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it than just wonderful beautiful experiences\nWho's moving the clincher urine is at the individual ... spirit behind it who's moving well let me answer that\nFrom a few different directions one as many people believe is India motor effect which really basically means your mind is controlling the movement and so the subtle movements of your muscles are the power suggestion is making the plan shit move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism or mid ... that's occurring through your body and these are some old thoughts they would go way back to\nThe Eighteen hundreds that's one thought about it to a third one is a is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plant shut the moving spell out messages\nTo Beijing worked with an inch and really absolutely\nAmazing and I will say this uh the group of beans I mean working with and I've talked to him before I talked about um before on your show and work with with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say\nWhen you come to the plant chat you set your intentions and whether you with a partner or by yourself I prefer to work with a partner I just get better results that way\nOur energy combines together reaches up to a level of vibrations like Tunisia frequency to get the vibration I Want to connect with and they lower there is to reach our frequency so we can connect in the middle somewhere and that energy is what allows messages the flow the plant you have to move and for for all the communications to happen\nWe're going to take your phone calls at the half worth ... your questions and maybe your review board stories if you want to share them with us a I've never I've never known you though cure and to put somebody down if they don't like to read you board that I appreciate it\nWell I you know that that's the way I mean that's what life is I mean we have one of your earlier guest was talking about the divisiveness\nAnd this tool creates a lot of controversy which can create divisiveness Roche and I'm not for that I'm for having discussion about it I'm for people having different opinions\nThis tool is not for everybody I'm an even doing this work is not for everybody whether you use a tool this kind of for a different one so I think it's great to become together have a discussion we all different points of view and not that one's rider one's wrong with that we can exist now now I Will say this George\nIn the group that talking board Historical Society there is a great diversity among stuff we found is believe it doesn't work\nSome of some of his leaves it works because if you didn't motor and a few of us might believe it works because we're actually connect with an energy outside of herself\nBut we can all exist together have love for this board for the history of the board and share that and the public with people and it doesn't matter if we believe on the opposite ends of the spectrum so we weren't at war group that actually shows that you can get along have different opinions without condemning each other\nOn the board start in in ... how long ago\nWell there's there's there's a what Gene Gene Orlando it has turned ... he owns the museum of talking boards dot com check it out um he turns it we just dishes because people say the board started back in ancient China and Greece\nThat is not true there is a different detonation tool that started back then\nThe first board that we have a we have an understanding that because we have history of it we have documents that talk about it is a board it's Eighteen eighty six known as the which board now we know this board existed and it was made by a company called the ws read toy company\nAnd George the cool thing about this is it's really interesting history\nThe people who manufacture this board\nSent a letter along with the board to president Grover Cleveland force for for his wedding gift\nAnd illness I Know and we know that\nBecause they took the opportunity to send that vaccine let her over to the Boston Globe who got published I mean there are doctors the PR yeah now what do you think president Cleveland did\nWell I Would guess she kept the board [laughter]\nTo renovations breach
