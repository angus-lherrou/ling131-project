talking about the inventory still in the dreams della right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward\nThe pay for that my new published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show\nLike on my news website over and coast to coast am on the street there there are elusive papers on the right inside\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town now with your analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical but the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation\nWhich is is some of the layers have a different thickness in stone that take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a ... view you start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and\nA review or a who was it was very well known a sharp drop your who don't we reviewed my paper or he calls the waves um and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by Clinton as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these are you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but\nEvery once in a while there is a jump so you have a much thicker corps\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another son jumps in to take this and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\n... rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for interpret it what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ten a originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have to\nHave to immediately say there are some researchers who said the pyramid was not completed that was that they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know one of the the most prominent researchers proposed this is Robert ... father John Paul will go out\nThe paper it's on I think it's on a Robert Duvall a academia a page and it's also in cosmic womb ah his brother vote to apparently sees in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people that think the pyramid was not coming to a peek\nA and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the uh repeating of the ticker layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps is it every twelve is there some kind of ...\nNo I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck me when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you were you just you know simple in mind that I thought each that they were just a applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed to appear minutes with something called they called they set that which is the pyramid and go\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how the conceptual eyes a pyramid angle so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd cheer question again there's little regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is bad with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen veteran decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides\nYeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension that\nWhich which Jimmy I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... um shot a sharp tooth and effect create published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't al ... and the big tipper it was a star Marek so it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and\nBecause of that because that constellation big tipper was so important to Egypt shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big the upper and we try to pair of it ended up in that in the north south uh orientation to\nAgain to jump in right there the coast to coast and we're going to take a break my new is ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] get Daily

published last week\nAnd again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference to my news website it is a Chiapas pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am and go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one\nNow my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you strike three hundred ... a a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there of the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way\nAnd the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty four\nOf these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing moment you're right I'm I'm I'm this thing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a war specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have sort of a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty fifth\nI'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses\nThat are associated with these route fractious tend to run a over feelings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that is around ... a number of facts of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid what we don't know of any spaces\nAnd war but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that\nThere must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that are exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away\nYet you need to have if you are going to a proposed these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there is supposed to be nothing right\nBut then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... that the which has a surface\nThat is around fraction of twenty fifth of Nineteen twenty fifth that alliance with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the heat\nOr so in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course on the twenty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the feeling of the queen chamber\nUh then the other courses don't don't have round ... twenty fifth and they're not associated with the wings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and there'll be have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground and power\nUm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers in fact the tower\nUm and and then the final point I Want to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the hope that the boys\nI got it yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly but we just it's kind of a a the image so I just kind of like you know paint that that into this illustrations just to give up off guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion and the use of the lion and go back to ... taffy\nAnd everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nBut the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates and weak constantly land a ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course\nUh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the uh cataclysmic events the end of the ice age the construction of go Beckley tabby\nThe erosion on this thing's all of these\nBeings Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go Beckley tabby not an accident you know with this references of course wouldn't lines to was low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely it's a fantastic question and I don't

Mesopotamia with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly like Charles so it was ...\nUm so what you saw what it meant while in the south you're here is what it meant and

Thomas Manu\nJeremy thank you for taking my call Manu ... search you know my question as we have decent plot town and the pyramids the banks have there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original boring a decent plot town and I know that sounds radical\nBut for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that you could\nIn architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties a remote viewing him to an intuition and actually rink construct temples repair the temples have less been discussed\nYes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the\nMinister of antiquities is trying to partially restored monuments so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern reconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do affection\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched so that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard uh it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter I'm a new area and um\nThey are basically recreating gives a a a ... in the in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to\nUh descend into a virtual world and we exactly like the way it looked or the way we think look and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and I they're working on\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with a number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses\nThat conform to this uh you know the the simple rule that the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth\nI think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to school out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the\nUh so he'll watch a burden many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids in for research and just general public access\nAnd I heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned waters access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreen question Daniel my new what's it like there now with you\nRegarding Dr hot so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than you'd probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are on and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so on the one and it sounds like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that they uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they want research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is if I was I was was still the director there\nHe I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that\nReviews the data so he is involved a half these not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he is involved they asking for is at by a is input um you know I think there's sort of a mixed bag you know there is the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV\nAnd given up spends and then there's the scientists the archaeologist who loved what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of fought it all out but I think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments that allowing people to research done and I to be honest with you I understand it you know some of the project\nField though

think oh well let me let me jump in I guess what you're asking my new is ah the origin of the word pharaoh and where did it come from from a which which people\n... to ... to ... ... ... ... worth of the middle of the pro which it ... the push language\n... Kush which which is of course ... ... to ... years ago yeah ... ... as the you know we're talking about a quiet of the way it does for ... years ago\n... older than any other language you can put a little bowl opponent show ... which was of people who is this big law it's a cush people still you know which ... which are from the coach\nWhich do you think like who does it should be a little late it was people well the pilot or\nThey ... they will know height or some oil\nI'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call a minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't quite some thanks for it but I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so so he chipped colleges are saying that are in the old kingdom\nA that term was not use\nSo the term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the king of the old king them I think the first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appeared\nAnd that's all I Know about it offhand I ... I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here a bummer when we're going back to\nA man as a um and in the first and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings yeah right\nRight like in armor and men is uh the first uh kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same\nAh ... may be the same or they could be two different kings they weren't called pharaohs back then\nRight and now there's another ah\nAh I have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and the the ... that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\n[noise] [noise] yeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh by the fifth dynasty the king have five different title\nUm and then the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse came so it was horse law armor and hors ...\nSo uh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after I came you know the designation a net soon that which is basically referring to operate in Egypt\nAnd then came the two ladies there and ah you know and then came to cartoonish have later um but uh the as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up if I was like four or five ... he is the first time I was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies us go to Jay out here in Los Angeles in jail you're up next on coast [noise]\nHello hello J. lo J.\nYou guys doing I don't know how high is there a first time caller long time long time listener\nUm I Am actually um Egypt sharing dissent on mom's side [noise] and um growing up as a kid I Would always hear\nMy grandmother to say that leads they tell me a lot of stories that there was always passages from here there there's always secrets to the um the great pyramid has secrets to theirs to tunnels here oh there you know there's always stories that Graham you know grandkids hear their grandparents say\nThe one that always stuck with me that I really wanted to get clarification on I've seen stuff like on line but\nI Try to take it with a grain of salt um I really am glad that you're on the show a ...

coast to coast am on this beautiful Sunday Now Monday morning here in Southern California my new or the phones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to\nUh numerically that is not not in writing but in in the language of mathematics um and it's not complicated math it's actually some of the features that Jimmy and I have talked about and some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know and you don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website\nGo check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino and do you notice is are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as Egypt genes\nTraits meaning\nThat's just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that do you knows referencing near one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely they suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nA has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of their trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWe'll let me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramid in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures\nThroughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is\nWhat do not not the top top but could there be a chamber or something at the at the upper levels\nYou as well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space uh that I'm connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off of our propose that the summit of the great pyramid was not a peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know it's fear and it's interesting that the diameter of the fear is a meter\nUh it's it's a very interesting a very interesting theory or and others have proposed similar things there's even if you're with I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great pyramid so not if you're a media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it um\nNow you've got to anomalies and a and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI acting so how big would it be the way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that height um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by ... Hi I'm saying right you know\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph gumption bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not all be stocked up I'm a one way you could do it to me is by putting the plays into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that uh who don't and buyer investigated it's up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the northeast corner right at\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up to a place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers they've made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know now it's just you know you're just to repeat studies\nUm but I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or the project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and hope that things that's the kind of money that will need for a project like that\nThis is coast to coast am I going to be church it's been an all Egypt the great pyramid evening year going into Monday morning more with my news said Sunday after this short break so stay with us [noise]\nBoom boom\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] Mm\n\nAn important message for Medicare\nOh dear I was just talking with Pamela\nAnd can yes Medicare also cameras recommended cancer and preventive screenings houses next in these early when it's most reasonable chance\nIf you're in the doughnut hole\nFifty percent discount on brand name prescription drugs you can get the prescriptions you need to stay healthy\nActually I was the one who told Pamela all about Medicare preventive benefits [noise]\nUh-huh [laughter]\nTell your friends and family with Medicare learned more Medicare dot Gov or call one eight hundred Medicare because when you share the new health\nI'm Jason plump founding board member of the Innocence Project and my new podcast as wrongful conviction available and heart radio on wrongful conviction I interviewed a\n\nRadio on land Warner fears is filing for bankruptcy the century old company that once dominated retailing America is filing for chapter eleven protection\nText path to seven nine six four or five that's P.
