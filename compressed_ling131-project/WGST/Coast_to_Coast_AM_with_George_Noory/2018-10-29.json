was sort of humanoid with this huge wings but it was kind of ... as well [noise] scares me\nAnd had the shining a yellow eyes but they sort of a ... or all the hair angle combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not always don't sasquatch 'cause he's got wings but he kind of looks like\n... ... and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend and you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black stories you and I'm Talking about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I'm going to be honest with you in Georgia I'm doing five books now on on these phenomena foreign the men in black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking ... you know\nGo on and the skin is why why why\nI'm I'm people talk about how they seem to have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them pay for even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that by full and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right off to pay for using wage of bullets which puts another angle to its um but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like\nIt's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a golf a horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe the ... the men in black ministry it's fall be on you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd you know\nI'm asking it into context ... with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the use animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... nations you know you go they really we won the next couple of events which are a sea of apps to explain\nThere is a power with demanding black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for their might be but I think it's a very small cats agree but says they the January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think this happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually have employed the legends of the men in black as a means to cover their tracks in other words the may be paid for with the government to know that many black all too real but I don't know what they are but he doesn't prevent them\nFrom using the ... the most have\nAs a means to to threaten and quiet people who [noise] who they may not want to have them talking about cases so the government may actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't think they do fully\nThat sort of leads us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk

paranoia ... about something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean someone doesn't really following you around it's sort of the the the inspiration for this new book or yours top secret alien abduction piles\nYou talk about the world in which we live where mass surveillance is sort of a given now right\n[noise] yeah and of course you know subsequent generation growing worldwide I've never known any different you know I'm writing a\nPaper last night you know before the Internet age will remember that was not a sort of worldwide surveillance that we have now and\nYou know I think that's what I mean I'm fortunate things for future generations it's gonna be chopping normal thing for them and probably accept it as well\nOr you know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea\nThe fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip\nStuck under our skin and then they can follow us and they'd all be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and all kinds of ways but in fact they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government that the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things so that's the word alien abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what ... alien abductions are all about that that idea which seemed preposterous are too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\n[noise] yes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually facial publication guy to first of November I can already got it\nBut I'm the reason I wrote about sacred I mean abduction fall just because over the years I collect a number of official documents on abductions which are painted classified\nTrying to fame Information Act in the u._k. um do you actually find me I was in a position where I could actually sort of put the book together you know provide the raid yes actually another book and I shouldn't but instead of going just overall\nAnd you know wind up present paper with the guy just showing how falls would be put together now I'll start the book actually with the contract a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded they abduction phenomena by just about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak but um\nGovernment agencies do ah put together falls on paper who claimed to have had I Lived in Kansas for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... castle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on them one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and see Israel eons but they told the FBI that they the Iranians had\nA governmental governments very different two hours and bordering on\nCommunism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example Joe trends hassles FBI file\nUm he's extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia Tom's gaze is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm over ... she was about fourteen and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact the papal now in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September of sixty one I'm with the bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess is the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case on record but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn ... wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey now in the story of basketball and hail they're coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky and then things kind of get waited a they don't fail writes\nThe you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd they get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board\nThe strange craft would they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the car when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they ... they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon where they knew follow gee what's intriguing\nIs that they they uh British police force actually handed over the

this is a direct quote but he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction little in today's world

something about ...\nIt's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together but has the potential

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're gonna catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] give me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it from you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experiences unusual states of consciousness\nReligious experiences peak experiences\nWhat whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of the privilege to be could be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this from ... in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it would be sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are you now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents isn't and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture\nYou mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of summoning a around the western world but interest and spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase\nThat that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess would be called spiritual beliefs they are pretty high numbers in America\nI'm believing and goes to believe in spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation and traditional really with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about that how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust sense of belief and\nOther world um and spirituality and the ... are really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so after that tried to think about and try to think well where where people get in that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm ... I'm kind of like a science nerd and and the fence and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi for thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and brace with ... with a sense of a mystery and and the longer\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the the bed for for a new spiritual infection and I and that's and that's what I Try to look out of the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time relating normally Georgia through\nThat [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you've sort of reached out look kind of look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time ... as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm I it it's it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um that that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about [noise] uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say a word about that for\nSome for the listeners tonight yes you know I'm going\nTo another demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimensions breeds spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um since Einstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world an Einstein I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talked about an additional spatial dimension [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw the line on a piece of paper or a line as one dimensional object that has length\nIf you then draw last where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and wet\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and height and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else and the the phone thing else as the tricky part something else is the\nIs the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see or um or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others some philosophers on in the\nBack to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um they find that they buy incorporating an extra spatial dimensions a fourth visual dimension that the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations look clean or they've seen simpler and more elegant um\nUm and so on so and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nEven\nWould change\nThat\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nRadio on Ryan's hears the party is on in Boston after the red Sox won the world series they scored a five to one went over

perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you'd tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah he his wife is is quite a story um but you're right there there's ... there's many others in the book Cruz sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious and scientific time and feeling that they can no longer or an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality a hint hint hint of an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes to Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he he makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right and the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a\nThe dreaming consciousness has a kind of a freedom\nThat uh that our our regular everyday consciousness doesn't have any and he uses a lot of scientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and\nSee see I'm into the future and you write these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know sometimes give talks about this and different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happened or didn't happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back and this one sided audio big ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of those experiences as well so in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit and the chapter on C.

Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made of that of that book but she talks about time slip some and and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nWell for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really counter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time is just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of\nFlowing we have this kind of intuitive sense the harm flows forward um in fact though you know I find that a number of counter to do things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experienced pine is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of her own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called up a block universe\nUniverse that already exist so um you know all locations in the universe and all the times in the universe\nI'm already exist and are all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] I've been through that that block right are we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and then our son future [noise]\nAnd and all of our defending future's all those moments already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually a discussion Scott depending wants to look at it just got to my book but you can also look at Brian Greene book he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that's the kind of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it it lays out these big philosophical issue right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how we are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow\nLift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say four dimensional world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nThe dreaming felt he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment and Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed to happen in some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as a as additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and have you thought everybody\nEverybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he also believe that everyone if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and they follow you had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and after that I'm sort of mixed up together well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about science is a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away takes us into the break [noise]\nNo you can get show updates and connect with other coast fans would you joined the ...
