colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing\nThat us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly uh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the ion air for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are respected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I in a treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that we've tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria are of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of the twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps\nWe aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern to solve it you know that is cutting back dramatically a nuclear weapons are and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threat posed by the Soviet from the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began his largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology um that is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the s four hundred a surface to air missile system\nAnd the stock a chain exercises you indicate you know I have three hundred thousand a soldier's thirty six thousand a armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the\nCoast of Russia straight at the United states now practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated\nSome might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their their passions\nFor free for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who we would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania that'd be entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nUh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese prime leaders have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers just met you know for taking time over the

capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this has caught our attention that's why you\nKnow the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as a true competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just\nThe military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world and you're monopoly on the distribution of a dissemination of information or appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population\nAnd of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things around uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of uh\nSuccess of at a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nLeverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I ... to the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder ... with the possibility\nOf ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these friends sharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states uh to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course they could show the um the brutal slaying of of a cause Shelby\nUm and how that might mean there is there a dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering what ... what are your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his to Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary ... is tragic\nYeah but if you've been watching my mom had been psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nAnd the so called ... and the the

we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course they could go to the Chinese or Russian but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA day and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with an of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime um there were

depth radio news talked ten ten lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis stays with is the book is a lines of evil Russia China the United states\nAnd a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived there had been\nA oh obviously some older patients with the Russians are particularly um uh well I wouldn't call them Russian regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered were had heated battles with them\nA there have been some near collisions and the south China Sea was Chinese vessels how do you see this\nOr what is the the danger of this breaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh the end and then time scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations are on they're up to current Richard and we had one here recently\nWith the U.S are done Decatur\nOr destroyed or are in the grieving reefs in the south China Sea um the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it\nAnd just in the last day we've had a couple of bi fifty to shutter flew over um you know the contested area in the south China Sea ... to understand that these islands uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missile\nListen here to fence weapons and you know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from that these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well\nAs the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is that indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west I'm terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case though the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we call them and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians white their hands of that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any in time scenario uh it it is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the big dog mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the leaf and to establish a Calif out and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you know\nThe release of the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a aired on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago and of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so these are issues Syria is\nYou know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there is some friction there that they are working together and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together you see the Iranians\nAre certainly the Turks are sort of our lives\nAnd the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here I confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nEven care to one and and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to

we've had a a colored history in that regard uh where we've done things certainly the U.S has not proud of but every nation has involved been involved and covert activities\nThat the things that I Know I don't talk about 'em and you know but you know we we need national leaders that clearly understand the the sobering reality of\nThe powers that they exercise and they need to do it uh with the eyes wide open now with our national interest it's involved and and do it in a way as humanely as possible um you know arguably you know what we did in the in the wake of nine eleven\nAnd which you know a allegedly a I'll use these words\nThat we took captive certain individuals uh that were threatening the United states and of course we've incarcerated some\nIn Guantanamo been there a and

are\nThe ... district with weapons\nAround the world around it'd be the world's policeman and you know use the bathroom door what are you sure who am I my question is um\nWhy do we call all these other currently evil Ronald Reagan feared the evil empire rub your your W.

not do one you're going to give people year we're still lives there in that he did the work you're wrong or\nYou know well I certainly had a question there Richard ... it is it is perspective um you know I think that the the history of the Russian a Soviet Union certainly\nAnd where they killed millions a hundred mile in China where they kill millions\nA and their foreign policy where they provoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support\nAh yeah we do sell weapons are defense security cooperation agency has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nWe we have made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like uh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is\nA we don't have any friends we just have interest and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself and to prosper\nUm sometimes are in the eyes of the beholder it is is evil or certainly in my perspective on I've you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I looked at their history and I look for the one today and it's certainly not what my country wants\nAnd I do believe a United States\nIs not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization\nYou look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world they don't have rule of law it in the wild west and there are no protections afforded to the individual you can be literally swept up the street in the middle of the night and executed\nUh for for no reason in most places in the world\nAre and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in was\nIn a western China today and that's a un report on somebody can look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that in the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong and we've acknowledge that\nWe do bad things but the rest of the world you know I have\nI've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places a and yet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to the United states where we enjoy the rule\nOf law we aren't afraid is Richard points out of being arrested pulled out of bed and shot and they had a more families being carted away and yet unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nThe likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so they're all\nGotta jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with an alliance and evil\nThe heavenly voice supposedly said don't worry everything will

C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of\nSecurity Donald Rumsfeld military analyst group and his brand new book is called me and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times\nFinally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly\nUh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the I an app for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty because they have\nA not only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that we've tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria of\nCourse John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps\nWe aren't going to renew it and that should be a really a a shot across the bow of months ago because it it should concern to solve it you know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons are and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally crossed the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets and the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology that is of course being shared a [noise]\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished uh when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union\nA and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania that'd be entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nUh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir putting and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nTalk radio six forty WG as the\nNBC News radio ...
