I'm a strong advocate of getting rid of the department of education what are your state's take care of education the way you're supposed to be Jimmy Carter with the department of education employees and to me it's a waste of fifty some odd billion dollars a year as far as giving credit for somebody going in protesting\nI Would I Would love to see where that actually happened and I would love to follow up on that you know what school it was\nA I forgot the name that many lives all and I forget to watch anyway\nNo way listening Seventy still young you got plenty of time so do you favor or send me an email at ... dot com and if you remember where that school was I'd love to follow up on it\nIf it's a state sponsored taxpayer subsidized school was no way they should be doing something like that the private school they've got different rules would that would be ridiculous to do to give somebody a benefit for protesting on one side of an issue over the other let me go to line three Patricia ... Patricia what's going on\nRight pat how are you I'm living the dream what's happening\nI liked to have to think oh I can get on that movie coming out you know from a few weeks ago I call it they can

common\nThinking they were kitchen but we have here where they'll uh they'll hang hang on every plane and that ... that race they are white made they have gotten away with something much\nDemocrat evil horrible people and in fact by telling them up to the curb\nWhich I appreciate your maturity to board him too but but and and don't hold your breath because none of those people are gonna be apologizing in fact a Dianne Feinstein just friday just yesterday said are you just went down a litany of why Brett Kavanaugh should not be the guy and it had very little to do\n... very little to do with the allegations that she leads to her office leaked about Christine Blasey Ford very little to do with that\nHer complaint was that he showed drew interrupting her interrupting other members are news anger you show that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the court that's being able to do with no he doesn't have the temperament to be on the court oh by the way\nOn the left on that committee interrupted Chuck Grassley the Republicans nonstop I guess they have the temperament to be on the Senate Judiciary committee and to be senators but he doesn't know the temperament to be on the court when he was\nHonestly emotionally reacting to people treating ... family like crap people calling him a gang rapist he had every right to react the way that he did and dying Feinstein as all of this new she knows who she is let me go back to and say how to being in Tampa Dan what's going on high\nHey Joel thanks for taking my call by I bet that's all I just want to make a comment that I Want to get a question or if it by you and all lined up\nOr down vote I think we've had it I think it's been years that we've had a beyond that this\nRule they want to pick your president they want to make the rules people are tired of the math contradictions the convoluted logic the same political incorrect if the pseudo wise retention it's\nAll over there and the tide is turning and thank God for that and I think a great president was the one who started this and put us on the Rush Holt I already am thankful for that you know um and I and I heard\nYour last call and your great for doing what you did diamond in the semi gods and hope as a a princess and Donald Trump junior for your list and they should be taking the mantle from his father he should be running someday cause that\nHe's fired definitely\nOh he's a great man I mean that great family affected hey nothing but crucifixion waiting liberal pay back at what they do to that family grateful just by\nEverything that they do is just absolutely disgraceful and you know what getting them know where you can think of him and for all the power to let them you can roll refrigerator random it doesn't matter he never went you\nHe's going to and they're still doing the right then I don't I don't have much time what's the question\nWhat do you think now we do that house in the mid ... yeah you think that what what would the impeachment process be white and and what what ground we have or if he's going because that's all they talk about\nThe the left will say it's obstruction of justice if they should win the house and be willing to go back to weigh in with their with their big on the bill claims bill claimed that he tried to do call me to not investigate the women to be more bill so that he tried to obstruct justice to stop calling me know you look you and I agree he didn't do that\nBut those are the grounds they'll say obstruction of justice I think they will in fact impeach him and I think the Senate would would uh would find him not guilty so nothing would happen\nBut that's the whole thing and it's a great question because\nThe voters of his country have to realize if you vote for Democrats in November one

the nation was shocked Nightline ran a story\nOr did a show and said just want folks for the last Twenty years the U.S government has had an ongoing program of remote viewing and as best they could in that limited amount of time they tried to describe what remote viewing was the nation kind of went watch\n[laughter] since then we have been pursuing the topic tonight may be uh the biggest program in

south of Charlottesville in Virginia\nAll right and Paul I'm half hour north of DC in town coral\nSo all of you sort of a gathered not far from headquarters such\nRight we sort of had a a homes here because we are of course we're in the project for so long and a as a result we just short of shuttled\nUm let me say something else if you don't mind about that red black yes and the project took over the database a show that there were um\nThere was some work called binary work\nOr where they were doing exactly that and uh it had been of experiment and or the continually highest score in it a was a person named Joe ... methodical uh who even one time scored\nOne hundred percent on ah I'm fifty two courage\nWow that was very very impressed I should someday reached that do do do you say one hundred percent uh there was one instance in the database where he got one hundred percent correct so it can be done\nOne of the this is Joe I I'd like to say something about the accuracy of\nI've been working for over Thirteen Years with a cognitive science is way up in California that that's the original founders of the original researcher mode during uh [noise] uh we we've collected statistics on on dozens of remote yours or what I Would call a world class from yours are generally speaking uh\nAn average a very good remote viewer can be expected to make contact with the target site about sixty sixty five percent of the time\nAnd out of the information they provide a the the hackers who the information will run anywhere from thirty five to eighty eight percent no there there are times when the good remote viewer will get a hundred percent or near a hundred percent quality remote viewing but those are extremely rare\nAnd when someone establishes they're they're sort of history over a long period of time say turn to a Nineteen years\nAh that that's the kind that percentage as you can expect\nOne of those percentages increased with a team\nNo I'm from a research standpoint uh everything that we have in the database that we've looked at it the kind of science lab\nOr the Google factor goes up when someone starts talking about inside gigs sure and nobody even has a political career wants to be caught dead standing next to any of those like it's\nAll in fact we had tremendous support from the Senate on down in a in some very important positions in government and when those people were asked to respond in particular to the Nightline program\nOr without exception all of them responded positively good refused to go on the air or state that publicly [noise]\nAll right I'm not surprised um you all three of you have now turned to civil civilian application for a remote viewing um\nAre there are there other ethical and moral limits or if I Walk into one of your organization's with a whole ... bundle of money and I say look I Want to know what it means to be she is going to produce into following area what they're doing will you do that for me\nUh this is Lynn I I'm a very definite moral and ethical limitations there are certain things I Will not teach a and basically during the span of course just a learning the basics\nThere is so much to learn that uh you don't really have time to learn all those esoteric things anyway are\nNow asking me Lynn ... wait a there are certain things you won't teach\nOh I Do not oh even address the subject of remote influencing and won't um\nOh all three of you I take it agree remote influencing which means uh by the way folks the ability at a distance or to influence what somebody else actually does not just read their mind but influenced their mind that it is possible\nOr remember it's not remote control it's remote influence understand right or\nThe um voted one oh I Want to ah make one thing very clear by the way of keeping the database I kept all the information on all the projects and at no time was there ever\nAn official\nTask game to our unit\nAre done by our unit are involved in remote influencing anything that was done was done by individuals on their own time and there was some experimentation and so forth but at no time were we ever task to do that\nWell would it be your view Lynn a unofficially that remote influencing is possible\nI Believe so I uh have collected the data and tried the experiments and have come to the conclusion that it's extremely possible\nMy God then you know I I again this brings me back to the military as a parent dismissal of this remote influencing would be of such intense interest to them or that it just seems impossible to me that they would not fully explore it\nWell if you're a politician funding something would you want to get caught funding\nRemote influencing on me or I don't think any\nPolitician does and of course anytime you do something and government there's always the chance of a leak and somebody finding out\nBut then again they let it go death sure but they don't want to get caught selling missiles to Iran either well you have a good that's right and our government does lots of things that it it might not otherwise want to get caught at and the idea of being able to remotely in for influence of Boris Yeltsin or or Saddam Hussein or any of the other big guys\nThis is Joe I'd like to comment on that from a science standpoint sure um I ... as I said before I had been over Thirteen Years with a cognitive science lab and uh there there are a number of labs across America I'm there had been involved in remote doing research and\nMany of those labs have tried some some experimentation in the remote influencing arena\nThere has been some some very interesting and provocative results which are still very much up in the air [noise]\nUh so if you were to say absolutely we can prove remote influencing you would have to say no we can't but if you said that there probably that there is a high probability that it's possible\nYou would have to say yes but all the researchers and and yet there are all based on that uh I don't know how you would actually acquire and uh be expected of a a a an ability to validate the outcome that's right\nUm and the experimentation I've done a the experimentation I Know is completely full of holes and could be shot down by a you know junior ... scientist\nOh but uh I have a done the experiment to my satisfaction are now believe\nThat it can be done and quite easily oh but as far as proof I'm Still waiting for prove myself\nUm our president has done from time to time over the last several years things that seem utterly uncharacteristic have any of you had anything to do with that\n[laughter] that I [laughter] other than with my vote no [laughter]\nAll right um I without naming anybody a would one of you say Oh yes I definitely in my own mind I Believe that I definitely remote\nI'm\nI this is Lynn I'm I have a a talk to many of a damn students a structure wise I don't think there is that much of a difference\nUm oh\nOf course sticks to the um sticks pretty closely to the NGO swan structure mhm and I'm a retains the the uh terminology that NGO used\nNo right so in other words there is not a lot of difference\nThere's not a lot now and go ah requested that people not use his terminology and so uh I started using\nBasically a slang terms that the students developed\nOh for instance a analytic overlay which is basically your imagination taking over uh uh my students called stray cats and so uh I took over that terminology simply because NGO\nUh put out I'm a\nLittle basic letter saying please don't use my terminology mhm and ah so\nAh basically oh I Would say as far as terminology goes ads is more edges closer to the original than than anything I teach\nUm oh\nMan I measure wise there I think they are basically the same\nAlright may I ask this of all of you why do remote viewers generally not love each other\n[laughter] well uh let me let me address that ah I've been watching this on the net\nWait a minute who is this oh I'm Sorry this is Lyn Lyn okay I've been\nWatching this on the net and uh [noise] if you look very closely or the the\nConcept or the feeling that all remote ears are squared off at each other is a form of sort of disinformation in itself okay the\nAh people who are squared off at each other seemed to be a ed squared off that Dave Dave squared off it it ah it and I are at and Joe ... and\nOh I think soon to be at and Paul oh and and uh several other people and if you may notice a pattern growing there oh\nWhy do you guys let me restructure the question what are you guys not love it [laughter] [noise] ah there are several reasons one\nI'm a [noise] for one thing oh when he got out of service have started ah\nHe started giving classified information to the public oh I'm a while it was still classified\nUh he uh is making claims that he oh ran the project that he started the project that it was you know that he brief the president and and I mean these are laughable things\nA bit not happen you're saying not true or not true All right ah I'd like\nTo make a comment here as well uh this is Joe ... is also made claims that I've worked for him and uh that sort of thing and those are in fact we not true statements\nYeah he said I worked for him to and I didn't [laughter]\nAll right here's a fax a McDonald's has has said that ... or ... was never a remote viewer ah we've the government but was simply a person who was employed interview prospective candidates for the government remote viewing program could you please ask him to comment on that\nUm this ... let me jump in the halls around this is Paul okay if that's actually not completely correct to his nose pulled a Joe's because they didn't overlap ed came in on the scene a long after Joe was gone\nUm it actually did indeed do did participate in some operational won't be doing projects however that wasn't his primary function or he was indeed a a\nA more an analyst task or a managing training and stuff you know he did he he he was kind of a Jack of all trades in that regard he wasn't hired primarily Israel will you were in only under exceptional circumstances that you do that but he didn't do indeed\nDid do some operational during I got that he did one did need a no ... on the crisis on for ... for a number or I haven't gone through the list but uh\nI'd say uh I saw at least six or seven that he was a list is if you are on I was really I didn't have that and I didn't remember that from my data base uh this is\nJoe I'd like to comment on my comment [laughter] ah that's not an exact quote for what I said All right\nUm the claim was made\nA um buy at\nA dams that that he was the only person who who was qualified the trainer or teacher of the people remote do and that he was the the most accurate remote viewer in up in the project and the only one who was a responsible viewer and my comment was that\nHis primary job while he was with the unit was to to act as a monitor and interface with the viewer in terms of uh handling are setting up remote feelings and that he was not a primary trainer he may have train or in the sense that he ran practice sessions and that sort of thing\nAnd and that's okay everybody had specific jobs on the Internet um and every one performed as they were required and I suspect that you perform\nYou know righteously and do the job or very well [laughter] ah or I have a problem is where he makes claims then then attributes them to himself when they're in fact don't have anything to do with him they had something to do with someone who perhaps is not even with this any more today\nIn a private moments are you gentlemen have have you know referred to it deems as Dr Doom [noise]\nAh this was a nickname that was given to him and the unit before he came to us or he was a he was called Dr Doom over there ah he's\nBeen predicting doom death and destruction for years and years and years now\n[laughter] uh would you say that he has seen things that the rest of you have not seen\nBut that would be with her or something and this is a a\nN and that's fine um well one of the remarkable things about remote doing is that when you when you make a prediction or you make a statement about something a one would hope that there would be some validity or some method by which you could prove politically or the brass information or I could\nCertainly choose or picked targets that are completely amber viable and make all the claims I Want and that's okay um\nThey'll never be shown are proven one way or the other but one would hope that if you're going to be making claims about remote viewing and its in its capabilities that you would be a opening yourself to being tested in some way or producing information that can be verified\nNo right well that ah opens up another topic and maybe a little bit in the sense of ... um he's been on this program and said I'm sure you're all familiar with the amazing Randy so costs\nUm and it has been on this program and said uh as straight out he accepts a Randy's challenge there is something like a million dollars are now more sitting there waiting for somebody to prove psychic ability\nAnd beams and said I accept I called the amazing Randy so called and asked him to come on he settled socks and said okay there's numbers in my safe tell add to come up with these numbers\nI said that's not fair\nUm you're in control of the uh uh the numbers and I I don't like that oh so how about coming on the program and setting up a structured test\nUh with the controls that up here on the program and the amazing Randy so called did not come on the program would not come on the program I'm do any of you feel that the amazing Randy's challenge could be a taken and met\nA as it stands a he's he's basically a a magician has a slight of hand and sleight of mind uh and if you if anyone does things on his terms\nUh he wins I don't care if you were a hundred percent accurate uh\nDoing it on his terms you'd you'd uh\nYou'd be subject to a magician sleight of hand and uh I mean it's a it's a gimmick a\nYou know that he uses for\nFor his own a popularity and so forth\nOK buddy that yes but if if the controls were set up a independently uh from Mr Randy\nThen he wouldn't participate\nAnd so that's why he wouldn't come on the program\nSure right that this is Joe I'd I'd like to say something about that he he doesn't except the current scientific controls that have been verified proven and used to cross a nine to eleven labs in the world\nCan you know it's easy to predict things that have already happened oh\nAll right let me let me pull away from this are you guys are going to have to have already having too much fun with this [laughter] um let's talk about the past for a second one obvious target in the past of immense interest to people worldwide\nIs whether there was really a man who walked the earth\nWho was the son of God called Christ or it must have been a for you at some time and in evidently tempting target [noise]\nUm this is Lynn oh I had done a series of ah of decisions on oh Colombian drug lords uh Hussein cut off and so forth and I\nWas talking

down to when you can and Joe ... model and Paul Smith a gentleman uh we left off at an interesting point I announce whether whether anybody had remote viewed Jesus was the ... was he the son of God what are you know if anything\nOf this is Joe and I'm In in my response I'm going to be probably a little bit more specific um bright light one of the problems I have is the definition for alien and there's a lot of construction immediately come to mind when someone brings that subject up\nI I Believe are based on a remote during my experience is that a bit UFOs a real uh let me say that up front\nI have not seen any evidence that there aliens associated with you a full phenomena of not seen direct proof of that\nHowever uh within the context of aliens I Would have to say that uh also there's some of my experiences um I Believe that there are a entities that people would perhaps call Ian\nBut that doesn't get guarantee that there extraterrestrial they could be um and it could be essentially time travelers a extra dimensional a projections\nThey sure almost anything here and I don't think we possess pushing proved to say one way or the other yet what they might your answer Joe\nI'm very and ... all of you agree there is certainly something out there other than us well\nThis is Joe again I'm ... this isn't a new issue are this is this has been around for two thousand years that we know of\nAnd it will continue to be around because those are simply experiences that are that people are having\nIn a while we may not be able to say specifically very much specifically about it other than they are experiences doesn't mean that it should not be properly investigated or or looked at or what happens unfortunately is that a lot of the data is a\nIs mixed with this information or it's collected improperly or poorly and [noise]\nAnd we wind up with some very interesting uh concepts about it but we we don't get any closer to the truth\nOr are there are there are aspects of uh Stargate that history of you are still unable to discuss publicly\nYes of course they are I Would have to say about Ninety five percent of that\nWell my God really yeah absolutely so when they said Stargate is declassified they only generally meant the fact that it existed\nAre generally so yes\nWell here's Paul um the the biggest body of of material is still classified and and probably ought to remain classified deals with the actual projects themselves and the reason for that is not the connection with ... remote viewing but the connection with other intelligence sources and means\nUm if there is material on some of that some of those projects that would that that could potentially harm our intelligence collection capability it might to disclose the existence of some human source that we have you know and and a\nHuman asset him at risk or you know ... there's a lot of stuff in there that isn't even involved with the real viewing that that is sensitive to end a important to ah American security\nI Would agree with that you made a rather startling statement one of you or that it deems you felt disclosed some classified material before it's time oh well this is Lynn ...\nI'm not only on a on a few uh T. V. shows uh I think there's one called the other side or something like that and a radio shows but also um\nI was down in Atlanta one time a working with a student and I had the chance to meet a person named uh Courtney Brad ... who was going to put out a book\nOr this book was about the Stargate project and he asked me to take a a copy of the manuscript that he had and read it and then the first chapter of the manuscript never remember everything was still classified highly classified\nI'm In the first chapter of the manuscript was the list of names of all of the viewers\nAre [noise] I went back and I said I said Courtney you can't you can't publish this and uh\nAnd uh you know if you do though they'll confiscate your book or something and and anybody that got him to take that first chapter out mhm oh I ask him where did you get this information and he said well I got to commit oh\nWhen I was a kid watching you know the old world war two movies and all I knew that the absolute worst\nTreason that any age you could ever do\nWas give the names of the other agents or I mean you you you buy the China ill and died before you do that and yet here was the entire list uh\nLet us go to Robin Vancouver\nWhat I wanted to pay for all this craziness going on in there I feel like you are a lot of signs\nOf actual journalism where you are open to everything and there's nothing like that\nWe're going to be going through some incredible times but not all going to be good times says rocky isn't gonna see\nAnd that's what we need\nYou were listening through our bill somewhere in time tonight we drink coast to coast am from march twenty fifth Nineteen Ninety seven [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAll right back now a to my guest and I will ask for the sake of the radio audience once again that they all identify themselves by their first name at least as they speak otherwise it is confusing Lou Cannon Joe ... model and Paul Smith all once again back gentleman\nUh before we get started I Would like to ask you my Web master\nIs listening we've got a a link right now\nTo the home page for controlled remote viewing you if you would like any other linked up um a say so now and we'll get them up right away\n[noise] uh yes this is this is Joe I'm the cognitive science was ... blank is a a worldwide Web dot Jay S.

addresses will get shorter and easier [laughter] All right we will get those up I'm now before we leave the subject of aliens or dimensional beings or whatever it is that you all sins and agree\nOr would be out there\nAre one obvious target in this area uh would've been the Roswell episode and I've got a a person vaccine me from Los Angeles saying uh somebody must have tackled that one has anybody looked at Roswell in it so ... what have you determined\nOr I can I can respond to that first I guess this is Joe okay Joe I'm\nI I had a private client who actually targeted me against Roswell and uh at the time I of course was totally blind to the actual target\nAnd ah what I produced was essentially a very accurate description of the location that was being part in Roswell which was the believe crash site\nAh there were some indications that there probably was an incident there but it did not involve an alien craft it involves a\nA possible ... collusion between uh uh some earth earth bound traffic and probably involved a some materials that were central to\nEnhance or then of course the story about the weather balloon\n[noise] yes I ... the data ahead did not specifically match a weather balloon but uh it it did indicate that there was probably any bad but it was probably not a ... a alien associate it\nDuring thought Joe I'm ... are you from Orange County aren't in reading ... book mind track which by the way I thought was a great book he talks about a stage in which he sees creatures or goes square spirits\nAnd uh the person wants to know does everybody who remote views eventually get there\n[noise] uh in in regard to what what their referencing are uh some chapters in there where I was discussing a my interaction with what you might call into these that uh took this took place essentially as an experience outside of remote doing or or want to make that very clear\nA while these these may have been a personal experience on but I think is bell ah they they were not the separation was not obtained a severe um of dealing with um\nI I Believe it's my personal belief a based on Nineteen years of participation in the project and in the remote during that I've done\nIt's my personal belief that um that we are by nature a central existing in two worlds a one foot physical and one foot in a spiritual and to ignore the experiences from a spiritual side would be taught him out the cutting off the left leg so to speak\nHere well then here's another good question other than the remote viewing of\nChrist um Kent any of you or do any of you aside from your personal religious beliefs are in in in the context of remote viewing ... or is it possible to confirm the fact that there is life\nBeyond the physical\nI I I Will answer that uh this is Joe again I'm In my opinion yes uh\nBut it's not life as we know the physical and it's it's obviously something else right and uh I I Believe that uh we do have frequent interactions with or what might be termed as as entities or spiritual being\nAnd that uh they have profound impact on us as a spiritual\nSpiritual beings ourselves in that those types of experiences or had the because of the profound impact of them have exactly the same effect as if you were run over by a Mack truck in the world so they should be paid attention to 'em and that's up to each individual as to what they do with I\nDon't write this is for all three of you are in the process of learning or are in the process of remote viewing is there any danger to the remote viewer\n[noise] this is Paul I'm\nI don't think so I'm In my entire time with the program I never experienced myself or heard of anyone else experiencing anything that would be considered dangerous\nI Know there are claims out there to the contrary but to um you know I just don't know where that's coming from\nA well a dangerous to the psyche of the remote viewer in other words that you might see things for example that would drive a person over the edge\n[noise] ah this is land could I jump in here for a second\nYes um [noise]\nFor each person when you establish a sort of contact between your conscious and subconscious mind sometimes there are things that your subconscious unconscious have been waiting for Twenty years to say to each other and there's a period of time generally when a person gets very sensitive the very a\nA reactive to things uh fly off the handle easily and so forth uh but that gets over with a any real danger that comes to a person I think is basically\nCaused by the fact that the subconscious is harboring a danger that is then let loose um I have never had any or even actually known any person who has had a a\nA remote view in session where this session itself or the target itself a had a had a danger to the fewer oh I think\nWhat you carry into the learning process for remote viewing may be a danger to you but that dangers been there all along anyway\nI'd I'd like to add something to that when I I this is Joe I I agree with what when and uh Paula both said\nI've never had a bad experience and remote going but I Would like to uh underscores the fact that uh this is a very interesting um experience remote doing or being psychic and there are a lot of people that\nAre that are on the edge to start with and when they're exposed to the changes their rather radical changes in their their beliefs or their constructs\n... there have been there's there have been a lot of reports about Soviet having been involved in that in the past\nUm but it's mostly kind of rumors and then and such a again no evidence of course I think of this nature it'd be hard to prove any way but there was some interest in what wild stories about what the Soviets could or might be doing\nAll that there are All

period of time in which the dinosaurs roamed earth\n[noise] uh not personally oh that is a I'm\nA fairly good training target and uh uh in fact I think maybe I have a in my in my early training um you know just as a as another uh\nA session to see if you're on target because we have feedback on that\nWell there was a there is the second part to the question okay a if so was man walking side by side with the dinosaurs\nOr\nI don't remember specifically getting that I have always felt that a a form of a man was yes uh-huh but uh that I didn't get that from a remote viewing I got that from other studies that have done okay a simple archaeological findings\nAnd then you know good PS here a PS why can't remote viewers win lotteries and I'm a before you answer that I Would have answered a Ross in California by saying Ross how do you know that a lot of the winners of lotteries aren't re most humorous\n[laughter]\nBut you answer the way you want when\nAll right we have ah people working on numbers which is a a very hard thing to do in remote viewing\nA there is another type of remote viewing called alternate I mean I'm I'm well a A R B a alternate remote viewing\nUh which uh substitutes remote viewing targets for the numbers\nAnd allows you to a remote view for instance the pick three now the way that it's normally done is if you are doing to pick three you have a poor people working a three viewers\nEach of which will remote view one of the numbers and\nOne person who collect the data looks on the church to see what the results Maine and goes in places Tibet off um but it it it's been done and uh oh it's been done successfully\nWell do you help people like this the ...\nAh yes now one of the problems that I have is this a security clearance\nAnd ah for many other reasons as well or if there's an investigation going on especially on an American citizen I Will only work it through authorized channels and so if someone comes to me and says you know uh\nUh my son is missing or or uh [noise] I don't know what happened to so and so yes I'm I Will tell them partially because I Want the cushion they're partially also because it's a necessity\nThat oh if they will get the investigating officer to contact me I Will be glad to work the problem for free\nAll right man a man man ma'am ma'am listen to me listen to me he just said have the investigating officer in your case\nYou can't have your son contact him\nThere aren't there is no I think for many years for K through ...\nYes but there was an original investigating officer on the case\nWe uh ... retired by now\nWe worked a case not too long ago a last year some time that had been closed for nine years and uh and on the results of our ah\nOur session a male Dave and I worked on this the results of our session the case was reopened and they've been finding are I hear some uh some new evidence\nSo do that man well how can I get a hold of lane okay that's a good question Lynne or ... what is the best way to get a hold of you\nOr do you have Internet access\nOr I Would presume and she doesn't she can get it\nOkay oh I Would say the easiest the easiest a address to remember is art bell dot com and ah right there's a link to my page and on my pages my address and phone number\nAll right there you are imam and or I might add that if you don't have a friend with a computer who can do it you can go to a public library and I just remember my address a which is WWW dot art bell dot com [noise]\nNow let me also say that right at the present time\nWe are heavily backed up with a signed witness program ah cases and so we're we're really bogged down until we can get more votes years working on these so um oh I Hope people won't be offended if um\nYou know if they call and uh have their police department call as well and uh nothing is done that day\nAh we have a we have a tremendous backlog here\nCompletely understandable uh west of the Rockies you're on the air with lint Buchanan good morning\nI yes good morning my credit for that kind of lost track of all people out there to cover up I think I already back\nAlright I'm old that that is an awfully good question in other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate it backwards\nOr absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote viewing is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with\nOh and there is a thing that a recall basically the neighbor's cat oh if or someone else whom you respect very much a does a session on a target and they're wrong ...\nOut of you respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing as well this is one reason why I never\nUm a\nTask the same exact question\nTo two different viewers who know each other\nWell this brings me back to it deems a tapes which\nGenerally the group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works\nIf it works then I'm all for\nIt hooked in on the other hand we all of those people\nThe ... out there remote viewing maybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes will be paid and couldn't there'll be assertive virtual anarchy that would develop\nThat so much fear I Do believe very strongly in the show direct effect and I know that the more people who\nLearned to remote you correctly the easier it is to learn to remote you correctly the more you learn to remote view incorrectly the easier it will be to learn in choosing incorrectly ... and this is my big fear with so many of the\nQuickie courses that are out there oh I'm afraid that they're going to through the shoulder I could just uh you know the ... mafia Fisher a just a almost destroy any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYeah well what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released it a very or relatively comparatively inexpensive price\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can uh get people doing this oh and doing it well then I'm all for it and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nAimed at style convenience security and train peace of mind with rhino safe dot com today that's right oh save dot com rhino safe dot

[noise]\nUm and for them I'm the editor of uh magazines could win choir do things like that but I'm but unified from that I just love mysteries and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking focal point of view\nAnd so one so partly the answer your question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like for if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that ... been looking that goes again all\nRight you know it's like they're like we're going to we're going to go to the beach I'm like that's really cool are you there is a monster so wandering over they're interviewing people taking photos\nAnd so that

discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with Ben Radford bend so as you tell us about the origins of\nHalloween it really does have a um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get state panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that time of Halloween or that were the fun was a little peanut characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dressed up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nAbout two years ago and he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that\nIn their himself oh\nAnd ... and when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that exactly\nI was just such an offensive like the first of all the you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nI Want to offer but I wanted to ask you that are still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray or candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are real\nHe's sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that is that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dance often are actually the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost all you know\nAnd I'm like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you know [laughter] yeah I don't need to wander whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think you'd still be is you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing is just silly\nYeah my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so they can feel the stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people to mommy for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restructure the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second waves of ... of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nI'm ... and in fact you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the uh the witch trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years\nI'm a court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy they'll hire you if you'd actually\nHave families coming together to make a gift costume\nAnd what you find is that uh the first um the ... the first record that I found up Halloween masks are really emerging about the Eighteen seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years um or they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid in your past the molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as a marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a colorful enterprise and you know it it's B it's become commercialized for for better and for worse\nAnd this is when you started getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know [noise] the the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you know and they're all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much and you really continue to to do that how do you see the future um Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well ah an estimate your question you know I think that um you know\nWhen I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we're with each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far\nIn Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really peeling again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who does like to dress up like a dress up right I mean eight year old kids love just eighty year old kid like a dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual or go you know where you've\nGot like holographic you've got to that because if he had that he was like this giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door and that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we are going to ask them about this the panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm kind of you will as Andy says we'll is rude tonight\nNever missed a detail or short just sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ...\nTalk radio six forty WG as the ... national park almost such natural wonders is half dome and the giant sequoia tree desire mental trailblazer John Muir and his colleagues campaigns for the congressional action\nWhich was signed into law by president Benjamin Harrison the way for generations of hikers campers in nature lovers along with countless signs of don't feed the bears\nThis week in Nineteen sixty two Johnny Carson takes over from Jack Parr as host of the late night talk programs Tonight Show Carson went on to host this show starring Johnny Carson for three decades becoming one of the biggest figures in entertainment in the twentieth century\nAs we can Nineteen Ninety lesson\nNBC News radio Andy mutual Brett Kavanaugh the newest associate justice of the U.S Supreme Court vice president Mike Pence made the formal announcement earlier today and the Senate after the final vote\n[noise]\n[noise] got to wait for a boy and morale\nDavid you're either has overcome a severe issue\nTo light the light bulb went on and I started to research things were going through capsule and it made me feel so much I can tell you one thing the product war\nNot only works in one way or the whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy measures we run into these are held a better way carnivores everything back into my body in a while but you know what it's better there and I feel it again Sam know\nThis is Richard Haass throw off or a carnival or research international call one eight six six eight three six eight seven three far that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\nOr visit carnivores dot com C.

hear on the coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented time we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of\nGhost tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it\nBut I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it I mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know\nAnd the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one of those things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted houses you know reached out and grabs her grow somebody or whatever I mean it's there are some of that but\nBut you know that's you know for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who were just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean a a mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause damage because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't warship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if during ... and if you ask them you know if you told them about some some goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the fans pay to what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know if I win festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's but there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is coming to a team\nYou know thou shalt not suffer which to live\nOn and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's\nOne of the more obviously comes up every every year coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nHum and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in ah the ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to feed James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking into ghosts and and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it if it ah when did you board or strictly prohibited anyone using ... board will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the\nThe owners were so concerned that using the word you board was going to open up you know do you want to ... or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it I think what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you will find this don't use it and so you know typically the concern\nIs uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was ... motion that\nA kid the dresses up as a which are of goal will become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party we have a harvest party so if they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into the harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff\nAnd of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything but I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights and the\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was it was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was a wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you'd go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas [laughter] just the way lives right down the\nMarathon borrowed my native right away I Am doing those\nHuge freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nThey were great under you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back oh man\nI I mean anything Googled afterward on here that and uh and uh\nI I didn't know that um that uh what's his face with a lot fewer seats for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup member on all the producers were were watching that so uh hey you guys are
