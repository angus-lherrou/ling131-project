wasn't any move to kind of compensate the u._k. shareholders for the loss of that option All right so where does this leave Unilever then\nWell I mean there's two things here socio Paul Pullman had sort of conceived of the simplification process as a great gift that he could give to his predecessor he's already set his departure date and so now that I'm that move has been completely tarnished as has you know our assessment of his reign as chief of the company\nBut given that the company has also made such an enormous song and dance about the benefits of simplification you've really got to

that there could be a brags that deal imminent what about that\nThat's actually another factor that was putting pressure on you know it's particularly today because it's not just the tax cuts\nFear factor fixed income it also gives the bank of England kind of free rein to either continue with its rate increases are if not ... that even bring them forward\nBut Armageddon Ashraf says is not an hand for fixed income in the u._k.\nIt is now and one of the reasons is supply said the chancellor of the ex checker is going to announce the government spending plans at the end of the month Theresa May has already fly that austerity is over I so if we see that chance there say that the government about to leave that its purse strings\nThat could well indicate a surge in New spending but he's also said that they think that'd be offended with new debt taxes are going to really bear the brunt of this\nSo what that means is that there's not going to be a supply dumb that would match the sort

right so what happened was there um you know a year ago at the Trump Administration wanted to basically ease the regulatory pathway for each cigarette to continue to be on the market um they wanted to make sure that adults who were smoking regular cigarettes could still have access to them um so that they would\nYou know they were trying to make sure that there was a those were available so they could maybe quit smoking traditional cigarettes at least I'm In the flavors were part of that appeal\nAnd what's happened in the last year since they um ease some of those regulatory burdens is that the company's appeared to have been able to take advantage of that and I'm more and more kids instead are smoking then because the flavors are still out there they're able to market them um\nAnd there just aren't as many restrictions and so what's really worried them as they've seen a Seventy five percent increase in use vaping and the last year and that's the number that the FDA was able to
