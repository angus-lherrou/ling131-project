war soldiers but you could still have these types of operations\nAnd I think that's really a one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there have been a in Ohio northeastern part I've got to ask I Believe he did a show from there the man's bill reform\nMatory yup we sure did\nAnd every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story with you\nSure okay my mother in full blooded Cherokee of Columbian quite a few times\nFollower ... are there any way ah my father died\nAnd three months later my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out you know to put two kids and just before daylight woke up my father was there he came in her bedroom sit down\nBad mom stood up her daughter kissed her and said honey everything's going to be All right but it's beautiful the strongest power of everything is all up and I always wanted to share that\nWith a sweet mhm ... these sometimes these stories are just emotional was well aren't they branded\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part it in my in the ... and that accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye a thing you know it's okay um ... you know these are positive experiences in their life changing\nAnd they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one ... and these are important things in life we talked about before it could heal from sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that they're sometimes paranormal experiences are used as coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's all like negative negative negative negative goes goes ...\nNot like that in real life so to join the Bronx I chose to go ahead hey George how are you Joe\nGood a brand and yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe you relate a story about a full ... seen um [noise]\n... um the question is do you think that there is this a little under channel of communication going on\nBetween the go see a permission and the recipient of the ghost experience um maybe perhaps subconsciously there's this supplemental um communication to wake communication going going that precipitate the or do we have permission appearing\nAnd I had a full reparation experience uh after my brother passed away um by sharing the songwriter and I was having writer's block on his song not related destroyed before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm [noise] he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital\nI'm short of 'em and uh it it sits during the day or at the foot on my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall um can you may be elaborate\nOn what could have precipitated this\nAh does your does your brother pass away or who he was\nHe a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away a city a ... before you had the ... maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nOkay All right I'm while answer your second question then we'll get back to the first question will quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know without the husband thing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check behind the workbench and he finds the pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is it happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with a complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother and I and when you resonate with something\nIt's not just information it's the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there was one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd he has this feeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog you know laying in the water and injured\nAnd you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions and then they you know wakes up cars finds a dog and that type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like\nI'm understanding or collapse of the uh reading a mind type thing\nWhere do we get to ... to go study sprinting\nUh the study is available or at Barnes and noble a it's an Amazon dot com if you like listening to books on radio or um in your car you can get it at audible as well so basically

countries or Mike ... is Bloomberg\nRight so uh what do you see dragging the market uh more broadly this morning uses growth concerns out of China\nOh man that is such a good question it's really difficult to kind of put your finger on one isolating factor at the moment and it's a bit of a cop out but I'm tempted to say what we have here is just sort of risk of sentiment and a little bit of momentum selling if you look at a lot of stuff that's been sold over the past\nFew days and weeks it's sort of a first and first out kind of knew the firm darling set the market getting sold off very quickly\nThat had when it comes to Chinese stock it there's a little bit of an industry going on because Chinese stocks were so battered up for it so long it's interesting that they've sort of become a target um while even more of a target in the past week or two I'm Still a little bit of a mystery there\nThe other big mystery now of course is why stocks are selling off in China even as you have the authorities coming in and really announcing a raft of a stimulus measures\nYeah that is an interesting point because as you say the Chinese central government has made plenty of promises about how it plans to shore up the uh the stock market there and you would think that it was to have more of an impact but I guess we're not seeing it at this point\nNo and again not going to be pretty worrisome to anyone watching the market we do have different opinions as to whether or not these measures will be successful so Goldman Sachs for instance was saying that uh one of the things that was just announced today the notion that we're going to have a concern\nOf Chinese security firms basically investing Twenty one billion un to help\nEase a margin cause I'm On Chinese companies have recognized that is going to have a positive impact other people of course aren't so sure a Deutsche Bank note came out just yesterday saying that\nGosh I think it was about um six hundred a firms and the China a share market basically might have met their margin call a level when it comes to share\nFinancing as of friday last week and just as a reminder the pledge shares it sort of a curious thing that happens in the China market where companies pledge their own shares as collateral in exchange for financing and of course the worry is that as you've got to sell off he sort of get a feedback loop intensifies everything so\nThe move that we saw today it's one measure that we've seen so far in China just to sort of accept feedback loop and takes the pressure off\n... news executive editor

Lon brief exploring legal issues in the new is brought to you by American arbitration association international trade or business to resolve faster where the international Center for it and she's a resolution the leader in alternative dispute resolution around the world I. C. D. R. dot org\nToday we look at claims from attorney general Jeff Sessions at a recent string of court losses for the White House and the judicial activism by judges set against the Trump Administration\nHer more on this story Bloomberg's doing grass species Charles and Jay professor at Indiana University school of\nLaw there hadn't been a slew of opinions against the administration but is it correct to say that judges who've been ruling against the administration are\nWho are making policy\nNot necessarily a I think that that that complaint is going to be one that\nIs always in and play and sometimes it's true but I I think it's also important to understand that we're talking about a string of defeats that the administration is faces that are coming from Republican and democratic appointees alike\nAnd uh you know I think it's a little simplistic to suggest that the reason that these to feature occurring is is because of the ideology of the judge involved rather them because the laws against the administration\nSix years ago you wrote an article for the Cornell law review entitled can the rule of law survived judicial politics so this is not a new concern I take it then\nNo and I think what's important to understand that that we we see a a complete a almost a celebration of norms that the Supreme Court appointment process level where\nOne can fairly argue that Supreme Court justices to hear any ideologically charged cases a year or indeed you're in love with only going to be influenced by their ideology and trying to figure out what the right\nAnswer is to open ended questions that are difficult to answer and the ideological charge what we learn about lower court judges is but it's a very different ball game there's nowhere near the evidence\nThat the average judging the average district is deciding cases of ideological ways because those issues rarely arrive because when they do arise the judge is subject to the president of the Supreme Court\nAnd so yeah I think we do have a problem with judges being ... ideological and and the perception that when they are ideological that they're somehow doing something um but\nThe appropriate and sometimes I think that's true and that sort of issue is most acute when it comes to the Supreme Court and what what information we have suggests that's a very different a different world among the lower court\nThat's challenge a a professor at Indiana University of Missouri school of law speaking to Bloomberg ... so you can listen to more legal analysis like this on Bloomberg Politics policy

better so for example ... age which is the interest rate hedge version they'll cutie is up a one point five percent\nThat six percent more than ... which is down four point five percent of the year so they're hedging works in a rising rate environment but what about if rates don't increase right that's exactly why this is somewhat of a ... a this reminds me of course you know GPS when other foreign
