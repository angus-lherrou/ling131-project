since February but some signs of risk back on this morning the CIA Asia Pacific index climbing for the lowest levels because may twenty Seventeen\nA joining us for more Bloomberg News managing editor apple O'Brian lives in our Beijing bureau a definite signs of risk back on Emma\nLee finale ... talk therapy is following that they get here in town and I found that we didn't like the the quiet unexpectedly good Chinese trade or\nAt least some of the export Trey Grayson accelerating in September and record at trade set with the U.S which Donald Trump a light and outlined Cabot the market but pretty happy with the thing is that the reason behind that data\nWork only got like a factor why at the Donald Trump parrots putting things on and on by that and planes trying to get out of China before that I say it\nMay not be extended that next and we may that they continue to stay at the ... that that that ... and early promising Chinese trade data I bet that backs up at night air that they say down here\nThat they felt they had said that pretty bad losses set a good day for button said it\nA good reason behind that that rally we have today with tents and said that the Internet that out of China really right after ... days to block it had its biggest gain it hits twenty fifth daily oath to help markets that have that\nAnd also on the currency fraud we have a report from Bloomberg the secretary Steven Mnuchin here the United states will not declare China as a currency manipulator the impact from that\nThat really helped that certainly help with that sentiment and the markets and not to China and eight today and what it healed that rate down the shore\nHad anxiety that that you are and what the term out of the trade war that either trying out what you said\nI evaluate at for example I'm tied up in a fight back against the u._s. or that Trump would we buy the allegations that he lied about it being that if you let it sit taking that off the table that late but now with reassuring to lock it\nOr as we look at currencies this morning one of the things that stands out the yeah in Japan is a lower against the dollar down about two tenths right now it's up to one twelve thirty three that's usually considered to be a haven currency what indication is that give you in terms of a market whether it be risk on a risk off\nWell yeah if you say yeah it is a haven April ... and the and one thing that bad\nBut it it kind of that show that people think that that rate doctor now have legs that they caught behind that came to repair it by the secretary innovating markets like China on that and who I think that looking pretty bullish\nUh what are the unexpected are the stocks of markets in Asia this week Indonesia is there a story that specific to them why are they the top stock market in Asia this week\nWe've had a big sigh currency they're a very exciting and back then that really the market that\nIt has had a bit of the ... the markets there so I think that's a little bit of fat I can buy 'em and and the market that has a lot of dining at that particular yeah when you think the fact that I said that you live in places like China and Hong Kong\nWell I think we're we're we're due for a bit of a balance here at least near term bath I mean I Do get a little worried when the when the futures are or were up a strong as they were uh an hour or two ago a because it is almost too much and the people with cell into it instead of by a week or so\nAnd and they're still up pretty strongly now so you may see a little bit of a dip mid day or even late morning that wouldn't be the biggest deal in the world but you know if you've got just mentioned how ... we saw this huge volume yesterday in the triple cues\nHuge by him he's a big increase from ... on on the sort of the New York stock exchange I'm Sorry the composite index a volume overall\nYou know that's a little bit of a sign of capitulation breath you know the vast decline on Wednesday was twenty eight to one to the downside\nAnd so and we're really kind of saw that that may be a it's getting a little washed out at least at least on the short term basis so I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a little pouch here and it's going to be key 'cause we need to get back up and everybody was talking about the two hundred a moving average we also have the fifty\nWeek moving average which is about the same level and we want to close back above that today that will be important that we finished a weak on a strong you\nKnow one thing I'm watching your gun my eye on this morning is the uh uh bouncing NASDAQ futures at one point six percent right now or are we going to continue to see a surge in tech stocks\nI think so and again I think your your little traders want to be a little careful because I mean and it is I think we will see a bit of a bit of a dip because people will be some people want to\nGo on strike then on the first sign of any kind of strength so I think we'll see a little bit of debt that might scare some people say oh my God here we go again we're going to see another ... you know after new or another failed rally like we saw both on\nA Wednesday and Thursday I don't think that'll happen I think we'll see a strong rally and it's got to be important there's nothing worse for a market that is he a precipitous decline into a weekend because then you know people people to panic over the weekend there's no surprise it crashes take place out early in a in a week because people tend to panic over the weekend so it'll be important that we have today\nYeah let's do a little bit of a post mortem if we can on ah the the slide we saw this week uh what do you think was behind it\nWell you know with a combination here we have this uh situation ever won a with of course higher interest rates and uh you know the last time we saw big spike and interest rates with little last late last January early February and that causes the stock market to to correct more than it has now uh so it's not a surprise that that had an impact but we've also had an impact but the uh\nUm you know with his tensions with China because people were starting to see some find that you know ... when he saw a PG earlier this week and for a corporation and Tiffany's all talking about how this situation with the trade tensions with China is impacting earning so people are starting to worry that maybe are earning from two thousand Nineteen won't be a strong so I think it's it's\nCombination ah I Do get a little worried when people start blaming each other for for things you know Trump claiming that the fed but uh I think we need to get away from that playing game that's that's going to be important going forward\nYeah we did see obviously a lot of that from the president this week and I mean we'll be talking as much about a so called logo fed if we if we hadn't gotten a there's a strong trade news from China last night\nWell you know ... if it's the blame game and not only does the president need to get away with the rest of us do too I mean the point is\nThat what the fed is doing if you know they're normalizing rate to use that term normalization because they took them abnormally low to save the financial system ten years ago\nAnd now they're doing the right thing people keep saying is they're asking if the fed making a mistake here well sometimes I mean it's not a God given right for the stock market to go up all the time a hundred percent of the time I mean sometimes it's ... it's it goes down and it's healthy to go down the fed is now raising rates to get them back to where they should be otherwise\nAnd same thing with the president I mean people on both sides of the aisle agree that China's been cheating he needs to do these things to make it more fair sometimes we do things that uh make hurt the market over the long term I think democracy voucher short term but if we see a ten to Fifteen Percent correction that doesn't mean what they're doing is a mistake sometimes they do the right things\nAnd after a huge rally since the election and a huge rally since the crisis\nA pullback of ten or Fifteen Percent is not the worst thing in the world of actually be healthy\nNow if we see a further uh lowered a trade news coming out of China because I think a lot of the reason why we saw a surgeon trade was because China was trying to get ahead of the tariffs here but uh if ... if we get into the next quarter in and trade slumps could that'd be a problem\nThat you know it it will be an and you know the the thing is the president or you know again people on both sides of the political aisle agree that we need to do something someday agree on what we should do maybe the British should be doing something different to change the situation but this still needs to be done\nAnd uh you know and the the the Chinese are going to drag this out as long as they can because they have the wherewithal to do it both politically and economically\nAnd and the thing is for us it might hurt our stock market and it may even hurt our economy a little bit I'm not saying it's a cause of corruption but yes I Do think it could cost in touch with and that's why I think that\nInvestors should continue to get a little bit more defensive raised a little bit of cash and that changed sell everything that saying they they have to deal with all their tech stocks\nBut Reagan little little more defense of those groups are actually doing quite well and that will help you out right out any kind of uh problems we have in in in the next six to twelve month and a ... little cash to take advantage if we do get a a a bigger decline\nWhat makes you say that China has the wherewithal to whether this\nIs number one they're the they're they don't have to worry about the the kind of uncertainty the election I mean the ... will have to worry that that the president might say well gee if I can I Do this I Am I might lose the midterms well he did they tend to lose seats in the midterms anyway so he kind of look past that but at some point\nA to people who have to worry about well you know if there's cause\nIf my top stand clause of the economy to pull back a little bit in the stock market pull back\nThat's going to hurt us ah a politically the Chinese don't have to worry about that the same thing on the economic front I mean they're definitely slowing but they've had this huge growth\nA and a bit of their their populace is a little bit more used to having these are the of downturns and then they're ... they're they're just learning these this new growth\nOf the of the great a capitalist society that they're they're trying to fit in in a weird way uh so uh they have a little bit more uh staying power then maybe most western countries which\nAre a last minute here we're just about an hour away from getting our first earnings reports from a J. P. Morgan and the other big banks we see fundamentals come back into play in the market\nThis was going to be vitally important not just the banks obviously that can help today on a short term basis\nBut what we need all the one thing that's been hurting I'm Sorry that's been helping the marketing we've we've faced we've all heard about these headwinds that the market his face this year we've been able to plow through them whether they be problems with emerging markets slowing growth a European banks et cetera but they've really fabulous range reports have been enabled us to plow through those head when if\nThese are if companies start to do with the PG or more a lot more companies start to say that our earnings are going to be hurt a going forward in other words it's going to be less important what the earnings are as it is what the guidance of earnings and got his are always important they are going to even be more important this time around because if they come back and say you know this really isn't hurting us\nThe market's going to turn right back up and go go higher just like it had eight of the last nine fourth quarters of the year so whether or not the of the guidance of strong or not I think it's gonna be vitally important\nMan maley equity strategist for Miller tape back always good to get your insights Karen\nHi Nathan thank you and we are watching futures that's in the future is at twenty three points this morning down features that a hundred and Seventy five and ... features that but one I read one ten year treasury downtime\nThirty seconds the three point seven percent the yield on a two year or two point eight six percent and checking the thirty year Neal three point three four percent\nAnd Bloomberg Gabriel continues to this is Bloomberg Radio\nSlap you on TALK radio six forty double duty as the\n[noise]\n\n\nG.
