ATF analyst for Bloomberg intelligence that's the Bloomberg each year for report on Fox\nRight thank you pay and we are live from the Bloomberg interactive brokers studios where it is now five fifty on Wall street\nMet merely joins us now he's an equity strategist at Miller tae back and uh met I've got my W. E. R. I. up on my Bloomberg Terminal and I'm looking at European indices right now and even the foot sea one hundred has turned back into the green\nWhat's got markets are back in a more optimistic footing here after yesterday's deep sell off\n[noise] well I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that you know today's world trading world a these are all goes into our lives and and other mechanized trading such a situations are programs\nOr whatever the market starts getting you know going in one direction in either direction it sometimes a exacerbates it in a major way and I think that's definitely what we saw yesterday I mean I've been cautious on the market and I did it did expect the market to come down there that has in recent ... a recent weeks\nBut the fact that it went down so far a late yesterday left our two trading yesterday was really just computer driven it wasn't the panic that we that you see with a big wash out or with a big uh were real investors are are selling so I think that people thought hey now that the computers got turned off for a little bit oh how people get a ... step back and say\nThis is going too far too fast for the market kind of bounce back that doesn't mean we hit the lower the sell off\nBut I think is giving people a little bit more confidence uh uh in what's going on as as the markets across the globe of stabilized\nSo how much lower than do you see markets going\nWell I mean the thing is things have changed I mean the number one it's it's it's a you know our interest rate to move tire a number two we don't have the synchronized global growth we had the beginning of the year\nBut the most important thing that's happening more recently as concerns over over earnings we faced a lot of different though had winds over ... this this year and each time we've been able to blow right through them earnings have been unbelievable but now with some of these uh you know with the trade tensions with China or some of these especially multi national companies\nAre starting to give guidance it isn't as good so people worrying about two thousand Nineteen doesn't mean or he's going to turn negative doesn't mean we're gonna have a recession but for a stock market price for professor I think we we could\nCould go a little bit lower uh having said all that uh we you know every single year where we had a mid term election for Nineteen fifties the market has rallied the last two months a year between the election and the end of the year I think we've got a on another one like that the before you know at a pretty sharp on before too long\nThat's an interesting point to make you see that coming no matter what the outcome of the election\nUh you know the the initial reaction of course will be will depend I mean I don't know what happens obviously but I think after that and and and again going back to the Nineteen fifties or going back almost Seventy years\nUh that uh no matter what the outcome was a the market has bounced back and again it makes it much easier to call for me to make when the market is starting to get very oversold a you know let's face it over a short period of time but not just a couple of days sometimes for a couple of months the market can can over the counter trend way\nA based on becoming too over shoulder to shoulder bought in this case is going to oversold\nAnd even though it could be a deep declined got a twenty six hundred I think the bounce will be a sharp on and they don't get that year and rally and then people have to look at what a readjustment portfolios for them for for next year\nNo one interesting a sector to look at uh right now has been the tech sector it's been one of the biggest performers this year a year it's taken the biggest hit him to sell off NASDAQ back into a correction mode now what's your outlook for tech\nWell the thing that concerns me most about Texas and one of the market will determine market bounce it back I think that well as well as the whole real work ... hour a look at the semi conductor stuffs you look at the end they estimate you're a semi conductor each year it's not one beer market territory age Twenty one percent and you see that it's broken badly below it's two hundred and moving average\nIt's it's it's trend is looks like it's changed\nA this is Medicaid leadership group within the tech sector and so therefore I think as you see is a market bounce back the big surprise for the last two months a year is going to be although the the technology but we'll bounce back that people will be go more into some of these groups that have been really clobbered like the housing stock for bank stocks\nEt cetera and those are the ones that are actually going to perform so uh I'm safer for sale especially institutional players who care about you know the ... the other performance issues as moving to the end of the year you're going to be able to get a performance of some of the ladder groups rather than the ... a group that has been for the for the leader for the really start to feel extra\nYou know when you talked about a semi conductors you got to think that a trade tensions are driving the the slump there\nWell it does it doesn't help but we also have a you know again we will go back to this thing where\nWe're at the beginning of the year everybody was saying she's everything is great we have synchronized global growth everybody's growing when we say specially if we're talking about Asia a lot lately but it was saying the one place you have to be here while at the last place you need we wanted to be this year and the thing is as the economy slows\nAt some point you know the U.S is going to slow down a little bit too because it's such a diversion it's gonna be hard for us\nFor the rest of the world the play catch up to us so I think that some of the conductor area is going to be it's going to fall for falling victim to that so it's not just the the issue with a tray attention\nNow at the same time though a lot of the animals who have been talking to her aren't seeing a recessionary signs are down the line and you are you thinking that we could see a more signs of a recession in the months ahead\nNo I I'm not so much has signed a recession is is I just think we need is a ... that the economy will flow\nAnd the thing is about the stock market is it has been pricing imperfection from pricing and that we continue to see this unbelievably a strong a G A GDP Growth and you know double the big double digit growth over twenty percent or more\nAnd that's not going to happen and who doesn't like him so I get ... therefore I think the market will come down a little bit I mean I guess people have gotten so used to being oh my gosh if the market turns counted goes now fifty percent because that's what happened at two thousand two thousand and eight\nI don't think we necessarily have to have recession therefore we don't necessarily have to have a bear market but I think we could have a rough for a year or two and Nineteen and and and then like I said this downturn could go into a correctional territory of the and the Fifteen Percent rain\nAnd this year we just get the low single digits or something we haven't seen in a while\nOr given that outlook than and uh the volatility we're seeing in the market right now what do you advise your clients\n[laughter] well I think that the sport really well in the last six to eight months has been getting more defensive ah you know if he even when the market was rally from may until we saw this correction start those defense of groups like the health care stocks that consumer staples stuck and even utilities\nAlthough they'll probably pull back as as a market bounces back\nUh those groups actually were out performing only slightly but they were out before me even when the market was rally outperformed markets calmed down a little bit so as you go to the inner ear and you're setting up for next year I think it's just a little bit more defensive play raising a little bit of cash and a little bit more defense of\nNot only will you protect yourself and I kind of downside but you're not being hurt when the Marta bounces in the I think that's a good way to play it right now\nMainly military back thanks so much for this good talking to you as always\nAs we take a forward looking at the market that's when the future's ahead by one percent right now again of twenty six points to dial up to hundreds Seventeen in the futures market that's again of eight tenths of one percent ... up by one point eight percent\nAgain of one hundred twenty two points\nYou are listening to Bloomberg day break\nTraffic on TALK radio six forty WG as the\n[noise]\n\n\nThe as the good morning visit the
