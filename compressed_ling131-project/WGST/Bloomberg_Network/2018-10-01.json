{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGST", "content": "With these strange smiles like almost too happy and anyway it was it was odd [noise]\nUm to this day the one thing I Wish I had done\nIs made of the make and model of the ATV and asked them\nHow did you get past the road block how did you get that ATV back onto this road the two girls there's no way they lifted any weight and even to adult men that looked like lumberjacks again they look just like the people on the brownie paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting\nAreas in the rain forest\nThe woods [noise] um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes wide again just like aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans it was like they were too perfect\nNot a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline nothing like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\nThey kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped and I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake\nAnd like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life sometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto the road that show [laughter] alone\nHow weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that the records their their sounds it was in those same\nWoods where I heard this ah ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think\nThe best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound and I'd encourage you to find out what coast to coast did with the audio tape they used to play of this a legit big foot recording ten or more years ago George ... used to play it\nI think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years but I heard that\nUp in the shame woods it's a unique recording never\nHeard of it before I'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big put my feet dimensional might extraterrestrial connection the humanoid that I saw in the woods but more I think about it there's\nAre Ninety nine point nine percent sure those were not human and hindsight I'm just glad they didn't take me whatever they were doing up in that area\nWell we're glad to cause a ... you wouldn't have been able to call in presumably thank you Jason for sharing

Vegas hey Brian what's on your mind\nOn a couple of comments on the on the Michigan for on on on on\nPrevious callers and over quickly maybe get the story in real quick um I I kind of a big experience and it wasn't until he played this year sounds like coast to coast they realize that that's what I heard I\nWas up um the Willamette to for national forest or love you know between um mount bachelor and a three sisters in Oregon\nAnd um it was up there a late night watch the stars and hanging out and know\nLikely music stuff sometimes I just kinda hang out more where it's quiet and there's nobody around her hours up their little went down to look at it starts to binoculars and I heard that same sound that he's talking about is\nJust as I Know what he's talking about [noise] um and it at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but it was kinda like hey what are you doing up here and I've\nGot a second guessing but oil and really far away and uh you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept hanging out look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed it say at least three five miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psychic impressionable at all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd me I jumped in my car so that got out of there um\nAnd you know I never really piece together what was you know I'm like I said I Will do a lot of reading once in a lot of course coast and when they're serious down it was like oh my God that is what it is it has a you know musicians like listen to

with the SEC ...\nW ha asked the\nMan is on jumps into the market with a ... ... ...\nIssues uh no no it doesn't it um if anything it gives them a starting point to go and attack their liquidity issues\nUh but mainly they have a billion and a half a debt maturity is coming up and twenty Nineteen and another two hundred and thirty that happened this November these are all convertible bonds are but they're well out of the money and in particular there's a issue in March\nOr which converts I Believe at three sixty so even with the uh the uptick in a in the stock price today it's still going to be about twenty percent behind that so they're going to need to hit the capital markets\nNow I Know your bones guy but uh this this year is just go right back where they were basically well\nYeah I think is for most a stock investors they're thrilled to have you on must back and I think if you're buying into the story whether you're on the equity side or the debt side you have to believe in ... to ah to make this company work\nWell let's talk about this agreement and the the need now to a point to independent directors how is that all gonna play out\nSo well I think it's going to be quite interesting because for Tesla it's almost as if the SEC is acting like an activist investor for them forcing them to essentially clean up the the business that they have and the management team that that's been in place\nAnd I do think it's interesting when you look at the ... a board that they have a where you have your brother I had a feeling much gather the brother on it now you have a a James Murdoch God who in self has run into a scandal or at these guys be\nSo uh you know putting in a credible management team and a business plan I think will be a very important for all stakeholders\nThat will be important but the proof is in the pudding is in in in terms of the production levels and and what he learned must can accomplish though\nYeah I mean if uh you know I'm an I'm an old ball guy now but going back to the graduate school days that's left hand side of the balance sheet that creates value right in the assets that you have and how you operate them\nSo eventually ah that's what comes into play and you know people wouldn't be talking about their balance sheet or risk if they were handling that side right so clearly that is that the imperative is to have better execution\nNo we're talking about this as if this solves Tesla's problems of what could possibly go wrong\nWell I think a lot can go rogue a lot has got ... um\nYeah I think for them to really what they need to do is to it did just focus more on the internal operation side you know you can't really live\nA on a quarter to quarter basis by having you have a car owners come in and try to build new cars are ... you don't really hear that got me out of a auto auto manufacturers so it's really an an an execution situation and\nIn terms of burning through cash as as we were talking about a desert come a point at which the the spigot shuts off well\nI think if people believe in a store you can look at others you know Amazon early on was a cash leader that Netflix has a cash leader if people believe in that growth story that's not necessarily the end of the world but eventually grows as slows down and you have to become more of a mature cash company ... a company and that's something\nTesla is moving towards ad won't eat to demonstrate that they have the capability of doing\nThe much talked about the some of the lawn mosques conduct of late and uh how this FCC uh agreement is an effort to sort of get to some of that but this is sort of a textbook case on what not to do if you're running a company\nRight uh yeah I mean I've I've been following credits for about twenty five years that I Can't say that I've seen another as CEO smoke pot on YouTube and still have a job or or or or anything\nOr not to want to be accountable to his investors in some ways yeah the first such a\nBrilliant person he he acts very childish um and I think that needs to get straightened out if a Tesla gotta develop as a puppy\nSo so again going forward if you're an investor what are you looking for now in terms of of bond buying that sort of thing\nSure well I think on the bonds there they have a one benchmark by twenty twenty five that's in the ... index um and I think really the the data points that we've talked to is the the bus typically trees around eighty eight is kind of where it's fallen out and it's been a polo that right now I think it's about eighty five and a quarter\nOr which means that there's a couple of points the outside or if it revert back to its mean for for him here on out one you have to demonstrate or a liquidity plan to take care of these twenty Nineteen converts or that you have\nTo add becomes the execution can they generate cash flow a man it's not just on a you know like the last week of of 'em up you get everybody together but can you can only do that I think
