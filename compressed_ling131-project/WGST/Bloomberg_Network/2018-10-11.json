M. C. markets are Michael thanks for the time I guess you could take your pick of the catalysts that have sparked the sell off what's standing out to you\nI think it's a combination of factors I mean I Know President Trump blamed the fed 'em in comments last night calling them crazy\nUm you know I think you've got to look ... off to the ... I think if you've got concerns about slowing global growth which the IMF outlined earlier this week concerned about the effect the terrorists have owned companies profit margins going forward with hunting season\nStarting in the end and at the end of this week and also obviously political instability with respect to Italy um relationship with the European Union\nThat doesn't really make for a particularly positive backdrop full risk appetite and that's before you start talking about concerns about the rise of the donor wake her emerging market currencies and pretty much every everything else that goes with that so\nI think well than Trump has criticized the Federal Reserve while I think he needs to take a look at himself and his um his fiscal stimulus at the beginning of this year which is causing the fed\nFor early more aggressively than would have been the case say for example two months ago so I think it's a combination of factors\nSo you don't see than the president's rhetoric which really is a ramping up considerably are causing the fed potentially to back off its path and gradual rate hikes [noise]\nNo I don't think this was a kid I think the president of the United states will be able to influence the Federal Reserve from its current policy of I'm raising writes gradually\nI Do think the rhetoric is somewhat unfortunate um but having said that you know I think they throw away the mold when President Trump became president the United states and this is something that was just going to think I have to get used to\nWell do you think then that uh there there could be some backing off from the trade rhetoric or if they if this continues to ah causes slide inequities [noise]\nOn doubtful about that because I think it would require significant change in tone only because the Trump Administration I think we have to might be minded\nTo running back Ray Rice if the stock market settle gained momentum of the moment for all the headlines that we've seen a about the extent of the center for the NASDAQ was still any backup levels that we saw in the middle of the summer\nI think the biggest concern is if they um they set off actually manifest itself into a much larger one certainly think European market so vulnerable you've got the ducks trading at levels all feeding January two thousand and Seventeen [noise]\nGo to put the one hundred trading backing levels we saw earlier this year so they sold it to the pay is nothing new knife and I just think there was a concern but maybe us markets could get hit harder\nPatrice thank you five fifty now on Wall street\nLet's bring Kristina Hooper she's chief global market strategist for invesco as a Christina we look to be pointed toward a a second day of a lower open on Wall street is is a global equity sell off continues a plenty of potential catalysts what do you use the causing this\nWell I think it's really a perfect storm two factors\nOff we saw significant spike in treasury yields\nThat's occurred really I'm a little over a week ago and that was a centrally stoked by a charity pals comments at the fed and they had a long way to go before finishing the rate hike cycle and of course any kind of significant spike and yelled tends to cause of rewriting inequities so that was the first culprit\nThe second is a growing understanding that trade is impacting the economy entering keep in mind for much of this year we've seen very much at an asymmetric reaction\nTo trade news positive news gets an overreaction\nNegative trade news how ... got an under reaction from investors and so that didn't seem sustainable um it finally has ended in that stock seems to have reacted to news that number one the IMF downgraded earnings expectations\nFor the longer term but also for two thousand Nineteen because of trade wars and tariffs\nAnd that number two we heard from one company yesterday fast and all that reference disruption to its North American supply chain caused by these trade wars so there's a growing understanding that this is actually impacting reality\nAnd that is a good point the reaction to news on the trade from because we have seen the equity markets slide ah whenever there has been an uptick in the rhetoric but I wanted to ask you about the uh the the spike in treasury yields we did see the tenure or touch three and a quarter percent it's backed down from there\nAnd you were looking at the the down said open nine to ... percent lower what's going on\nWell because it's more than just that ten year it's also concerns about trade and so while the ten year may have been the initial trigger to send stocks down last week it's more than just that and I think now markets are fixated on the implications of the trade wars\nAnd obviously that's I'm having a quite a drug particularly ON Technology stocks you see that continuing\nI wouldn't be surprised to see that continuing I think it's no coincidence that um in terms of geographic revenue exposure tax the tech sector has the largest exposure to revenues outside the U. S.\nUm interestingly utilities which have held up very well in this route have the lowest exposure to revenues outside the U. S. so that may be a factor at play\nDo we see ah the ah the supply chain shift if this trade dispute with the United states continues\nWe certainly could say that but we have to recognize that factories are and pop up tents\nAnd so this move can't happen overnight\nSo yes there could be a shift over time but I Would expect disruption first\nUh in fact the K ... Institute put out a really interesting piece a couple of months ago\nAbout the potential for disruption of the global such supply chain created by trade actions and it mentioned that in the twentieth century most of the company's production assembly took place in one location under one roof the factory floor\nUm has since broken through those walls and now span borders and ocean\nAnd so taxing imports today similar to a rectangle wall through the center of that twentieth century assembly line indicating production and raising costs in a similar fashion\nAnd so that's why this is so frightening is because we haven't necessarily been able to fully understand and comprehend how impactful trade wars can be but it's clear that the epicenter of this could very well be that global supply chain\nWhich are invesco cheap global market strategist Christina Hooper on a Bloomberg day break and Christina I got to ask you about the President Trump's injecting himself into this debate a pretty forcefully seeing the fed has gone logo what's your take\n[laughter] well that may have helped emerging markets currencies because they've held up quite nicely ah and and it could be um expectation that we may see the fed take its foot off the accelerator\nAnd it's always bad to to mix politics with the fed 'em and so we could see some adverse consequences but actually it has been a positive in terms of standing the contagion in the last day\nSo do you see them to the uh the for perhaps has its foot on the accelerator a little too hard I mean the the talk from German Powell is gradual rate hikes and that's been the talk for quite a few months here\nWell has the right approach the problem is the fed is using two tools that one and it hasn't really acknowledge the power that comes with utilizing two tools to normalize at the same time\nBalance sheet normalization is incredibly powerful think about how much of an impact to we had 'em as it was occurring and so now that we are ... unwinding this great experiment that having an impact in addition to fed rate acts\nSo while certainly um they're being gradual and thoughtful with fed rate hikes I don't think they fully acknowledge the power of them she normalization particularly happening at the same time\nWe're getting to be the start of earnings season here what are your expectations moving forward\nI actually think earnings will be solid um we've certainly seen 'em a lot of companies down or a labor of buys\nA earnings guidance and in fact I'm Seventy five percent of companies had downward leave revise of those that have given some kind of earnings guide and so we need to recognize\nThat that while earnings are going to be strong they may be plateau going at this point however I expect them to serve as a ballast for the stock market fell off because they will be good uh and they will provide some level they should provide some level of support for stocks\nAnd and that's why I Love it I Would expect this rally to be this excuse me the sell off to be relatively short lived not dissimilar to the February sell off\nOr to just ... you see a bottom coming in the short term\nI I Would expect a bottom to occur within the next few weeks sooner rather than later most likely and it should be helped along by earning season\nThanks for this casino Hooper cheaper global market strategist foreign does go
