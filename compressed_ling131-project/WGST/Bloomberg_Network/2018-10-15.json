[noise] most of them than live more than thirty to\nForty years old so I have a hard time believing the medicine was really in her gr really man I don't know if you have any comments on that but I uh even the pharaohs\nI think there was one that lived to be eighty almost eighty but most of them die didn't or forties that ... ...\nI we have actually so that's a great question so I'm the worker village a you know it's a southern ... uh where mark leaner has been a excavating a they find actually workers that have a they broke a bone and it was splendid\nI'm so they were performing sort of you know surgeries are on on these workers when they injure themselves which goes to show\nThat there were not being abused or they were probably voluntary workers and ah they were being well fed and there will be taking care of so\nUm yes the lifespan was definitely shorter than ours but there are if you look at if you go to Cairo Museum UC statues of people there were definitely the older than

well aside from the descending passage way to the lower chamber is any of the pyramid underground\nAs I'm I'm Sorry it was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg ah\nOkay that's a great question so I'm a you know one way to marry the the the theory of a lot civilizations starting something in ... uh and then the old kingdom are Egyptians or a you know building on top of it is basically\nTo draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro was your name right yes so um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look\nOn on the pyramid itself on the on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is that walk that's not humor in stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of\nYou know allow for stone to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has seen you ate it is that the things that maybe there were shrines on the in the three locations and they were lying to you know the belt stars of uh Ryan a dating to therapy\nAnd then you know the old kingdom Egyptians came they basically built up your image on top of these shrines\nAnd so uh and the ... so what under the pyramid also you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks\nMuch older and when you walk into the pyramid uh you walk into the what's called the king shaver\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically to phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely something that's possible\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating conversation tonight here on coast yeah I loved\nIt thank you so much to me we've got a twenty
