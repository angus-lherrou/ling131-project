Eric ... ATF analyst for Bloomberg intelligence this has been the Bloomberg ATF report I'm Pam Fox\nAll right thank you Pam it's five fifty now on Wall street want to get some perspective on the fallout from that missing Saudi journalist for that and to look at the markets this morning we're joined in our Bloomberg interactive brokers studios by Bloomberg executive editors Joe Wise and tall\nAnd Tracy alibi ah Tracy let's start with you as a secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh we saw the uh the benchmark stock index\nAh in Saudi Arabia drop as much as four percent now it's a pair of many of those losses what investors looking for now as a these tensions sort of come to a head\n[noise] yeah well this recovery this morning seems to be driven by a that report from CNN saying that the Saudis will essentially changed their tune on what happened to take a shot in the ... they're going to say that his death was the\nResult of a botched interrogation I'm not entirely sure I understand the thinking there because the other report we're getting is that that mission or the change\nIn their story is coming from the actual king of Saudi Arabia meanwhile the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is the one who's really been driving those hardline denials so if anything it seems like we're starting to see a little break of dissent among the Saudi royal ranks can\nGet it is interesting to see these sort of conflicting reports come out a it is especially before we saw that CNN report President Trump was floating the idea of a rogue killers perhaps or being involved in ... disappearance Joe what does this do to the uh\nThe image of this or you know a reforming a crown prince this young crown prince who's come on the stage and Saudi Arabia\nWell you can really see the effect that it has in that conference that's coming up in a few days and all the people who have dropped out we've got more names just out this morning the c._e._o. Credit Suisse according to our reporting will no longer\nBe attending and you think about like what is the purpose of all of these conferences and there was the floated idea of an aramco IPO's they want to build this big\nTech city in the desert they would really like a lot more foreign capital it's pretty clear and when you see bankers and CEOs and of course uh you know media organizations Bloomberg being one of them are no longer attending this event\nIt really speaks to the toxicity at least at the moment of the regime no of course that could pass and maybe and three to six months or a week of the bankers we'll be back to doing business with Saudi but right now they're thinking yes there's a lot of money they're potential but that is just not worth taking it\nYeah and a jumping sure I just wanted to um jump off of what Joe was saying 'cause it it's really difficult to overstate the importance of Dallas in the desert or I was there last year and not only is that Saudi Arabia is opening party it was also essentially Mohammed bin Salman mine's\nComing out party if he will um he was there and you know glad handing all the executives he was taking selfies with all the attendees it was as much about him as it was Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYeah so what does this do overall for a NBS and for the cloud of the ... in the desert event I mean could this have a long term impact Joe\n[noise] I I've been here to Detroit and Tracy you know he was there last year so we're going to defer to trace aspect she has the right call him on\nA well I mean it's not good news is a when all these people who were clamoring for your money or just a year ago suddenly won't even attend your flagship event ah the question is whether or not of course they return whether there's a way for Saudi Arabia to somehow rehabilitate itself in the eyes of the world\nIt's interesting to me that that seems to have been the straw that broke out this is terrible that broke the camel's back I'm given that we'd seen plenty of bad behavior from Saudi Arabia before people seem to forget that they had allegedly kidnapped or essentially the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri\nHis last year of course there's the ongoing war with Yemen uh the blockade of cats are\nThere is a long list of bad behavior that foreign investors and governments hadn't been willing to overlook but now you're sort of getting these social swell a change in the norms I guess that suddenly make Saudi Arabia I'm no longer acceptable\nOr let's turn to the overall market picture Joe ... and it's all I Know you have but yeah there because we're we're seeing a futures contracts point to them honestly hire open as the S. and P. five hundred is in the midst of its worst month since August of twenty Fifteen what are you looking for from earnings\nWas if we get Netflix earnings later today and I think that's going to be a really important one because if you recall last quarter a lot of those big high flying tech stocks\nReally bombed of their earnings Netflix with one Facebook of course another Twitter another and then when you look at the volatility that we've seen over the last several weeks\nThe tech stocks have really taken it on the chin once again\nThere appears to be at least temporarily this kind of rotation under way in which investors have been selling the biggest winners of last year's a lot of popular hedge funds stocks of which Netflix of course has been one ah really among the biggest losers during this sell off\nSo we weren't going to really be watching closely to see what kind of momentum that Netflix has\nYou know Netflix is important in some sense to\nYou don't want to overstate it because it's unique in its business model in this situation unlike some of the other big tech stocks it's not massively generating cash flow\nOn the other hand it really is this sort of symbolism of the hope for growth at all costs and this idea that if a company can just grow like crazy then that's all it has to do and so in that way it really does reflect a lot of the tech optimism that's been embedded in the share so\nI don't think there's any question that that's going to be the big story of the day and what they say will sort of a you know sort of shade how people see a see the rest of the stocks in that area\nYeah and uh as we focus on tech after the bell we're looking at a couple of more financial earnings report\nComing out and just a couple of hours what did we learn from that sector are so far that will be important for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs later this morning just quickly\nWell the big banks are suggesting mostly things or find the economy's looking good credits looking good no real problems but of course with companies that Goldman Morgan Stanley going to be a lot more interest on trading and capital markets things like that and that is a highly uncertain wide range of expectations and so we'll\nFind out shortly what's really going on
