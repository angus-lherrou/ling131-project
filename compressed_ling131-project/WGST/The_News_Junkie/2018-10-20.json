letting it get started\nBy mice more does gum [noise]\nWell you know a rivalry is big when it is reference simply by wearing falls on a date on the calendar you know with special\nThat even when the schedule makers move it off that day you still refer to as the third Saturday in October well the calendar\nIs back aligned as it should be and thanks for the last eleven years so too has the outcome welcome to Rocky Top it's been a home\nFor the ... long time Alabama has made it still at home here in this rivalry not just in this location but back at ... stadium in Tuscaloosa for now eleven consecutive years do I hear twelve that's what the tide will be going forward today Welcome everybody I'm Chris Stewart\nAlongside Eli Gold Tom state run into controls\nA cast of thousands to be joining us very shortly but it is always nice to be up here when you got a few wins and then the hip pocket just to go\nNo doubt about it it's just been of course a series of streaks as we know bam a has now and is in the midst of an eleven game winning streak Tennessee though is the only team to of ever beat and ... seven times in succession and match happen then the series as well but a\nZero in on the good stuff but the Crimson Tide has obviously dominated this series of late and uh if you listen to the so called experts they should dominate again here today it's gonna be interesting to see what kind of emotional carry over the balls have after\nLast week's winner at Auburn but a nevertheless ah Alabama's the better team and one hopes that title will be able to prevail here today\nThere's that saying that the enemy of my enemy is my friend did last week for about three and a half hours Alabama fans\nCould pull for the power to the students the final whistle blew everybody went into Tennessee week mode AOL doubt or got about it but it is interesting when you look and I think it's five members minimum\nOf the Tennessee just the coaching staff might have been counting to support staff sure that have very direct ties to the University of Alabama\nA lot of people that will be wearing orange today have worn crimson in this rivalry over the years\nThey really have it's going to be a you know there are guys on the rosters who played for each other but again there have been some injuries that have taken that away we know about Jeremy Pruitt and coach from Chris lanky was at Alabama coach friend played for the Crimson Tide now of course on the coaching staff\nFor Tennessee Volunteers so there is a lot of crossover between these two teams hack my parking pass for today's game was in Alabama and I want to hear from where we parked the car so there is definitely a lot of crossover between these two organizations\nThere is indeed and you referenced the win for Jeremy proof squad last week in regardless of whether it was ... whoever it was it was a big when it came against a team that\nGranted not playing its best foot ball right now but he'd been in the top twenty five they'd been in the top in earlier this year it's already a signature victory for coach fruiting your number one here in Knoxville\nAnd people were waiting for that of course he's had total support a fellow formerly former coach now the director has been very vocal in his complete support for Germany pro it and\nHe is turning things around and and the different elements that make a team happened that discipline is there a Jared guarantee than all of his quarterback or you know last week the lights finally went on now\nDo they stay on and I don't say that in another way he was a pretty good quarterback\nAnd of course last week all of a sudden they could do nothing wrong against the Auburn Tigers so\nJeremy is got symbol leaving in themselves so that that's something you can do a defensive a prowess that he of course is known for has not yet to you know been transferred over\nTheir sixties third and scoring the fans they're forty seven yards given up in America there the numbers are fairly high still but\nHe's got to bring his own players in to this is a new situation but uh he's going to do just fine you know some of the coaches I did mention just sitting here to\nMy mind went blank there for a moment but the defensive coordinator for the balls Kevin Shearer\nPlayed tight end for ... uh we've been shouldn't will friend and Chris rum fun I mentioned the Chris Wink gee uh the titans coach Brian meter Myer was on the uh Crimson Tide staff a few years ago two thousand sixteen of two thousand seven teams so\nAnd it's not a surprise that the Jeremy would you know read the cookie jar some I mean he was here\nHe knows these guys were good and if he can convince them to wear orange well you know\nGod Bless them I guess it off they went\nThey did [noise]\nFrom Alabama's perspective this is the theme that\nDoesn't have to do anything extraordinary to improve on his seven overall record for no\nIn Southeastern Conference play the reality is Alabama will have to do a lot of things to help the balls for the seat in the eleven year streak decides got rolling one\nWould assume we we should tell all of our listeners if you've been looking at the weather channel and so on I did indeed rain earlier today\nRain until about ten o'clock ten Fifteen this morning\nThe rain stopped at that point and actually there's blue sky overhead now we just saw something very very bright sunshine begin to have the grid iron show\nOh weather is not going to be a factor the wind is fairly significant flowing from are left to our rights that could be a storyline as the day goes\nThe field as it magnificent shape the rain was not that hard\nSo it's not like you're talking about any standing water it's magnificently manicured so\nAh the playing conditions will be outstanding for both teams but you know the bottom line is even a ... Smith doesn't do much for mammoth today if any I of course are pulled the hamstring last week and a has not done any work during the week in practice but uh\nYou're right when I went to a combined with Jerry Judy and Henry rugs and then I Would assume Jay Leno wattle would be a ... the other primary receiver of ... D Yvonne take can't go\nUh it's tough to slow that bunch down a tendencies rushing defenses know better than sixty first in America so your hand off to Damien Harris to Joshua Jacobs a male all the rest of that\nLess dodgy Harris and Brian Robin some again statistically a all of that plays very much into Alabama's hands today\nThere's an old axiom that every\nDrive ins with the kick ... is a good Dr ... but if it's a punt the reality is Alabama's only put at one time in its last three ball games unfortunately that put last week didn't go great there's going to be a new look\nTo the Alabama play a game or a lot of conversation about that any way it looks like perhaps walk on my Bernie air is going to get the opportunity as senior\nPretty special for a young man if that is indeed the case to get his first opportunity to starting role\nIn a game of this magnitude\nYeah he's a a walk on and the transfer he played it eastern Illinois University but as you say he's from Madison, Alabama and a one to Bob Jones high school up there and\nBurn your is um if if indeed it happens or it could potentially be that you know and again let stressed that the coach has never come out and said here's watch going to happen right uh\nYou know they're watching practice you know we've seen beyond tape brown working in place of Leicester caught met the left guard but have we heard those words come out of mix tape in his mouth no you know we have not so it has been widely reported\nBy the state wide media so you know you have to wait and take all of that stuff with a a with a grain of salt until you actually see it down there but uh\nThere are guys you know the the team has looked at what happened to me are kicking game in Austin Jones started and uh then Joseph both of us took over a so the coaches not afraid to make changes when he feels changes are due\nAlabama in ... the today a match up as we said it's always special for the players it's always an important game the fans and I think than the ... of this is part of what makes this very very special yes we have are in state rivals but this one\nFrom a regional standpoint historically within the conference itself and even nationally is one that doesn't really have to take a backseat to anybody\nI Know there's been a lot of talk this week or you know is this still a viable rivalry I'm sure it is you know that's you know the I don't I don't think outcomes of games\nIf he can do this Memphis topped they've got some great running backs and of course Barry Odom um coached at that program as well and then the Nineteen Seventy eight Missouri teams that played bear Bryant in Alabama played himself that team is going to be honored today warn powers or coach will be in Colombia [noise]\nHe's not doing well Chris he's battling old timers\nMississippi State at LA issue the tigers [noise] taken on the bulldogs today they'll have a by week next week and then they'll take on an Alabama and much like the tide or at least the fan bases\nTrying to keep focused on the match up today because we know what that could be\nIf both teams take care of business today but frail issue the next task Mississippi State six o'clock tonight on ESPN\nOn ESPN it's in the valley it's gonna be noisy we know that LSU fans will pack that place Mississippi State presents a challenge because they're ranked we know how good Nick Fitzgerald is he's broken broken all sorts of records at that program and we of course we'll see him\nIn a couple of weeks as well but I think the interesting match up in this game Chris is what kind of defense will have a run to dial up against Fitzgerald this is a tough game for LSU and certainly might even be looked at is a tramp game LSU is beaten three top ten teams this year topped ten teams Miami Auburn\nIn of course Georgia they've catapulted into that number five swan and this is the Frank component that LSU his played this year and I've used is that several times with you all year Fifteen in ... when they have a one hundred yard Russia so they need a good ground game will see what they can do against Fitzgerald tonight six o'clock\nKentucky playing host to Vanderbilt the cat's five in one would become bowl eligible with a victory and frankly\nBrian a lotta years that's big and that's big enough for Kentucky but they have their site that much further than just a big bowl eligible as they host a three and four Vanderbilt squad tonight seven thirty eastern on the ESPN network\nYou know and I remember a couple of years ago you're absolutely right about that Chris when when when you and and you I talked to coach a\nCoach saving about Kentucky I Can't remember what year it was in the last couple of years when when Alabama played them he talked about that they were coming back he was very impressed with the program that coach scoops was building there in ... thankfully for coach scoops they were able to be patient because it took him a couple of years to get there but there are five and one\nThree in one in the SEC they lost that heartbreak her but\nThat that win against Florida earlier in the year really a ... is huge Vanderbilt is tough but they shouldn't win this game Kentucky they've got Snell right now he's just under seven hundred yards rushing eight touchdowns\nOr should be a good challenge for them Vanderbilt his almost beat Notre Dame there three and four but they've not want any games in the SEC there oh and three you'd think Kentucky should win tonight Kroger Field and that will be six thirty start to tonight sugar by the way to put up some pretty good numbers almost Seventeen hundred yards of the year\nAnd eleven touchdowns but Kentucky will go in is the favorite\nFlorida Georgia South Carolina and Texas A M all have by

little start just after three thirty locally two thirty in the central time zone right now back in Tuscaloosa, Alabama God's Country\nOur own Todd Robbins and Tyler watch their bomb Howard's victory grill there in Tuscaloosa gentleman\nI'll tell you I'd be the last folks to say good morning to you back home as you approach of the new now are there how are things that bomb hours already\nSo it's not bad here we are looking at this Illinois Wisconsin gain more snow was falling there was this phrase in October but we're ... reasons because of it is but\nBut here's the restaurant we got an I travel a lot of fans coming in to get a free game Neal and of course this is always a great location to watch a band the game here at Bob's victory grill a lot of great television he's got it in a restaurant of course right through it as always but ah yeah it's a a nice day just to lose it cloudy sixty five got some rain in the forecast so I'm\nReady to be indoors and watch the game and hopefully get ready to smoke a celebratory cigar afterwards\nThat would be awfully awfully nice Tyler watch the father still cause you to be on occasion you know you had the uh the joy of\nRunning through the here in Knoxville so to speak certainly as you scored a a game winning touchdown for the tide in this series and I'm just ah what's your perspective I Know I ask you this every year but I think it's worth\nSherry because we as fans know what the rivalry means to us but as a kid who grew up in Alabama had a chance to not only playing the game but also good immortalized at a painting about it\nPretty special I'm sure still with this day rolls around all the challenges\nYeah it's pretty cool it's the best seat in the ... stadium it's the only one that's not a strict cheek with someone else is in that church board in\nA ... and you heard Eli talking earlier about\nPerfectly for Kentucky if they can stay focused their business and against Vanderbilt you would think that they would be able to do that but they only played board awfully tough year week or so ago and if in fact he has any led down or is it just forced to be one dimensional invent that Vanderbilt defense can have a lot of success today [noise]\nYou've guy Kentucky invaded\nGoing at seven thirty eastern six thirty central on the SEC Network\nAgain you've also got I think one of the more interesting match ups as well with LA shoe hosting Mississippi State down in Baton Rouge still go with six central on ESPN the tigers favored in this one but again trying to make sure they don't look ahead to what by week or beyond is they take\nOn the dog's tonight you know we we mentioned it earlier and talking about the mental\nA belief of just thinking that you can win and that's what she was just playing right now they're more they're no more talented than they were last year or the year before\nThey're very talented but that's not to mean that they're more it's just the fact that they have bought into what's being asked of them they're going out and perform and a lot of people are anticipating the Mississippi State upset right here because of what they did versus Auburn a week ago but I don't think that you can beat the sale issue deep and it's just run into football I think you'll issue stand to have\nA lot of success today on both sides of the football I'll look for them to dominate this game [noise]\nMemphis in Missouri boy you gotta love college football uh\nTo to do this this vote with it given from the state of Alabama I'll put it that way you got a ... that really really water flip\nAnd watch it because ... they took a UCF to the to the wire last week and had an opportunity to beat the machine will beat him\nAnd Missouri we saw them a week ago their explosive on the open society of a lot of play makers on the defensive side as well and they need to rebound I mean this is a program that has won a lot in the last couple of years that they've been very mediocre Barry almost five hundred ... the last couple of years\nTrying to ah again give themselves a little bit of a push going into the back half of ... talking about Missouri but needing a uh\nWhen coming up they won't have a chance to one today taken a Memphis but trying to get above five hundred is they take on to the other tigers today all burned in old miss\nBattling as we speak and at last check in that when ... which had a field goal blocked on its initial possession to start the game has made to feel goals since the end they trail Auburn seven to sixty important as I said earlier when I was to talk with Brian House worth important for both sides for different reasons\nAnd don't miss in this football game they're they're riding high right now they have a lot of confidence coming into football game and all over and obviously struggling last couple of weeks but this is an illness defense that it's just that they're they're bad that they are really bad and sitting here watching and they give up and opening drop\nTouched down to all burn for a couple of three announced an hour's drive and again this is almost a battle of we really don't want to win why don't you all take it now we don't really want it either um you don't know what the mindset of the sovereign football team is right now but the longer they are able to stay in this game\nOr the more success that they're probably going to have an ... they're going to get more confident\nThat ball game again between the Auburn Tigers and the old miserable about midway through the second quarter Seventy six the tigers leading the
