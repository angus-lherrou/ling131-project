without any question\nIt's ... percent alcohol by by it also says point five to eight witness factor is that for the games [laughter] I prefer I prefer a hundred on a scale of a hundred for that

alone as soon as I saw blah blah blah got all of it now next we're going to go from the People's Republic of California\nWe're going to go to church land we're going to go to I'm Germany I injure private but Ali this is their October fest Mars inauthentic ovarian festival\nFestival logger so let me open this bad boy up here I can remember how this thing works here where the money\nThey make some incredible beers ... this this is a big one too by the way this is this is one pipe whoops there we go we've got some definite foamy head on that one\nWill pour that that is a giant now\nLet's talk about that momentarily on this particular beer 'cause I Do have some information on it\nBut very instead been celebrating the harvest with beer festivals since before the fourteen hundreds of Mars in his brood in March to be ready for the September and October beer festivals for October fest so let's say cheers on that definitely has a very rich amber golden color\nOr both on the nose very bread like flavor aroma ...\n\nPretty good delicious pretty Smoot yeah yeah they say medium to big body but I don't think so at all goes down so easy it really does get that honey ...\nYeah interesting almost a ... to ... if you will I didn't see what is the okay out by ... percent alcohol by volume and the idea was Twenty one\nAnd uh they followed district lines you got to say it again for me the rain who ... water barley mall top jeeze that's it that's it that's it take another sip on this\n\nVery nice All right now we're going to do something a little bit on the phone side here one of the tasting methods that I use selection methods of what beer that I should get what I should grab if I see a cool label or a funny name or something that grabs my attention I buy it well\nAt the north pole it was inspired by this famous line from a well known children's storybook and sent to set on his great but enjoying a hearty brew and we shall even though it's not winter\nYou'd never know what I mean it's like ah still summer here in the cigar city but many parts of the country starting to get a little chilly so we're going to open this up\nAnd it says ah let's see water\nA barley actually got different languages in here so it says one of our range of very special Christmas beers brooding England for the usa we all know of course that Santa's really from laugh land\nOkay whatever they say now this again is a Porter so let's talk about what a quarter rich\nOr poor is definitely a dark roast the Yale usually has some chocolate and that ...\n... this is I mean pitch black cheers on this and this looks like a glass of his press oh yeah\n\nThis is very very tame pretty good I mean I'd be used as like a four there is no bitterness students very very smooth and it's six percent alcohol by volume\nBut you never know it just doesn't\nJust very smooth it's almost I hate to say this is almost a little pedestrian\nLittle mundane I think it's ... it's more of a classic styles Porter I think yeah they also make some other beers called up bad health they've got the blackouts a very bad I'll seriously battles criminally bad health insanely bad health a lump of coal centers but\nWhich are again just made for winter says Richard warming I'll tell you what would probably be interesting on this if you warm this bureau\nServed that are maybe put a little bit of dollop of this and some warm coffee I could work you know or if you've got a little sore throat or a little sniffles you warm this up taking all those taste here [noise]\n\nYeah it's just nothing uh you know nothing nothing overly crazy I mean it's just not as crazy as a name yeah exactly so overall relatively pleasant or would I go and buy their sin consume this on a regular basis no\nWhat is it worth it to say hey we tried centers but why not winter Porter the answer is absolutely\nFantastic All right so we've got that now next up we're going to go to a beer that is from Belgium Stella I wa premium logger beer it is a name that is\nPretty well known I mean those are very popular beer been going for a long time so tell us about what you do about ... ... um well I\nVisited a brewery many

let's open it up let's give it a try you can never go wrong let's see here will open that bad boy yeah\nI think they're marketing Everytime I see one of their posters I Want to drink one job but they're marketing\nVery strong on the nose nothing special say cheers on that or we go we'll hit that and we'll take a sip\n\nYeah it's a it's a regular ... I mean again\nThis is for the craft beer enthusiasts they will be disappointed in this fear for the average beer drinker\nAnd the United states that maybe want something a little bit more flavorful than a butter Coors storm Miller a and an important beer this would be it a but again this is not going to be something where you're going to say man\nA lot of happiness lot of bitterness lotta flavor complaint you're just not going to say that but these are these are the most popular beers in the world they still sell more than anyone else and again when it's hot in the summer this is the kind of thing I Want a nice cool refreshing beer ... this is kind of it so very nice I'll take another separate this\nYou know it's funny Paul because as we taste some of these other beers that have a variety of hops that have a higher alcohol content some complexity the higher a international bitterness units when you go to a regular logger it almost is a relatively flat in terms of taste\nYeah your taste buds are kind of shocked you get all this flavored right intention you go back to\nLike where what happened I mean that's it [laughter] like I Need more Iowa next up I picked this up to this is a real big bottle of this is one pint six ounces six hundred and fifty mill leaders\nAnd this particular beer is from the great divide Brewing Company in Denver in Denver, Colorado establish Nineteen Ninety four to this is their smoked Baltic\nQuarter this is a very interesting smoked Baltic\nHer and the it's a dark ...

some sweetness I don't see any bitter\nTwenty four on the I'd be use I'm getting no bitterness whatsoever federalize orange or amber colored to it and by the way one of the cool things [noise]\nIs that when you buy this you know they don't have a six pack they normally you buy a six pack\nA you know beer comes with a six pack but for you into especially for Utah it comes in a twelve pack one

funky Buddha sticky\nTreats its blonde ale with vanilla and the second is funky Buddha key line pie flavor cardio when you think of Florida\nYou think of ... known crabs key line pie\nIs very interesting because funky Bhutto was bought by constellation brands yep about a year and a half or so ago nobody knows the sale price but I think it's interesting when you got a giant like consolation
