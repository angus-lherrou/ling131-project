you can say that the Christine Blasey Ford lousy Ford however you pronounce it that coming out after capital that that was the start this goes way way before that there has been an attack on men\nAnd on masculinity going back forty fifty years but it is intensified the last number of years with this contrived statement called toxic masculinity that all of a sudden if you are born a male\nThen you are born with a toxic masculinity gene in your body\nThat when you are born a mail from the time you come out of the womb than you are a future sexual predator your future criminal\nThat's how some of the ultra ultra left wing feminists the nut cases the whack a doodles that we're seeing on the ultra left these socialist lives that's exactly what we are seeing now\nAnd so we are seeing not only that but we have seen the intersection of political correctness\nWith now the war and attack on men let me give you a perfect example of Winston Churchill one of the great leaders political leaders in history one of the great statesmen of all time\nWent in the face of the German Nazi invasion he stood tall inspired instilled confidence of course it helped with the United states of America\nAnd other allied nations including Canada and the other allies but really the United states let's face it United States and secondarily Canada we came to save European ally that says there's no ifs ands or buts but he instilled confidence saying we shall never ever ever surrender\nWinston Churchill always with a cigar and the the whiskey in hand\nAnd what is amazing is that\nHe was very popular during the war after the war's popularity waned when he was out of office number of years later popularity skyrocketed there's no question that his popularity probably higher today than ever except when it comes to the whack a doodle ultra lives\nThat now seem to\nHijack the political correctness conversational maneuvers let me give you a perfect case in point\nX astronaut Scott Kelly\nHe and his brother astronaut Scott Kelly alpha male ... you're an astronaut you go to space in my estimation you're an alpha male when I was growing up\nIn the sixties late sixties early seventies I mean in Nineteen sixty nine I'm you know it was five six years old and I remember when men landed on the moon I remember Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin Michael collins Apollo eleven\nI remember vividly at my

T. plastic um depending on how many beers\nYou want to brew is pretty much at the same time as as how many for miners are going to need a ... kind of like retail a rental space it's what should be for miners are full\nThen you got to get another one um good problem have by the way it is a good problem here is a good problem when you have lots of it um but you're going to need some basic uh you know high drama there's you're going to need a bottle cap or a big spoon um and then patients or you\nGet a rush the hands of time you cannot no so what did you start making your beer the whole process takes about thirty days so you'll have your official brood day which is a usually three to four maybe five hours um\nAfter that you let your beer do its thing and just ferment I'm a you know to a certain temperature for a couple of weeks and then usually the bottle age or bottle condition after that you could also go into a keg which takes another week or two\nWell the nice thing about home brewing\nAs opposed to well first of all it home brewing is one hundred percent legal as opposed to distilling your own distilled spirits meaning vodka or whiskey moonshine\nAnd there's ... there's a couple of reasons for that but first I think probably the most important is health and safety right right yeah I was just telling you could you could ah really mess some people up like you know poisoning them\nOr you could well yourself up as well you make it like a bomb because I think there's two types of alcohol there's one ether alcohol and evil and one is deadly if I'm not mistaken correct yeah one of the deadly in one you can drink what am I okay right right and the key is you want to get the one that that you can drink it's okay but\nThere's there's much more a regulation and that's why you see these moonshine are is it's technically illegal but home brewing is legal and Jeff ... or correction counter Meyer the the master brewer\nA home brewing a hundred percent legal very different than distillation as we're talking about absolutely get that Mike nice in close I absolutely even closer absolutely much better or third time it was a jarring so a very big difference\nAnd uh what type of people are you seeing coming in is there any specific age range are is more men than women using give us an idea of who's coming in here to actually learn how to home brew\nUm for the most part it's twenty five to thirty five year old man and a little bit older I'm mostly people that have found that they either want to make a cheaper where they want to make something that they can't get it the breweries and they they want to have something seasonal for themselves so they can make\nFor each season for each day for each month or for an event or for a party they want to make there's they want to have their own thing going\nFor I think there's also something very cool and I think maybe a little bit a romantic about saying I'm a home brewer I brew my own fears where you have people at a party and you can sample some of their beers and people can actually be very proud of the offerings that they're serving absolutely it is you know I think there's something there's a there's a wow factor to that\nOh yeah you could address flavors you can do anything you want so you can make it a stronger as light dark heavy or you know barrel aged or whatever you like\nNow one of the people that we know mutually Phyllis ... who is a is known as Phil are blamed on the cigar Dave show my producer for many years now helps us with creative services\nHe is home roar and it comes in here purchases home brewing supply and he is he's told me he said I I finished very high I didn't win the award yet and of course I resident resident about it all the time\nBut the one thing he always tells me is that he loves to be able to experiment and try different things and I think that's probably the one commonality with home brewers is they want to try they want to have fun to hobby is making some grape here five years is that one of those ... are pretty they're they're off the charts\nThat ... so what makes a beer off the charts how does a whole were\nAble to be able to Bruce something to say that's off the charts what is it is it the ... and says it how they ... it's all\nIn perspective and personal taste you know I I like uh I like I'd be a some people hate him you know I'm not a big stout guy\nUh but that's awesome people ever drink so to make a chart you know that fluctuates right either you know is relevant to someone's taste I don't know how you could do that it's it's all personal taste\nBut overall what about the beer did you enjoy\n[noise] I'm probably the Roma the that that the clearing is to Chris Chris ... um the\nOverall flavor and you know it is the last ... did I think it was a a a mango or something like that in there and it was\nJust full of flavor and again there's no right or wrong so you could have five home brewers coming up with an I. P. A. everyone's going to be slightly different depending on what they put in and and and I guess the hops they use and the other ingredients so really it is it is a custom creation\nAlso their equipment in there Bruce style and\nHow they didn't specifically I mean the temperatures can change everything temperatures of fermentation temperatures of your mash everything can change in each brewer has different preferences based on what they want out of it so you can make a dry or you can make it a little more body can give it\nMore Roma by adding hops late you can give it a little bit more bitterness fatty hops really early so I mean each brewer knows what they like to know what they want and I mean there's there's great beer in every style every little bit is a little different but it's wonderful and its own way\nSo we have learned so far that before we even get into the science of brewing in home brewing before we go through the ... the steps\nYou need some key equipment and Jeff as you mentioned root canals fermentation vessel a fermentation lock a spoon is that the sample the beer while you're while you're making sure you got your taste what you're creation [laughter] it's like ...

that no\nOne of the things that you gentleman mentioned that brewing is all about time and temperature and as we learned in step to matching of the grains you basically steep the grains whether it's wheat or whether it's cracked barley in hot water between a hundred and forty two degrees and a hundred and fifty nine degrees and you both said\nTime and temperature that's all brewing is about it's crucial\nAbsolutely I mean if you if you don't go long enough it's not going to convert all the starches and then you're just going to have less alcoholic beer\nAnd if you go to long which isn't too much of a problem but you can start extracting slaves you don't actually want so\nNow or hour and a half as a temperature you one for the body are trying to find is really important to kind of nailed down and taking notes being sure you're you're repeating so if you make the same here again you can either not make the bad beer again or make the good beer again remember those composition\nBooks we used to have back in grade school where you write everything down they were kind of bound I Would say if you're going to be a home brewer that's a good investment to make because Everytime you make a batch I Would assume the exact amount the time the temperature so you could look back and take notes and say you know\nI liked that particular beer but let me try one degree more for maybe another few more minutes see what that does and then you hit that a ha moment where you get exactly the\nFormulation you're looking into brutal fulfilling I'm sure it is you add on [laughter] so when you brought your everything the exact same way absolutely have you know that I have an entire rest of your book full of just notation\nThroughout the whole process and that is guarded I noticed a very large fault as you walk in here and that is garden nobody's getting near there in fact there's there's patrol dogs right right around the secret service [laughter] All right so time and temperature\nKey elements in brewing now after you match the grains and you said roughly what an hour mhm okay what's the next to\nSpy urging which is basically a fancy word for renting the grains out politically or you need to rent that sugar out of the grains that you've converted the searches you convert into sugars now you're trying to rent solve those sugars out into another pot or\nTake the grains out of that pie and rent the sugar side of the grains you just want to separate the grains from the show so you want the sugars up you know you want the sugars in so that you can use that to boil oh so you want to share a tragedy just remove the grain\nOh so once the grain is done you don't need it anymore I don't know my understanding is that many breweries when I was up at shipyard brewing they told me that uh they sell the remnants of the grains to various farm so they had continuous reviews in the area\nYeah you can make dog biscuits out of it too and I'm sure as\nMy chickens love it they'll go crazy after a while and then they'll they'll gorge on them\nSo it's like a dry just becomes like when you try it out it's just dry up it's pretty empty of any nutrition but it's just ... there's chickens like it and do you like that or compost compost is another alternative okay actually a here have a a amend Emanuel we give our grains to for his coats really mhm\nSo basically there's no waste whatsoever constant recycling that's it All right fantastic so far gene you are reducing the sugar out of the grains you're getting rid of the grains your retaining the sugar and the water ... which is called war was Wu or team now\nWe have actually sampled the war and when it's warm ... tastes pretty good it's like it's the way she said it was like a sweet tea rain T where we're at a did even brewing and ended up Mike Brian said try as I said boy smell was incredible\nYou could actually make a tea or a soup out who it was actually I thought it was just drinking in of itself we we\nBottled a couple of bottles of a I'm a black guy PA and it tasted just like a stout a non alcoholic style because it doesn't have any alcohol in it um so it's yeah it's pretty good stuff\nSo the word is basically the ... the sugars with the water\nOr after you have matched the grains so the ... of the sugar out and then you create the war and that's going to be the base of your beer absolutely okay so that's you're basically that's your stock that's your your ingredients right there that's the that that starts the process so now that you've got the war\nWhich usually is tastes sweet got these sugars in there you next go to the boiling component was boiling do\nWell boiling does a couple of things that sanitize it it evaporates things that you don't actually wants to know jazz\nJust feels so things just things you're not actually going to need or just evaporate and also evaporates water source condense is it so you have a stronger sugar solution got stronger war yes gotcha also what it does is as you add hops throughout the boil the heat and the temperature actually", "show_name": "The News Junkie", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "13"}
