diseases\nWelcome once again to help line by purity products on your host marks the most so glad you joined us today it's a power pack program in fact our story originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated\nAudiences around North America with a special segment on the French paradox\nYou remember the French paradox this is the counterintuitive concept that says red wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health in by Taliban scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best aggravates genes that control our weight\nOr energy healthy aging and even longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was was there a troll yes ... the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nOur guest today says that's just half the story so here the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce for over Twenty years Dr precedent is an institutional New York radio host in his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a longtime product formulated and high level advisor for purity products jak your freshman\nWelcome aboard mark always great speaking to you\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's touch them as long as we're as we're also nominate those people out there who just to vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is ... ... why is it all over the news today\nWell first of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals a week and every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically reservoir troll is what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine that's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found and peanuts\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation and the scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when raspberries role was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got although scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish well anything that extends the life of anything is going to get the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well\nBy two thousand six Italian scientist discovered that resveratrol extended the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex\nAnd here's what really got them interested a Harvard researcher David Sinclair reported that resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice by thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon definitely supported normal and semantic activity in the body it improved in Torrance\nIt was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved endure and storing aerobic activity and it even proved to support brain function\nGreat study from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading at an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived health threat like not eating enough caloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they call the longevity gene in your body it switches on a sort of a protective mechanism that gets on a secular level but capitalism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's dictate according to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard now this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening in all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years under co Q. formulas but now that feature co enzyme Q. ten would you say is just as important as residents role especially your heart health and you also say in some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs ... ... what exactly is good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak or what our co enzyme is a co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects\nWell Cokie ten is the new trend that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's awhile ago while I was teaching for the first time and physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heart the well they found out that was co Q. ten\nAnd that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell wins himself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nSo we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of co Q. ten and your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten you're living in what we call an energy deficient state your heart and he's co Q. ten\nIn fact the highest concentration of ... in your body is right in your heart muscle\nYour brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system it supplies energy to your lungs to your liver\nSo needless to say we all of this energy that case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty you've got less than fifty\nPercent of the co Q. ten and your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential\nMore

deficiency with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine well I mean that's a lot of people now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin D day of bone and bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy colon on top of all of that and a great new study out of the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and cold and health\nI mean who thinks that those things right\nYeah that's amazing so
