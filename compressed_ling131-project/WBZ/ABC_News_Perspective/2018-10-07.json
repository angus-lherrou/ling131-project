{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WBZ", "content": "But we always stress the fact that you need to have diversification you know it doesn't necessarily when in bull markets but the idea that diversification also doesn't lose as much in their markets\nSo so if you're never winning ... if you'd never hitting home runs but he never striking out that's the whole idea that's the beauty of diversification and it was frankly right now you know ... with with us stocks as high as they are you know they're no longer bargains I mean it's like I can actually you know I can buy the international markets on the cheap right now\nAnd so if you constantly rebalancing sell some of your winters to buy losers sure and then that just kind of helps buffet you when when you know when storms and financial storms come so\nIt's good to know why it's happening but it's also good to know it's a good reminder as to making sure that you are well diversified because it could be a buying opportunity like it is right now according to these metrics but also to make sure that this has said that you're you know you're never uh never taking it all on the chin when bad stuff happening\nWell that's the thing is if you look we always talk about if you want to get on our week remark to report first of all go to S H P financial dot com when you go there you can get we sent this report every Tuesday a market ... ... you know something about the market also a recent copy of our radio show and some other information\nThere's no charge just go to a stage ... financial dot com newsletter sign up and you can sign up right there and I think it this woman was saying about like diversification I feel like it brings me back to the conversation we had earlier with losing Steve in that couple that we were working with\nWe always tell our clients had I'd much rather you'd be mad at me because the market's up twenty five percent and you're only up Seventeen percent than to be mad at me because the markets down forty percent and so are you so diversification if you if that maybe if you want to hit home runs and and try to double your money every couple of years would definitely not the right from for you\nBut if you're looking to kind of reduce exposure as you get a little bit closer to into retirement\nThat's a huge thing and that's what I'll say going back to the same story if you don't know how much a lot of people listening don't know what type of risk they have\nIn their portfolio of you know what if you're the skill of one to a hundred one being all your money in a bank in a in a hundred being all your money in in the in one stock that's risky do you know where you stand overall do any idea I guess the question do you want to know that something that we can run for you run a risk analysis of your portfolio\nTo make sure you where you should be to make sure you where you feel comfortable especially if you're close to her in retirement\nSo give us a call we're happy to do that the number is eight hundred to two seven Seventy seven Seventy seven again that eight hundred to two seven seven seven seven seven or go to S.

H. P. financial and our retirement road map podcast you can you can subscribe to it\nAnd you're listening to all of our past shows current and past\nAh for you know maybe if someone I Know it sounds bad if someone's that something desperate right keep him as someone has to listen to us maritime hopefully we provided a few good I guess here and there are any ways Keith for that being said what was your number one takeaway on today's show\nAs part of our process and our retirement planning a program here we focus on the back end of it which is legacy\nAnd I know attorney McManus touched quite a bit on it earlier\nHow important it is to work with someone understands you know your state and\nWhat you've created who's dealing with a couple of this past week they came into our office they had just created in state plan and they had been where they ... they were working with another advisor and they took their ... or one didn't know you know what the estate planning was how was executed or how to execute it and then to fund\nThat a state planned so it's so important to work with people that are knowledgeable in all facets of retirement not just investments\nGood point Keith how about yourself man and just to stay on the same theme of diversification you know we talk about tax diversification planning diversification kind of what keeps talking about and then also an investment diversification\nYou know here's this align when I read from a report that we had recently diversifying globally implies investors portfolio may not be the best performing relative to any one market but it also means means it may not be the worst performing\nIn other words when you have a diversified portfolio it it doesn't you know it's not the best performing in a bowl but it's not the worst performing in a bear and that is extremely important as you enter retirement\nAnd that's something we see all the time and the first meeting with our clients I let them know hey we think it's okay to reduce your upset a little bit meeting maybe in a really good year you're only going to make twenty percent and not thirty percent\nBut in the trade off maybe in a really bad you're you're only going to lose ten percent instead of thirty percent or whatever the numbers are so we feel like if it's for folks that come to us you know we're going to mix different um portfolios and different instruments you know both market in non market to try to get our clients the best overall risk adjusted return\nBut most of what we're dealing with is trying to take on a little bit less volatility as you get closer to retirement and more importantly in retirement\nAnd my final take away is the story of Stephen Liz [noise] and I know they came into her office in a while back and their clients but when they first came in\nThinking about that he was four weeks from retiring in retiring for the you know he did not want to go back to our trust me in his wife Liz did not want him to ever have to go back to work they want it to be able to enjoy retirement\nThey had an advisor for twenty something years and there are retiring and for weeks and there was NO PLAN in place they were just ... the only plan was yeah we'll send you money when you need it there was no written out plan\nAnd they were at the point where they had said one point five million and they had enough as long as they didn't take a big hit\nAnd so I think I might be Warren Buffett I'm not sure who I heard this quote from but I Love it and that's it's crazy to risk what you have in order to obtain what you don't need to think about that and I just want to tell a lot of people coming to our office as of late 'cause that's what people are doing\nThey're risking money to try to get from one million to two million or two million to three million but don't even need to get to that level to Khattab a comfortable retirement so it's an it's crazy to risk what you have\nIn order to get where you don't need so Steven Liz\nThey came in we built them a obviously a plan that gave them a cash flow that they needed to cover their goals and dreams which for them was to get her motor home\nAnd travel you know travel around the country and different parts of the world during retirement and then have enough to cover the bills that was their main dream\nAnd so if you haven't taken care of your dream planning or an overall plan or you're not sure if you're retiring and the next three to five years and you ... there's NO PLAN in place from where your income going to come from one of the tax Irma F occasions as there is an estate planning all these things that have to be thought about retirement\nTake advantage of what we've done this or we we built our from around the ability to help people like you all used to do on urine to take some time pick up the phone and give us a call we have offices and brain tree Westboro we're in Hyannis in Plymouth mass\nCalled eight hundred to two seven Seventy seven
