H. P. financial and you'll see the retirement road map podcast if you want to subscribe to it and listen to past shows or listen to shows as they come out each week feel free to do so if you don't want to do that and you just want a quick recap\nOf today's show what the most important parts of it were as it pertains to you and your retirement we're gonna leave you with our top three ... takeaway is right now ... what was your big takeaway\nEarly in the show we talked about following the retirement rules and first one was you know as you start to into retirement\nDo you think about adjusting adjusting your mindset adjusting to the fact that you're not going to be saving money any more but you're going to start to be spending and also it's a nice adjustment in regards to your mindset because now you you don't have to work right you can enjoy\nYour life so it is a big step forward when you do retire in regards to the adjustments that you go through assuming assuming you're spending will go down you know when we build plans for folks that's where we assume and chances are whoa you know with the cost of living and things like that going up as much as it is\nIt's important to plan is if you you know your what you need now is what you're going to need then and go up\nPrepare for alternative sources of income remember people back in the you know my parents and things like that they have pensions to rely on they've Social Security to rely on so many retirees are coming in now a days saying I have Social Security and I've done a great job saving how\n... how ... how do we how do we make this all work so you got to really think about using your assets to supplement in and provide income for you in in retirement no your nest egg no the amount of money you have in the type of money you have from attacks standpoint and when you should draw on each bucket and why\nAnd then the last thing is build a plan for your retirement don't go into retirement and what we called wing it you know you plan for vacations hours weeks at a time he used to spend more time planning the retirement than you do your next vacation\nStuff teeth and just to kind of piggyback on that I mean sometimes you know tell people a story about how you know if you ever sat down for a job interview right and then the person that you know your new boss said you know Derrick Keith don't worry about it you know to just work here and are just call me if you need a paycheck\nAnd it's like no you you wouldn't be you know I'd like I'd like to know exactly what I'm paid for this job and take the bus like no no no no don't worry about it you know to just call me if you need a paycheck and it's like people are entering retirement in similar fashion\nWhereas you know now that their their monthly income to build or do they need money and if they have a plan sometimes it's as simple as oh yeah call me if you need money\nAnd I don't have a plan they don't know where that paycheck is correct so it's like look if you wouldn't take a job without certainty as to when the next paycheck is coming in where it's coming from\nWhy would you ever retire with that same amount of uncertainty so you know keep for rules are five rules is kind of what that builds up to and just want to remind people that you wouldn't take a job like that so you wouldn't be entering retirement either\nIn a in the best time to build an implement the plan is when you don't need it it's before you need it so that you can get ahead of it so [noise] so whatever you're doing right now I guess I Want to ask you you know what is money mean to you and what's important in your life right now\nAnd what really matters to you at this point in time as you are getting ready to potentially retire and the upcoming future [noise]\nYou know we have we ... we share the story earlier marking Karen in and they were in a position where they had a an advisor they had a portfolio but they had NO PLAN in place there's a big difference between having a portfolio of stocks bonds mutual funds compared to an actual plan\nSo when they came in they had NO PLAN they had way too much risk in their portfolio and they were paying high fees when they left what they had was a plan that the ... the risk was reduced substantially because they're retiring and three or four years\nThey had they had a a place they had a plan of where their income was their paycheck was in come from mass and they weren't wing it they knew where their income was going to come from\nThey were able to reduce their fees there are paying and they were able to build a full retirement roadmap plan\nThat looked at income planning investment planning taxes health care and legacy\nSo think about where you are right now think about where mark and Karen where before they came in\nCompared to how they feel now and how they have a plan in place going forward to retire confidently if you if you're like Mark and Karen where they were a few months ago where they had NO PLAN in place didn't have any basis for how they were going to retire if they can retire how much can they draw from and you want someone to help build that out for you\nThat's what we're here to do it we've been doing it for over Fifteen Years and we're happy to help you all you have to do on your end just pick up the phone we have offices in Plymouth Westboro we're we're in Hyannis and brain tree\nSo call right now you folks standing by right now to take your call eight hundred to two seven seven seven seven seven to say you want to complete retirement romantic
