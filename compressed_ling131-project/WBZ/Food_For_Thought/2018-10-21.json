hundred and forty whiskey send brown liquor is a really popular\nAnd very dynamic I mean there's just all is they're not the same every one is really different I mean we can go from Jack Daniels all the way up to uh the whistle pigs which I absolutely adore ...\nI Will kill citizen studios well from a Jordan Company or will you started in the business at Fifteen and where and how\nIt's actually funny I mean I think that there'll be someone joining us with from the north end at some point here but I was a Fifteen Years old and I started working at a restaurant called mark who she is\nIn the north end or with Chuck Draghi who's now at ... oh yeah and uh I Would take the train in one day a week from after I got out of high school and I would come into Boston I'd worked for Chuck can I just was a sponge and I just learned all\nAnd you know that was Boston pre bad the expressway coming down I have a pretty big big yeah and like I just you know wandering into the city and are finding my way through all this stuff and experiencing restaurant life for you know what I think people\nUsed to write about in a way Anthony Bourdain wrote about you know it was cut throat crazy not not the environment that I think the kitchens are the ending I run now which are definitely much more can you know\nI'm just kidding well that is where did you start\nA so I worked at the pillar house of you know the pillar house out of one twenty eight or ... when he root sixteen and need a Mr Larson actually I'm going to see him in a couple of weeks I'm very excited so\nIt was a great experience chucking oysters are inter met those you know scooping a sorbet a member of member cardinal all used to come into law by a really big deal and he had astro turf on in the kitchen which I thought was super cool\nWow boy that's a sign of its time huh astro turf in the kitchen I'm yeah I'm always fascinated especially in this town this has\nBecome such a restaurant capital in the country it wasn't always that way you know they used to compare us to New York compare us to Chicago but Boston and I think it's the results of a lot of guys like yourselves has just exploded over the years out what was your first restaurant of your own anti\nA trim on six or seven which but in Nineteen Ninety six and on your point if you think about it in the mid eighties you know we had ten restaurants that were really good you know the ... all of 'em was Jasper ... and then the way I like to think about is that all those restaurants had children\nAnd so then we got the nine parts to trim on six or seven of go on from there and then they had children so now we have I Would say eighty hundred restaurants that just depends where are you in Boston and I'll tell you a great restaurants yeah we have such a great eclectic restaurants\nAnd I think that the one of the things that makes Boston except you know kind of separate itself out from other cities in the country is\nMost of us are friends with one another yeah this isn't like a ... a ... super competitive you know business from our side I mean it's a lot of like how do you do this how does your business work like I Want to know because for us it's kind of power in numbers you know sure we might get to a point of saturation which were probably you know slowly rolling up on right now but\nI mean I think that that's one of the things that is really great when you look at any of the charity events that were a part of you know both you guys wrote to share our strength one you know that's a bunch of people all working together to a common good and I think that that's what we do so well here and it's not necessarily the ego it's about helping\nYeah yeah I'm Glad you brought up the camaraderie among all of these guys in the Boston community while the New England community uh basically uh you know I Am in a unique position where I'm asked to host a lot of fundraisers you just mentioned share our strength which was a great of and by the way\nI so I get to see all of these guys at work\nAnd I see first hand how it is a legitimate camaraderie you guys you don't feel like an angry competitiveness between each other and you know I always see Andy walking over to your booth or everybody kind of exchanging ideas and menu items what they're serving that night so we are\nUm you know I've got two amazing boys I'm twenty eight twenty nine I'm a but probably celebrating the ... anniversary twenty five years is um probably what's amazing you know this week\nNATO quickly do you have something special going on for the twenty five year

I mean first of all from growing up I mean I go out very sheltered I thought everybody with a talent and so like when I Know and then um and there was only like six or seven restaurants had growing up in the ... and the north end at the time but then in Nineteen Ninety three when we open tire\nMe on the kind of changed the way I think people ate in the north end because we weren't doing Italian American food it wasn't spaghetti and meatballs chicken ... chicken pox and there's nothing wrong with that for nothing wrong with that it's delicious we surveyed ... but we were just doing something different\nSo people just would come in and say you know look at the manual go oh gee let's try something new or they just walk away but I mean it even from that point\nIt's more restaurants like tearing me started opening up and I think we kind of change that\nAnd so I'm curious about when the when the highway came down 'cause I always felt the north end was disjointed this kind of secret plays the cutting you had to make a trip to now it's just part of Boston how did that change everything\nYou know I used to call that a highway the expressway I used to call it but not green monster because liberated us from Faneuil Hall Haymarket and you know ... or city hall that separated us from the whole area of Boston\nWhen it came down during the construction was a little tough because people aren't coming into the neighborhood run once it came down it it it was like the Berlin Wall coming down at United everybody you know when it was just everybody you know coming over from Quincy Market Faneuil Hall and the north and the ... actually got much more busy some\nAntique for now you would say is a more simple menu old school to tell him versus Sarah ...\nYeah ten years like old world classics kind of you know with you know combined and you know with today's you know American palate you know more of I'm just like a more upscale menu", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Food For Thought", "city": "Boston", "day": "21"}
