from those mines all the rails and\nAnd palate is evolving evolving I'm I'm All right and here's the big question and the big Alice in the room key we think that I Would ever be going down this morning design five years ago even four years ago I I wasn't going there my brain just wasn't moving in that direction like\nUm I I've had conversations with you about how you're not going to go in that direction and it but every project that you do is getting cleaner and cleaner and cleaner and in some ways I think better it's a we called\nTransitional right on right on ...\nOr is or what everybody likes to hear and transitional is traditional mixed with modern a little bit but we're ah but yeah it's it's here to stay it's every customer\nI don't want to try and do you think this is here to stay so Palin would not be putting all this money into manufacturing windows up in New England and in pushing him here in the New England states if they didn't think this is going to be something that was gonna stay\nTrends change Thirty years ago we were we were started post modern architecture crazy circular played in things and who would have thought that that would disappear as fast as it did and it's gone so now\nThe Jetsons right that you had him ... show and one number the Jetsons right that's futuristic it's probably two thousand Eighteen the Jetsons but\nThe other one thing that we haven't come up with that that they had are not the flying cars around the corner we don't have a face it we can put on our phone rings and our faces made up and he has done right and we go\nBehind him go Hi this is Cindy what are you doing oh Trish I'm doing nothing\nHow are you and everybody looks really pretty I Want one of those okay at all times but I guess that I Would say that modern architecture is here to stay because it is it's where we're late to the game in New England\nWe I like the game but remember in Steve you'll remember the project I did a wall to grow up in his home\nOkay that was a flat roof modern home\nWe did that about Seventeen sixteen Seventeen years ago and I was like oh God look in the old um Martin while to grow up his home the kids' bedrooms looked like an accordion language that they got like a little room with a twin sized bed and that was his beliefs that children get these little compartment rooms\nAnd then we expanded it but we have historical board the landmark for the at everybody in our back if you guys did a great job on the windows or the windows are perfect like just like they look back on the day when that home was built no but okay what about power\nWell we're seeing the same kind of things that we were late to the game in New England in Palo saw the trend probably several years ago and started working on this new the new product line but a couple of product lines but in general in the contemporary side\nUm the whole idea of just more glass and more fix glass an oversized window units both are indoor units were now making products that are\nFlooding doors with five by tenfold panels was kind of stuff from an engineering standpoint there really wasn't available um that many years ago and now we're seeing just this was like well this is what people are calling for is just\nMore glass and less venting stuff even in New England air conditioning is kind of taking over it's just the um the design of houses is critical and some of the performance issues come into play after the fact\nYou know no disrespect to Boston but it's just like clothing to you guys dressed very Brooks brother's polo Ralph's around and look at both you guys but as a fashionable president like fashion you go to Barney's in Boston and you go to ... in New York or bunnies that you know desire in Florida's are in Boston the by is\nBy different you know I think they think when the stone ages ... and they were in New England like we have no taste like were behind the eight ball at all times and whatnot people would not behind the eight ball\nOkay so Steve I'm an ashes question there are so many places to spend money when you're planning a construction project why should anyone care about putting the limited project money into a quality window product\nSure um you know there there's a lot of places in the ... seem like they're just more sexy spots to spend money whether it be kitchen design and finishes and lighting and places like that that are just they're more fun places to spend\nTo spend the money um but they're also places those are places where the design trends change even faster and you can change those products out in five or ten years people redo their kitchens in ten years\nUm was not unusual nowadays and a new home where's the windows and doors are no one's ever going to want to change its an expensive proposition to change them so putting them the money into a quality product on the front end is just a more sensible place to spend the money during the early ... you know during the initial construction project\nAnd wouldn't you agree there is a difference for me cheap window trip Palo window\nSure I mean there's there are significant differences between you know between um you know quality products different material\nAnd I'm usually she 'cause I didn't want knocking based products okay but there is a difference when a windows half the price of the pillow and now we're not just paying for label here okay hold that thought I'm ...\nAnd you're listening to talk of his nails on WB the news radio ten thirty and we'll be right back to figure out why you should spend a little bit

okay today would you agree yes for sure most people are replacing windows ... will do and not doing anything no no we modeling just replacing windows because the windows of old so let's talk about two things one what is replacement windows\nHow does it happen this hormone called Palo windows and say hey I Want to replace on my windows or do I need to get an architect if they want to replace existing which there had his palate handle that\nWe've got a couple of different the divisions we'd go to a division of cells directly in provides intelligence services\nTo a um you know to the consumer\nThrough our a replacement division and we provide a you take full responsibility both of them from the measuring and the seizing the consultation process to work with uh the homeowner on the on the project and then we also have a certified contractor program as well if they're doing additional work or other work on the house and more work with a\nA remodeling contractor there can be on the other parts of the job or just replace windows okay so\nI have a question here let's say the window size you have today doesn't fit exactly what they have they're going to need some type of rental guy to come out there right but I'm sure had a bigger make this space bigger or smaller they tempted to to their that happen\nSometime yeah I'm In a lot of people like any other kind of remodeling project some people want to make alterations size changes or design Shane\nOkay so then we need a guy like McKay\nThan we often will know situations will counsel them to bring in someone like an architect to help them make those kinds of decisions\nSo would you find a lot of people just go no I just want my exact size replaced and I don't want to get into any bigger than that\nIt's for sure what it is is that is the largest portion of the market in in the greater Boston area is is more farmer windows being sold those replacement products that are being added into a new new construction and that's a big division enormous part of the business or the largest market share opportune only a ... in the market you know replacement window\nAnd you guys offered the guys they come in they do other place in the whole package apply and then these guys put it in starting to get everything then saw the purchase everything's down with ...\nWhich I think it's great and people need to know that and the headaches off them in the headaches totally on you guys like my question to you as renovation\nAgain we modeling that's what most people joining in not in the building massive homes are being ... new homes or whatever you want to say they're adding on let's see houses built in Nineteen ... in the fifties and you don't even know when do they use now you put this new addition on new master family room whatever you're doing and I had to get these beautiful winters\nHow one would you advise them to match them somehow to if they had the budget let's look at the numbers to replace your old when does it make the whole house match what would be how would you compensate with the with Mr Mrs Jones on this\n... at least a third of our work [noise] excuse me a third of our work is renovation a would do a anywhere from a small mud room addition to a two million dollar renovation we just we just finishing up a very large restoration of a house and we\nAlways try to have the budget enough money in the budget to replace the windows because this is the time to do it it's invasive it's I'm so we're we're always recommending that when we sit down with a client if it's a two hundred thousand dollar budget and we're doing an addition\nDoesn't really leave a lot for the for the Republican and ... if they can't came and we ... we can match to like I Know ... all different types of like if it's a painted wood window existing when those painted double Hong\nHow has the ability to do a painted window where a lot of other manufacturers might just be the final clad that might you know it looks like an addition then we're ... we can we have the ability to do our work and then at some point in time they can match up that can replace their windows and and that does happen a lot and\nAnd my my personal opinion is when I drive by random job I I Know I wouldn't call it a rental job I'm a talk just complete edition the window scream to me like wow we don't match here we're new it's two thousand Eighteen and over here in Nineteen fifty\nI'd rather cut back on something on the inside make my decision smaller have my whole house match the windows hundred\nPercent I that's what we tried to do to sometimes sometimes it doesn't work and the sometimes the addition the bedroom with a family room or the the kitchen addition is more important than they'll catch up with the goal is always to have everything be cohesive but\nIt doesn't always work out when I was were so when it doesn't you find a way to make it all work\nYeah and it in the replacement you know having the opportunity to not have a have a wood product matching would I think that's probably the biggest comparison if it's a a fifties colonial there was there's no vinyl products out back then so it's a everything was paying great it's paint great so we would try to match that up\nAnd you can buy tank re windows still today obviously yeah so you you would go with paint grade with paint grace\nMake it match so you would not go at the vinyl clad window on the outside with the existing being paint grade correct of the older home okay we were talking earlier about a transient got this new modern line coming out\nIn the percentage of what you're selling right now in this year okay from January til now what's the biggest selling window in power\nFor ... traditional products because the only because of the market is so I'm Still largely driven in New England a it's a replacement window business is is a huge part of the market but a new construction\nYammer rapidly seeing things at him like venture the just the transitional designed type of thing somewhere in between true you know a colonial traditional host to a more modern house we're seeing I'm a very traditional farmhouse kind of fundamental shaped till the structure but\nWith a real simple a more contemporary product used in that design\nSo which do not leaning more true even new construction you're telling me we're still not more traditional\n... is a real world is somewhere in between uh with more contemporary stuff is being built brand new but more traditional look to a traditional ... I'm Sorry a contemporary look to a traditional style house\nAnd when you when we say contemporary so my listeners can understand does that mean like all glass just all glass no mountains but what does that mean when you say Martin windows two poodles cleaner\nLines cleaner paint lines are just more simplistic a more simplistic details\nAnd what that means like what is that what one would see the kinds of live on our\nHouse that was built um when I started would have been a six over six colonial window that six lights over six lights\nRight how much ... there's a question of how much of that still getting sold six over six for over forty on much\n... as far as designing I Would say that still fifty percent of your business five percent five percent ... percent because the client every kind as much more educated today in terms of the choices in what what's available you know before it was magazines now it's\nYou know the ... the social media to the show to me", "show_name": "Cindy Stumpo is Tough as Nails", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "21"}
