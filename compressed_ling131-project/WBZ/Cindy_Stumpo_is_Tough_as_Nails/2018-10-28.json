I'd say one o'clock in the morning\nIn Nineteen Ninety three artists are the first in about what I Am where what city were you born into\nA new a new world was messages the hospital was new Wellesley is what he's saying the city was needed knows\nWhere what state is that in\nMassachusetts see I'm new to all those David most of our major but uh yeah I've been trying to get me into this and I'm very curious so far from what I've learned\nWell it's definitely a you know it\nShe's more ... takes her time emotionally needs to like make\nIt out in the bag I hear you on hold back on um city sampling and listen to his nails on WB news radio ten thirty and we'll be right back with David I'm Sorry we get to have to commercials\nSponsored by the window sill bluebird there's always convenient wait let them into your home and water spot by our dente supply designer and letting hardware and plumbing fixtures discount prices\nThat evening I'm Sherry small WB the news to our top story now the worst of the nor'easter to hit the bay state is over but there are still lingering when some rain and those power outages to deal with the ... the debt cope in Marshfield Doug what are you seeing their\nWorld sharing the storm is winding down random stop here but the wind coming off the ocean still strong enough to shake the biggest ... that I shouldn't still um boiling waves rolling end of the seawall here are some minor flooding along the coast\nNothing compared to past dorms Darwin's have down from trees and freelance knocking out power in some spots\nSome ten thousand customers in the dark state wide national grid says most of those allergens are an ethics Middlesex worst or ... ... says most of their auditors are in Boston and Brookline Marshfield Doug ... W busy news radio ten thirty\nThat thank you for that live report or their top story game for the world series now underway in LA the red Sox taking on the Dodgers the first pitch went out to eat oh nine right now we're at the bottom of the first\nNo score to out Dodgers fat Red Sox leading the world series of two wins to one Red Sox nation hoping for a third win tonight we'll have more news and weather updates at the top of the hour and course traffic on the three's very small WKBD news radio ten thirty\nSeven nails on WB Z news radio ten thirty and I'm and I'm here with my time chat and my daughter's Samantha was in my clients my friend and that famous little king David Palmer David pick it up and lives in place\nYeah so I mean the the calculation is so important to her because she is huge divisions huge dream she's Jupiter Neptune conjunction very rare connection conjunction means in the same position in the sky and for her\nThat means that she had these huge visions but she wants to make sure it's exactly the right way to achieve them so she'll take her extra time\nTo make sure that everything's in a row and then execute because it's too important to her are now being those things are that she wants to achieve\nAnd don't get me wrong just because just calculated it might take her time in my knee do emotionally feel that things are right because of the moon and Pisces it can be very emotionally sensitive so\nThe environment is the feel good and everything needs to fill in the right space them comfortable\nWith her Morris trying Iran is when she jumps out and she's comfortable\nIt's like in tents radical and exciting so it's not like she's boring because she's calculus to if it's that she's she's radical because she wants to make sure that she gets to the best\nPlace at the best time so it's kind of like shopping you know it's like for her it's like you know sorry like won't even walk through the aisles that out of the crap on it needs is the best the best of the best of the best and we'll\nTake the time to make sure she gets it and\nThat's the most part about her and she knows exactly what is good and what is not so if you want like the best person to know if something's good or something is bad you should be talking\nTo her because she knows exactly would scrap and what's good and it's like you're right the price checker\n... you know how to write because when you build a house with somebody for a year plus you get to know everything about them David I get you know everything about my clients they get to know everything about me and it just becomes one big family out here and I'm a fortunate bills or that I get to have these great relationships and you actually just bang you're right and I just got it because I Believe\nYou're building a house at some of the ... everything about the ... I think that what you're saying Hi Spain [laughter] that's what he said nobody making ... who else would I built my house the other day and you know what I'm saying I Know she could pay the bills is but\nThe point is is that it just developed and everything you just said about her was dead on dead dead on I've got a question what's the worst thing about her eyesight like if you had to be married to her what's the worst thing about hindsight\nIs twenty miles right off hand he gave me the ... be nice to have the worst\nThing about being married to a tourists would be that they're very particular\nAbout what they like and what they don't like so if there's something that you like and they don't like it they probably will go or be part of it you know like they kinda will tell you sorry you know like and so there's a part of it to where like\nBeing with the tour as you have to have the same values as them if you have a way different values and have a different lifestyle you know it's just not going to work like the the understanding needs to be the same\nAnd it comes down to the little things like like going to like purchase cars like if you're like in the German cars in that other person may be a new American\nWell it's just like like kind of weird like because like literally it might sniffle up being like God I got to get in this car right now oh man I have to be seen in this\nThing and you know like they kind of like really are really connected to the values of their life or what they feel as good or not good ...\nCan be stubborn but you know at the good part about it is they actually help people raised their vibration with cell forth by doing that by saying\nHey there is better out there why are you wasting your time but it can be kind of harsh to be on the other side of that and realize yeah like why am I drinking the or why am I using that Ninety nine cent a paper towels when I should be using the bounty or whatever you know I mean okay\nSo now we know the White House we know the worst character part of a bull what about a Virgo\nYeah the worse than the best way to do with like the criticism of outage right and I think so you like you can be doing this\nA little bit better by adjusting this and that just in that and\nWent out about how all that and and and that you could\nBe doing it a little better because they're both are signs so they're very kind of similar but but vertical gets really specific about small things like why did you just put the cup in that place you know what I mean it's like\nYou could have like use the cup holder better you know or you could have put your jacket in this thing why did you put it here you know it's like about more of the very tiny\nVery specific things but they're about rhythm so when you're rhythms off they know how to get you back on track so they're like showing you where you're messing up and where your life is scattered so they're the people who are like showing you where you're all over the place and\nSo we want to stand in line with the whole nine eleven with their lives all over the place or we can figure that out [laughter] I find that a lot of all the sign\nLike families in areas and she's like\nBeing good about earrings and the ball you know they can be a little Bush the tourists cancers were just great people like I Love\nBeing king um she's a\n... for those tend to be to me a little like I Want slipped up like you know like the people that might have people when they called like mass murders\nAnd ... why they call now and I I wrote to us email ...\nWhatever ah the tourist is one of them I mean I was not a big one and Virgo no Kansas we'll kill anybody okay we\nWe love people around here in California where oh yeah I'm terrible I got an anti Kerry and so you never know [laughter] I was just a little off in the way of thinking like they're very old fashion or they're very um I I'm not sure how to deal with\nA lot of stress because their minds on so fast so they're trying to get rid of the stress when they see something you know it's kind of like ... live this over a little bit you know or who they are back see driver's\nLiving life [laughter] you know so so like they're constantly around your shoulder like you should have been doing this did you realize you just wasted time and now we have to go through this extra step in gene many\nChristmas you know like ... like we could have been doing this so [laughter] so it's more of the stressful aspect of like\nThe stress of seeing what could be done in a lot more easier fashion\nBut watching people do that is stressful for them especially because then they have to go in and fix it all you know it's like oh my gosh that kind of like somebody going on a computer and opening all the programs up and say why didn't you just do that now joining really slow and now you got to go in there and clean it all up it's like little things but\nBut they actually add up to big things right every little thing adds up to a big thing and they they're trying to help people the right away\nIf he didn't do these little things you wouldn't be in these big problems\nOkay and what's a good thing I've ever go what's that what's a good ... and I think the good\nThing is I don't want I Want badly trying\nTo help but people take it as you know he likes it like like critical okay\nBut really they are people who are coming from purity and things like this could be done better but like you've got to be able to start adjusting your routine in your rhythm and use it will be putting this here and and and they basically are trying to help but of course help always comes across wrong", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Cindy Stumpo is Tough as Nails", "city": "Boston", "day": "28"}
