architect you want to come up with a floor plan have them started off at the ball rolling\nShe is talking about whether you're doing new construction renovation in addition anything if you're moving walls and you're replacing have an architect coming\nRight and Sandy you but I think you and I probably are are on the same page with that next step is\nYou want to get your design are involved in the conversation loop that designer and so now I can look at the planet I can say you know what from it how I live perspective does this work I'm walking into the into the space and you know what that logistically doesn't make any sense to have a bathroom over there versus\nOver here over your kitchen to be facing this way versus valley you know whatever you got the point\nBut ultimately Sam you are correct then we're going to bring in the contractor but ultimately you want to get the whole team together once that contractors looped in and I feel like weekly meetings in the beginning are really important\nIs that just too time consuming for you yes it is for me it is um but the reason why Sammy his answer was famous answers because she's used to people coming to me for us as the builder\n... than I put the whole team together which works to LA that's also happy but our team is the architect the civil engineer and the structural engineer right so we're builders remember that and so that's our first team then typically\nMy end uses will hire their own designers right and at that point they start to work\nWith the air um architect mhm and typically by the way when somebody comes to me I'm already you're already coming into a company that's full service\nWe have an architect we have a structural engineer we have a civil engineer but then everybody has their own designers or the last me for references and I'll give you a name I give and again also I also asked the client what Trump budget to write because designers charge\nDifferent ... oh yeah there's there's so many different ways and\nThis is a question I get asked a lot is when somebody's looking for a design our first of all how do you find that person you know how do you find the person that's going to meet our budget that gets you\nIn a relationship that's like um I mean I haven't done online dating [laughter] lives here I imagine it's like online dating where you have to meet a lot of people and find the right connections makes are you guys live well together they have to as a designer you have to get that person\nMore emotionally I think like you have to really get how they live their life like I Want to know\nTell me what you do the ... the second you wake up\nYou go to the bathroom\nLike I said oh God yeah your cousin cause I don't do any of that I wake up and go to work [laughter] I'm shallow the night before I get dressed and out the door I go\nBut the the big one here is that when my client\nWell I finally did it\nI opened a four O. one K. once why just wait for the inherited we'd definitely got a rich uncle somewhere where one call away from the winner's circle at the derby dinners with multiple for a vacation home in the country using ... you don't actually think

shake or ... or ... lowers are darker uppers or later\nOkay so let's stay with us the shake a style Joel why for me because it's gonna have longevity it's not too trendy bingo and then you're doing you said your uppers either change colors yeah which is something new for me personally I haven't done this time I catch them before and I owe him in a short shakers instead or overly inside so you are in setting them yeah\nSo you feel the incest getting to traditional and maybe to start moving towards the all the way I don't know I\nSay stay within set yeah so basically if you don't know what ... means awful overlay a the ... and ... into the the dog goes into the frame of the cabinet\nAnd the overlay comes they bought up together on the ... or ... which is a more modern look the overlay correct right okay so let's go there so shaker instead and then you're going with the\nTwo colors right so I have is a it's not a bright white but it's like a white white but not right white for the ... and then the deep deep dark warm grave for the lowers there's so many ... green great great rivalry I tend to lean towards a blue greats okay\nAnd then you said you're doing a waterfall lighter

make sure you get them she and I got I have to bring in the studio ... you know for me it was a big deal having done HDTV for so many years the people that know me have always relied on need for affordable design that has a luxury feel and I've\nNever wanted to go beyond that I've never I've been very very true to that and that I don't want to have a product out there that breaks the banks so this is actually an engineered stone that is very affordable we don't have a million colors out there I Believe there's about twenty five of them that I work on creating the color palettes together and\nYeah so there there's a nice choice but it's not overwhelming and it's it's really affordable now you're making\nThem in this country or outside of here inside of sketchy good um and that you know it's funny 'cause like you go to see the stone and my Jewish clients once he's a stone 'cause I mean Israel I get this you know I I I get on this like well is that made over there and one over

keep a neutral base but I can change out my accent and change it up so that all the more expensive item stay the same you know if I'm going to have a cell phone it's gonna be a pretty neutral color so
