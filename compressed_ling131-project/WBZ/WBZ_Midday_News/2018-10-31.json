to you by Toyota learn the latest news from leading experts on cutting edge innovations hybrid and safety technology Toyota Mexico places\nWB Z news time twelve fifty five questions send rumors still swirling around the prison killing of Whitey Bolger WB Xi's been Parker spoke to TJ English on the ring central news line a DJ English is author of two books on Bolger about the mobsters brutal death\nWhile on one level it seemed like a fitting ed I'm a brutal and to a brutal life\nAnd I think a lot of people would follow the Folger story always thought that it might end this way it almost felt like a logical ending to the bold your story but on the other hand he was eighty nine year old man with a heart condition in a wheelchair\nAnd do you you would think that most people might have been content to let him\nTo let him go out on his own but I I get the sense that in the criminal underworld there were a lot of people that were offended by the idea that Whitey Bolger might die of natural causes and so they took matters into their own hands and brought it to of Ireland and\nDoes it surprise you ... the the way it is we I mean obviously he's been in prison for a while now with a life sentence then they transfer and Oklahoma we don't know why is going there and where he's going and then he ends up in West Virginia and twenty four hours later he's bad they're there certainly is room for conspiracy theorists here either\nSo yeah there's a lotta unanswered questions here I mean a lot of it just makes no sense Whitey was put in the general population in this prison in West Virginia\nI mean that's that's a death sentence Whitey Bolger in general population and their explanation for why they put him in general population is is that Bolger requested it well since windows windows prison authorities\nMake decisions based on what it may request so that's pretty strange\nHe had been an isolated locked up and all his previous ah prisons he's moved to this one I mean it\nIt sounds like a set up like he was moved there to be murder and he was killed within twenty four hours of being moved to this new facility they obviously knew he was coming and they were ready for him so yes there's a there's a lot of questions that need to be answered and unfortunately I have the feeling will never\nGet straight answers to those questions because that's the way the bureau of prisons operate sits at world unto itself and that's really not held accountable and no answer the questions they feel like they want to answer so we may never know\nMet his TJ English author of two
