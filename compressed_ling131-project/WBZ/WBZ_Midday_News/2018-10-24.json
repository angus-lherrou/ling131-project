officials at a news conference here last hour is that there may be other devices still out there in the mail have not been discovered yet the device that was picked up in the mail room here at CNN has been taken by the NYPD bomb squad to show that he said to an FBI\nLab right now is the best hope of investigators that's what the devices themselves\nThey'll be able to backtrack and find out who said that\nSo they could figure out who this person is\nI assume they have no clue they've given no clue as to who might be\nWell if they have a clue that hadn't told us a and so we have to you know ... obviously I Hope and expect that they're they're doing their best to track down a but what we do know is that a number of people have been targeted\nIn the mail and it is a chilling thing to do all the news organization in the city and Washington are now on edge it there are rumors that fears that other people may be targeted by these devices that down in Florida and South Florida the office of Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nA says it received one of these devices and the back story on that\nAccording to sources is that the device was bailed or address\nTo Eric Holder the former attorney general but because every Wasserman Schultz the Democratic congresswoman who formerly had at the Democratic National Committee was listed as the return address uh the the device was march return to sender I'd wound up at Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office and so\nThe bomb squad and South Florida has reported to that seat and the device apparently has been sick as it safely removed and we'll be ticketed for analysis but the point is officials are describing these as similar devices as part of the pattern they're not collecting evidence and a best seller investigators is they're able to use that have to figure out what\nDo you think there's any significant and I know this would be wild speculation so understand if you don't want to answer it any significance to that these are all aimed at Democrats it seems\nWell so far if you look at the list of people who've been targeted there either Democrats or people who've been critical for as we are city Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters last
