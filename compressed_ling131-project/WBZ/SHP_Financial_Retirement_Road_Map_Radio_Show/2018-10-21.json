H. P. workshops dot com again that's S. H. P. workshops dot com\nAll right we know Keith everyone stories different everyone's situation is different\nBut given the recent market volatility I thought it was important we were talking off line about you know a situation that not only stories work out with happy endings unfortunately and this one we did the best it ended up being happy but it was a little bit of time to get there yeah so if you want to bring everyone back to two thousand eight I think it was a summer of\nTwo thousand two thousand and they you know a couple that I started to have conversations with about working together marking Gina come into the office they come to\nWorship exactly what we were talking you know you were just talking about and they came in to visit with us after that workshop every member mark you know he came in you know and his work clothes you know you just finished up work to kind of dirty because he's a he's a contract he's out there moving things building things and doing things like that so he had come in\nAnd he was trying to retire in the next three to four\nMonths I was his goal and when we started to talk about I had an advisor to it I did have an advisor that he did he was working with we sat down in the conference room I could just see in mark size and even in jeans size because mark has had a lot of stress you know in his career trying to balance he owns his own business he was the sole proprietor\nTrying to balance all these different jobs and he was actually being hands on and some of these jobs as well because he needed to do that I couldn't\nFind help and things like that and you know gene who's getting the kind of the brunt of a lot of the ... you know the ... the late nights and things like that so there's a lot of stress on both of them and therefore you know as a sole proprietor you said you know what I I've had enough I think I've saved enough\nMoney that I could step away from this business\nAnd either salad or dissolve it depending on the value and I said okay\nFor his main goals Keith ... where the mark and Jean say they want like what would be a certain amount of income to David amount of money\nSo the main goal was you know he needed to generate about a hundred thousand dollars a year and all we had was Social Security so really he just needed a hundred thousand dollars a year so probably about Seventy thousand sixty Seventy thousand off of his ... portfolio at that point however you know we started to talk and said look you know a hundred thousand dollars\nIn two thousand ease a lot different than a hundred thousand dollars and two thousand and Eighteen sure so we we do need to account for inflation and Jean definitely had some concerns\nWhen it came to health care because they were going to be retiring early they needed maybe a little bit even more income up front to supplement and to get them in you know ... to get the health care paid for four in the early years before they get on to Medicare and how much that they face head of a one point of this round up to about one and a half\nMillion in assets that they put away a lot of it was pre tax that he'd been putting away through his company and things like that so we sat down\nAgain they they were about a month to month and a half two months away from retiring\nSo what we did is you know took into account the goals that they were trying to accomplish and you know I said look there's a couple of different things that we that we can do for you to limit limit let's take a step back was set up another time for you guys to come in\nAnd let us do what we do for for the families that we work with which is\nWe want to take a deep dive into the holdings that they had in the account to give them the potential upside that they can make it a good year in the market and the potential downside did they could lose we also want to assess and take a look at any underlying costs beyond what the advisor was charging them to know what we wanted to do is say hey look you know\nYou have about Ninety five percent of your assets directly in the market in about five percent down to local bank and cash or cash like alternative we needed to develop a strategy that when mark does retire and his wife said to mark and Jean we need to know where your your money or your paychecks going to be coming from\nIn the short term or even ... throughout retirement what we did we set up another time for them to come down is really nice to kind of take us to step in and take a look at that because they're advisor they they had been working with and never talk to them about building a plant\nWill keep in two thousand seven and eight ... we were coming off a few good years in the market so at the time was that a concern of there as well they can certainly care I don't want to lose part of this one point five million\nBrought that up to them I had to you know you have to yeah because ... like just like we're seeing now you know ten years\nInto a bull market run the market doesn't go up every year forever right that's where we have a very\nOld bull right now I mean literally it's the oldest bull market in recorded history as it's not the strongest but it is the oldest for a long\nTime so I mean it's you're naive to think it's just going to keep going and that's what I I didn't say that to them but in my mind I said look\nIt's my responsibility as advisor to show them the upside and the downside so when they came back with the results so when they came back you know do good news is they weren't paying a ton of fees no that wasn't a big deal to them and that wasn't a big deal to me all however we did address I did take a look at I did want to educate them on the the fees that they were paying\nHowever ... was a little alarming to me was\nThe amount of risk that they were taking in their portfolio you know what a good year they stood to make about thirty two percent in a negative year they stood to lose about thirty so I was like whoa you know that that's you know that's a big down trying to think about that used to give blood sweat and tears one and a half million dollars if you lose ... hundred thousand\nYeah if you lose five hundred thousand dollars that that's a big downturn\nWhat they did is they actually you know showing the planned shorten the income strategy exactly how we would build out their plan reduced some reduced some risk give them some upside but also get what we call that paycheck or that mailbox money whether it's through the market or other avenues\nAnd they had enough to go to had it in all their goals perfect you know their retirement would've been a clear nice concise picture\nWe've been able to manage it for them they took a step back\nWent to visit with their advisor and their bodies are kind of talk them off the ledge cast for lack of better way of putting it and left the instead let's leave it where it is sort of member\nHim saying or her with the advisor but they said it was too conservative right correct taking too you know you're gonna miss these big years in the market\nIf you go to strip right and I would I turn around and said hey look when you retire to both
