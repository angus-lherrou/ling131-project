C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never so [noise]\nAnd then like a scene estate planning maximizing what's left to the next generation as efficiently as possible in ... as we know\nIt's not the differences everyone that you hear on the radio I we were the best at Social Security planning we do investments we do legacy here what we do our five step process is all at one spot\nOftentimes people ask me if I went into business so why did we go independent in ... we found there's multiple reasons for that but we found that there was just a lack of comprehensive planning out there that you know is that about certain people on the radio that they would focus their specialize on this or specialize on that I mean\nWhen you study the industry you find out that the people that have ten million dollars and more they're getting all of this detail they're getting all this focus\nWell everyone deserves that everyone is listening to the show deserves the attention to detail to make sure they have mapped out income plan and investment all those things that you were just mentioning and that's why when independent why we formed S H pay\nAnd chief as you know what I mean and this the three of us a few years ago and we've been lucky enough and blessed and we thank God every day that we have this company and his team in place in the clients are so great that we deal with every day\nThat we can sit here and coasts and not take on one more client and be okay but we decided this is what you know when we do different trainings across the country in different areas that we work with we see that we do have some that's different and we do have something that can actually help people\nAnd help you listening get too into retirement it's not just fluff that we're here talking on the radio to repeal proven process that can help folks build a plan and give them confidence as into retirement Keith\nWas funny 'cause one of the biggest questions we get asked when folks come in and visit with us is when I retire what is my retirement could look like and just sit down and go through their whole plan comprehensively built out an actual income strategy and investment strategy\nAnd then take a look at everything from attack standpoint [noise] make sure that the health care is taking care of and then the final piece is make sure that you know when that time comes many many years down the road and there are no longer with us is that money is transition to the next generation it empowers them in a given the big C word as they enter retirement confidence\nWell it's it's amazing chief in in the best way I can tell the listeners or or just explain to you want the power of this retirement road map process can do um I had a couple that I met with literally two years ago\nAnd it was billionaire Angela and they had about five hundred thousand dollars saved to retirement and they're both sixty four at the time and one of the first questions I asked them which is one of the most common concerns that we see is\nWhen do you want to retire when is your target retirement date and you know what their answer was keep them out\nTo will never be able to retire I Am or where they said look me in the eyes so we're never going to be able to retire it you know I'm almost embarrassed to be here because we haven't saved enough money for our situation\nAnd said well let me just crunch the numbers for let me take some time and see what we can do ever angel said listen we only have five hundred thousand dollars I Know I Know we're not going to be able to make it can just tell you man keys\nThat they were able to make it in this is what I Love about this industry is ... being the bearer of actually good news as opposed to being the bearer of bad news and I saw in their idea was to retire by ... sixty eight which they knew they couldn't and they say we may still work you know until sixty eight\nBut we saw that said you know we can actually build a plant where you can retire in two years at age\nSixty six and guess what happened a few months ago that they they retired\nOr ... them\nAnd now they do things like the the neat part about it I was just talking to her the other day and now they're setting up trips a family trip they've always wanted to take their doing things they never imagined possible just by because we took the time and they took their time to do what they picked up the phone and called and called us\nAnd so that's all that that's all that it took and I love working with awesome families and I love working with people that initially think they have no chance of retiring and being the bearer of good news and saying hey guess what\nLet's look at your information you actually can retire and here's when you can do it that's the best part of our job so as you are listening right now does this sound like you is that a concern that you have of whether or not you can retire at a certain point it's so let's take a look at your situation to see how much

puzzle together to help folks retire when they want to and to be able to give them you know what keeps them out was that\nOne of the most important phrases in retirement that's financial independence

H. B. financial done gum no here's your host very\n... so today we're\nWalking you right through our retirement ... step plan that can help you get too into retirement in his help so many clients that we work with\nGet too into retirement and since we open the doors to S. H. P. financial way back in two thousand three myself Keith ... started this and like we mentioned earlier folks\nWe can we say a few years ago he said you know we could sit back and coast and just keep the clients happy and maintain our client base but we want to help more people that's where a passionate about and we have a process implanting tool that can help you get to and through retirement so why not continue to utilize it\nSo when the first segment we talked about number one ... one of our five step planning process which is building an income plan you can't have a retirement unless you have an income plan that delivers that monthly mailbox money each and every month to last as long as you do step two of our five step process\nIs an investment plan she might be thinking\nEveryone has an investment plan everyone has investments that ... you know you have mutual funds stocks bonds annuities alternative investments\nAll these other areas but the most concerning thing that I see when it comes to investment planning is controlling volatility\nWith in your portfolio let me see it again the most important part of investment planning when you're getting close to her in retirement is to control the amount of volatility or you know huge potential down swing potential in your portfolio\nAnd I mean that can be the difference between success and failure for many people listening to the show\nNo absolutely not a great way of summarizing that is that when you when you enter retirement until about ... hidden singles you know what I'm trying to hit homeruns anymore we're just trying to be consistent\nYou know and made me think of a you know a couple of clients that came in recently Brian ... you know Brian was a carpenter Michelle was still working and she was had a commute that she hated I mean she was literally going to shore\nUp to the north shore on a daily basis and was just as unhappy as as can be and so they they were nervous too when they came in because Michael just recently been laid off from a job and he's kind of doing odd jobs and doing carpentry work\nAnd he was just saying All right well I you know all she has four one K. and it was all in the market at that point and so we obviously we uh we did step one which is to set up their income plan and talk about okay if he if he collect Social Security now okay and if you continue to work and\nAnd what it is that we set it up so that you know in anywhere from six months to a year's time if the commute was just too much for her then she would retire at that time\nBy cutting that four one K. out of ... not just the growth bucket now from cutting that for one case into some into a big chunk of the income you know fixed income ... things like that and the other chunk we let grow\nWe just said look you know Michelle it no matter what happens if there is a market correction there were any time that is going to happen to the next year you will not be impacted by\nIn other words the market is not going to dictate when that commute is too much for you if you just don't want that commute we've set it up so that we used to have your portfolio so the minute that you are done working\nThen we know exactly what bucket when we're going to withdraw money from and exactly what money were no let grow so that winning that volatility kicks in and then that correction happens it does not affect Michelle and Brian's life\nAnd that ... having when when she left the office after telling her that and then you know good doing reviews you know after plans establish it's just it's it's so nice to reminder\nYou're like oh no no in in that she retired ... ... that's funny so then literally about a couple of weeks ago I spoke to a recently and she ended up getting transferred in in ... ah on to the south shore so now she's now she's like I'm at I'm gonna work for a couple more years\nFrom ... imagine her feeling knowing that she's going to work every day knowing that she can stop when she wants exaggerating that is a much better way to go to work then to wonder like a lot of people are wondering right now of hey how long it might have to do this for\n... ... ... ... absolutely and also to just to be able to\nWhen I was talking to her about how she just got transferred to a shorter commute just saying but look you know show don't worry about it if the ... it just always felt so good for me to tell her to remind her\nThat hey if the market falls don't worry about it we have a plant yeah so I was able to tell her what happens you know so when all this market stuff happening all his news hitting and everything else I can say here here's what it means to you and it doesn't mean much because we were able to set up the portfolio to set up the investment planned the right way\nCorrect and a lot of people that come into our office you know we still use the market as a tool for many of the folks that we work with it's a good long term investment strategy but if all of your money is subject to full risk keys\nThat's I mean think about if you're fully in the market you basically we wake up\nEvery single year knowing you might make forty percent\nOr you might lose forty percent so if you're a million dollars yeah might make four hundred this year or I might end up next year six hundred thousand which is almost half of all the money I've said to my entire life and so to me that's the first thing when it comes to of what we call the volatility control I mean you worked your entire life to get\nTo this point why are you taking chances and do you know did you even know that there are strategies\nAvailable right now where you are we utilize all the time where you can take advantage of the upside of the market and but you're not going to take the same downside risk\nIn a lot of clients we tell them every single day I said listen I'd much rather and hope if this is you're listening right now take take take this into consideration 'cause maybe we're not the right from because here's a conversation I have some times hey Mr Mrs Jones I'd much rather you'd be mad at me because the market's up twenty and you're only ups fourteen percent\nThan to be mad at me because the markets down forty percent and so are you in your retirement is over and you have to go back to work peace I mean that's that's the whole deal right jeeze\nA hundred percent it's controlling the volatility it's setting up the plane correctly\nIn our philosophy since we started building up these retirement a road map says you need money for safety money for income and once you have those two buckets built which to me I kind of draw a line in the sand there and say look safety and income\nWhat have you protected you protected your lifestyle that's awesome that's a that's a that's the biggest thing\nWe're trying to do for the folks that we work with this look like Matt said earlier with his clients and he gave them the ability to say look I don't want to drive to the north shore anymore if either one I can walk away if I Want to it's a liberating experience you know\nWe're helping them protect their lifestyle now once that's done you have that third bucket which is growth\nThen what goes into a bucket for growth is determined on a conversation between us because we have some current clients that are a little bit more maybe on the aggressive side in that growth bucket but then we have those clients that are still more conservative\nBut we don't want the growth bucket to affect you know whether you can take a trip that year or whether you can go visit your grandkids or whether you can buy a new car or whatever it is you're trying to do on a month to month year to year basis\nWell simple symbol that will keep the same right there is you need time in the market if you're going to be in the market you need time\nSo our clients for only advise and the only a portion of their money that we have invested for them stays in the market and we use other alternatives when it comes to\nGetting their safety getting the income they need you know you don't want that to be marketing generated because if it's all in the market and you a million dollars and you retire and the next to your six hundred thousand what is that going to duty or retirement", "show_name": "SHP Financial Retirement Road Map Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day":
