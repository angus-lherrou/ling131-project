H. P. story segment right now and I think it's important because a lot of you can relate to some clients that we've taken on last few years and clients maybe uh been with us for Fifteen Years obviously every story is different and not everyone situation is the same\nBut I figured you could relate to the story because we ended last segment\nTalking about the major the major goals and rules of retirement planning in the final rule that we gave which was real number five was to make sure you have a plan in place before retiring and don't don't just be reactive and then retire and say oh wait I Need a plan\nBecause everyone knows it's a lot better to have a plan in place\nBefore you retire than waiting to retire and then trying to scramble at the last minute so mark and Karen head hurt our radio show for about four or five years say we've been on we've been on the station to think about ... close to ten years on the radio and they had heard us for the last four or five years and they were in their fifties when they started listening to us\nAnd after a while they they they said they wanted to come in three or four years ago but like a lot of other folks have been procrastinating\nSo actually go through the story I Want you to think about whether or not it makes sense to come in for a review sea of some of these areas that we're talking about makes sense to you as they did to mark and Karen\nSome arc and Karen really they had a few concerns that came in from the radio show and when they first met I could tell they were a little apprehensive you know the it's not something you do every day to go through\nYou know open up your finances and share your life story and what your goals are in family goals and you know income goals and just a it's a big deal and they so they were a little apprehensive just nervous just warming up a little bit at once but once we\nGot to know each other and got to know their situation\nIt became apparent we were going to be able to help them out quite a bit and so I was talking to mark and Karen in that first meeting and they had really a few major goals\nNumber one I remember there sixty years old and they came in a few months ago so this isn't an old case they really want to make sure they retire between age sixty five in sixty six they've saved up bought a million thirty thousand dollars so they had about nine hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in the market\nIn about fifty to sixty thousand dollars in bank account so little over a million dollars major things they were concerned about is when I retire\nWhereas my income going to come from how am I going to have the income I Need to cover all my bills and not worry about running out of money because they were only going to have Social Security there was no pension there was no rental income there were only going to have Social Security income\nSecondly they were concerned about volatility\nThey said you know what dark I've heard your show I Know the market's been up for ten years in a row do what you know I'm concerned that if the bottom job so how is that gonna affect our retirement and I remember Karen saying like you know Mark's worked really hard and and and I've worked really hard and we want to retire in the last thing we want to do\nIs not to plan properly and have to go back to work [noise]\nThe other thing they were concerned about is a state planning they were concerned about just having a solid state planned for their like a trust will that it that they had never set up for their children\nAnd then finally they were concerned about fees they had an advisor they had they had worked with for many many years and they didn't really know the total fee they were paying they knew there are paying a management fee of around one point two five percent\nBut they didn't know how much the underlying assets cost him on top of that like the mutual fund cos so again major concerns were how much they're paying fees state planning how much risk or volatility was in their portfolio and how much income they can draw from when they retired or do they have enough for you about eighty thousand dollars per year\nBut that was after taxes keep they needed really over a hundred thousand dollars close to run around a hundred thousand dollars gross so after taxes they could have eighty thousand dollars now than it needs to go up every year great point and that has to go for inflation\nSo the first thing easy solution based on their situation they were able to use the file and suspend technique with Social Security which some people can't use but basically when mark triggers his Social Security uh sixty six\nThen at that point Karen can take half of his and delay hers even longer set by the time she's Seventy she can now get hers and it goes up so that was a quick strategy that made him a good chunk of money very quickly secondly we looked at from an income scenario and an investment scenario\nThey had we we looked at their uh their portfolio to see how much risk they were taken and so this is if you forget everything else about the show to me having volatility control\nIn your plan when you're close to\nOr in retirement might be the most important thing you do for your retirement plan because too much volatility early on in their retirement can literally wipe out a retirement and we've seen numerous examples\nUnfortunately of of people that have come to us in ... or a potential clients that have come to us too late where it was too late to do anything\nFortunately marketing Karen had said that this money and but when I ran an analysis think of like\nAs a a risk score zero to a hundred so if all your money is under your mattress well I guess that's all your money is in a fireproof safe in a place that no one can touch it that would be\nScores like a zero and if all your money is an Enron stock that would be like a hundred and Ninety nine and so they came in and they had a risk score of uh Seventy so you're probably wondering what does that mean to them what to Seventy\nSo when I ran the analysis on their current portfolio they told me dark where we're concerned are advisor we've told him we want to take on less risk as we get older we're concerned that this is not being done\nWhen I looked at their portfolio and they came in for the second meeting I said hey mark herring you're you're absolutely right you know if\nThe way it stands out of Seventy if the market where to go up if we had like a two thousand Thirteen tight market where we consider that a bull market like a really good strong upward market you'd ... you'd probably earn about thirty percent at your current risk or which is what should a quaint two uh two hundred and Ninety thousand dollar game\nHowever if we had a a really bad year like two thousand eight\nAt your current risk level that would be a loss of three hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars and I remember in and at that point yeah member mark looking at care and he's like that's like that's the thing about that the most that's over a third\nOf our entire life savings and they looked like we can't afford to take this risk and I was like what you know why do you think that your advisor did not do this is it you know why did how come that you know they just they are going to do the ... where you're telling people you're telling me must be telling you advisor that you want to reduce your volatility\nAnd so [noise] so think about it at risk or of a Seventy you could make thirty percent and loose thirty five percent basically in a good down here for them they could make two hundred Ninety thousand in a good year\nBut they lose three hundred thirty seven thousand in a bad year I said why don't we change what if we bring you to a thirty four on the wrist scale so getting scaled zero to a hundred and thirty four you can make ... you know fourteen percent in really good year which isn't as good as thirty percent\nButton and it really down your like two thousand eight\nYou'd probably lose about Thirteen percent which is a lot better than losing thirty five percent ... so if we had a ... is the way we set them up at the end of two thousand eight type scenario in this general terms but if if they lost a hundred and thirty thousand dollars on a million they're not going to be high fiving me but if they can deal with it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "SHP Financial Retirement Road Map Radio Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "28"}
