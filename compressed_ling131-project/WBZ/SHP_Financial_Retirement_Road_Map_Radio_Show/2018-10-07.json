Hi [laughter] this is Rick\nNo get outraged really know that it makes you what I hear what is your claim on the\nLine so Cindy I follow you on social media lot and I notice there's a lot of changes going on with your style and design I was wondering how you keep up with all the trends that are going on\nYou know I could tell you something I'm going to go [laughter]\nAnd we take history him off

design or do we know it just somebody sharing pictures you know\nI'm keeping up with the trends are impressive picture they are they're really impressive pictures and you know they're so photo shop and blah blah blah and and you know some of them are a real picture some aren't\nBut keeping up with the trends is what you ask me a lot of ... to a different look what I've been doing for so long exactly it's hard you know you kind of set in your ways you have had your brand for so many years but this new generation they want different than my generation and\nIf you'd asked me if I Would ever

C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never so\nAnd it's like um you don't want to be rude but that's that is not someone that would be a good fit for us right Keith in terms of what what our goals are because we're not trying to double someone's money in three to five years you know we do\nThis right and not only that you talk to them and say you know why do you want to do that and I and that's what they [noise] in you know in their minds that's what they think they need to be able to retire successfully but then when you kind of pull back and start to ask them questions around their situation\nYou could say hey look you know you don't need two million dollars to retire it based upon\nYou know what it is that you need on a day to day month to month basis so they're really focusing on the wrong number one of the things I think that we do well is dive in and build and what's called a bowl based plan every family is different every one situation is different everyone's goals are different\nSo it's up to us as independent financial planners to be able to work with each family to discover their goals what it is they want to do and help them achieve I'm ... I'm Sorry to interrupt but but it is also just going to pick up on what keeps saying about the gold based plan I mean\nYou know just to combine that with the idea of diversification is that everything should be diversified you know you should have an income plan you know a legacy plan a health care plan and you should have a diverse in you know diversity within your planning\nBut also specifically just because of putting I mind is the tax planning you should have diversification within ... in your tax absolute you know do you have a higher rate money ... money and after tax money you know ... you know do you have different areas because we love that so\nSo the whole idea of diversification and applies to planning to making sure you have all five areas it applies to investments and apply it applies it specifically within your taxes themselves\nI mean these are just all areas that you need to be focusing on for a true comprehensive plan\nAnd most people that I say I'm going to continue to say this until everyone fiesta planted they deserve but a lot of people come in and they have\nA bunch of investments and or like you said maybe they have like a million to in IRAs and like thirty thousand and raw and ... and checking and savings and there's there's not really a lot of balance there from attack standpoint so we try to create tax diversification we try to ... acid diversification\nAnd we try to create planning diversification meaning everyone if you're thinking\nAbout retirement when you're younger and you're working you're just putting money away you don't really in in essence obviously I think everyone should have some sort of an escape plan but what you're doing is ... is just investment planning [noise]\nYou're not worried about income because you have an income from your job you're not really too worried as you know healthcare situations could come up but most likely as you're older you're not really worried a ton about that\nWhen you're getting close to retire if you if all you have is investments thinking about what your plan is right now you just have a bunch of investments\nOr did you have a fully written plan that looks at income meaning where is your income going to come from when you retire not just from one portfolio but how is it going to come out\nAnd they'd be going to be all pre taxes are going to be tax free what's a combination do you know how to plan your income so last as long as you do and make sure your accounts are set up properly to give you the incoming needed retirement and then we look at investments that is what as you get close to retirement\nWe'll talk about this later in the show but I think you need to look at investments maybe giving some up off the upside it's okay if you don't hit thirty percent in a good year maybe you only get twenty two\nBut that's okay because you're not maybe if you get twenty two when it's a thirty maybe you'll only lose Fifteen when it's down thirty if that makes sense so really you want to have some balance from an investment standpoint in diversification then we talked about taxes\nHow do you create tax efficient plan as you get close to retirement in ... in retirement as well as leaving money to the next generation we talk about health care and we talk about state planning in legacy planning leaving assets to those who you care most about\nAnd so that's what it all comes down to is having a plan that covers each and every area not just a pile of investments and so we think think about in your lifetime what you've done to get to where you are now\nAnd what does that mean to you and do you think you just want to have a bunch of investments and hope it goes right or did you want to have a plan that make you know looks at every single area to make sure it's uncovered\nSo you can retire with a little bit more confidence\nYou know going into your these years can be twenty Thirty years of retirement\nThat sort of thing and so that's an order short on time but like\nThe idea of making sure that people are aware of how much work this is ... there's so much to it and so I that's why I just want to really emphasize cut you off that that that's the whole you know that's why you know 'cause I appreciate when people are like oh you know what to do it myself it's like a pre shit that 'cause I Love doing this too\nBut it's a full time job yeah so do you really want to do that and\nYour retirement yeah I mean if you and some people do if you don't want if you don't want to travel as much and do as much and and be able to run everything that fine we completely respect that\nBut if you're not sure or maybe you say hey maybe I just want to get a second opinion maybe you're someone who does nothing and doesn't want to do some retirement and wants to rely on a professional you want to come and obviously and sit down or maybe you're someone who's not sure and say maybe I Want to run some of this myself maybe I Need a second set of

I still come into that we do encounter people that are that close to retirement and still don't have something written exactly what they're taking money from\nMentioned the patriots show up to a Super Bowl and like Braves about take the field okay what's the game plans like what are you talking about we don't have a game plan will match that see that's a football game this is your whole life is is retirement\nAnd so he's and he also said you know not only do we don't have a plan but we also haven't talked about taxes inflation\nHealth care all that stuff is well I said All right and I said what are your main concerns what do you have and they were lucky enough they worked hard and they saved up a little over one point five million dollars between IRAs a little bit in raw in some some after tax accounts\nAnd I said what are your main concerns he goes well two things I Need sixty thousand dollars per year\nOff my portfolio and I said why or why why didn't you that you think will that be between that sixty thousand my Social Security in a small pension all of a good chunk of income coming in every year and I said well why do you want that income\nIs equal number wants to pay the bills number two I Want to buy a motor home and travel the country for a few years and number three I Want to take a big trip every year with my family and so now we're getting to the heart of really wire here\nAnd I said what else are you concerned about he's like I'm really concerned about leading money behind to list or making sure she's taking care of if something happens to me\nThat's that's on honorable and and I said you know the reason I Know he really meant that is because if someone said that once I write it down if someone says it twice I handle on it and if someone says it three times I circled it and I was that that paper was circled on the line and everything was dies yeah everything on it was a lot of damage to that part of the paper\nAnd so I said since you're retiring in in four weeks I'm assuming you advise is already set yourself up for this and he goes yeah I'm sure you already did and I said well you are you sure you're here for a second opinion you you really open to a second opinion because it's so we're going to really dig deep into your situation I said number one do you mind if you ask how much you're paying and sees\nHe's he takes care of me you know because we were good friends she only charges me point eight five percent per year he's like I Know most people are one one and a half\nI'm only paying point eight five Mike that's not bad\nI'm like the Hubble these mutual funds and other things you own he said well no there's no fee and that image pinpointing five I said All right do you mind I Know you're paying twenty five but you mind if I just run the analysis for you and just see what you're paying and total he said I Know it's gonna be twenty five but go ahead sorry I'm going to do that because if you're open to if you really open to it I'm going to run the real Nelson\nSecondly I said how much risk in your portfolio do you have in my question was one point five million what's the most and this is something if you're if you're if you've nodded off during my initials talk you hear\nThis is one thing you want to remember because I asked him what's the most you'd be willing to lose in a given\nThere without totally losing air being super nervous he saw that one was anything I said Steve come on you got to pay to play this is the market here you have all your money in the market he's a find ten percent\nIt and just as there that's a great question for all of our listeners should ask themselves how much at this stage in your life how much are you willing to lose before you start hitting the panic button and just taken time and just ask yourself that question how much willing to lose at this point in my life and then do you know the answer\nWell he said ten percent found the ... which is a hundred fifty thousand dollars he goes I get nervous when are you saying that but I guess I Am at one point five million if I lost a hundred and fifty I'd be okay I said All right well let's we're going to run your portfolio from arrest standpoint from a fee standpoint\nWe're going to run an income analysis to see if you have enough income in cash flow coming in to cover your needs and achieve their goals and finally a roadmap which outlines of five areas of of our planning process income investments taxes health care and like I said\nHe's ... he's leaving we set schedule the second meeting and that's why I said you might have\nNext meeting you bring your wife back you mind if you bring Liz back he's got she's not going to want to calm she doesn't she thinks he's meetings a super boring I kind of got a chuckle out of that\nAnd I said well just do a favor tell her Derek said it I think it's important for her to come back and be involved in this process and he said fine that's what we'll see I'll do it I can see what I can do fast forward I'm not going to I I don't want to make a story longer than it has to be but when they came back in\n... in between the meetings actually we were running the analysis and it's like it was a different person he said he didn't want to lose a certain amount of money he said he had he was only paying a certain amount of fees and I was looking at the analysis my team ran it was like are you sure this is Steve and Liz this is not what he thinks he has", "year": "2018", "show_name": "SHP Financial Retirement Road Map Radio Show", "city": "Boston", "day":
