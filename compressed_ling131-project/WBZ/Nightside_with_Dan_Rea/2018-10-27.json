bombs across America\nAt this point fourteen pipe bombs\nWere sent to various political\nFigures some private citizens are in a I'm In a rain that lasted several days and shook up a lot of people as rightfully should but today around the middle of the day and arrest was made\nWe now know the identity and again you know he's he enjoys the presumption of innocence but boy if there ever was a case that looked as if it was sewn up pretty quickly by the authorities\nCesar Cesar ... you know I watched as much as I could uh this afternoon uh we're we're working on a number of projects here and I said I watched as much as I could and I said yesterday\nThat I thought that this would be a lone person than it would not be a cabal of people\nI don't think there's any suggestion that there are others involved at this point and from everything that I have heard and everything that I have read about this case this guy was a complete loner fifty six years old I said yesterday\nThat this would either be a fervent Trump supporter\nA fervent Trump opponent\nOr a nut job well this guy fits two categories you saw his van he's a bourbon Trump supporter\nThese also in that job listening to an interview tonight I Believe it was on CNN with the general manager he worked as as a delivery driver I guess for a restaurant of some sort and the general manager of the company said that he was always very ... very respectful very cordial but\nStrong political viewpoints and like Donald Trump he claimed or that he's a Native American and he's a seminal\nWe've heard that story before the um the ... the tribe in question the Seminoles have said no he's not a member of our tribe\nWe've heard that story the force well so the question that I have for all of you tonight is that last night we were in a situation where we did not know how this story would end I think this story has ended tonight\nMy suspicion is there's probably no more bombs out there no more or the FBI saying they would not hoax bombs that they were real bombs whatever\nA no one was injured that's the good news that's the good news but it's a wake up call for the country and I talked about it last night and it's like to talk about a little bit tonight I think the pressure's off a some people last night were concerned that we might never find out or it might take a while\nI felt it would be wrapped up pretty quickly apparently this guy left to fingerprint and also some perhaps DNA evidence on one of the packages that were sent I Believe the one that was set the Maxine Waters one of the stations reporter whatever this is their guy\nThis is their guy and he's a loser he's a loner fifty six years old apparently his mother kicked him out and he was\nLiving in that van and looked at that van ... plastered

importance Wednesday when the story really broke and Thursday yesterday when the story seemed to get even bigger and the number of people who had received these pipe bombs the number grew\nDo you think that this story\nHas any impact on the mid term elections one way or the other that's what I'd love to hear your way you know six one seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten

gave our sons and daughters and their life in a country\nLike annoyed I criticized him for that as well but I think it's whoever's elected president whether it's a Republican or Democrat it's perfectly appropriate for folks on the other side to criticize a and I think that with President Trump\nHe um he gives the as his opposition a lot of fodder for there a lot of ... ammunition I guess for their for their criticism okay mother fought a lot of cannon fodder he gives it to them I think\nYou're right that don't you think it ... the ticket could color shocked to criticize his wife
