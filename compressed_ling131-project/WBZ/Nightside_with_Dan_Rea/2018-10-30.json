evening I'm old enough WB news or top story this hour the world series champion red Sox are headed home from Los Angeles due to arrive this evening\nAnd investments for the long term\nBut also we have very reasonable expectations of where the markets are going what kind of ... um yield we will get from our investments\nAnd I think that's part of the success of Massachusetts we are a skills based economy\nWe have done better than most of the country um bounced back from the downturn of the of two thousand\nSeven eight nine very strongly\nAnd it's because of our innovative economy but at the government level it is because we had fiscal guidelines that were established in the early part\nOf the twenty first century meaning around two thousand two three and four and for the most part the state adheres to them\nThey do hear from me when they don't need to hear from them and it's something that I've been very very firm about ever since even prior my swearing in four years ago and it seems that many of the initiatives that I have been pushing their coming along a in doing so\nI wanted to I Want to talk about a lot of those initiatives would like to give your audience a little idea we're now forty billion dollar\nForty budget million dollar state budget but\nLast year we rent a surplus so explain so I understand I Know the finance managers understand that's a good thing about\nGovernment it's a it's very different and then a business or does it so to speak is that\nWe're required by law to budget or to what anticipated revenues will be well of course um if you put all the spending together there is a great deal more need\nThat much typically you can afford to budget for and the budget is based upon anticipated revenues there's a process that state government does through\nTo make a determination of what they think those revenues will be\nAnd uh the last couple of years we didn't see increased revenues in fact we had to readjust what we were anticipating quite a number of times as did many many states in the country\nAnd so this past year with a conservative budget we ended up doing better than what was anticipated and so they what was good about the surplus [noise]\nUm I for those of you are in finance and accounting you know all about reserves\nRainy day funds the stabilization fund well this state was not replenishing it and the way in which they needed to and even on the local level when I was chairman of the border to select when in Brookline I Would start every town meeting by saying we do nothing that harms the rainy day fund\nBecause we don't want to harm the bond rating\nAnd in Brookline they adhered to that\nWhen I got to the state level I had seen that they had been spending down that fund\nFor years and years even in the good times well rainy means rainy\nAnd so consequently I have been pushing for them to replenish that\nAnd they have started to do it last year and a ... a part of the surplus went into the rainy day fund and for the first time in a long time we're over two billion dollars in the rainy day fund my goal is that that fund would get up to four billion dollars\nFor two billion dollars up against the forty billion dollar budgets to five percent and I'd ready to the ambulance added doubled\nI'd like to see it be ten so that's why you have to get me back in there so I can continue to push those folks\nAh yeah well I'll tell you I think that the legislature I'm with a speaker to Leo uh who is also a boss blood school of ... uh like uh like your husband and me and um\nAnd my dad and and your dad rants

I'm not department of revenue or taxation but I Do have feelings about it and sell Massachusetts is always one that is also one of the ... you know we passed proposition two and a half percent\nIn the Nineteen seventies which limits the amount of taxation two two and a half percent plus new grows\nIt is a debate between a lot of different people Massachusetts had a reputation and list called tax that use it for a very very long time\nAnd there is um music means distance on changing the tax code it would require I Believe even could be a constitutional issues or the state in order to do that and I I went up\nThere was just an advisory opinion from the sea which felt that this a valid question a was a yes or the millionaires tax was where it gets a little bit it's going to go back to ... ... it's\nAn extremely complicated issue that um would need tremendous collaboration on between all sectors within the state on and something that a plate of right and we're having been a local elected official it was very tough on local community we have\nTwo minutes left thank you for the question is a great way to have a ... and I was still a lot of headless your\nHi I'm Zoe I'm an accounting major Nichols I'm from western mass actually and as a senior in college I'm obviously graduating with our student loans I can speak for a lot of people here that probably has to monsters out it was just wondering what your recommendation would be to pay off that debt [noise]\nGet a great job and we wish well\nFor women in particular what I'd like I Want you guys and we all live within minutes later one minute you're just isn't against guys\nIt is an absolute fact that women suffer from the wage gap\nIt just happens for the and it starts happening three to five years out of college\nIt makes it harder for you as a woman to pay off your loans even more so than a guy this is a family show this is an economic issue for everybody and so what we've done in my office as we've worked with the business world\nHelping them understand it helping them learn how to change it because companies that pay every body what their worst\nArab more creative and more innovative and that means paying women and people of color exactly what you pay everyone else and so we have done that internally in my office thank you and we you do that figure it out by doing an audit of your company\nMcKenzie Pew state street data shows you how the quality and opportunity equality in wages you you are more innovative more creative and more profitable suffered young women\nPlease go to equal pay and da di ... on that as my website it's going to explain a lot to you and it will help you as you move forward because it'll give you a better chance to pay down your debt\nReally great question thank you very much for that question we're going to continue or the other side of the news with a interesting pedal on marijuana and where it is right now but I Want to ... a grave robber paws so treasury debt over\nThere to talk to some of these young students as a um during the\nDuring the spring the habit southerners who will be back to the other side of the night a glock news with Don up from Nicholas college you're Dudley, Massachusetts state\nWith a go to this is\nDan re unified your home and say big on energy bills with window world so they want to do to thirty or forty six seven eight one to two thirty four forty six other call\nFrom Ninety nine dollars a minute to\nLong roofing ... ring central the global leader in cloud communication and collaboration solutions for your business for free trial visit rings central dot com ringing central communicate collaborate and connect [noise]\nW.

the appropriately named Daniels auditorium I appreciate that uh the last president now the president but maybe this this auditorium Daniels auditorium turkey for much\nLet's go away to the bat I think that uh Rachel has a question or back there go right ahead\nHi my name is ... and ... and I'm In a criminal justice major\nUm we can try to enforce the rules and regulations see now against legalizing marijuana and I just said and how the police departments are going to decide whether they're going to do with the U.S behind motor vehicles\nWell that's a great question that's a great question you know how to check a cheap for drunk drivers alcohol related blood alcohol content Hi what are you gonna do what you think someone's a little high\nWell so um\nI happen to be on the ... commission as well so\nUm that's another whole commitment it always ends yeah it was started as part of the statute or so there's a whole commission of people that are together from various disciplines that are going to come up with some\nRecommendations for the canvas control commission and to the state on how we should handle the operating under the influence issue some of the issues that we saw\nUm after you get them back as far as medical marijuana were uh open container of marijuana in a motor vehicle driving under the influence of marijuana I'm\nOpen and how can you tell someone is driving the is well there's there's there's a it'd be our says a train 'em to detect those types of things observations yeah they make they make observations there's still\nNo breathalyzer nothing like that\nRight as I Know there's no breath test or anything like that um basically here in Massachusetts a\nWhat we did is um we have drug recognition experts which are a specially trained officers that I can bring somebody a and give them test back at the police station\nThe problem with that is that we don't have what's called implied consent like we do for alcohol so when\nWe arrest somebody for operating under the influence of alcohol that brought back to the station and they were offered to take a breath test right and then if they refused that tests or they can lose their driver's license with ... with oh you why drugs we don't have that mechanism we only have the DARE\nUh and if they refuse to re there's no there's no consequences to the ... on the drug recognition next right up just a check in\nMassachusetts had a very important case the Supreme judicial court may um weighed in on\nA case called commonwealth versus gear hot um they found that police officers as layperson could not get on the stand testify that a person is so called impaired by marijuana on that but they could offer a what's called roadside assessments so when they're on the roadside they can still give\nThe same field sobriety tests that we would give for us somebody under the influence of alcohol except\nThese tests um the we wouldn't be able to testify to the outcome of that okay so we can testify to our observations but not really make an opinion as to whether or not that person's impaired\nSo how do you get that Evan so you do a roadside testing someone can walk straight line you can get it in a in a in a DUI alcohol yes but you can't get in a marijuana case at this point\nRight so what you have to do is you got to go back to the Oscars observations why was the ... maid and the first place um what was that person's behavior their attitude their demeanor um ... you know they have the class he blood shot eyes um\nIf he had marijuana Janice that classic question in your opinion in your professional opinion officer was the individual under the influence you can ask about alcohol but not marijuana that's correct end of the year ... you cannot well this is why did they why the distinction\nWell they they the distinction is because of the the scientific evidence to support alcoholic the breath the breathalyzer is is very scientific and it's been validated over and over again\nBut if someone doesn't take a breathalyzer and a and they're willing to have a license suspended the officer can still off of their opinion without the benefit of the breathalyzer\nRight they can testify based on their ...\nBut they can't based upon their training and experience in terms of marijuana that's interesting I think\nThey can testify to the results of the field sobriety tests so you'd probably all seen the you know the the police officer during a field sobriety tests right they make the one leg turned the the one leg to stand the\nI'm saying the alphabet they they give a series of tests those are all validated a field sobriety tests and specific for alcohol so um we also use those tests for OU why drugs but they're not as valid data to support 'em\nDrugs as as much as they offer out now so that's where we we run into the problem\nWith what what we'll do is how will respond to what is the same we've always responded to it but we do need more tools are available to law enforcement in order to affect a plea deal with the uh operating under the influence\nAnd it was a swab test is that\nHas any of the central\nUm I think it could ... the problem the problem with marijuana impairment or\nSomeone was placed on the rest of our operating out of the ... influence of marijuana is that the swab test um THC acts differently in the body than alcohol does alcohol\nOr as water so soluble it it it processes very quickly um marijuana OTC can stay in your system longer um in different forms of a T C active THC can stay in your body up to twenty four forty eight hours in the inactive THC can say in your body upwards of a thirty days\nSo it just by swapping somebody alone\nIt can help tell us that somebody has THC in their system it may even be able to tell us that those active DC so that person may have used within the past few hours but it doesn't really tell us like a breath test um that this person is impaired you know we don't have a per se limit\nOf ... you know point zero wages per se limit Massachusetts for under under the influence of alcohol we don't have a limit like that set for um\nI think my in one way or ... this is another area where industry can partner with public health and safety official so for example when Syrian natural or just days after we got that first cultivation products manufacturing license or we produce the public service announcement the talk very specifically about the dangers of driving while impaired\nWe have the first point of contact as the providers of this type of substance to the folks that actually purchased ... boots on the ground in our shops and still providing education on the dangers of driving while intoxicated\nOn the dangers of taking too much at any given time those are things that that we can do a in partnership with law enforcement and remember\nYou know this is uh we're we're him growing a brand new industry here in the commonwealth of Massachusetts the regulated cannabis industry whether it's medical or recreational it's very important to remember that word regulated\nBecause if anybody thinks that the marijuana industry didn't exist five years ago before marijuana past medical marijuana pass or doesn't exist today and the unregulated market place they're wrong and you're not going to find drug dealers off the street partnering with law enforcement to put out public service announcements about impair driving and and educating folks at the point of sale\nCom I this is very Armstrong are you a saber spender if it's the latter making sure that you have enough money

I I agree with that um the the the two separate laws to separate regulations they are going to um they're going to move medical marijuana from the ph under the cannabis control commission a there are a lot of advocates on the a chemist advisory board that um are you know pushing for the\nThe advocacy of the medical marijuana side and I think that it it's going to be a it'll it'll be fine next question rates you who do we have\nUm Alex magazine from Oxford, Massachusetts and I know they have a limit variant liquor licenses that are allowed and I was there and um they're going to do the same thing for the marijuana industry\nI'm Sorry did she say those are the limits of license is a lot of any community I guess what you mean right\nIt's a complicated answer and a ... you know if you want a more detailed answer you could take a look at the recreational marijuana regulations but essentially if a community wants to allow cannabis to come into their community\nThere is technically no limit however the board to select men local town administrators all have a a a veto power over whether or not a ... a company comes into the community so that sort of gaining issue right there\nFor those communities that have banned a recreational cannabis they'll never have even a single one and there's some middle ground in between for for a variety of different cities and towns but it's not me unlimited like liquor license\nSo yes so what you're saying is that what time do you live in Oxford\nOkay she'll Oxford said yeah\nOne for sure to three boil\nAgain it would be governed by or what they call the community a host agreement must be given by the community in order for the company to get a license from the state so that is\nYour question okay we're ever going to go next here we go away and it has a question where the guy we were in the red Sox drifts to license or by the way\nThat ah my name's ... I'm a sports management for Mr initial island and I my question is uh in the past four years since January twenty fourteen the state of Colorado has brought in five and a half billion dollars in revenue just from marijuana sales alone\nOr my question is if it were to be fully recreational legalize in Massachusetts and and then in the United states what'd you see similar economic effects in this day and in this country\nI think we have no reason to think we wouldn't we have a population here in Massachusetts a slightly larger than Colorado a and as the chief alluded to earlier I think that a per capita consumption of cannabis here in Massachusetts is is higher than Colorado so I think we would probably see quite a jump\nIn revenue chief just on the attacks and the revenue side of things okay I I don't think it's a it's prudent to look at the amount of money that you're bringing in and tax revenue without looking at\nThe unintended consequences and the impact of something that it has on society in fact I saw it in the news the other day that our insurance rates are going to increase because of\nLegalization and more people are likely to drive under the influence of\nMarijuana and therefore the Irish aren't rates are going to go up um people are dying and crashes the the addiction and\nThe other cats either way from Colorado on either accidents indoor injuries fatalities\nThere is that the the fatal crashes in Colorado ... went up significantly um whether or not you can attribute that to legalization of not um [noise] is\nYou don't always causes a look at ... bomb but don't know I mean we all know\nThere's data that suggests that but you know if you have to be careful in saying that it correlates with each other but um you know the ... I think that we can expect I just because of\nThe attitudes and behaviors of people that you know they're gonna they're gonna think and we have done the awareness that it does cause impairment but there are going to be the people that are going to push the limit and therefore there's going to be increased\nBy Columbia showed the spot do you think there'll be increased fatalities ender are accidents and I think\nThat any time you're talking to me anytime that ah that you increase or this type of activity you're going to see a a sort of combination increase in in negative consequences the question is\nUh you know at what at what larger societal cost\nSo you keep it a prohibited you also see negative consequences and you can be fatalities involved in in Kansas prohibition as well and variety contacts so it's really a complicated picture and we've got to look at all of those inputs before we decided society direction we want to go and I think the Colorado and Washington and they're pretty good petri dishes eventually\nThey would uh in certain cases yes I don't disagree\nThey'll get thrown up um we have less than a minute left so we have run out of time but I just like to

course I'm speaking of the massacre at the synagogue tree of life in squirrel hill and Pittsburgh\nThis past weekend and it's really obviously very tough and this ... act of\nA criminal and I do have a lot to say about it I Want to hear from you six when seven to five or ten thirty I spoke about it on my show last night as well\nAnd there a couple of very important things that I Want I Want everybody to\nRemember and talk about and spread the word I'd like to see others in the media talk about it and first and foremost is to please stop calling this man insane or\nDeranged or reference that he had mental health it is a diversion to what the real problem is and that he is a cold hard criminal [noise]\nI think it's important to make the distinction because a lot of people have mental health diagnoses but they don't go around picking up guns and shooting people and they think it does a disservice to providing care to people with mental health and\nThat it it\nPeople with mental health I'm a bad name and I think it minimizes the violence perpetrated by criminal and we need to separate out the singular category of sub humans like this man\nAnd I won't say his name because everybody knows it by now and I don't need to give him any press but he's subhuman criminal and just like all criminals\nThey do what they want when they want how they want they have extreme behavior they feel they never feel the ... to control themselves or do anything to rein in their emotions and they think they're special somehow\nAs if they have these feelings and they're allowed to take them out on everybody else and that others of us in the human race\nYou know don't have problems don't have issues don't carry [noise]\nMassive burdens and and therefore\nYou know he has a harder life or he they have some reason to justify why they do what they do and they pick yeah unfortunately I often the case the Jewish population because of the virulent\nStrain of anti Semitism in our country and other countries around the world and it's the you know historically\nThe Jewish people have been persecuted and so this guy felt\nUm that you know he could do whatever he wanted and we need to call out people like him as stone cold criminals there is no excuse whatsoever\nFor harming people for perpetrating violence I don't care if your mommy didn't hug you enough when you were a kid I don't care if your daddy didn't come to your sports games if you didn't have a daddy and you didn't have a mommy I have represented so many kids in foster care\nThat had zero support system yet they come out of what's not agree it's not a great system oftentimes as very well adjusted\nHad nice helpful I mean a lot of them carry problems and you know some of them do get in trouble but there's others that don't there's others that don't they\nThey find ways to do good in the world even though bad was done upon them and so if you're out there any potential criminals like this\nPiece of garbage and you can be saved from becoming a criminal\nI'm speaking to you you have feelings that are wrong and you are not allowed to take those feelings out on anybody else in any small or large way find a way to heal yourself find a way to do good in the world\nMake someone else's burden lighter make somebody else's day better but do not think for a second that because you had something bad happened to you that you are allowed to perpetrate harm against anybody else you or not you are not special\nNone of us is special in that regard all of us have burdens nobody gets out of this life without pain\nI mean maybe there might be somebody out there are small percentage of the human race the very few\nAnd just make yourself better or get off the train and take yourself out that's what I have to say to you\nIf you want to improve yourself and you want to be redeemed there are so many people out there willing to help you there are so many places that you could take advantage of there are resources\nBut do not dare\nTo think that would we we will treat you in any other way except the piece of garbage you are if you take a gun in your hand or any weapon in your hand and you use it to kill somebody this is unacceptable I Want to hear from you six when seven to five for ten thirty [noise]\nPeople have solutions of how you think we can prevent this and we're going to be talking about

me when I hear the people on the TV [noise] ah compare\nThis guy's a dislike of immigrants with Mr Trump's intention of not allowing the immigrants to cross that border mhm\nAnd like it and because she gets like minded with Mr Trump piece there Mr Trump is therefore responsible for his murders of Jewish people mhm\nAnd I just I mean ... what is the media is trying to push I mean there there's no freedom of thought in this country whatsoever\nI it just it just is outrageous that they would eat that they're trying to push that idea and to America it's very dangerous what they're doing\nWell they're trained on islands the act the president um yeah I\nI understand that yeah and what can only say Mr Trump's ... everything but a Jewish person I made it his daughter's choices Jewish\nGrandchildren pitcher which President Trump is so lover of Jewish people and all of Israel loves him my family is is a former senior this real I'm the son of a Jewish man I'm a mom what you call a ... Shiites you mhm\nBut I still you know I still love my ... and I ate pork and et cetera et cetera and cultural you know my culture still stays right I I find I find it learn believable that they would even trying to see what Mr Trump might be and I got six just\nIrresponsible days or whether they're ... and the two issues okay and\nUm there is this um ... they're complaining the tuition and trying to make this about immigration in their eyes you know the as the as if\nThere was a direct correlation um you know this guy would have found ... criminals so this is what the media's do any first of all its mind blowing that they're this stupid that you know they're taking the guy's rant and they're saying well he was upset about the caravan air go\nThat's what caused him to act today I mean if you know anything about criminal behavior is it they're going to do it at some point it's just like the timing is is a matter of um circumstance but they will they will find a way and they will they will they were perpetrate violence\nUm if knowing stops them or gets in their way and then um the media is now like\nBack back back I'm\nBack failing in right you know according to his ranch like taking his ... like this is just it's it's really this is what's not and if I Want to say nothing dangerous it's dangerous because area go\nI'm that way if if this guy so now if if this anti Semitic murderer um had\nSome conservative actor had done that while Obama was president of got the media would just be their hair would be on fire\nAnd then there's that there's a play that was done you know where they killed Trump in the end and um [noise] so it's and let's see what else do we have oh we have the\nThe violence the riots the antifa you have the people in Oregon and the left is shutting down traffic we had that happen here um we unload the privileged kids who apparently have time on their hands to sit across Ninety three and\nBorrow the rest of us from our daily chores and I just find it completely repugnant and I'm entitled is very entitled because this is this is a little lazy\nActivism I Know that's an oxymoron\nBecause these people don't want to do the hard work of I don't know maybe getting their community together and go into the elected officials and asking for change or you know making change happen\nBy having their voices heard and doing it repeatedly every month showing up the office making an appointment\nYou know the ... stick to it of this type of activity that actually changes the world\nAnd you know the consistent responsible behavior and no they don't have time for any of that because that's just for soccer is right that is just for a responsible adult people who believe in\nDemocratic change and doing things from the bottom up no they just want to throw their fits in perpetrated their violence and their rhetoric and then\nWhen Trump pushes back then it's all like they all scurry under the covers and and plead victimhood it's it's really disgusting um there's so many more examples that we could give but it's and it's actually a neat little trick they have because\nEvery time they attack Trump anybody who tries to\nWho tries to weigh in on the policy Trump supports even if\nYou know I don't support every way the Trump does everything but if I weigh in and support a policy like for example immigration that Trump supports than\nThan they label anybody who says anything positive about the president as in league with him and you as a racist as this that or the other thing and that\nIs done on purpose my friends to shut down dialogue they are the fascist they are the fascists we're\nGoing to go to rod in the car hello Rob you're on the air\nOr him very much enjoy your show thank you for bringing this job for the barn or destruction OK You're welcome I'm I'm I'm a supporter of President Trump but are are you all for mhm or as you said you know it seems like they're only standard is a double standard these days\nI didn't get credit for that Steve from brain treated say that but it's good [laughter]\nYeah and I do agree with Steve Steve with us or a goat opening up the ... and maybe I'm revising a lot of our\nLegislation around you know certain people who um who needle\nMhm ... ... it's a ... and empowering the courts and law enforcement throughout mhm what do they all stuff it's it's similar to how polarized we are as a country\nI think it brings up the real extreme cases who really you know go to war over their point of view or whatever it might be mhm\nAnd you know it's just a crazy time and we I don't think we're ... like what I did want to pick\nYour brain real quick about one thing I wanted to or something or you know those shorter out in Vegas the guy who you know shot and doing wrote a concert there yes mhm\nUm I don't know much about it in Idaho where can you ever an inside track in what we are very interested in hearing your thoughts because we never turn a gardener you for a solution um\nWhole thing and I'm just wondering if you weren't sure what your thoughts are about what do you think's going on there and ordered him like the real story is behind the story um would back I I'm just\nI'm just curious I mean the fact that he shot into a country music concert just garner makes me wonder if\nYou know it was somebody on the left he was somebody on the on the left

Jerusalem as the capital of Israel which certainly an anti Semite would not do know who did beat him\nAnd I think what they've done in the media they have created in Trump mythological creature they made in my first of all being a racist how could it be a racist when he pardoned two black people you know recently I mean if you look at\nI mean it it just doesn't hold out and he's against immigration needs against illegal immigration actually and I love your article in the sun I get to you every day and I I Love it when I read your radical linking it with you\nI don't like the double standard I myself deplorable morning there mhm so it's just I and I used to be a Democrat but I don't know this party and you know I don't know them anymore\nThey don't exist in their their their their previous form is pretty much gone and yeah\nAnd I mean it could have come like you know maybe there's some moderates out there who can bring it back I I don't know at some point in time and they realize that they have gone so far afield but Anastasia I mean I really appreciate your comments and it's a year to say and actually many people have said\nAnd I'm a ... the Trump is actually the most pro Israel\nPresident that we've had and so\nThey don't care about the facts and they don't care about the fact they apparently think we're stupid ... wouldn't just take whatever they felt without looking at the actual facts of the situation it is I don't understand what's going on with the media I really don't but if it gets really got\nIt has they do think we're stupid and that's what's really insult enhanced Asia is that if um you know they all taught the ... ... talk in lock step in these talking points and they blame Trump for everything as if and this is I I really think it's horrible because it's so dangerous because it's like they repeat repeat repeat propaganda\nAt some point it becomes propaganda instead of them delving into the facts and just reporting on the facts and letting people decide\nThey're trying they're making the conclusion and they're not supposed to make conclusions they're only supposed\nTo I have never seen the media like this before so bad I don't remember ever being this bad I mean truly can only\nBlatantly prejudice well\nYeah and there is did they the problem is and if they should they went from actual reporting to this you know sort of\nCoffee roundtable discussion with people who aren't experts who don't know what they're talking about they're filling twenty four ... filling their right twenty four seven and I just it's just descended into this madness of everybody yelling at each other I Can't I don't watch it I\nI like to watch you know where there's maybe one two or three people and they're having a cogent calm conversation they might be disagree and I see a lot of them disagree\nBut they they give evidence to their discussion and they back it up and they cite sources\nUm you know where they're getting their information um but that takes a little more time to produce and put that kind of thing together and a lotta newsrooms have become very lazy they just like slap slap someone on you know put someone slept someone on the net slap stick somebody up in the\nUm the teleprompter had them talk for three minutes and then it's going to break right now I'm exactly\nThank you Anastasia thank you for reading my up and the little son numb\nIf and I agreed with it if you do there will be more [laughter] okay great thanks again have a good night if they get by by\nOkay everybody sorry about that that was my bad I'm going to keep talking about this and we're going to take a quick break I'm Marie said Franco filling in for Dan ray [noise]\nLike side with Dan ... news watch members da dum de ... tens or [noise]\nIf you drive doesn't sound like this\nYou know it's time for broad\nWe can we use the ... only four to four no she ... will drive were just read among excitement has never been more fast fair and simple upgrade your drive but he was short one mile [noise]\nHumans may change with the season with the elements that makes ... an Audi cue five two point oh gee premium all wheel drive the ideal SUV me on [noise]\nSafety comfort and performance at least one now for just three sixty known among lose a primary was to take advantage of their faster\nAnd civil approach to car minority Westwood dot com before ... who's ... who was on a coupon for six months which was which was always present in terms of what you find that was before anyone talking to you know security part of a\nSkier or just some on the dot com ski and snowboard Xcel resented by ... it was the world Trade Center sixty percent of gear including a contract for the thing is they all get as Foley deals on what's there to see the process of vacation from New England for us and Canada WB the TV's whether\nWriters Ariel Sharon releasing fitness challenge and laundry all here Garton drinking ...

know a ... so I said it's a responsible to say the least oh extremely\nIrresponsible and in front of\nMe personally what they've done is they've taken all the fun out of the upcoming midterm elections I'd like\nTo hear the facts I Want you know I Want to know uh you know the interesting in the excitement of vote you know\nIn this particular case or the Democrats going to overtake the hosts are the Republican Republicans going to hold on to the Senate show me what racist but no CNN has got to go up there and point fingers are pointing fingers are pointing fingers and there's three major networks and Canada\nOne has followed the same sick\nOr when you as a CNN and the other two at least\nI'm seeing the global those that have been a while um but I I I just wanted to say that uh um you know that their policies have to change or or ... become irrelevant because it is terrible reporting\nThey are it is awful and they're circling the drain and it's not just a center sane at Richard I'm I don't know did you see I think it was and I own a double check wasn't it Ted Koppel who who was yes it was it was Ted Koppel and did you see it you can check it out on line with Brian's down there and couples basically like you know\nTrump is making your ratings for you and you know and it was just like the way Koppel delivered it it's just like you know it was just so I'm a just point blank right and he he startled\nUm seltzer because you know you would have thought like they probably think like oh and you know Ted Koppel he's immediate guy he's on my side and couples like right and he called them on it and so and he's not the only one and they are just\nThey are using Trump for their ratings and um oh yeah who said\nThat I think it was um at Les Moonves right from CBS you remember only sixty campaign that the electricity Les Moonves who's now an email yeah secrets out about him right in saying that you know Trump may not be good for America but he's definitely good for our ratings\nBecause that's all they care about is the money and the ratings right\nExactly and and I'm Sorry if if you're a news agency\nYou know I I I Want to know how how are you know a\nSomebody's doing in the ninth congressional district in in Massachusetts\nBecause of that going to the race you know [noise] what they're doing is just a just extremely poor journalism and like I say it'd be great to see them become\nIrrelevant and obviously that's not going to happen and\nI think they are I think they are to the extent that obviously people are changing the channel or they're going into other sources like what you're saying exactly as Richard I said since I've been running since I ran for office and before that\nIs that all they do report on the um it's basically a way to shut down democracy because they're not reporting about all races equally they're not reporting on all candidates equally they're not informing Americans about the candidates who are up\nFor office and it's it's just complete shutdown of true democracy and true journalism because um you know they they don't interview if you don't have X amount of money so they decide they decide who gets the most media time right and so therefore they make the artificial I mean we think we're having free and fair elections give me a break\nUm because it's just ... they it's just based on the media I'm picking and choosing the people they want you to hear from\nOfficial that was a great word to describe things I'm\nA daring thing air sides Richard [laughter] I I\nI Love it when we're able to learn from one another and I wish one of the things we didn't Canada in terms of our election of pro says this is Heather ... terms because I think right now Mr Trudeau might find themselves in a great deal of trouble but anyway\nUm I I think I think the twenty three seats up the Democrats were hoping for may now be in jeopardy\nAnd when it's all said and done I Hope they have the uh the chutzpah to put their finger at CNN because it may be the one agency I'm that thinks or their ally but maybe the part of the wrongdoing\nAnd themselves to extend archer call on Sunday and you know we'll talk again
