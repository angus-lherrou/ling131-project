took this whole thing going on with cattle per se as I say it was about twelve years old I was accused of something or it pretty stupid or someone called this girl over the weekend that just called her but he said sexual things\nSo for some reason she thought it was me I had nothing to do with it\nSo the police came and they arrested made for a\nWhile a twelve and\nWhile I was six foot or twelve years old\nCome on what is your window that if you were six foot forward twelve ... what did you end up at\nI always six five two [laughter] and\nSo I got a rust belt fortunate that night I got arrested by the police but father was working on a car so I was stuck down there in a search crimes unit for about five hours as a twelve year old that look that much older though I was\nSo fast forward I had to go to court for the now at the time my father was in a hospital my mother didn't drive so we're from Philadelphia we were just on the outside of Philly we ought to take a bus at a subway downtown three separate occasions the girl and her parents found out it wasn't me\nThey never showed up three times we had a ride down there and go out and prove it all the all time I got

o'clock news 'cause I'm up in the nine o'clock news I Want you to finish the story on the other side thrown us short day right there is an important call here comes during house with important newscast better call\nFrom Ninety nine dollars a month\nDue to loan roofing dot com with free support for life awaken one eighty stands for your success if you need to lose weight you wouldn't once and do it right with the long term solution for weight loss awaken one eighty weight loss\nExactly so you know they've got me a locked up and they could have happened I was a lot about what the what these other people you know I was just a kid and you can't you know I was terrified I couldn't show it because you know they would have just looked at me as a victim\nRight\nSo what why is let me ask you why do you think the police ... how long ago was this if I could ask how many years approximately\n... this this would have been eighty four\n...\nSo Nineteen eighty four so we're talking about right around this this era\nOf ah the allegations against judge Kavanaugh and the police would they would just say to you once you confess and then what would they offering first of all you didn't do it what would they offering as an incentive for you to confess\nThat way you want to have to go to court just get it or what you'll get probation it's no big deal and there's a book but our medicine so this is a big deal\nYeah big deal you sure\n[noise] so I I learned at a young age that it's all you know if people don't realize it was so it makes it accusation right or wrong that's there yeah\nAnd I assume anything's ... et al did did I Hope you didn't confessed did you go to trial\nI did I what happened was I had to go downtown Philadelphia\nJAG Corps juvenile court I sooner\nCourt so my father was in a hospital and my mother did drive so we had to take public transportation and we went down the first time we thought there was the last episode of course they didn't let the people never showed where to go three times the third time as I finally just mass\n... non in uncommon story and so the case was dismissed you you've never were are judged um culpable in any way shape or form\nA well\nA good ending did you ever get a sense of why this young girl did you know the girl who made the ... who made the allegations\nThat girl and I I ... well shared call my friend's house that will stand by ... around the corner from me and my best friend she called U.S House the weekend prior and I hung up on it ... or whatever is in that\nGot upset by that and I don't know that was the reason she really thought I was on I was making a call\nUnemployed yeah did um I was told to stay away from her and I did\nI bet you did she ever approach you at any point later on and say hey al I push it through a bad circumstance and um I Want to apologize\nNever ever well she's got to carry that I Know he's got to carry that way I don't even know she cared but that's\nWhy people don't realize how to make it a is a ... you know you just make sure it's true and I feel like if you do what you saw something in there and that's it and then the people that may be accusation should there should be some type of penalty for making a false accusation\nWell they can be a big big big there there's certainly can be but in a situation like that first of all I I question now again in how the police they simply took her word they should have been some investigation Don ...\nMore than them telling you want you to plead guilty and you'll get probation is no big deal was a big deal to U. L. thanks to standing tall and and dealing with it and thanks fair share and thanks for your call tonight it's important it's an important story here because\nThere are false accusations I mean there there are false convictions the DNA the Innocence Project has shown that the individuals in prison for serious crimes up too including murder had been convicted wrongfully\nUh and and the ... the justice system is a delicate balance\nIs a delicate gallon balance between the due process rights of the defendants and the rights of individuals to um to file charges and say I come back to this story about Julie sweat Nick ten ... ten gang rapes she goes to the Montgomery County police and nothing comes out of this\nI mean sometimes you know it just comes out of common sense\nAnd what people make these ridiculous stay let's and I'm not saying it's true or not true but sometimes you just really have to look at it and and does it does pass the smell test and a lot of times it really does it I think people want to believe it because they hate Trump so much\nWell there's a little bit of that but still it by saying it would seem to me\nThat for for Julie sweat Nick to say on to MSNBC yeah we went to the police we told the police I mean gang rapes that's\n... ... ... I guess you get one of these things that he said she said and the police sometimes might look at the two of them and say well gee how do we decide who's who's telling the truth was this consensual I get the frustration there and I get we saw that played out last week but\nYou're telling me this all sorts of witnesses to gang rapes and they couldn't find these kids back in in Montgomery County and find the kids who weren't involved in the gang rapes and say look you know if you were there you go to the problem but if you can tell us the truth of what happened there and we can we can actually put the people the way who did this horrific thing\nI just think this you know it's implausible to think that allegations of ten gang rapes would not have been taken seriously by any police department in America and I don't care where\nBut that what you're gonna get when you're ... you're going to get multiple other people make accusations to try to make the initial accusation credible\nFollow the more reason that the police yeah that can happen to I'm not suggesting it could have been totally made up but for her to go to the police you know what I'm saying for her to go to the police and say well the way it's crazy thank you al thank you very much that could have a great for you to\nSix one Seventy five or ten thirty triple a nine to nine ten thirty my name's Dan read this night side we do expect\nTo be talking with Alan Dershowitz professor Dershowitz later on in this hour I don't know that he will have the opportunity to take phone calls but he certainly will have a lot to say in the meantime I Want to hear from you what will happen what will transpire whip the Kavanaugh nomination and what sort of the time table do you put on it\nI Believe that it's going to be resolved certainly by the end of the week uh I Will be stunned if it goes over into next week\nNight side with Dan Rather than news watch never stops W.

the news from around the world to know whether to gather any given day I was\nTo our responsibility to make sure you the best informed [noise]\nBecause we live you're too easy names when the dirty\nLittle ... hey Danny Danny Danny welcome to them they die early on the radio\nDi di di di di di radio ten thirty [noise]\nWe're focusing\nTonight obviously on the calf Kevin on nomination process a confirmation process I should say uh and during the first hour we played three songs from an interview on MSNBC with Julie sweat next she is the third accuser she's the one who was talked about\nI think ten parties in which gang rapes were involved so let's continue with our conversation and let's go to George\nIn graft and I'm going to try to move people a little bit more quickly here because we're falling a little bit back some folks have had a lot to say George you go right ahead\nYeah part of the of the Democrats is just unbelievable yeah yeah they're they're they're trying to say that you shouldn't be confirmed because you don't just drinking impact meantime they have a candidate for the Senate daring checked says hey don't work\nWell and and there's even some evidence that he that he left us that he tried to leave the scene but they think is the greatest thing since sliced bread or the it's just unbelievable and and\nThey try to say that there are women but in the ... when Bill Clinton was a\nRape Juanita Robert she broke Kathleen ...\nAllegedly oh these are all allegations but but we also want to mention the allegations against Keith Ellison who's running for attorney general in Minnesota\nOr who his his girlfriend has accused that as recently as a just a few months ago he was physically abusing her dragging her across the floor\nUm that's a lot more recent than than what ... what Dr Ford indeed may have gone through but there seems to be a blind spot there are amongst the hierarchy of the Democrats to call Keith Ellison actions into just to examine them to investigate them\nCory Booker the Democratic senator from New Jersey he has admitted he said that it that he broke the girl when he was a young man are Thomas carp or a senator from Delaware beat his wife I mean\nAgain that allegedly allegedly ... you know which one you know I just mean to throw that word allegedly India because [noise] uh no charges I Do know that a Sherrod Brown a the ... there were a restraining orders taken out against him during his divorce his wife is still standing by him politically there now divorced\nBut those those are actual I just want to make sure George that we don't do the same that others do and that his throat charges around you know we need to do I believe we need a Broderick yes I Do but there was no prosecution of President Clinton\nOkay now it's ... you know some some of your listeners have mentioned the fact that they said you know she just so many there I'm a that she didn't do that that she didn't warn friend that there was two rapists and the house right\nWell potential that they would not they were not rape is they were potential rapist and someone who was who was the first caller mentioned that sometimes when people are so terrified that they don't you know they they don't think\nSo she didn't she didn't help out our fan but let me add something to that if these two guys having this friend if they were intense are committing right why didn't they go after her friends and apparently they don't ... I mean the whole thing makes no sense\nThat doesn't mean that does not mean George than they do not was that ... that she's lying does not mean that they could not have assaulted her sexually assaulted her she never claimed that she was she wasn't raped whose own claim of rape but they could have sexually assaulted maybe they came to their senses I mean it doesn't\nYou know I just wanted to make sure George said that we try to keep it up on something of this\nStraight in our here that's all you you raise all sorts of good questions in issues and I thank you for doing it and I don't mean to to correct everything but I just want to you just want to Lebanon Lebanon the conversation a little bit okay 'cause I Know that you're very emotional about this\nGuy just say one more thing very quickly I'm sure I I did have a letter from college it was a letter from the comedian pat Paulsen endorsing by a run for class president\n[laughter] as I say that way yeah I ... I think we have all said the few letters but again I have in a letter that my friend Tom to refer to bubbles be interesting to look at it that's for sure thank you George\nOkay Bye bye have a great now we're going to go next to Paul up and bill recover pull your next in the ring central ...\n\nUh where he's not there we're going to put him on hold and we'll move on that's fair enough let's go to I'm a poet comes back to the phone don't want to lose him here in the meantime let me go to Mike in hooks in New Hampshire Mike you're next on the ring central names like ...\nOkay when I mentioned that so I don't want to take a stance on it than just what the listeners and you just something to think about when I was working with a girl some years ago she was a teenager I was in my early thirties\nAnd her boyfriend was accused of having relations with this one girl with his front so she was telling me at work about it give me the details [noise]\nI was trying to soften the blow to the way she was telling me that you know is probably guilty of what they were ... and what he went to court months and months went on and uh come to find out in the very end of it\nAnd the and this the point that I thought made which really convinced me that I think this woman is is tired of it she said that she went to the Montgomery County police circa Nineteen eighty to eighty three and told them about these ten parties\nWere gang rapes that occurred and I guess for police decided they weren't interested in pursuing that case\nIs that eating ... is that conceivable in your mind about\nIt I doubt it and I think the PR it'll look into it and look it she made an honest mistake that's one thing but if she sat there and did it to\nBe or not to be to be or not to be a PR jury a spell it and she made a decision that she was going to make up a story about a man she never met a man she didn't know the managers two or three years older than\nThat woman must be prosecuted convicted and then president\nAnd it's a very important part of me too movement because the world has to understand that most women who have been a soul tell the truth\nBut that a significant number of women who claim they have been assaulted either I'm mistaken or our little lion walking lying for the most deliberate willful financial and other reasons but we have to get rid of this notion that all women tell the truth that all men lie to the old white man\n... agents conduct but she has to be investigated this was an education moment for the world and we have to convey to messages want\nNobody gets away with rape or saw no matter whether you're Fifteen or Seventeen and twenty forty if you've done it and you pay the price but nobody gets away with making false allegation of rape or so\nAnd that has to be equal equal not to the ACLU\nThe ACLU says you believe the alleged victim and you are presumed guilty and\nIt's sitting up there is a mere suspicion on the ACLU I remember when it was really a civil liberties organization\nInstead of an anti civil liberties organization\nThat's that's the point you and and are good mutual friend hardly ... I'm right I Know have have have seen this organization is a change in in morph into something\nThat's eight to ten Ikle do what they want stood for let me ask you this\nShe was represented by counsel Michael ... um how do you figure out and he obviously is a\nA is a high profile has become a high profile attorney and not based upon his work as far as I Know in the courtroom as you over the years\nAnd in the classroom are you on so many high profile cases you're a high profile only because of what you did in the Simpson case of the costs from your case and in many other cases in your career as a professor at Harvard law school\nThis Avon Audi have any exposure here if his client is found\nTo have 'em executed a document that that might not have been accurate [noise]\nLet me start by saying what I think you do now I think he ought to withdraw her ... David and withdraw complain and her claims because now there is no doubt about whether they're accurate so that there is an ethical obligation if your doubts about the accuracy of\nThe day that there is an ethical obligation to withdraw so I think I have an army now as an ethical obligation to withdraw the affidavit\nI've also asked him to wait but lawyer client privilege so that she can be asked and she can be asked what was your original story did you help change it who first use the word gang where it was at his her word um was she in any way coach\nWe have to get to the bottom of this this is a very very important moment\nIn our history this could be as important moment in some ways as the me too movement\nA you know there has to be a nominee movement a movement that says no no I didn't know this woman I never met her uh she's making up at a whole lot a she's a ramp wire I'm not saying this about this particular woman but if an FBI investigation groups that case\nThere's every reason to make sure that women are deterred\nFrom coming forward with false stories otherwise we're going to see 'em rampant wise one after the other in an effort to get publicity that money to extort this is not an uncommon phenomena or our country today extortion by the\nActual conduct yeah so so now you talk about the a C O use seeming pivot on Sunday important concept of due process but there are others even within\nThe legal community who seemed to embrace that position and members of the United States Senate have embraced that position washing as it is going on in the country Allen\n[noise] well I think people in charge here either undecided women in the side of men during this either Trump to sign up and I try to try to there's a Democrats or Republicans I mean I'm caught in the middle and an anti Trump anti Republican liberal Democrat or you say on that\nNational board or the ACLU who's now literally disgusted with the ACLU and it would sound that the senators you know they say this was your job if you ever heard of a job interview where most of the people conducting it on one side has said we're going to die and your job no matter what you said we're going to do everything in our power to keep you from getting the job\nSo the ... for the job and you're never worked but once he was accused of the most horrible\nCrimes of gang rape is no longer a job that you you're required to process of law require a heavy burden of proof and no presumption that each side is telling the truth of\nEllen I've done my research as thinking knowing normally do and I and I got back to President Clinton's nominee Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg they both received somewhere in the vicinity of Ninety votes hum of ... bipartisan acceptance\nRepublicans and Democrats I'm Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were their votes were somewhere in the mid sixties I'm somewhat down from Ginsberg and dryer obviously but I'm Still a fairly substantial number of Republicans looting\nLook at school yeah look at Scalia unanimous\nYes precisely but so now Gorsuch against whom there were no allegations of impropriety that I recall a year ago seed fifty four votes three of whom are Democrats um all the senators from North Dakota\nAnd I'm In West Virginia\nI think Gorsuch was unusual because that was at revenge for denying Obama the\nRight to appoint Merrick Garland and the Republicans ... you're physically there they didn't need to get ... they didn't get a hearing they all say they're going to vote against him just because President Obama appointed him and it was the last year his term so you know the Republicans don't hold their head up so high\nWhen it comes to this either I think both sides have absolutely distorted what\nThe frame of the constitution had in mind for advice and consent frankly if the famous new have advice and consent process fish Supreme Court justices or they wouldn't put it in the constitution it's a disgrace to the constitution it's not something that today American should be proud of\nAlan Dershowitz as always thank you so much for um for for ... or it's going to be very interesting to watch this I Know that we don't know how it's going to turn out\nI I Want to ask you one final question that is that my sense is that this is now coming to a head and this will be resolved one way or the other within the next several days at the most am I wrong I think\nThat's right unless new information comes out but look the one thing I think all ... can agree to do is go red socks\nThis weekend on that point yes I Would I Would think

S. N. B. C. over the weekend she spoke with Kate Snow who's really good reporter by the way for MSNBC and also NBC\nOr and I thought they'd her um\nExplanation or there's a lot of inconsistencies as Alan Dershowitz alluded to uh she theoretically could be facing some legal jeopardy here uh I I don't know that that will occur but certainly Alan Dershowitz feels it should uh and we um\nI I just want to play the one soundbite which to me is the most\nInteresting the most ... incredulous I guess would be the way to describe it so slip make is talking about these parties where\nBoth mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present and where there were gang rapes or trains as she called them and she went into great detail in the affidavit anyway um she does say that she went to these parties ten of them\nNot one not to not three not find on a temp and its attempt once she became herself a victim of gang rape\nAnd she said\nYou hear her statement here in this discussion\nThat at the urging of her mother she went to the Montgomery County police and she would have us believe\nThat nothing happened that I guess\nIt just never was prosecuted which to me is crazy um\nTen gang rapes ... this is this is what she said you'll be you'll be the judge here we go this is Julie sweating the client of attorney Mr integrity himself Michael ...\nAfter your ... you described as a ... attack on new at a rape did you tell anyone Oh yes I contacted the Montgomery County police did and I also I told my mother and she cried with me she helped me the next day\nI was so distraught I Would I Want to make on a ... with the outrage is so hard for me and we spoke to\nThey I I vaguely remember people that I'm not quite\nSure and a hundred percent like sweat Nick's mother has since passed away\nWhat look also named one of the officers she said she spoke with that officer is now deceased NBC News verified he worked for the Montgomery County police at that time we have requested copies of any records but Montgomery County police officials said today it could take up to a month for them to respond\n[noise] records you would think that if there had been gang rapes in Montgomery County Maryland\nThat there would have been some public prosecution there would have been some institutional memory\nAgain in my opinion uh maybe I'm wrong [noise] uh I I Can't believe\nThat back in the day even in the day that some might now view as the dark ages the Nineteen eighties that police will have discounted allegations of multiple gang rapes at parties\nUm\nI teach do didn't seem to follow up on that question\nA and maybe she did it may be the answers wouldn't inadequate but Alan Dershowitz use as you heard him say\nUh that after David should be withdrawn or by my collaborator ... we'll see what happens I don't think that will happen so the number the number six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty what will happen to the judge Kavanaugh nomination my prediction here's my prediction\nMy prediction is there will be a resolution within the next few days and by the next few days I mean\nFour or five or six days maybe Monday at the latest it will be resolution [noise]\nAh my instinct at this point is I don't know which way it will go I don't know what the FBI report will say if the F. B. I. report\nIs in ...\nIn ... towards\nJudge Kavanaugh I guess his nomination will fail either in the Senate will be withdrawn if the FBI report comes back with nothing further\nMy suspicion is he will pass it will pass with less than fifty four votes because fifty four is the Gorsuch standard\nWe will go to phone calls gotta go to break I promise we got Bette Tina Patty and bought and then once they start to go will have room for you I Want to get as many of you as we can thanks to get Alan Dershowitz six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty\nNinth side with Dan re ... news watch never stops W.

we get you down as ... we had how many FBI investigation but this is the seven\nSeven [noise] I don't think they're going to find anything different\nAnd they tend to go back to the to the very people ... your your high school classmates your neighbors your call his classmates and now all of a sudden people are\nAre are seeing all these things that um you know that that I can understand I mean again if if if it's true it's true it sounds to\nMe like he was a very different person back then whether or not people have the ability to changes they mentioned Ted Kennedy changed and and then that she had I mean\nKennedy ... to ...\nYeah and I think it's that one or two dollars that I'm not I'm not a I I I I knew Senator Kennedy hum and I understood that he had um he had some refuses just no no way to to describe it Patty as always thank you much\nThank you and I talked to soon going to go next to even in Dorchester high evil unwelcome your next to the night side\nRight or you\nKnow receive on go right ahead what's your what's your thought on all of this evil on\nI think I'm Sorry I'm spiral [noise]\nYou're so you're not only ... it'd be good for it but you're going to pick a day okay [laughter] that's pretty good\nYou're sorry to say that though so this is what you hoped for\nWhile I'm On hold all the time that animal will\nYeah an evil and your your line is little are tough here tonight to you on a cell or you had said\n[noise] [noise]\nWere you only have I have my own you only get it right when I got a lot and I was on our data gathering on I got out\nCount getting me but I I I think\nHe probably will they I don't think that way and\nI really don't think that I went there and that ... that he had I don't think that we're thinking let's coach didn't do it and it was a good faith in the late ... again it and it\nAnd some ... some people in case he tried employed by where we might like when he got a little steep yawning you basically what that is it's not like he can't get it and I think yeah\nWell that's true but at the same time his entire reputation he had a very\nPristine reputation as a judge when he was nominated a lot of people say gee this is a great nomination\nHe's um more moderate than some of the people that Trump might have nominated a it sounded I mean he was sort of George Bush guy that's that's who this guy was he was he worked in the Bush White House um he was nominated to the federal bench by George Bush he was a George Bush\nDie not a Donald Trump guy per se a and now that reputation\nOr is certainly been be searched some would argue it's already in tatters\nAnd no one likes their reputation or\nIf it's not like he can't get any kind that you get any\nIt so many people who believe him\nWell how do you want to they don't they don't believe\nYou don't get a job again but if this is not true what he's being accused of it's kinda tough to take you know that's fast\nWhen he signed that when he signed on for when he when he accepted me and and not\nOnly to see any way anybody like that\nYes yes yes yes I agree with that but what I'm saying is if if he\nSigned onto this knowing that all of this stuff was out there you might argue with this guy was was foolish\nOr if he signed on and what this and this is not actually true or is it an exaggeration then you might then you may feel sorry for them I don't know what the truth is if I don't know where the truth is\nWhy would somebody why would somebody thinking about what he called him well why would she couldn't help for any any aid fly like she could tell and our family why [noise]\nWell um there are those who are saying that there you heard if you heard of Alan Dershowitz last hour he said that there are people who for whatever reason\nUm either imagine something I mean the opposite of and again I don't want to argue with you I just want to tell you that that I don't know where the truth is okay I'm waiting anxiously for the FBI report that's where I that's where I Am so let's see what happens hey you have your work did you tell me you had to work\nI'm here you know I\nI heard somebody ... ... and ... and ... getting a a cat and I got it had they had me she was there for a ... he ... he had more money here that much money do I\nWell I think that's a that's a huge leap of on\nThe couch I'm telling you right now I well\nYou're you're you're a better psychologist than I Am thanks it on I appreciate it but I'm up against the eleven o'clock news and you got to go to work\nI I I think the\nReal estate with this next hour if you're on the line we will get to your first up I promise if you're not you know the numbers were free support for life awaken one eighty stands for your success if you need to lose weight you wouldn't once and do it right with the long term solution for weight loss awaken one eighty weight loss better call\nFrom Ninety nine dollars a pound\nTo Dr Ford and that she did not feel like sharing it with too many people um that that answer in my opinions inadequate\nBecause the the letters leaked\n... if if that is her answer well what does she think what's the purpose of the letter she think she was supposed to do something what fits for them and took the trouble to write a letter\nOr I feel that that Dr Ford has been victimized by this process and I think been victimized primarily by the Democrats and the reason I say that is if this letter had been shared by Dianne Feinstein with ... with a Chuck Grassley to say\nAnd they had said look let's keep it on the down low\nLet's let's let's let's hope you're well the investigation was still going on and let's assume that they came to the conclusion that the letter was accurate\nOr then they could have easily disposed of Kavanaugh's nomination in August they could have great presidents have missed president you have you have a nominee here that\nI'm not going to pass because of this and then they could have a withdrawn the nomination a cabinet could have withdrawn his nomination and they still would have had time to to nominate a subsequent\nA candidate but the Democrats and particularly find science office held a letter and also we're told that Feinstein's office\nAdvised Dr Ford as to what law firms should represent her hand that law for him did not communicate to Dr Ford according to Dr Ford's testimony the\nRepublicans willingness to go to California and interview were in California privately\nOut of the glare of lights if she wanted to do it that way\n[laughter] yes I understand that I and I heard all of those things that you're just any of those things that you just mentioned [noise] but I I just her answer just truly Lance because I mean if she received a lot of she's supposed to do something with it and act on it confidentially but she'd get nothing\nShe used it as a political cultural at the eleventh hour [noise] gap is what she did a search you use it for political purposes and that's why I say that Dr Ford\nAnd she investigated why aren't they say why didn't you\nGet if I may be I think that and I believe they could be in the ... a Senate investigation going on\nWhat investigation an investigation\nBy the U.S US Senate Feinstein you know the ethics investigations I don't think she's going to go to jail or anything like that but I yeah\nI Do think that she basically took advantage of a doctor for it\nIt's a letter for political purposes it might it might it could and he didn't do very differently and I agree with you totally [noise] okay well thank you very much you raise a great point pre she in fact I\nHave a great now let me go next to we're going to go trends I assume that strong for Trevor Trevor in revere high treadmill or you\nHi Dan I'm a great it's a I'm On it to be on your eye hot ring central might side line that I\nI've been listening to you since day one that you've been on the air and I very rarely call in but you know this is one of those things you always wonder you know what makes people call in and I do and this has just been infuriating to me watching this whole thing\nUnfold as just the just the Scots thing nightmare our country is really going down the tubes [noise] I'm really embarrassed than ashamed ... what we've lowered ourselves too but I I but I but saying all that I you know I'd like to go with I hundred percent agree with you within the next couple of days this is going to wrap up and\nI think we're going to have a a a new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and it's going to be over and on and and like you always say the the American um [noise] you know a conscience of memory is short lived you know it'll go away and and he'll go on and do his job and and he'll go down in history is probably being one of the\nMore fair and even mind that a Supreme Court justices but I have a I have a solution\nGood great hunger only ... by the way they are with your kind words and thank you for being such a loyal nights I listener\nOh I Love you I Love I Love your your ah your your back and forth and I love it especially the fact that you give people that call in or if I don't agree with you you give them just as much a lot more time there's not many out there that do that I Love that about you\nThink a very fair very fair it on us but I I Want to say so we can put this all you know to an end or I you know all about his Catholic as you are\nI'm I'm you know I I go to church every Sunday but you know I Believe in God I Am you know a a good Catholic I keep I I've kept my nose clean never been in the back of a police car let's put it that way but I like to be I'd love to\nHear the exactly where I Am I'm never in the ... story or at least ... against my will or an\nExact every Sunday and I was disappointed in what is going on in this archdiocese as anyone especially as a dad with two children who I was bringing up during this this this tumultuous time but go right ahead Dr\n... three children here so I I totally agree with you I have three children and you know I'd be horrified if something happens then but um I was an altar boy back on the day and nothing ever happened to me so I kinda feel\nI was never at home maybe I never was the ... I was never in danger of being an altar boy [laughter]\nOkay so let's say the next Senate or a committee hearing on on judge Kavanaugh's nomination I'd love for someone to just stand up and say you know like they said they although the story goes on the Bible or what he who is without sin cast the first stone\nAnd see how how how you know how many people would really have the guts though they they have no shame it seems to me that many of the senators\nWouldn't be there wouldn't be a lot of rock throwing in the U.S Senate if that was the standard ...\nRight right if they if you know if they were all uh you know kept kept to their their their their virtues you know you look into the back on you spoke a little bit about some of them here and now you know they've been accused of this and accused of that [noise]\nNot not not all of them are a squeaky clean as they make themselves out to be you know and I think uh I think if a company the caller said that President Trump is going to withdraw his nomination but they're not listening to the news I I'm not sure what what their\nWhat their reasoning is but uh you know he's he's going full gung ho he's he's Brett Kavanaugh all the way\nI thought it would also I Would also think if you're just you're jumping from one second I Would also think that the fact I was listening Don house the Olympic on\nThis guy said he was saying that the indications are that the uh the FBI this issue might be wrapped up by tomorrow that seems to me to be some would argue perfunctory but ... but others would argue a sufficient\nAnd it's an honor that you never supposed to predict how we jury comes back you know when they drink is back quickly are slowly\nBut if the FBI investigation has really been wrapped up that quickly I Won it sounds to me like they probably weren't able to find much new\nUh than what my own food I agree\nMaybe their favorite maybe they have found a silver bullet which will end the nomination I don't know\nWhy don't you think that if the if Trump is trying to tell them you know all those employees and all those you know White House staff to kill his lawn standards or is it is a woman right doesn't drink and all\nThat it's not a home and he's an Episcopalian\nOh sorry sorry but he doesn't track I Know that that's part of his his thing I think the White House would be virtually empty you know I I don't know maybe some of our friends on the left will say oh the White House is empty but\nHell no really use it might be things that Donald Trump has been accused of that probably the ... would not out there we're going broke the trip we're all sinners okay it's as simple as that uh you know there's only one guy that I Know a a that came in with flawlessly\nRight right I have one last point if I might as a male only think go ahead I think yeah I agree with you know I agree\nWith you know what I was referring to I was I was not referring to some politician I was referring\nTo I don't know I Know I think we all know that there are no I'd like to say I I think this whole thing is for you know and you had a couple of calls that I thought what a testify for this\nUm you know I I think there's ... there's a new movements starting and you know we have the uh the me too movement out there going downhill but I think we were starting a huge movement you tour accused falsely you two were were were accused of something and and considered guilty in this country without any evidence\nYeah well let me just say this I I don't think we can lose sight of the fact that there are\nLots of bad people who live amongst us and there are lots of bad people\nWho will do what ever they can to take advantage of people not only sexually monetarily you easily see the scam artists who go around and and and and try to get money from older people they'll fix that drive you know all of that okay there's a lot of people\nWho will do whatever they can take to to basically take advantage of individuals' so we can't forget that there are women\nWho had been sexually abused or who are physically abused who were emotionally abused we we endearing then you also were physically and emotionally abused but we also have to understand that there are also people who\nDo not hesitate to levy charges which are which are baseless and that's part of our system which works so well you\nKnow in in in other countries at other times all they had to do was accused someone and at that point they went to the gulag or are they went to the to do the do the indoctrination camp for the re education center still what America is all about we can't forget that\nHim to hide maybe I'm not understanding your question\nMy question is when you have a bunch of Democratic senators who\nCame out against this guy's nomination\nYes uh even before his name was present there was some Democrats were going to oppose whoever\nTrump nominates a what do you think [noise]\nGarland issue so that that that's my answer to that\nTheir handler again Rob I don't know why we're getting his feedback let me talk to and you talk and we can maybe work this out um so if the answer to that issue\nIs okay um this is a Merrick Garland feedback or this is payback excuse me and therefore anything goes you guy guys I'm gay Garland a hard time\nUh and therefore we're not going to accept a ... what are you too might come back to my question\nIf he said you know what a devil's triangle was it oh yeah oh bar that was my nickname bart I was bought yeah do you think those Democrats would have turned around and said you know what those guys are pretty honest guy he's telling us he\nKnows the devil's triangle maybe ... maybe we'll change your mind we already came out against him we've already come out against them but ... well this'll pulled him over the line do you think that would have happened\nBecause I think that aside from this whole issue um went for I think they all the Democrats opposed and that I Would just on the basis of a what we think or its policy is that they shouldn't be against a a whole host the progressive ideas\nAnd and when you're on and\nI'm Glad you're honest because now what that gives the Republicans the right to do we have in our in our country tens tends to have\nBalance of government we have a Democratic president but we have a Republican House in maybe a Democratic Senate oh we have a Republican Senate\nOr and and you know ... it it goes back and forth so now if we can do is not only can we take gridlock which we've had for years in terms of nothing getting done now would we can do is we can gridlock we can watch the Supreme Court justices die off one after another Rob\nAnd when a Democratic president nominates a qualified\nDemocrat the Republican say we don't know what what his decisions are below her decision so we're going to vote against that person that's not what the advice and consent clause of the United States Constitution mandates you know and and I know it\nI agree with you a hundred percent than a or face that's where we're at with both parties I don't like it on the part of Republican thinking that way too I like it on the part of Democrats or anyone else but that's where we're at it like to to try to battling each other\nSo respective of how we got there and we can debate that so now the question is is it in our interest as a nation to stay that bifurcated number one and\nThey do nothing did more reinforces that by for Haitian then this sort of truculent behavior by United States senators who are playing to their base which will help them survive politically will help them survive politically\nBecause Democrats\nAre in in blue states and Republicans in red states know what their electorate is and\nNone of them are going to have the guts to say guess what Garland actually he's he's he's maybe President Obama's this choice um but but we need to give him a vote okay and as a matter of fact I'm as a Republican\nVote for him because frankly I think he's qualified and uh and in order for us to get some more Republican judges on the court or or or ... or constitutional is whatever you want to call them we got to win some elections\nWho's gonna make who's going to do that for this country which senators do you think are going to I'm going to have the courage to maybe go against the base but do the right thing for the country and I think this damn few in this US Senate who would do that\nI agree I Will point out Mitch McConnell though at the beginning of Obama's term said we're a ... day one we are opposing everything he tries to do but can I make another point than about a cabin or can quickly\nBurning a you know and there is no way than that I Believe that you would ever except investigation or if you are fighting for your client where people were coming out of the woodwork to testify\nAnd you would accept a a an investigation that took a couple of days it's\nNot fair it's just not feasible or you know I'd like your opinion obviously I'm calling but you know on on that point\nOn during my opinion on it okay so you're asking me to play by the rules to be fair well the other side you know being fair that is what you're saying you want you want and you can't have it both ways either both sides are going to be fair and we're going to straighten this country out at some point Rob and I don't know how we're going to do it or\nWe're gonna continue barreling down this path where I don't care about you because I got a D. after my name\nAnd you don't care about me because you got an hour after your name and you're going to do what ever it takes and I'm going to do whatever it takes to win because what it's all about is me or you maintaining our political power and the country\nBe damp that's what it's about you know it\nI Know it and someone has to stand up and say it and someone has to stand up and change it\nI agree with you a hundred percent but would you agree that if you were the attorney you would want a more comprehensive investigation for your client then what for just getting\nIn this atmosphere in this atmosphere going to give you an honest answer in this atmosphere where people are out with the long knives to get my client I Want an investigation that is going to clear his name as much as possible and I'm honest enough to tell you that\nRight\nAs well as I Do that if it was your client your answer be the same route I Love your calls we've gone ten minutes\nWant to get more people in please keep calling this program and you know what I think the UN I maybe disagree on a lot of issues but I sure wish there were more people like you and me actually elected to public office who made at least consider\nThe possibility of working with the other side and putting this country back in a position where you can nominate people as as different as Anton Scalia or and Ruth Bader Ginsburg and get in ... case a unanimous vote and against ... case a vote of Ninety six to three\nThank you and I appreciate it I just don't want us to become like going down this road of a Republican I agree with you on all the partisanship is horrible\n... thanks Rob ... go have a great night I went very long with Rob because frankly I was a good call I Want to hear from you\nEverybody else from now on they're going to give him a two minutes max let's get as many people in if you agree with me great if you disagree with me even better and I will try to see the microphone to you that would be my small concession in the last twenty two minutes of this program but I'm telling you what I said tonight I Believe in my God\nI Believe in my soul and I don't care if you're a right wing Republican or a left wing Democrats like we have in Elizabeth Warren uh here in Massachusetts\nThere's there's no interest only interest is in what's best for these people who are in the U.S Senate the feather their own nest period they will do it
