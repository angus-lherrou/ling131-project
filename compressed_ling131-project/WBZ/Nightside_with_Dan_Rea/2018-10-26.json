I Know I'll get an honest answer let's assume that someone which I don't think it's too likely to get to Donald Trump and let's assume Donald Trump goes on television tomorrow night next week\nAnd says look I'm I'm the president the United States I've used language but it's been way over the top I regret that\nI pledge to you the American people that I Am going to change my ways and I hope that all of you will accept it you don't have to vote for me but I Hope you'll except might\nChange of ways is genuine and I hope some of you on the other side of the aisle will also toned down your rhetoric it'd be it'd be made a big speech like that would you buy it\nI Would only by it if he followed through by changing the weight\nOf course there's no way to say that but do you want to see is I'm not sure he's capable of giving that speech\nBut I Would eat in it and he I I really\nI Would definitely get ... I Would watch them and I would give them a chance that I I think if he did that I think that would go a long way that I really do I agree with you I agree I I I mean I think some people are going to hate him no matter what choice there's always a crazy that's always the case um\nBut I think but I I don't even I don't agree with a lot like the way he talked about immigrants or his positions on every time I don't like that\nBut I'll tell you the truth even though ... more conservative than him if pencil within their pants wouldn't talk like that\nAl ... al ... and I think yeah\nAnd I said so I disagree with pants on his position without 'em and and I would probably vote or before I vote for Trump\nI don't know the problems I don't know that Donald Trump's ego would permit him to deliver such a speech\nBut you think or what but um but I Wish\nYou look there's always a possibility that somebody can see the light of day\nIf he gave that speech and he gave it with um integrity and credibility or he could change the course of this mid term election and then he he lived to tend to standard that he says\nHe could be a pretty funny guy he doesn't have to be right ... street talk New York to be funny\nAnd he's actually accomplish some good thing for this country and he'd be much better position that they were out there right there and I yeah I just\nI don't know that he's capable of this I don't know that he's capable of this it'll be interesting but we throw it out there you and I throw it out there dawn lit up is okay\nBut a couple of nights he does a mayor culpa and says look I I acted this way 'cause I had to get elected I'm Sorry I Will change my ways I regret the mistakes I made I regret the comments I made\nUm I I I Want an opportunity\nTo do it right I think most Americans would given that opportunity I think you're right hey John loved the call thank you so much ah you got it and I do not call again where okay well thank you activity land Kevin want to get you in under the wire haired right ahead\nOkay Dan these envelope that are being nailed to the ball and and the packages for voting\nIs that a question or a statement about crush\nMy understanding is I ... my understanding is that they have stamps on them I Would assume that they have stamps on them and they were mailed there should be post marks on them and those posts Marta should indicate but where they were male I Would assume\nRight 'cause that's what I'm thinking what state are they being well\nApparently they're focusing on a center just you know in southern Florida\nOkay why are they being nail Democrats and Republicans for that's the question that question\nI mean you know you said don't speculate\nSo it's not the son of Sam doing it that's for sure I Would say watch every stop watch every email box where they the letters and packages being sat stat there\nWell I don't know the average yeah okay that's that's a good that's a good suggestion we'll see if uh if that solves the problem I Would think they have a lot of information right now and let's hope that they could solve this I Want to see it solved I don't want to see this go away this is a case that is eminently solvable\nEminently solvable and before I go I just want to say that at the end they test the wire that it's it's a rather than to show share and gamble\n[laughter] always stay in power it's adults in Tyler Tyler well\nI'll tell you ... ... it's barely I think that if and if you and I took that same tests Kevin I I think that we might we might see that ... the ... the level of sin tell her that she as well\nI Would go back to the Vikings and not wait\nAre good for your Janet okay thank you both tribal talks or whatever night or\nTo the callers on the line we will get the right after the ten o'clock news have you on the line dialing now six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty I missed a beat the box office will do it right after the news break remind me of this Brittany okay\nCambridge mobile tell them that exceed has job openings for senior mobile software engineers in Cambridge, Massachusetts you'll design and implement algorithms and features needed by Cambridge mobile tell them addicts he in the family of mobile apps and mobile less decay the individuals will also be responsible\nFor trouble shooting and fixing problems and released applications the minimum requirements for the physician or a master's degree in computer science information security software engineering or a closely related\nField of study for a bachelor's degree in the same field of study in two years of experience in any related occupation building and designing mobile applications all the fight applicants should male resumes to Kathie Hodge born\nDirector of operations in HR Cambridge mobiles HeLa manic skiing\nOne on one main street fourteenth floor Cambridge, Massachusetts oh two one for two with reference to job coats EMT L.
