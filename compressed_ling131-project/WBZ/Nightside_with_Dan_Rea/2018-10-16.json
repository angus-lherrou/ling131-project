Senate campaign but ... decided to release this video this morning and I guess the result truly are sort of in some ways backfiring on on what she was trying to do to put it to bed and I you know again I'm not trying to talk about this about\nYou know Sarah Warn other than to say that she did it take to minority hiring positions when at University of Pennsylvania one at Harvard where she had listed itself with the Native American heritage and then retracted that in when she had gotten the Harvard job out of that national uh directory of lawyers so\nYou know I think for her she needs to sail answer the question why she felt that uh with whatever percentage of it she had she felt that it was it worth it was worthy of taking to minority hiring positions that would otherwise have gone to somebody with a much stronger background I\nThink I mean that's the question of Baltimore the fairness here we're talking both did she receive an advantage or we we talked about that I'm a lesbian last caller from Philly Lexington who was fairly defensive of her I said\nShe you know do you do you think the white people should have a chance to claim that there is something that maybe they're not based upon a you know one in five hundred and twelve or what are the number is\n... or so or ... three weeks from tomorrow or is it is election day this was coming this is coming to a close pretty quickly\nIt is and look I'm excited I mean we've been campaigning as you probably know for the better part of a you almost a year and a half this quaint and talking to people across the state they feel that not only is Washington been overlooking them but Sarah why really has not been focused on them that actually was something that came out yesterday at the Washington Post office or talked about\nA in a report how extensive her work is her her team is on building this a campaign for the White House in twenty twenty um you\nKnow I mentioned in the past on your show and it was as if I have heard about how she took a hundred and Thirteen Days to respond to a veteran from ... who was asking for help and it turns out\nYou know after the primaries are just a few months ago she was called over a hundred and Seventy one uh Democrats from around the country after their primary victory as a obviously congratulate limit they trying to\nUh ... herself for making this presidential run up why couldn't she called back to them away\nTo the to the veteran in the other thing is just this last Thursday down in New Bedford the city council shouldn't there for the letter\nTo Senator Warren asking for intervention on the fishing problem they've had with the sector nine a ground fishing licenses federal licenses that she's ... they've asked her to to please provide some uh assistance and getting them transferred and Eddie yet to respond but she's been a has a campaign shut up and every one of the fifty states now and just\nIt's been traveling to Georgia last week was in Pennsylvania in Oklahoma the weekend before well I was up in Lawrence or with the\nColumbia gas gas line explosion victims so look I I think it's very clear at this point and from what I've seen on the campaign people are responding very positively that they know I Am going to work for the next six years for the people at Massachusetts well she is focused\nOn sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue and and trying to make his presidential run and basically\nBeing am I for the next two years if she were to be reelected\nFirst debate on ... on friday night we're looking forward to and I hope\nOh I Can't wait I mean this is something I've been looking forward to for quite a while and that will be at the eight o'clock on friday night and we have one on Sunday\nA cheese later and then there's a final one on the thirtieth so there'll be a great chance for people to tune in actually I hear the difference is about you know my work in putting money back in people's pockets versus or work too I guess in some ways uh you know raise their own profiling and make this running for president\nAll right let's get some calls Jeff deals on the line of folks I Know that when you call then you can comment you you can talk to Jeff whatever you like um let's let's get back to Michael in denim Michael your next door in a way to have your wait any longer you're on the ring central nights I call the line Jeff deal is join the conversation he's running against\nElizabeth Warren is the Republican nominee go ahead Michael you got a comment or question\nFor you can't just say hello to you a check feel too but I mean like this Elizabeth Warren\nHang a small part of the Cherokee Nation finally stepped up to the plate and spoke up about it because she didn't have ... up the recognition she's not a real American indian and that's an insult to all those people like everybody in the late ... knows just like your speaker just said\nBut I mean I'm all against attitude and she's planning to run for president of the United states and if anyone nobody's shoes that it's going to be a shame on them because that's all she drove after\nThat when there's no question that there's no question about that Michael you we [laughter] I don't think anyone would disagree with that right just\n... yeah I Know and Michael thanks for the call I just want to say one thing you know she talks about a rigged system out there that is working against people and yet here she is taking advantage of it just and it was supposed to help somebody like in a true Native American background and she felt the need to use that for her own career advancement yet she said that she never get benefit from that which I think\nIsn't it true but uh but we found out the other day that uh you know first of all here she is wanting people to pay more in taxes she's talked about raising individual\nIncome tax rates to fifty percent maybe more and yet we found out that she deduct it somewhere in the neighborhood of fifty thousand dollars worth of clothing now I don't even have fifty thousand dollars worth of clothing in my house let alone a fetish of that to donate to charity\nHold it against her that she and her family may have thought they have certain heritage but to use the system to try to help yourself a economically or in a career or when there is no evidence that that's a problem and I think that's\nThat's basically that's what I Do I Do you get a free ... she's getting a scholarship and what about people running for\nA cash to proceed on scholarships\nIt's also it's also considered a cause of the left which is cultural appropriation I mean if you\nShow up at a um sink them Iowa event and you're a white person and you're wearing a Mexican superhero many people will look good you say is that that's what they say they say it's one thing that we're so Merlin cinco de Maya it's another thing to\nPerhaps I Move up the ladder to a professorship bike bike law falsely\nWhy do not have Mexican heritage my church is Russian [noise] so so do I get home from the white vote for you know\n[laughter] so it doesn't matter early getting jobs are allowed to do so do I do I know I Know

I think it was Karl Marx says history repeats itself the first time it's tragedy the second time it's farce and I think ... war and\nAttempt to explain or ethnic deception is now in the four square him that you know people are laughing at her with this one one thousand plus Chan\nThat she might have an ancestor uh using DNA database based mostly on Central American people not native North American people\nAre and she brought it rolled it out with a huge article in the Boston Globe and fancy video\n[noise] there's a certain unreality to it that I don't think anybody is buying it I don't even think her supporters by now they may excuse it she difference between believing it and excusing it I think there are a lot of people who support her for a lot of reasons\nWho very clearly understand\nWhat she cold here during her career but they will to excuse it and I understand that whether that's a good or bad but I think it's almost ... now I think\nPeople are laughing at her I think this notion that a DNA test which she didn't go to a regular commercial\nOutlet like you or I might go to it doesn't appear that it was done on a blind basis meaning she hired somebody to do it for her that's murky and the global article whether the person doing the testing during the review knew who he was doing\nThat which might create some incentive even in good faith person it might create an incentive that um\nIt doesn't look like the actual DNA data has been released it doesn't look like it's been ... by anybody else I mean a responsible newspaper would have had another expert review the same data rather than just presenting what a candidate\nHand them a show this whole thing is almost a joke\nYou can support Elizabeth Warren I'm I understand that what she's doing and the way she is abusing Native Americans who are very upset with the whole DNA thing the Cherokee Nation\nIssued a formal statement by the Cherokee Nation secretary of state telling her that she should not be doing this that arm full to them for her to try to use DNA and essentially they said please stop when you work damaging\nAnd it's it's almost it and that's really how I feel it's so far beyond explanation everybody knows what she did she tried to choose your resume by claiming Native American status whether it helped or didn't help or people can debate but she tried to do it\nAnd I think I think she needs to just stop I think she needs to stop and she needs to apologize to Native Americans for what she did\nYeah I I'm I'm I think it'll be a um a a cold cold day in ... in late August when that ... that were to ask but my guess is professor William Jacobson\nHe certainly knows a lot about how\nFaculty members are hired at law schools and um he's gonna walk us back through this um the developments here but particularly some developments in the mid\nNineteen eighties when in a I'm a professional book a than a professor Warren I chose to change your listings from white to a Native American and when and how that would have played\nA and we'll also look at some questions that professor Jacobson has raised some about the DNA test results and what questions\nHave not been answered a and we'll also take your phone calls you relate to join the conversation the website is legal insurrection or six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty professor William Jacobson will join it will be stay with us and we'd like to join the conversation\nIf you had any any questions you and your mind about what this entire\nUh again this morality play that is going on now for for too long may perhaps uh is is all about feel free to join the conversation [noise]\nNight side with Dan re the news watch never stops W.

I. T. I. dot org\nAll right let's get to phone calls you folks have comments or questions going to go to Noel in ... through and Noel welcome you were first this hour a night side of the rings central nice I caught a line you're old professor William Jacobson to ...\nI can I just want to make a comment I find ... artifacts about all of that foreign fascinating but I also wanted to share with you that I've had to Danica Don and\nI Am as Irish friends as you look at both of my DNA test came back won ... percent Native American and the other that I was twelve native\nAmerican graduations you should run for the Senate and well thank you uh let's let me ask you know well you raised a really good point stay there I Want to get\nA professor Jacob's into commented this based upon the statistical analysis awards DNA test though Noel seven and twelve percent that's a significant number the number for\nSenator Warren is a fraction of a decimal correct in the best case scenario [noise] is that\nCorrect that's right yes and we don't know exactly because ... was based on the DNA ... you know we the one sixty fourth up into one one thousand and twenty four\nRight that's a one one sixty four would be I think one point six percent or something like that I'm In one over one thousand in twenty four would be would be point zero zero zero something\nUm what is the average um Americans have a if you were to go back into the DNA ancestry for um that that significant period of time Ken generations of studies that you're familiar with them at\nYeah there was one that was circulated a lot today it was in New York Times article from a few years ago and I think they said the average American of European ancestry is a zero point one eight percent DNA attributable to\nThat you know the Native American but it's really North American original people's\nShow ... yes Elizabeth Warren arguably just proved that she is less Native American DNA and we'll talk about that in a second I'm than the average European American show she really shot herself in the foot here but I Do want to say Native American\nTribes reject the use of DNA as a test and the Cherokee Nation came out with a very strong statement today against what she's doing trying to use DNA\nBecause what she needs to do to satisfy the Cherokee Nation is she actually needs tape to find an ancestor it's not enough to do DNA and particularly\nNot enough to do DNA where the database that was used by her a genealogist was central and South American which and and that's very offensive\nTo Native American peoples when a ... it's actually a white person goes a DNA test comes up with some minuscule percentage\nBased on his theory of migration do I she really has offended a lot of people for whom this is very important\nThat the Cherokee Nation sector state a fellow named Chuck Hoskins junior said using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any trial and they should even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong well no well congratulations on your seven to twelve percent\nCrazy huh\nYeah um and and you did not think you had any um\nNative American heritage I still\nDon't think I ... I Know I came back that way you know and less of a relative centuries ago hooked up with somebody in Canada that ... ... and ... percent\nYup well ... ... you never know Noel great right now I hear your voice come back more frequently with you I I ...\nAnd I go to bill in ... bill you're next on nights out of the rings central nice I call the line with professor William Jacobson of Cornell University law school go ahead bill\nHow're you doing [noise] hey I'm you know the thing here is though you know she took the test she has some Native American blood in her and\nYou know according to all of articles didn't see that for what they are uncovered that she didn't get ahead from the professors that they all interviewed I mean is that correct things wrong\nWell let's get professor Jacobson to respond to that point bill\nShort what the what\nThe globe did is they reviewed some documents that they didn't review wall and as far as I can tell they did not review hiring trials at Harvard law school which has never been released she gave them some documents a few other people gave them some documents we don't really know what the globe reviewed\nThey never gave us a complete list and they certainly never published them so we don't know what the records at Harvard law school they did interview I Believe it was thirty one professors who are still alive we don't know how many have\nPassed you know since Nineteen Ninety three but um who said that they did not factor in but it that interesting and it it might be true and at Dan can vouch for me on this I have always said consistently over the years we do not know whether or how much the tar but pat\nWilliam Jacobson of Harvard or excuse me of Cornell law school let us get to next to Robert in California and Robert welcome next on nights I with professor William Jacobson go ahead Robert\n... thank you my uh my niece went through nursing school at Cornell\nUm so I guess was going to be a really good teaching lesson because what's going to happen is Elizabeth Warren's going to actually learn what real evidence is when it comes to perjuring themselves you know I really do believe that to taste you know the other the other thing to think about also is on the DNA testing\nFor that so that the system says if it was it was truly an accurate Gillette says test the test it would be looking through the regions of Scandinavia and the Baltic regions for what's called the lap for so many tribes there that most closely linked to the north American\nIndigenous tribe people and had she'd had those traces it with a straight through in her case to move further south really invalidate the test altogether\nLet's get professor Jacobson respond and that's an interesting point the course of the Native Americans I Believe a thought to have immigrated to North America are from Asia about twelve thousand years ago professor\nWell you know I don't claim to be an expert on the nuances of DNA testing okay my position is that she should have done it in a normal manner\nUsing you know the shorter commercially available um companies that do that\nOr maybe she did maybe she did maybe her brother's dead new global article was very curious and says that her spokes person did not respond to a request as to whether the other family members have been tested\nEverything about the way she did it was just very curious she found a professor at Stanford to do this for her\nShe did not appear to have been done on a blind basis so he would have known who he was reviewing that data does not appear to have been made available to anybody else so we really don't know whether they should have included a different database you know with Scandinavian or\nNative people I don't I don't know the answer to that but she went about this in a very curious very unusual way\nFor the call Robert I got a whole bunch of folks who want to get into okay my front\nPorch pre she had very much let me get to very quickly Richard and Ontario got full lines rich you what do you have for professor Jacobson tonight\nProfessor Dan I Hope you're oh well um\nThis is obviously hitting news here and one expert was saying that um\nUh the senator would have to have a what they call it new with our first nations and what a bloodline and her which it's apparently she doesn't have um um and then secondly\nI'm due to first nations a residency United States have banned cards\nYes they do they have um their records that are listed a this that some people have for the department of interior if that's what you're referring to professor Jacobson you're familiar with those for a fight\nThe the if you are registered with the tribe you can get an official recognition of fat she's never been she'd never attempted to as far as we know so I\nYou know she ... and but I keep coming back to the the Native American tribes themselves read jak DNA as a major particularly the Cherokee Cherokees there were three recognized tribes\nThey all have meticulous records they have records going back to before the time of the trail of tears and before that uh they have rules that they cap they it is a people who really kept track\nOf their genealogy and their history and you you have to be on whatever those roles you have to identify an ancestor she has never to this day I identified an ancestor and I was very upset with the Boston Globe\nBecause they mention a woman named share OC Sara Smith you may remember oh she's scared Sara Smith when this first broke in the news the end of April two thousand twelve when Harold broke the story they somebody uncovered a news later which mentioned that ... Smith\nMight be I'm a Native American because her marriage certificate or that he is Elizabeth Warren's great great great grandmother the Boston\nGlobe who ran with that story then turned out someone actually went and reviewed not the newsletter but the actual source documents and there was no reference to or being Native American there\nThe glow which forced to retract\nIt in May of two thousand and twelve and yet and ran a correction saying there is no evidence that OC Sara Smith is Native American her great great great grandmother next glowed and runs in the article this morning bringing up the OC Sara Smith as a\nPotential uh ancestor of Elizabeth Warren so they're putting out there and they do know that there was no doubt no proof of it but they put out\nThere again that concept of her great great great grandmother even though the retracted that story six years ago that shot a recording to me they they should not have put that in there when they know they had to retract the story before\nAn editor's you regret it rich I Want to get a couple more in a while and\nJust one of the thing I'm a ban card does that title you do not pay federal tax on purchases\nI'm not sure that I'm not sure that ended up I don't think and I get that Yankee\nBoston a donation of the shadow funds on its way\nMy friend ... thank you so much a very generous of the shuttle fuss staggering but let me get real quickly I'd like to get to and if we can I don't know if we can do it let me get very quickly Chris in Chicago\nChris next door night side I'm going to Jimmy for time here because they want to get also and for most to go ahead Chris\nI'm two quick questions real quick and let you go yeah number one regarding impartiality saying or his facts correct the other question besides that is if there was a conservative would you be concerned about this issue as you are I don't think it would\nBe well I think he would be going ahead professor I was starting to question\nThe only one let's get his answer the first then we'll take him door I Want to get ... on the cutting you off hold on okay if Liz McGuire was a conservative would you be as concerned about this as you are\nIf Elizabeth Warren was a conservative she never would have been elected because the Boston Globe the New York times or Los Angeles times the major newspapers you would have been all over this story I have covered the story of Elizabeth Warren\nBecause the newspaper either wouldn't cover it or ran cover for her show would I be concerned yes if there is a is there is a\nRepublican Senate ... senator if there is a Republican presidential contender who phony to up his ancestry ... in an attempt to get a job advancement and yes it would be concerned with\nIt but I don't know of such person if you can tell me such person I'll look into it\nOkay Chris what's your second question\nWell that's how I said to my second question becomes such a person is Donald Trump because our president\nAnd there was initially from the ... year has he claimed ancestry\nNo but he may have cheated on his taxes we know\nThat that's fine but he he he's plenty there's plenty of people who are looking into that Chris and we will but but you mix metaphors here it's you know why one question\nDan if we ever integrity is the issue if the three of us carry about integrity which I deeply do and Elizabeth Warren is running against all try and all your current boss integrity who'd you vote for\nA if my choice I don't have a choice there I vote for neither one of them just like it didn't vote for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump Christopher\nEnough gotta go hope you are satisfied that answer but let me get if I can hear more strict ed you got about thirty seconds what can you do with it\n[laughter] and that that\nA modern liberalism athletic too where everybody is charged by what ethnic or political group they belong to like I Want to give you a little more to say but I'll just end with that [noise] there was an interview on the BBC I listen to this past weekend whether object came to putting a ... ... ... ... and ...\nAnd they were inch of professor wouldn't that be a professor at a university and allow it and I said why was was ... actually no there really isn't any evidence that he was a racist they hit in March and rally don't treat us very well and we\nDon't want to throw it out you had a little bit off base but I understand the point you make it as always had okay thank you very much can you take it down or any place thanks very much a professor William Jacobson thank you very much it's legal insurrection dot com\nAnd the other one is Elizabeth Warren wiki W. I. K. I. dot org and I do hope to Chris in Chicago feels he got direct answers\n... great thank you very much\nProfessor stay there were like to thank you up and we're going to come back\nWe're going to open up the phone lines has talked about this issue ... didn't jump on board phone lines are wide open right now this is Dan re beautiful your home and say big on energy bills with window world Seventy one to two thirty four forty six seven eight one to two two thirty four forty six\nSo she has to appeal one to that democratic base in order to win the nomination and then of course she has to appeal to the to the broader central a center of the base of the country the country that\nThat the people who voted for Barack Obama twice in two thousand eight and two thousand twelve and then turn around and voted for Donald Trump or two thousand sixteen\nMay be somewhat inexplicable to me um but the more I think about it I can understand that there were people who looked at\n... Obama Senator Obama and two thousand eight and said great this is a different sort of presidential candidate and things aren't going well they were not going well in two thousand aid let's give him a chance and those same people are are enough of those same people were\nSatisfied with what he had done in his first four years where they reelected him\nAnd then some of them for years later said hey this guy Donald Trump these they thought things were not going well enough and I've had a lot of callers who called me and said that they voted for President Obama twice and voted for Donald Trump\nOnce and I tend to believe them so I Want to know does this impact your vote in November\nAh and I'd love to know frankly right now and I'm not going to argue with you I Love to know if you voting for Warren to be reelected over over deal to veto there is a Republican and a Democrat love to hear here from you on that ah and also does\nThe other question to me is that the clear intention\nThat Senator Warren has and then she is now not only telegraphing but all but saying she's going to run for president in twenty twenty swimming she gets re elected in twenty eight team\nDoes that make you more or less likely to vote for her so those are the sort of the combination of questions on the on the docket and I'm really looking to try to get a sense of where people stand on this and the only way I can get that sense if you give me a call not here to argue not here to fight\nOr tried it here to try to understand six one seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty will get at least one in before the break was started off up north of Boston\nGoing to go to Vicky in Salisbury Hi Vicky welcome you an extra nights I thanks for calling in\nYou for taking my call um I just wanted to weigh in a little bit about her having the DNA test fat on 'em and I I'll compare her to Brett Kavanaugh there are many many people\nOver the years that have you know like then accused of stuff for a you know had to go to court or something like that on trial and a lot of people have said well you know if I\nIf I were accused of that I Would be screaming and yelling and be very very upset and you know I Would show that you know I didn't do this\nWhich was can also capitals position I think ...\nYeah but the thing is is that he was criticized for doing that and then\nElizabeth Warren who uh is finally decided to take the DNA test people are dissatisfied with that too\nYou know what I mean so it's just like you can get him to do and damned if you don't get interest and\nInteresting comparison obviously a I had not thought of that but I I think that's a very interesting comparison and and they both um\n[noise] I'm sure that the both of them I I Would hope\nIn their heart of hearts believe I could see the red capital really believes that he was the victim of allegations which was furious a and the owners with Warren might be I guess if you give her the benefit of every vote\nMaybe she's absolutely convinced that her a grandmother or her answer whatever had told her that as a kid I guess that's possible\nBut come on the end you and I are both I I'm half Irish or you're a full Irish men but as far as American Irish American though I Will tell\nYou this my dead many years ago tried to convince me that we were part Hispanic because the spin a miner had broken up off the coast of Ireland the Fifteen hundreds of\nGod that was ... at least the hadn't open minded about it but um you know I never liked her until recently and I was afraid in the last\nTerm she was going to leave Massachusetts and and a run for the president say but so I'm Glad I'm Glad that she said this one but um you know I went to a town hall or a ... court\nTo see her and she was a lot here I didn't like her because she was so school mar mesh but\nAnd you know always pointing the finger but at that town hall she was a lot softer then um he normally appears you know she was not she even gave Joe Manchin a break which was a big deal and um you know I just liked her better in that atmosphere so\nSo we go to vote now who are you going to vote for up for her you will who did did you vote out first time yeah\nOkay so so by like light really care for her that much no actually I mean Democrat so I voted that way you know I\nTotally get it I'm just trying to what I always try to figure out I'm sort of I Do my little focus group here okay you're you're now being focus grouped by me because I always try to figure out if people have switched and if so what has made them you basically\nOr were a reluctant supporter as a loyal Democrat or two thousand twelve and you actually knew a little bit it sounds to me like you're going to vote for her a a two thousand Eighteen to\n... and don't forget him on the Democrat but I'm really not a liberal I'm just a little to the left of center I like ... I'm an JFK Democrat\nWell um I like to think of myself I'm a huge admirer of or the late President Kennedy than I Am but\nI don't know that uh that he would be comfortable in the Democratic party today but maybe maybe so I don't know um is there\nIs there any Democrat who who but let me ask you this is my phone over this are you happy that she's going to go off and run for president you think that's a good thing for us\nOh sure yeah I mean not for the people of Massachusetts not in the middle of her term but who knows um I'd vote for her for the president\nOkay so so that it's OK should candidates people who've decided they want to run for president that's a fairly full time job\nYeah yeah now is that you're right yeah but come on how many people have done it so many people have done it that way so\nWell there are a lot of people who have done it that way there's a some have not done it that way some have okay you're absolutely right on that\nOr is it fair to seek and secure the six year term and then go out and spend a good portion of that six year term running for now\nAnd you know oh I can I think he was meant senator but all I can think back on with my caucus and you know it wasn't until it was ... he was on the road and ran for the president said and I'm\nA delegated his responsibilities especially the accounting ones to somebody else thinks reenter went awry in this state things were really pretty good under his\nReign over the ship is different than a senator I mean I I gotta yeah okay so so you say good luck to her and and it doesn't again you're going to vote for us with a ... they may be people out there are going to say hey I'm not going to vote for someone who\nWants a job for six years\nAnd clearly they look in the ghetto\nYeah OK Vicki I Love your show you know that you know one of my fellow nice to talk to you again in\nAs always they don't be is one of my best callers thank you so much\nMake you expand make me think thanks bookkeeper she ate it and could you\nKnow ... that's the type of ... you don't have to agree with me to call this program as you want to greet me again but I Love to hear I Love to find out from people why how they get from point a to point see\nOkay that's the issue six one Seventy five or ten thirty Tripoli nine to nine ten thirty let's keep it going and have some fun and we can have good conversation on nights I does all we're trying to do\nLike side with Dan Rather than watch never stopped W.

you kind of drifted on me because\nI don't think that the focus is tonight on Trump we will have other times we focus on Trump it's certainly not what Trump said it which was reprehensible or John McCain agree with you ... here's my question you're a voter in Massachusetts clearly it does not bother you that she's running for reelection\nEnd the day after she's elected she's gonna kick into high gear to run for president that's not a bad that's not a problem for you\nWell no actually I wouldn't say that but I mean\nWas it who you go to but I got you got a choice you you've you've castigated deal I think inappropriately but that's fine that's your opinion so you have a guy just deals not running for president he's running for Senate [laughter] and he would serve six years Elizabeth Warren ... if she gets elected she's going to start the presidential campaign the next day\nIf she hasn't started already does that it may not matter that's what I'm trying to find out for people if it doesn't matter that's fine\nYou know there's no right or wrong answer I just was curious what yours is\nBut but but they're anybody I mean in the history of politics as late as she doing something that nobody else has ever done\nLike if she not not as suggesting that\nShe's still not going to go down to DC and vote for Massachusetts like her votes and not going to support Massachusetts over the next six years everything she votes for is going to support Massachusetts know\nLike if if she's out campaigning in Iowa um she ... you gotta you gotta be on the floor of the Senate in order to cast a vote\nAnd you don't think she'll make the trip\nAll the like you know there are there are plenty of 'em are people who have run for\nThe for the for the president it's a fulltime job bill\nI mean it's like ...\nAnd so therefore there will be ... you you can do to you can't really do now there are people who have done it I agree with you OK Mali both\nI like I Am a

citizen now there are a bunch of Republicans I'm cruising\nCase it was the governor I get that so my question is real simple bill if you take everything you're going to vote for Warren which is fine

like that I had a whole for one yeah oh no they don't know do it on that but\nIt does about looking to do that's all I'm not going to do is find out\nYou know I Know but that seems to be like the issue like it's like ... it just I feel so terrible this like how the country being so divided on stuff it's like\nFor me I Would say this bill\nI Would say this if you're looking for a ...\nI think she's gonna be a big United don't you think on that one\nToo I think she's got to be a big in Idaho [noise] uh\nI mean in terms of what like bringing the\nCountry to get to tell me the truth bill

with you with Hillary Clinton making that statement about Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky [noise]\nI'm I'm really taken aback by her comments with regards to number one Bill Clinton is the time was a man in his fifties Monica Lewinsky was in their early twenties and a very young impressionable woman\nI'm Sorry but um that is not socially acceptable in my book if I'm old fashion fine All right\nI think you're I think that you are very um old current I think that you are right with the me too movement in the sense that uh there's there's no I mean not only\nMan of with our family\nWas an age look it was an age um differential number one but before but beyond that he had the authority the ultimate authority he's the president of the United states and she got her and\nI have come to the inclusion and that's not the reason why I call but I've come to the conclusion with Hillary that she looked the other way with her husband's indiscretions that she eventually want her to be president of the United states it didn't happen to her because of Iraq Obama\nAs well as Donald Trump and language as of late justifying basically mildly justifying justify violence in the streets\nShows what type of person she truly is and fair minded liberal and progressive need to be honest with that Trump supporter I'm not going to mess myself okay\nDonald Trump is a crude jerk however\nWe would agree that we would agree there no but however\nHis policies he stands for when guards to enforcing immigration I'm Sorry I don't want the demographics of this country to change\nIf that makes me a racist that are racist or write his policies with regards to trade deals that Bill Clinton pushed with maley Mexico and China\nHave not worked out well for American workers blue collar guy is anybody out there that liberal or progressive got a call me selfish because I Want to retain my job or want to see fellow people like myself and the bills\nIn trades be employed by factories that hire people like me\nWell let me just say that would ... say this about that that's exactly what the Democratic Party has had\nBeen bank you were you asked you they were saying you union support they wished they supported unions and union members voted in droves the Democratic cute cute\nI voted for Democrats\nStarting with Jimmy Carter in Nineteen eighty because of my union affiliation\nOkay so it's not exactly like I'm a right wing Republican or right the problem is the Democratic party has shifted a ... and it it it to me it's been a party of you know what I'm going to put my finger on the wind and see which way the wind is blowing on Tuesday\nFor your your honest enough to admit that you're voting for what you consider to be your enlightened self [noise]\n[noise] I'm voting I voted for uh people that work for a living in this country guard lists of their ethnic background or whatever\nI assume that's what that's what you perceive him and I agree with you you proceed that as you were in lightened self interest and that is what the Democratic Party stood for for years but in recent years it's it's changed a lot of union voters as we saw in Ohio Pennsylvania Michigan Wisconsin and even\nA state that I'm a ... that Hillary couldn't carry Minnesota was a lot closer than people which would have expected would've expected\nRight and and the wind the clock back to Nineteen eighty eight Nineteen eighty nine I Lived in mission hills in those days\nAnd I was active in mission hills democratic award ten committee I was elected twice to be a delegate in Springfield in eighty eight as well as northeastern in Nineteen eighty nine I was a blue collar Democrat back in those days All right\nI totally yeah and you know so believe me and I saw a change in the party with regards to people that call themselves progress is back then and I thought to myself you know I Know I'm a Democrat\nBut I'm not sure who these other people were and there was a shift in the party of where you know what we don't care about the constitution we don't care about the rule of law\nPrincipals don't matter anymore we're going to do whatever it takes by any means necessary\nTo seize control of power and I'm Sorry I'm a union member for thirty five years and if that makes me about the only member well you know what where with a badge of honor I don't care anymore\nI have ... always appreciate your candor a I assume that you will not be supporting Elizabeth Warren on November\nNot at all because she you know what my ancestry goes back to sixteen thirties I'm probably probably somewhere along the line one or two percent Native American I don't know it\nBut you know what that doesn't give me the right to fill out a job applications say I'm Native American okay she lied and she got a path to college is claiming she was Native American and you know liberal in the state who gave up on critical thinking\nAs long as you say what they want to hear we're going to give you a pass on what truth is and that's why I left the Democratic\nIt's interesting in real quickly 'cause I'm I'm running past my break here is that if which surprises me is that\nWe have a very strong Democratic Party in Massachusetts our entire congressional delegation is now is democratic\nUm we have other than the governor and the lieutenant governor the other constitutional officers are all democratic\nOr Democrats dominate the the legislature both voters Dayton okay we're we're vividly blue state and yet and yet in order to find someone to beat Scott Brown in two thousand twelve this party had to reach for someone\nWho is ... ... an Okie from Oklahoma I mean there was there was no Democrat\nIn Massachusetts in the congressional delegation and elsewhere that could have beaten Scott Brown they had to go out of state and find a Harvard law school professor from Oklahoma\n[noise] gonna gonna say one thing Liz Warren made sense only one time and her political career and that was reinstate in the Glass Steagall act that's about all that's the only good thing I have to say about\nAn hour to grill that I Would agree with you on that\nBill Clinton repealed it Nineteen Ninety nine that's why we ended up with a banking crisis\nSign but try show at all but right and also you're absolutely right on that ... that then\nTry and try telling that to Harvard intellectual and Ken more
