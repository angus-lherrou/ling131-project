I think that there's going to be nothing that's going to come out on that unless these leaked a which might happen before before the election\nAnd said he's getting along with his deputy attorney general\nI saw that today he liked raw shot look he's in love with the head of North Korea has to be driving back and I'll tell you what else is going to drive the Democrats crazy I don't know if you saw the story today but\nBill and hill are going to get on the road like a road show just see that\nShow for the next couple of years\nA bill and hill traveling medicine man show medicine show or whatever\nIt is good at least good from whatever areas fails your [laughter]\nYour market value of sitting were gone down considerably\nIt has been so we ... we didn't have any five dollars a ticket\nThe cheapest in the house it goes up to six thirty nine you kidding me for it\nIt's the same thing with seven thousand people that's their idea of it are you on physician\nAdmitted like Germany or that now it's six Seventy don't even believe with no money on the table Herman don't worry about our [laughter] so I drew the\nYeah that's good news is that it's six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple a nine to nine ten thirty or we're going to go next to them to go to Bridgewater and bring Eric on board arrogant Bridgewater your next of the rings central nights like on the line well\nHey hey dad I did see that Clinton's story you know\nToday and I laughed out loud three brief point relative to the Democrats threaten a Kevin ... investigation the one\nYou know the FBI investigation is complete it or they have absolutely no profit of evidence uh I I think it would be a very unpopular thing for the Democrats to go down that road again I really think they know it also\nA number two um you know I don't recall you\nBeing overly upset when Trump or after he got integrated wanted to reopen the Hillary email investigation either I think you thought that was a pretty good idea\nYeah I was probably wouldn't have a host of that I'd love to know um what what happened on that I don't I I think that that was the FBI\nHad concluded their investigation that\nThere's some some elements of the FBI who we have now found out were as corrupt as you could possibly guys like ... the deep\nState a couple of tax between a girlfriend in the bar\nFor I don't know what I'm Talking about eradicate but now let's get a question you want to ask the question to give me a chance to answer it I'll be fair with you if you're familiar with me Andrew McCabe a who is very much involved in that situation after his wife it receives at seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar home\nWatch all of the people of political they all have the independent thinking\nWell Andrew McCabe gets indicted and wind up Peter Struck in the girlfriend and Mr and Mrs or ... you you had a ...\nYeah that was one thing the doctor there but the other thing is that what Susan Collins so I think the President's Day sixteen minutes which is really counting kick it off to the response from the name has been positive\nAnd even hardly ever hear people who are praising cat or pacing of people in the air really planting this\nSo you think they were only protestors out there [noise] and that's really what it sounds like\nWhat what what happens is that you can um see demonstration with a thousand protesters inside the capital's a which you know really looks boisterous and loud in Iraq as a and they were a lot of people who were arrested\nI don't know what sort of work a wild those people to protest a no I don't have a chance to go to Washington in protest I don't have a chance to go to the state house that are real job so you have to ask that question there has been there have been reports and reports that I take seriously\nOr that George Soros and and his organizations have actually paid some of these phone call I Believe that do this and it's ... it will all come out in the washer November six now\nAgain if people want to have their point of view heard they better get to the polls and they better vote because that's a very important election if I'm a it\nWill either a confirmed the direction of the country or it will take the country off in a different direction whatever you want\nAnd but I think it's like ... ... you know and I think again there's a lot of people\nWho are cool I ... I can convict demand something with absolutely no accident what kind of a country that that is a frightening\nWell is the allegation is the allegation\nWe have to have it and it goes I cannot think Karen ... Alaska\nBasketball to look at about I don't know red capital\nA all they know is what people who worked with him\nSaid and it sounds to me that\nHe may have been a ... and I and I would accept the fact that in college\nHe might have been a a guy who drank too much and I think there are a lot of people who do in college drink too much but but in terms of being a sexual predator normally if someone's a sexual predator in college they continue to be a sexual predator and he was more than a sexual predator\nHe was somebody who was accused of assaulting people exposing himself to people\nAnd in the case of the ... a a a person or the third of\nAllegation that he was engaged in a series of gang rapes I mean I think that was so over the top you know to cut throat ability of ... a professor Ford who I found to be credible I think she was the victim of a sexual assault I'm not convinced it was Brett Kavanaugh I'm not even certainly was bred capital\nA and I think that Susan Collins laid it out very well Sandy thank you so much for your call is always appreciate it very much\nThank you have if they didn't have a great now let's go next to Patty a new report Patty you're next on nights I go right ahead\nGetting at some point I Am very proud to let him out and look at the end for for so long\nAppreciate Hattie\nHeat that um I just want to ask how much money think eight progress is willing to spend on this\nI think whatever you you're talking about the wealthy progress is the uh uh\nStiers and and he uh uh in the George Soros is I think they have the money and I and I think they believe in the cause and I think that they're not limited in any way shape or form and what they're going to try to spend\n[noise] I think this is going to bring out if they cannot credits walked away at the applicant ...\nMaybe we'll have maybe we'll have a record turnout I I Hope that whatever happens it's a clear mandate one way or the other so we can as a country move on\nI just wanted to say I would also led to criticize they need to look at\nA local rape crisis center at that point it stuck up for it\nAnd I would suggest it they may not ever and I would also like to see an insurance either treatment has like Kenneth Lay\nKPSK our other tax on a genuine fickle sexual assault\nWell again I I found for to be credible um I've I've said that in the year and I thought I thought she was credible ... I have no way of knowing that it's just what my impression is\nNow I agree but I'm just talking about rape crisis center and how long it takes quite ... quite tests\nAt my own and they don't get that psychiatry or they ate at social work I\nAlso think did rape crisis centers are important because it is the only way the law and women can call and can be guided a damn thing like that happens but\nNow that it's very well actually I I\nKnow the patio all I'm saying is that if a woman is sexually assaulted and she has nowhere to turn if she has no support system or or maybe if she does have a support system but she ... she has to feel comfortable and confiding in that support system she has to have some way or to get help and I think a rape crisis center\nIs very important and hopefully the people that rape crisis centers realize that the these these cases are serious and they should be dealt with seriously and that they should be able to distinguish people who are coming in a and who are really in crisis and get them to help they need that's my thought\nYou know I agree with you there I create with rape and ... and the show they're all very necessary at the end it's complex\nWell apparently I Will agree with that and we can we can solve that now thanks I gotta run ... thank you very much gonna get Mary from Chelsea in final call this hour we're going to stick with the next dollar Hi Mary how are you tonight\nI can I just want to tell you that I couldn't take them a red way that no that law and I'll tell you I think people are signing the true what\nThe Democrats not all of them doing ever since it ... just trying to paint anything on them and it's all about getting ridiculous that Russian thing oh gosh they you know the women anything and it's\nIt's just absolutely no respect\nFor the presidency I think you know people over the years that respect it wherever the president ...\n... but at the same time Mary if let us say on the Russian thing here is let us say a deal was real evidence that somehow the Trump campaign of the president's ... clue had colluded with people ah who ... who do not have been involved\nIn in this election I Would hope that by now\nRobert Mueller and his team of investigators would've produced that proof because if if they come out\nA month from now or two months or three months from now with some sort of\nAllegation the president has been able to be in office for two years and it's been able to do things and put in place several things I get the investigation should be thorough but the fact that it's gone on this long is beginning to make me think\nThat they must not be must be\nA they must be be nothing there or very little let me put it like that bad hole right well I don't know you would hope that there was something serious that uh the ... team would have gotten the word out that hey we got a problem here because somehow we've elected a in inappropriate president ... we have elected\nA president who has no right to hold the office and\nThat's where I thought they were going to go but it seems to me while they are going off in a whole bunch of different areas in terms of how much did he pay taxes in the Nineteen nineties\nA dead end and I think you might I think you might rebel will see let's see what it let's see what happens when it comes out a stationary appreciates covering all I\nHave a great nightmare goodnight six one seven to five or ten thirty triple a nine to nine ten thirty we will be back but at the dawn how for the nine o'clock news will continue to talk about your reaction to the\nConfirmation of judge or justice Brett Kavanaugh and also talk in context of politics and if you disagree that's fine fine if you want to raise an issue or raise the theory that's fine but let's have fun with it and let's have a conversation back and forth\nI don't want to yell at you hope you don't want to yell at me if you want to weaken yelled back and forth maybe great radio but it's not good conversation you know the numbers coming back on nights I'd better call\nFrom Ninety nine dollars a pound\nDue to loan roofing dot com transfer funds in deposit sex right from your smartphone download the ethos fading thank local out today is at ... dot com\n... thought saw tower power is coming to the hand over the Internet was terrible Wednesday October test Hanover theater dot org it's our of power\nW.

confidence\nIs doing the investigation [noise] and you know and I think I Know they don't know how to investigate [noise] um we have ...\nWho else are you going to use under these circumstances trolley that's what the the the the Senate Judiciary committee\nAsked for some what\nDo you get your committee if I were had any influence I Would suggest traveling every Internet committee rehashing after the disgraceful performance was\nOkay so let's say the judge the Judiciary Committee should resign the FBI obviously should not have done the investigation in your opinion how to resolve this how would you if you had the magic wand how would it be resolved that\nHey I can kinda get you know I Would do it but what I Would suggest doing is home different set of people aren't Judiciary Committee this court is important\nIn in in the past and getting some investigators ... down to the to this committee the Judiciary Committee going professional people and they're all good he ATF his pain fine investigators in and then you\nKnow once you can use the history of these nominations and in the white picket fence nation should look for [noise]\nOkay well that's the suggestion I don't think any well let's see if people responded that Charlie ... team of ATF investigators grade be charged with a investigating all of the Supreme Court nominee I\n... think tank you can walk to go after more cash people very ... little hey April\nYeah so and in what would've happened Charlie in your mind that that team came back and said I'm their allegations but there's no core operation would have you been sounds\nLike me would be happy okay good at home and that's happening people it down the investigation\nSo it's just the FBI used the FBI here was the problem\nYeah the FBI is the problem today are they being said this before and I and then change my opinion they should be dismantled early in the meantime ... the reason peril dismantling you\nKnow I think the ... that a lot of the FBI is in the process of being dismantled right now if the truth be known a you know comb he's been fired McCabe was investigated by a grand jury struck struck a page if you're going to have some problems as well so um let's say let's see what happens Charlie got to run away past my breath age they let me say\nThis finding they I think commitment you know the the committee and its investigating shit creek washers hoping that the wrong path\nWell I'll tell you that maybe\nThe ... you know you're\nOkay only do me a favor as opposed to talking about that one is you get in touch with mullahs operation because I'm sure they could use a little bit of a reporter at this point\nOkay I'll be happy to do that or I also want to report back to you over the next year\nWe had always

everybody's face\nWould talk to about ... ... ... almost every night for the last every night yeah\nYeah yeah and I called in but but guess what the good people one okay now people might say well you're not that good people you know we are the good people\nI Would like to think there's good people on both sides of the equation don't quite know Dan Schorr\nDay and I love you for your you always look at both sides but the thing of it is among those sites too because the the car that you talked to earlier who is concerned about you know women not coming out with what if they were affected by abuse and everything\nWas in jail for Michigan is right\nOn with her but seeing what they they don't understand that\nI think by the way I don't know what side she was on I think she was asking genuine questions you I didn't I I like to call and and they wouldn't let me you she talked about some ... some neighbor of her so she had never had\nYou heard the story or for those who didn't hear the guy said to oh how are you today nice to see you and she said Oh nice to see you too and he said ... then he followed up with an and it'll be even nicer to see you\nDoing more yoga I Know yeah they got it was either obviously a peeping Tom at some point if that we've done where's your daughter what advice have you given your daughter\nThan what I Want to tell her though it's like she doesn't understand she doesn't see the difference between politicizing thinkers and reality okay now I have listened on both sides of the fence because I have a daughter\nSo if you want to do if you if your daughter came to you and related that story there Angelica related to me\nRight my advice to her we'd been go down to police station but\nUh and they also have a son and I don't want him to be you know that if he's gone for a job\nThat standing there like them at the yang here absolute that's why we naturally fairness due process and\nA and an alleged punish those who we can obviously prove are out of line it's normally the conservatives who are saying let's put those people you know way if if necessary and oftentimes traditionally it has been\nA lot of the folks on the other side who say well you then again the second or third and fourth chance I Believe it or selling chance but after three or four times there are the chances you\nBut then the thing when we saw with Kavanaugh is we saw a process that was so way out of line because\nThere was no I mean what what we're seeing here is politics man and if people don't understand that lesson learned about politics it's a war it's a game it's like this is what we do\nWe can't make it ... you're right you're absolutely right and and that's what I have tried to do is just shy character Hugh\nI had tried for two months now to try to show that how\nWe tried to do that for eleven years to make people now into a twelve year to make people understand and I try to do that by I'm not going to sit on one side of the agency I'm right I'm right in right at the same time look at the people tonight who have been unreasonable with me\nI'm Eric from Bridgewater earlier tonight I've heard he would ask a question wouldn't give me a

she was down there observing demonstrating didn't matter she was a reasonable woman who obviously recently had a very nasty experience they could have got a lot nastier and we need to support women

C. news radio tens or whether it was never a\nAnd great thanks for having me Dan or\nWhat interests me about your background is that you have been very successful and very successful in the business that I've been in for a while and then of course Russia broadcast radio give us a little bit I can I can drone on a boat your biography but I'd much prefer\nYou to uh tell me what your um what you have done and ah you've you face some obstacles in life and you overcome those obstacles\nPressure so first of all I'm a western native\nWhereas even most important while\nYeah yeah for sure I dropped the accent and I had to eat out when I moved when I was twenty five years old\nAnd outside of Massachusetts but still a Red Sox and patriots fan and so you know still part of the team\nBut I I grew up in ... and ... grew up poor and my mom had left my father and ... and worked three jobs can make ends meet and you know I when I grew up I really believe that there was one lane where\nI live with the Israeli somewhat you know dark and challenged and there were the other lane or other people and that seemed really beat up on ... and I know what that ... style you know through life I\nI just decided I thought of work really hard 'cause I don't want to struggle for money that way that my mom and dad and I started with a paper route and then waiting tables and bartending and you know doing a number of things and then getting into sales and I really focused on generating money because that\nWas my number one concern and fear and\nI ended up in that radio ...\nAfter years and and I\nBecame an equity partner in a small company in ... at twenty\nSeven million dollar property and turned it into the five million dollar property and an under three years then and then moved on to publicly traded company and they came at the pie and they get that get a vice president and ultimately a cheap revenue officer before I\nWas fired a year ago and decided to go out of my own\nWell it's interesting how you graduated from Clark University which one of the great most as a bunch of great colleges sounds to me like the shorthand you grow up on what people would call I guess metaphorically the wrong side of the tracks and you wanted to figure out how to get across the tracks\nExactly yeah exactly it\nOkay and you did a lot of stuff\nThat I suspect um many successful people have done a which was not necessarily considered glamorous and ... was was not particular particularly in November of ... at the time\nBut those jobs those those lower level entry level jobs how important with ... and ... your character\nAnd the first thing that pops into my mind when you articulate it was I right outta college right outta Clarke I went to work at a commonwealth winery and which would then Gallo distributor Gallo winds and I went there because I saw when I bar tended how\nMuch money the sales people made and I thought you know I should do that\nAnd part of that job when he first got there there was a hundred men and two and then I was wanting it to\nOther than male dominated industry and you had to ride on the delivery trucks and deliver it the case of the wind\nWhich meant also you had to carry the sixties and voice their cases of wide off the delivery truck I assume\nAt Twenty one years old right exactly\nWith us but those are good those are good experiences and uh so you make the transition into radio what I Want to do is you want to take a break and I want to come back when I talk about ah getting into the ...\nVideo business and I also want to talk about the lessons that ah that you've learned in life and what I'd like to do is see if there are some folks out there who would like to call in and maybe tell you where they are briefly how they're stuck\nIn from where they are and where they want to get to and maybe you can give them some guidance and some advice I assume that's ah that's very possible I Hope\nLet's get him on stock let's do it\nOkay so if you're out there going to listen to Heather uh\nMonaghan my guest or for the next segment or to try to applaud out how she got to where she got to and again the the book is confidence creator is this just out

if you're stuck if you're in a job that you feel is a dead end job maybe had there might be able to make a suggestion to you\nAnd I also want to particularly here for women are because a\nBook or the

written a best seller confidence creator how you create confidence in yourself I think all of us have a different times in our lives so confident different circumstances\nAnd other circumstances we quick we do not feel confident Heather on the run up a hypothetical by before we get to phone calls and so far we only have many callers on the line which really disappoints me that the women are not going to take advantage of this opportunity we'll get to that at a moment\nBut last hour I had a caller from Michigan and jealousy who called\nAnd we were talking about the cabinet confirmation hearings and the fallout from it et cetera and she presented me a um a a situation that she found herself in\nAnd she asked me what I thought she should have done I made the mistake of not finding out from her what she did actually do but make a long story short\nShe told me that um where she lived didn't tell me if she's in a big city or a small town she had a a new neighbor who she is not met and she walked by him on the street one day this is his name but there's not a professional setting and the guy said you all very nice to see you and she said Oh thank you nice to see you too\nAnd then the guy made the comment to her or it'll be nice to see you when you do more yoga exercises\nThis was like so much she had never met before okay this was like hey how you doing nice day out\nRight so I I I'd love to know what your suggestion to her would be there was not a workplace situation and it's a neighbor\nAnd and then I'm going to tell you what I came up with I'd love to know what what advice you would have given to her she she wanted to know what she thought she should have done and I I should have found out what she in fact did I had a specific suggestion love to know what you would have suggested\nThat first thing that comes into my mind you know hearing that situation as you know that person doesn't know her so\nThey are absolutely injury you absolutely not whatsoever\nRight so it's kind of interesting so I really want to set the tone for the first thing that popped into my mind that I Would say is that what they choose you know I Would make it very clear that inappropriate and I hear what they have to say it also buys you a little bit of time because when you're still thrown off\nBy something like that you don't\nKnow exactly how to respond and and and he can be listening to death and and it's still are you know say well I did it you don't know and kill your ... that situation what that feels like right so\nI Am ... yeah I've never had a random person and say that to me so I really don't know what I Would say however the first thing that\nPopped into my mind it I Would want to clean my ground I Would say excuse me in that person's feel very uncomfortable that they don't know who they're dealing with and see how they respond that's going to allow it it's going to buy you a minute and then get more information on the thing kind of handle the situation better that the first thing that I think up\nOkay I'll tell you what I said I'm ... because she had said to me this is a stranger and I do think that she said she kinda just kept\nOr and so my advice to her was to immediately and I wasn't sure what community she live what type of community she lived\nIce and go to the local police and report the incident because it might be that this guy had a background for someone to make that sort of comment to someone who didn't know a ... but a neighbor nonetheless somebody who was going to live\nIn the same vicinity um go to the police and maybe the police would be able to look him up and say hey this guy has had a problem before or maybe he asked\nAnd the other problem before maybe it was just a jerk or and the police can go and visit him and say look this is what we're told happened ah it's better not happen again and I think most police departments would do that and do it willingly so that was my suggestion I don't know if if you're saying I'm off base with that\nMy guest is Heather Monaghan her book confidence crude or into joining us from Michigan is Angelica from west Heather\nOh let me get to appear on the line because she may have a follow up or recall back and Rob I don't know why I'm not good we go higher ... normally we don't call back but you're always go ahead\nYou were wondering what actually ended up happening what the gentleman that I had\nMy yoga comment you but as we would save as Paul said now the rest of the story go ahead\nYeah so you're kind of want to but the day before that that comment I was actually an import a apartment in a different gentleman had circled the fall for ten minutes\nLike say slanted and um I felt uncomfortable laughter and I had I had I I kind of gave away my power by next thing to have that in the hospital he would have had no idea how he's going to let her life you know they are that ... that we're not going to overcome that actually conduct\nOut you know it was my duty to talk about what can appropriate behaviors I approached and said hey\nMaybe uncomfortable and his response on the line that oh under the yoga instructor um and but at the Y. and I just thought that you could do really good job not to buy 'em so hopefully in the future he recognized for that wasn't OK I'm going to get the failed but here it's like oh I didn't I didn't ... you know like I was like looking out for me I'll\nShow you did with Heather suggested and it worked\nI I Hope so I'm waiting for us either now that okay did you ever know the problem with the guy\nA while I actually watch for like a month long road trip after that so I'm going to be back there starting tomorrow Muslim or anything I had\nTo go ahead Heather sounds to me like I didn't get the whole story last hour in Angelica did take control of the circumstance\nBut I I think that sounds great at you know and it's great that you were so self reflective and email realize when you thought that one situation and how you didn't feel good about addressing it that you get that next time you know life is all about progress and learning from our situations and I think that's fantastic that you did that\nAnd I will be shocked at that man gives you a hard time again based upon how you handle that you really created some theories abound rates for yourself which is you know that's amazing\nA jolly good thanks so much for calling back in my favorite color than they are very rarely do we leave we allow people to come back on to say ... I think we've never done this before but it was well worth it I mean I'm a regular listener in a regular color out there in Michigan okay we have a lot of listeners in Michigan believe it or not\nGreat thank you so much\nIt has been very unbiased and friendly and I appreciate that night\nThanks Angelica talk too soon but I loved that call okay let me get a we're going to get three and I promise let's go to Bruce in low Bruce you a next door nice to have the money and go ahead Bruce\nDana Hi Heather I'm I'm actually in hall H U L L\nHome here in Massachusetts he is he's not calling for the other side of the other go ahead\nI'm\nA I'm afraid the dam that I Would instinctively lower my so to that person's level of making a comment about but snide remarks and I would have turned up by a woman I Would have\nTurned to him and said well I'll see you shortly after you use your in larger for three or four months old so\nI kind of get to drift veer Bruce you I Would have been quite rude I haven't been coy fruit yeah right okay I wasn't tried a few months to a a kicked a as a woman but you look it's tough for you and me to put ourselves in that situation Bruce yeah if you know yeah you know what I'm saying that\nShe did the right thing there's no doubt about it and training my personal training tells me to handle living in that regard but I think I Would have shaft Adam you've got a lot of nerve buddy\nI Bruce Bruce you ate the whole thing but you for taking my call you bet your body and thanks have a great now let me get Debbie in New Hampshire\nDebbie won't give me an extra nice with the money and go ahead Debbie\nHi thank you so much for taking my car um I'm I I think a little older than the woman that either and in that called in earlier I'm I'm forty six and um I too has had a lot of in the workplace\nYears ago not knowing how to deal with that but I think that's one of the things that we need to remember is that um as much as are willing to learn how to handle themselves in different situations um you know a lot of other people out there are struggling with with what can they say and what can't they say it\nAnd sometimes people say things completely innocently and still me that's the way it is or the way it sounds so I Love that on how they're called that she said that she\nAsked what he meant by that and um\nI think that's so important because when you're talking about a workplace\nIssue so many things are just don't even bring it up don't even talk about it it's not appropriate ever but when you're talking about a neighbor situation and people are in Iraq than maybe you know in his exercise type of thing they might say something\nI'm trying to these social I mean I think a lot of people um forget about you know generational differences and about ... people are sometimes not socially than a ... a little socially awkward as and they said something and they didn't ...\nThat just generous of you let me see of Heather ... agrees that workplace different than the neighbor who are different from a a social setting a party or something that the howdy howdy filter or working in different circumstances in filter maybe what might be saying the same sort of comments in a different set of circumstances\nYou know that's a great point there is nothing wrong with asking\nThat question right so the more information we have\nThe better we can process and handle the situation it's really about how you feel if you feel threatened and come there well there's a reason for that right so\nThat it really helps guide you and and like you said if it the neighbor and you're not feeling threatened and you want to know more that's a great point\nAsk more questions that we don't know is that person socially awkward and were they just trying to make a connection we're not sure that that the most important thing is that you feel safe and that you listen to your guts because you're gonna know instinctively and that is a conversation you can happen or not but I\nI Do agree with you I think we're program with that are fight or flight instinct ah which you ballot commonsense whatever you want intuition whatever phrase you want a and you probably should follow your instinct ah and yeah\nAnd if you really feel threatened probably want to treat them differently than you think that this guy might just be a Gruber and doesn't really know how to start a conversation effectively thanks Debbie\nBut one other thing I just wanted to mention is I'm actually looking at a different options as far as they talked for a lottery or earlier on um I was involved and fend off I that a lot as a\nTest\nNo matter how was that was from the other day and I love to have in the corporate world valid I looked into\nPositive results hospice server in health care in something like that but I Am a little of it being forty six years old and the\nRole I suspect that hospice um since the ... they're going to need a lot more people for hospice care as as as these years goes by goes by go go ahead Heather as the baby boom generation ages go ahead other quick comment Debbie\nShirt so with Twenty years experience in one lane and lay that it needs in it for three years old and I was fired I really question\nThe same thing that your question right now you know I've been doing this and but can I go over here and go to another lane and what I've learned is there are no lanes years gills and unique talent\nAre yours and you can own\nThose and flourish where ever you decide to take that and we had listened to this outside voice for so long that we live here and you're good at this and this is your job and this is what you are that's not real and I am living proof of that for eight years old I'm forty four now\nI we invented myself as an author and I can tell you I wasn't the best you and I was in a guy that people thought was going to write a book but you know what I listened to myself I applied what's unique about me\nI was the real me and I stepped in to it\nLater I I hate to I hate to step into it as well but Debbie I'm flat out of time and he'll do you know radio business works were flat out of time Debbie thank you for your call\nHeather thank you for your comments is entitled confidence creator and it is available Amazon on Jindal all sorts of different places stay there like to thank you off the air Heather and I'll give it a plug in the other side as well okay\nThank you thanks don't don't hang up we'll be right there to the calls I Apologize but here comes the news\nA and in some cases I guess someone could be a winner and loser\nI don't want to suggest a single name because I don't want to spoil the water okay so I think all of you know the players\nThe people that you've seen on your TV screen for the last ... intensely for the last couple of weeks but the people who have made appearances on your TV screen for the last well really month\nAs soon as it all was stirred up as soon as the accusers came forward and I don't want to make a judgment as to I've told you that I found professor forward to be credible\nI did not include her identification a judge Kavanaugh to be accurate\nUh I think that was what a many people and concluded so I'm going to ask a real simple question we've just gone through a very difficult period of three weeks\nThree weeks and I want to hear from you who was the biggest winner if there was a winner here ah and it doesn't have to be an individual it could be a concept\nOr it could be an institution\nA winner oil loser\nI think you get my drift I think you were smart enough audience for me not to say well what about this person or what about that person\nSix one seven to five for ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty the red Sox Iran thing in New York it's fourteen to one\nIs robbing so bad that right now the Yankees have a catcher who's pitching\nUh it's been a a one night for the Yankees and hopefully the red Sox can win it tomorrow night and not have to come back to Boston but at least they're they have taken back\nThat their their home field advantage with a very impressive fourteen to one thrashing\nOf the Yankees in Yankee Stadium six one seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty winners and losers the Kavanaugh's confirmation process is over in the first hour we talked about first two hours we talked about\nWhat I think will be the continuing efforts of some and the Democratic party to continue to go after Kevin aren't even perhaps to impeach him but I Want to hear\nWho do you have more respect for who do you have less respect for and it doesn't matter which side of the political equation you fall in love to see if there is a consensus winners and losers I'll keep that try to let you know six one seven to five or ten thirty Tripoli nine to nine ten thirty\nSheryl from bill Rick starts us off this hour Hi Cheryl how are you All right Dan how are you I'm good I Know that you follow this closely 'cause you've called a few times in the last few weeks um you can give me a winner a loser for we give me one of each [noise]\nUm I Wish I was I was I'm\nCalling while you were talking about that I had a different reason for calling\nOh go ahead then that's fine you don't have to you can call with ... and you won't go ahead\nBecause I don't really think there

churns as for enough okay and I think I ... I think that was several upon how I feel about this last couple of weeks you know okay [laughter] um [noise]\nBut I mean should I knew reason I'm calling and I've tried to call you for the last week and I'm just not been able to get in\nLate Allen busy it's been a it's an interesting time go ahead\nThere have [noise] um [noise] I've talked to Ford was credible too I I I think that you and I probably in the minority as far as you know I'm a you know our political persuasion and I think many people agree with us but I Do think she was credible but I thought that he was credible to\nInsist they can't both be right I Do have a theory as to how she could have been mistaken\nWhich would also explain why she doesn't she couldn't she couldn't tell anybody can't tell anybody where the house was what street it was on she can't describe anything but\nI have to warn you that the meal the only people that I got to really understand what I'm Talking about the people who have bad eyesight like I Do okay\nGo ahead [noise] All right so you just put a couple of pieces of evidence together I I watch your testimony more than once okay just to test my very\nFirst of all she said she only had one beer [noise] All right now I tend to doubt that All right but um let's just take her at her word and said that she only had one beer right she's only Fifteen Years old she's not used to drinking anyways uh so I think that one beer would get a ...\nI don't drink at all I'm a teetotaler I can tell you as an adult one beer would get me biased right All right so\nLet's just say that she was you know probably she probably had a little bit of a bizarre and maybe a big buzz on since I think she probably had more like two or three years\nWhatever you get get to where you're going\nOkay so um [noise] I I notice that throughout the testimony she kept her glasses on and the very few times that she took them off\nIt was only for a second uh chewing and anytime anybody spoke to her she would immediately put them back on and I was struck by that because I Do that you know and the reason I Do that is because I was behind this is a bad without glasses a contact lenses [noise]\nAnd when I was her age I Would I ... I refused to where my glasses I walked around without them I keep them in my purse and I'd sneak them on but I walked around without them and I'm telling you that I couldn't see three feet in front of\nMe so would you say is someone attacked her but she couldn't identify the person and she thought it was Brett Kavanaugh\nWell think about this for a\nSecond goes is what I'm trying to get you to the ... ... ...\n... ... I Am I Am\n... let me let me just say it though you know won't take that long [noise]\nYou know uh it would explain why she can't you know I I went to parties at her age when somebody else's car I couldn't have told you what street I was on cars because although I saw the streets that I couldn't read it if somebody if you stood in front of me right now three feet away\nI could see I be able to see but I Would not recognized your face 'cause it would be a blur\nI don't know what her on Tom Cruise to her ophthalmologist per se but I get the theory show you think she's blind is about\nWhat I'm saying is is the way we remember she said that so many came out when she went up to the bathroom Seventy came up from behind it and she said I didn't see it was they pushed me in the bedroom from behind\nWhat she didn't say after that though is whether the room was dark or light I've a feeling that the bedroom was probably dark um there's a combination\nOf a little bit of alcohol and she ...\nI got it I got you got your theory Cheryl it's we're sort of litigating the case so I think it's interesting you comments I hadn't thought of it that way then\nIf it had been me I Would have been able to see the curse and even even if they were right on top of me in a dark bedroom and I don't know that by the one thing I don't know that she didn't say was whether the Romans jock but I think it's probably safe to\nAssume that it was yeah I Would assume so the other thing too is that even people who are very near sighted or at that age that domain puberty okay\nClose they can they can identify but I didn't want to discuss I didn't want to argue about when the debate that one because they think it's an interesting theory maybe some people will respond to that as well but I'm past my break and I got to let you go and please keep calling don't ever hesitated sometimes the line gets busy but\nYour break color and I always appreciate your participating thanks thanks ... thank you thank you then\nYou're much Sheryl did not want to pick a winner or a loser or both so I Will open it up to you or it's over we'll at least for now it is judge Kavanaugh is confirmed he's a justice on the United States Supreme court and failing you beach rent\nAnd I don't think there's much to impeach him on in my opinion he's going to remain there or we will see the results are November six\nAs to whether or not there is the so called a Brit bump for the Republicans or whether or not this is going to drive voters away from President Trump if you want to opine on that but I'm specifically interested in who you think is the most\nUh who's the biggest winner and who's the biggest loser and you can give me both or either six one seven to five or ten thirty Tripoli nine to nine ten thirty I'll give you my thoughts I first want to hear from you [noise]\nNight side with Dan re some news watch never stops W.
