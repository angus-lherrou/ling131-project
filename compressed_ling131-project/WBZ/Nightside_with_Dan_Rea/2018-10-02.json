thanks very much Rob a a as we has it has been our want\nUh we like to begin every Monday night's program before we get to the meat of the matter which we will get to in a moment before we get to the meat of the matter a we have started a Monday Night tradition here on nights site\nIn which we like to begin the program with a playing the national anthem the reason we do this is because ESPN on Monday Night football\nHas decided had declared that they would no longer showed the national anthem or play the national anthem in advance of their Monday Night football games\nNow I think that does a disservice to the men and women in this country who has served\nThat flag I also think it does a disservice to the NFL protestors\nBecause I think that for them not to be allowed to protest if if that's they want if that's they want\nIt deprives them the opportunity so this is the national anthem sung by a young I Believe that this is the seven year old girl I'm which are which Rob a play in a moment it was sun by this little seven year old girl\nWho is an incredible presentation this was before a soccer game uh in California so I Will ask you again I Know if it's raining or drizzling but at least crack you window or if you're driving in a car and if you want to crack in a couple of inches that's OK and turn up the radio\nAnd do we dedicate this one to the to the young people in this

Massachusetts hey Matthew you're next on nights I go right ahead\nThen you would want to get you know I have a wire haired go right ahead oh\nOkay well I ... yeah I was going to throw it out that\nThe judge right just sure why can't they\nWhy can't they run it like election like you know it it seems like it gives the senators too much power or like finalists ... you get three people like a police promotion and they\nExplain what they did do a big background checks so they know everything and then open it up to the public and let them vote on who they want because it seems like it's more power position and the president\nWell we have the problem here Matthew is is the provision in the constitution that says the president appoints with the advice and consent of the Senate judges to the U.S Supreme Court so we'd have to change the constitution in order to do you\nThink of I mean they probably would never change it but then then the people were ... we have a voice\nBut we don't elect federal judges all federal judges are appointed we do some states do\nJudges Pennsylvania for example a new elect judges Massachusetts does not so it's it it depends upon but with federal judges they're all appointed and they were appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate\nIt in and I understand that but don't don't you think they should have done that hard work a little better when they you know I Know I have friends on the state police and they do background checks a new candidate and they go deep\nInto it and why don't we just became a sergeant and he even said he goes I Try to do the best job I possibly can get because when I retire I Want to know that I did the ... the lead the state in good shape we could policeman\nIn ...\nUh I think that's probably what what the what the these FBI agents to do as well they've investigated him six times when they do a background check the ... if you are going to be nominated for something Matthew with the FBI would do is say OK where the macro to high school where did he grow up where they go to college where did he work beforehand\nDon't tell them if you're gonna get any sort of security clearance okay even if you're in the military and degree in your home town to be on your street to be talking to your neighbors\nWho didn't go out with and and they've done would say oh he hung out with some guys from a different well let's find out that's what they do that's what they do the gun and six times so all of this stuff\nThey didn't have did they not interview his jail classmates back in the day I mean it's a relatively ... it's a small group of people that did you graduate from high school with certainly a little larger in college\nBut I never went to college but no but you know what I'm saying I mean you guys like absolutely I agree yeah and so I I\nAnd that's all that's all I'm saying and and whether or not um it was done right six times uh hopefully be done right this time in\n... I mean I was my the question you asked Matthew okay if you let us say hypothetically yeah we're being yeah I'm a native for judge and they went through your background I'll bet you drink some beer in high school\nWell honestly yes I did but you know and like even like when I graduated high school my graduation day and and and I have from a prominent family that had like they own asphalt ... they're rich [laughter] I actually had four ounces\nI wasn't I wasn't big in the drinking football team I didn't play football was going to lead the way I went to one football ... six pack of beer\nI drink more if someone said they have you ever drink over the women I Would say yeah I I went to a party that had phobias and I drink 'em all and then I broke two off another guy I'm not going to lie about it it's like hey I'm human\nThough you're ineligible for the Supreme Court [laughter] I Know I don't like talking to you know keep\nCalling back right at the uh nine o'clock news done have you on the line Sam Nancy I Will get you all and I promise and feel free to give us a call six one Seventy five or ten thirty AAA\nNine to nine ten thirty this is Dan ready for window world get ten beautiful energy saving windows now for only thirty nine Seventy nine just eighty five dollars per month window world seven eight one to two thirty four forty six\nIf you work with pumps motors drives for commercial you're just about what he's hospitals are schools go Williams in New England pumping motor WABC Odessa group dot com\nAnd I wonder if he is a good good good I'm\nGoing to switch it let's switch gears on on uh on on the other are the major thing had last friday right that everybody in the U.S was able to take a ... a ... that says it's just going to be ... ... is right for the for the lifelong job of\nPosition which has got more color right\nThen somebody said mum on pause and the potential but make that shouldn't be vetted out and if somebody has not been a big old but I\nDo I do believe you know that when people\nHave been in that ... are they mentioned that line and she'd go and it'll go to the go to the police at the time and complain about it\nBut if if I had to listen to judge Kevin uh say that he did say it was the process of it and then he was right and if you know that somebody who had been there on the hill it's fat inside and it's such a good ... what are your parents\nNot big guns and you know how how this is going to go if you go and chatting and it's not going to\nGo there Shashi sale Sam Sam I'm Dr Ford said she never confided in any one half the time\nAnd that she never she never confided in any one she did not tell her parents so you're you're raising an interesting point but is a point that that would not have happened because if she did a a you know if she did not tell her parents what she believes happened\nThen the parents could not have cautioned against bringing charges against Brett Kavanaugh or Fifteen year old a Seventeen year old Brett Kavanaugh\nPrank but then if you see the point\nI mean she ...

twenty twenty Susan in Chicago Susan next on my side you're next on the ring central nights I caught a line going ahead\nHi I'm trying to make a quick I have to question but why was that a Christine Ford turnover core counseling records two thousand twelve two thousand there came to the ... committee [noise] um [noise] what is she hiding here why she turned me over\nAnd say that I'll give you an answer or this woman wrote a letter to Dianne Feinstein in which she said she wanted to maintain their anonymity\nAnd someone in either Feinstein's officer on the Democratic side league that anonymous that letter and which she asked the confidentiality I can understand why she doesn't want her medical records or a psychiatric records released to this to the same people probably released the were released those to\nAny answer there have any inconsistencies and what she's saying maybe I'd heard shape with assault in their late teens that when she was Fifteen [noise] um [noise] again inconsistencies\nHe didn't know how many Jews why attack her well because I see the pain and catch cabin on a white face and I look at his two young girl and I look at the ... they had been looking at the health\nCare of by Dianne Feinstein if she had had shared that information that letter on a confidential base with Grassley they could have had a quiet FBI investigation let's assume that the FBI investigation came up with nothing that would have been the end of it they would have been no embarrassment for anyone\nOr if the FBI investigation grow up with something\nThat could have called the president said you really want to go forward this nomination he would have withdrawn denomination no Feinstein helga letter until the last moment it was the ace approve sleeve and she didn't care about the anonymity requests from I'm from Christine forward\nAll she cared about was the politics veers where the is the the criticism should should should be lodged in my opinion Susan\nOkay fair enough but why do we know about this sport has shed a heritage that people have that are sexually assaulted her in the past [noise] um [noise] you know I had ... mentioned on friday night and she uh mentally ill paranoid whatever who knows we don't know anything about her and\nOf course you're still focusing on the wrong place in my opinion I I Do why don't why I Try to do with Susan I don't care what you try about Susan Ford the the people here she was used by the Democrats she was used by the lawyers who the Democrats recommended to her by\nA by catch the lawyer cats who did not can tell her that the that the uh the community would fly to California to meter\nBut you know look a she's a very accomplished a woman with Kim Masters a PHD traveled all around the world she doesn't know how to call the Senate anyway why I think she filed a criminal complaint that the local headquarters police headquarters in Montgomery County\nWhere it should start why have running to the FBI which you have to provide actual evidence and by the way thank goodness that or is it the Franco on friday night had it not matter feelings whom you believe you need some evidence here that life being destroyed\nA person like judge Kavanaugh who has had no ethical complaints whatsoever it\nAgainst Susan I think you ... if if you're looking to win hundreds to your side okay which I Hope you would be she it was used she was used she was used by Dianne Feinstein she was used by the other Democrats on the panel\nIn my opinion and she was used by the lawyers that were recommended for her to retain by Dianne Feinstein office she wears used she's\nShe's been re victimized that's the point that that you and other Republicans and I say that well with all due respect should be focused on in my opinion\nBut how can everything she says have so many inconsistencies anyway All right ... thank you\nBye bye let me keep it wrong here Steve in New York City you an extra nights out of the rings central nights I

Massachusetts while I was centered in me that will work for them for the next six years\n[noise] um [laughter] do you think there's any possible a ... that is it ... and within the realm of any possibility that she's going to heed your call\n[laughter] no no of course not I mean look you know there's been people asking her to help them for a long time whether it's veterans at all that she uh ignored for over a hundred and Thirteen Days whether it's the fisherman did ask for help with the federal oversight by NOAA and she promised to have a staffer\nStart working with the ground a fishing industry the the second nine folks uh they said that they've never met\nThe liaison that she said she promised she had two staffers that have gone to New Hampshire to go work for the Democratic party up in\nNew Hampshire to I guess get a presidential run in order so but she always been focused on her own presidential ambitions for years and is the argument we made for a long time is that you know\nWhat do you have to gain by having one go back to the Senate forty whereas you all have a seat at the table right now with the White House that's controlled by Republicans house has said it\nGot Republicans oriented need somebody advocating for Massachusetts where there's the transportation bill it's getting beat up comes out\nAs a there's a ton of projects around the state we can use that federal funding for\nAnd you know Elizabeth Warren comes knocking at the White House you think they're going to give her the project she's asking for there's no way\nWell maybe you you mentioned veterans in her um a unwillingness to even talk with the veterans I happen to know John Macdonald is one of the founders of veterans assisting veterans up in the ... valley there's not a better guy in the\nUh in the fight for veterans to John Macdonald a and I know that that he was very frustrated with her unwillingness even to initiate are engaged in a conversation about veterans' issues yeah\nDennis ... his his part\nYou know I Know during his very well as with a dentist enjoy guys guys\nAnd you know those are kind of guys that they take no salary the\nOrganization they work with is completely non profit everything the trees goes right back to giving veterans wheelchairs special equipment they need if they've been wounded or she is they come back and they have certain age that's all they're doing and that's all they're asking for which will help from our senator and you know back in the day\nYou could count on people like Scott Brown you could count on people like Ted Kennedy I mean that's the hallmark they worked for constituents they delivered for Massachusetts\nTed Kennedy was very good on veterans issues\nDespite whatever criticism that people wanting to levy at him um he a Senator Kennedy was very good on veterans issues which through this Jeff let's take a secret take a few phone calls we've been we've been talking a little bit about the Kavanaugh up a situation my understanding ... has your position changed on judge Kavanaugh at this point\nNo I've always felt that he um ... we should move forward if there was no corroborating evidence and so far there hasn't been from what it sounds like the FBI\nIn their efforts to um I guess do this last bit of I mean the seven review of the judge I think he's at six previous screenings by the FBI gets the shipments will determine finally once and for all\nThat uh you know his his defense of his innocence is accurate and if that's the case then I think it needs to move forward\nBut let's do this on we're going to break a we're only going to keep you until I'm half hours we keep you've above twelve fourteen more minutes draw the line we'd like to talk with Jeff deal\nGreat uh if you want to if

Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty\nI got to be honest with you Jeff I I Know this is going to disappoint you as a friend but I'm praying that she runs for president [laughter]\nWatch you know that okay I Am pray it would be the answer to my dream and we\nAll know we all know that the results of that would be a failure and again you know Massachusetts just can't afford to have a senator wasting two years a pressure\nNoises and I and that's a very serious point but I'm just saying that oh Elizabeth if you can please just leave work this into\nThe into the schedule because I just know that when she's out on the campaign trail and she's ask tough questions like you know how do you know your Native American and she responds with such honest forthright non condescending answers like this\nOne was in uh Brooklyn restaurant a cop or more Wall Street reforms when she was asked again are you part Indian\nMy mother\n[laughter] ... if you look up the word

Hey Steve how are you\nA dad are you um do agree a\n... though the last time we talked I think we recall the gentleman's bad but it it got even more bizarre I Can't believe that if if if your bed me that it will get more bizarre from before she testified I would've said no and it it ... it technically did this is the most\nThe oddest thing I've ever seen what this Jeff Flake nonsense and and here's\nWhat I don't understand about and wind and one's pressing on this is why issue refusing to turn over those therapy notes she showed them to the Washington Post and from what I understand she's refusing to turn them over to the committee and she's refusing to get them to the FBI and and that\nLong ago to ... I'm going to tell you why but I think I think this this memory was recovered through hypnosis especially a deadly afraid I got an answer for you and you're not going to like the answer I\nUsed to you know had she wrote an anonymous winter\nTo Senator Dianne Feinstein and asked that it'd be kept her and him and he'd be protected\nWhat happened in that letter it does leaked by someone in Feinstein's offer someone on Feinstein staff or someone on the law firm the Feinstein's office recommended to her why would\nYou want to do your psychiatry notes to the same ... who leads\nAnd it was just a thought\n\nDianne Feinstein the officer or an attorney I'm just going by you know if if you're going to put yourself out there as a victim and you're and you're going to testify to these notes in front of Congress yeah then you're obligated regardless of what you want I mean there's a discovery process here that we we know everything about cabinet and the most important crucial piece of evidence regarding her\nStatements and what what she has said hasn't been turned over to investigators\nSay I mean I think he's I raise\nEighties I understand your point but I'm just saying rise if you would you want I I I I made my my made my case uh\nOh not dying shrines with their by messed\nThis up from day one I think she did it intentionally or if in July late July early August she'd gone quietly to Grassley and say look we may have a problem with this nominee because look at this letter now let's assume that that is a quiet FBI investigations on I guess one\nThis guy did this they could have called the president in the middle of August or late August and Mr President I think it's in your interest to withdraw the nomination and they would have made an announcement that for personal reasons he was withdrawing the nomination uh and that's\nHow I I don't I don't I I don't I think that a background check would have proven exactly what these are which is what the prosecutor came to the conclusion I wouldn't follow up on these and they're totally uncorroborated unsubstantiated I don't think he would've called them for that reason that it would it would it would have prevented these these other two people end up staying sweating that goes on TV that I I guess that didn't do too well for a\n... his client from what I saw her on Twitter but um you know this but the thing is turned into just a ... or ... at this point and then I feel bad for this photo but there are a lot of old and our story and I I think if she did recover this through some form of it no system that is an important fact that the committee needed to know\nWell let's see if I had met let's see maybe maybe the the FBI will come up with the investigation Steve I Want to get one more in okay you've got a buddy say about\nThanks very much let me get real quickly here and I'm going to push but I Want to get there in before the newscast and the Olympic lock newscast and Jay in Boston go

today the United states and Canada agreed to a replacement for NAFTA and it's called the U.S Mexico us MCA for U.S Mexico Canadian agreement\nRichard how is that playing up in in the great north to nights\n[noise] well it is the biggest story I'm a a you know there are stories probably back age two or three but national question it's the biggest story and [noise] I uh [noise] you know I I actually think that that a\nPresident Trump did nothing wrong in these negotiations not many [noise] Canadians may say that um but um\nWell let me ask you this do we're still left just started that there are still left out why there would be a tariff\nOn American aluminum and steel when one he's using it as a national threat and certainly Canada is not a national threat [noise] um he was completely right on the three hundred percent dairy situation with Quebec\nBut um [noise]\nI'm Trudeau and move on that because he was prepared to move on it with the\nAsian trade acts he was making [noise] so um kudos to President Trump because he knew that and um [noise] uh overall I I think what candidate gave up there um\nBut that's good for the agreement and what we maintain is the big thing 'cause we wait the dispute and the mechanism [noise]\nHad President Trump had his way on that issue there wouldn't be in agreement as we talk right now\nRichard let me put it in terms that all of us can understand you seem to have a pretty good sense of this give us an example of how it was and what has changed as a result of this in terms of how it might affect Canadian consumers are American consumers is there a couple of examples you can throw as\nWell um [noise] yes there's\nSo that so that people don't need a Harvard degree in economics to understand [noise]\nIf if if they weren't going to buy\nA car and this agreement hadn't been signed there was a good possibility that that ate the Trump Administration was going to raise tariffs and the pac which is a deal since Nineteen sixty five that Canada and United States have\nWhen you say hey look Richard stick with me now I hate pronouns okay when you say if you were going to buy a car are we talking about\nRichard in Ontario or Dan in Boston buying that or a rich\nIt Richard in Ontario if he was going to buy a car it probably would have been ten to twenty five percent more expensive I'm at this deal not been reached\nSo if you're going to buy a twenty thousand dollar car a it would cost you in Paris maybe twenty two or twenty four thousand dollars\nOr more OK Sylvia for you by the current in Canada right without any imported from the U.S\nA lot of it that a lot of makeup of the cars been imported and they and what will be added to that car would be that percentage there's no question about\nOkay so in ... so so therefore since this deal now will keep cars intended it coming in from the U.S a little less expensive give me an example of how it might help or hurt somebody down here and these are always the average person doesn't understand the whole concept to Paris and\nUh in packs and stuff but they do understand what it costs to buy a gallon of milk\nSure [noise] um the the uh American consumer would now be able to buy a Canadian milk 'em\nIf they so choose at a at a reduced price [noise] and ah that's reduced price as as what as compared to what it would have been had there been no deal\nIf you let me ask you about why we had a lot of ... and stuff down here in America why we worship in milk back and forth across what is it seems to me that that the American college we produce enough milk in America Canadian cows\nEverything is open for business [noise] like just like in my home town right now there is a five hundred million dollar bridge going to be built\nOkay that five hundred five hundred million dollar bridge contract was awarded to an American firm K\nSimilarly if ... if there is a government ... method element project by the way if there's a government project available in the states any catering company has the right to bet on that\nYou know and I get that I get that but what I'm trying to understand and again and I'm and maybe you can help me maybe you can really understand it is that I get it oh you got some particular company in America that builds exactly the type bridge that you need in in your home town in Canada I get that but what I'm saying is\nYou know it's a ... why do I have to ... in Massachusetts import Canadian milk we get milk we got a dairy farms all over New England and we just I just don't understand the hang up in the mill thing and I really maybe they're going to talk to an economist on it I don't understand it\nOr the one thing the mail is ... is that the the producers and co back where this is mostly happening in Canada producers in Quebec\nThey know their price okay\nThe price the price is fixed for them so they know what they're selling it and that so they know how to how much to produce or how much to produce a farmer in Massachusetts or Wisconsin [noise]\nIf if the truck pulls into the farmers driveway to pick up his milk and the guy in the truck says well this is what I'm giving you for a gallon if the farmer doesn't like it\nHe's probably dumping the milk that's a hard fact that's true that's he's he's getting rid of the milk he's I mean I've gotten a sour I ever\nAll right Richard Richard I'm there's all this has been good but I'm up on my break here I Want you to to help me going forward on this story because they know that you followed it closely up there and I just\nI just ... and maybe we'll get some ... ... maybe do a whole couple of hours in some nights just so I can understand it better I mean I really need this and I'm not playing dumb on this one I just don't understand why um why something like milk gets shipped here from Quebec I mean I could get it if they if they're doing\nYou know Canadian cheese or some product and all that but I mean milk has a has a shelf life of you know a couple of weeks maybe maybe\nWhat okay the dairy industry isn't the best industry to look at it I mean you can look at anything from the nylon and most of the positives industry\nWell we won't do it on this call left Detroit another call the other way past my ... ... way past my ... I'm going to get a scoop we'll talk soon and I'm next time I Will not let you I'm not sure what you wanted to call about tonight but I had to take the opportunity to discuss that with ya\nChurch just one comment happy anniversary and it was them um [noise] my ... a counselor for sexual abuse put me on to you eight and a half years ago is that true\nTo help me get through the night she said listen to enter a she did a masters in Massachusetts at a university\nEnded her PHD at McGill in Montreal\nSo well pleased if you see here at talk to her thank you because you've been a great listener integrate call ...\nAnd you have been a great friend and we'll start doing some vet soon for the shadow ...\nWill have to say okay well see the eggs Richard daycare but\nTalk to you soon that's interesting Rob how about that a counselor advice in in Ontario for someone to listen to our show\nSix or seven to vie for just dirty AAA nine to nine ten you're going to get back on the topic which of course his cabinet but I also just wanted to take advantage of Richard\nRichard actually has suggested to me a few weeks ago to get one of the Canadian ministers in the show the minister he suggests that was the one who was the ... the the deal with the U.S uh she declined maybe we'll get it right now the deal is negotiated\nBack oh night side right after this\nNice side with Dan re so news watch never stops W.
