C. news time eight o'clock cloudy skies in Boston forty five degrees\nOn a couple of minutes from our time but I think is where I was gonna say I don't know how to follow that they will do or what is the chief something well again as I say it's my little protest against ESPN I didn't mean intentionally rope you know this one older brother would write a book let's uh let's get to well let's get to a little bit of a\nLittle bit of politics in interesting times two week Trump tonight will be election eve it's going to be an exciting time of year the chance to get around the country much I'm sure when you have\nA I'm both around a bit I'm Dan and ... you know it's one of those circumstances it we are uh unfortunately a divided nation at the moment um there's a robust political debate going on I'm across the political spectrum and so\nIt gives 'em candidates the opportunity to try to make their case and I'm I'm fortunate that I was able to make it through a Democratic primary challenge back in September and um there's no Republican now that are on and on the on the ballot so I'm Still run around the disc quite a bit but I'm able to to travel around a bit more than\nI my shows is the Republicans new district was smarter than your democratic Conan We'll\nLet that go on that are we did All right um and I know who are ... percent if I'm not mistaken we do that was pretty good ... we did All right now the squeaker but it was comfortable rigged it All right\nThanks away um but you know done it is interesting because it enables me to run around the country um which has been helpful to me on a number of levels out one it's a useful to see what deems pop up all over and over and over again\nAnd and it's also useful when you travel to other parts of the country to understand what are the top issues that come up and other parts of the nation because\nI'm not everywhere has uh the ... viewpoint our our political ideology that that greater Boston in Massachusetts doesn't so I think without question the issue that comes up a most frequently actually on health care and trying to make sure that\nEverybody gets access to it that we can bring these prices down um that issues like preexisting conditions we don't go back to a time when\nInsurance companies can say that they're ... install lifetime caps are denied because of preexisting conditions and but this is a real economic challenge for many families and so I think ... interesting to see these political fortunes somewhat flipped from\nHaving the Affordable CARE Act to be an albatross around at Democrats next for for so long and now actually it's it's one of the big issues propelling democratic\nAnd we're not seeing a sizable increase one way or the other they will and a few weeks they want a few weeks but I think one what's also understand again\nFor whoever is organized this because if\nIt takes some level of coordination to get thousands of people to come together and start marching so\nWhat what are those who didn't what are those goals why are they doing it and what needs to be done to address it and the explanation to some of those individuals to say look what our country like every sovereign nation is not we did not have an open border that's if that's the belief that gender that's not the case\nWe have a process to go through to understand if there are viable claims for asylum in which case we can do to get them but if you don't have one then you're gonna get turned around and that's that's our system and that's OK\nOkay let me ask you a crazy question okay because because I came up with a crazy idea of the other day and I I think you identified the problem perfectly the poverty the destitution corruption we all everyone agrees on that\nWhat about if someone said let's send the U.S military again to do in cooperation with the government of Honduras in cooperation with the government to Guatemala in cooperation with the government of whomever would be willing to allow us to come in and work with that government to help that government eliminate the drug trade\nAnd eliminate the poverty that comes with it and the crime that comes with it\nNow I Know that whenever you talk about US military intervention anywhere people don't they get crazy but is that not a potential option assuming that the Honduran government or whichever government would would say less we would welcome you will work with you\nMean shorter supply line them in the middle east it's our backyard or doorstep am I totally nuts when they even contemplate that\nUm I think then that starts with a conversation one with those governments and too with an understanding of those people what they're going to interpret as a U.S military um support and then if it's one we do have military on the ground in those countries because we we already collaborate on\nA military training support 'em supplies from talking to my chicken it up a couple of nights understood um but I think also recognizing that the U.S military um\nHas does not always is not always met with the warmest of feelings for from individuals in those countries that are in Iraq yes we did um that\nIf the goal there is a sense they gain\nA trust and support so that you can root out corruption will you need to make sure that you've earned that support and trust in the local community and I think\nI don't have a plan ready for you at this point but I think there are um there's ways to one make sure that you're not going to get ourselves involved in an innovation\nTo that you're not going to um put your American troops in the position that American was going to be shed three recognize that there are institutions and again I'm One of the most influential and powerful ones in this region is the Catholic Church that actually can still has support in local communities\nThat I'm a lot of cartels and even violent gangs still respect\nWhen I was down there I think it was in Honduras and they said the the one place if\nAte somebody's targeted by getting the one place they can go to escape is doing the church and the what was the one place they will allow you to go traditional sanctuary so um but then when you come out your intro but that if you were to actually joined in and become a member of the church and become a priest or shorter touch where they live that's they let you go to commit a crime yes but um\nSo I think it is understanding what locally\nWhat organizations and institutions locally have that support and how you can do that through them and again this is not ... this is not a quick or easy fix my point being is if every administration decides to ignore the long term structural objective that we have\nA good long term structural obstacles that we face you're never going to get there and I see your next guest is just walked in the sitting right behind you um you know I think it's\nA far be it for ... to nine o'clock [laughter] you know that is Harvey Harvey needed to go into this is something that I think he he knows far better than I Do but\nWhen our first topic in the second one I think are linked here at Dan\nWhen that as long as people are able to as long as those the drug

this this is funneled by money American dollars off of our streets and we haven't even talked about China in sentinel now we'll leave that failed and that's that is also where you have to address the

I Would feel an awful lot better about this announcement if there was some idea of a plan that ... we this presented to not to the American public um but also obviously including Congress and Sudan there's obviously the allegations that the Russians have been been cheating on this and\nI I don't think there's any doubt that uh with the increase of just technological advancement that the the treaty is up for some updating all that being said the idea of um\nUnilaterally pulling out of this treaty I'm having the United states take the um\nThe burden for the world of of us pulling out I'm leaving a rush to be the ones that actually strep throat even if they were the ones that had been violating it without any idea as to some overall strategy about what does this mean how are we going to go about it when you start saying that it makes the world safer for some sort of nuclear weapons if you're getting into an intermediate range\nMissiles tipped with nuclear warheads you're still talking about nuclear war right this is not the idea that you're somehow going to contain that and not going to hell of a sudden leaked ICBMs is\nIt does it undercuts the theory that Trump is too close to boot and it seems to me that that if I'm ... and uh if if this is what my buddies doing I'm I'm a little bit concerned has helped Trump politically to diminish that allegation\nI think the the issue that I have with this administration their foreign policy is\nThe author lack of clarity as to what ... where these pieces fit in it is a tactical response without any sort of strategy and so I'm like are there things out there that have been done that um you know seem to be positive sure\nI think what we're what I'm looking for is to say how how is any how're any single one of these that policy maneuvers interventions actually linked to some sort of coherence as to what this means not just for the short term but for the long term and then I think that the real challenge here is\nYes this might give you some sort of short term and the Russians are violating will pull out we can invent some of these weapons or or reliance strategically fine part of it the architecture behind and the idea behind these treaties and others was a recognition that the United states can share some of these responsibilities with other partners\nAnd create a a a Web\nOf alliances that will deter bad actors that Russia China beat anybody else China's not part of the NFL tight China's not but the point is that those those partnerships as alliances that we create actually create some form of stability we start pulling out of all of them find you could say Russia by this and we're pulling out we're going to do our own thing\nBut you start doing that over and over and over again now of a sudden the the sole country that bears the burden for our own success is the United states and we don't aren't able to offset some of that cost on other countries too and so that's where the overall strategy around this\nNeeds to be there and I still haven't seen it from the administration\n... let's go back to me had Richard and Richard you get less than a minute because you weren't ready to go right ahead\nTry and make it quick Congress and Kennedy you're doing a fantastic job\nYou could say I know they are now like [laughter] go ahead Richard\nI just wanted to say that I'm currently in the biggest disgrace to open it but you know\nYou're one of the fuel it has the gift you've got the brains the ability to people and I know you're trying to work your way up the ladder but you know I Want to what we really need some some strength to work against Trump and I help you get a group or to Washington to it but\nDon't back down the courage to whip the brightest anybody out there in Europe the Godzilla brings and the experience to do it so\nWell originally originally about who we are at a time Congress we can't even sure what to say thank you Richard yeah I Do to keep going as long as the one on one force you read the news you raise yet at the age or do we have the newscasts coming up and then Boston police commissioner William ... is always congressman thanks for coming in second question I have\nFor anyone who's interested they're no pre screened pre screened calls the nights that we take them as they call and\nThank you so much ... soon by just start come back right after ...\nBlue Cross Blue Shield is Massachusetts is offering free informational seminars on Medicare registered on eight hundred to think to blue Blue Cross any dot com slash seminar\nBe any will ... over board members owners and managers this this Saturday from nine to two thirty at the Burlington Marion visit came died or vi any ...\nAnd what can I make statements like\nA violent repeat violent offenders should not be released into the community and then I hear ... one person say oh\nYou know you want to walk up black and brown men no\nIt is a criminals a criminal that should not be released into the community if they're committing acts of violence and that we as a community shouldn't stand for it so I'm just surprised that some people still want to make it a an us versus them when we've known all along or in most recent years rather that um\nThe community and the police working together is what gets the job\nDone well it should be us with us yes here or there are people who are on the right side or people in the wrong side a and a\nThankfully the people in the right side of the equation are protected by the police the thin blue line\nFar out numbers those on the wrong side of the street a ... only one or two percent joins Iceland a precisely in Enron any community um but they're the ones that do the damage and the other ones that have\nA this horrific impact I I Know that last week or so it was a little bit of a ... a little bit of spike I'm sure what rate in Boston um was that\n... ... gang related thing where there was more gang\nRelated book and I can tell you I'm not as a homicides were connected in any way that's what I met a ... a tit for tat type thing okay right on so you know we had robberies and I'm\nAt the fellows who used to be attended to the gasoline state yes yes yes things stations last friday to her\nI learned in on a on a on a scooter that may have been a a robbery and then you know a couple of where we think gang related but um you know what I'd like to say to the folks in Boston you do hear about when there are negative things that impact the community\nBut if you look at at the positive things you look at people in the community that are coming forward to help families that have challenges\nAnd to make sure those families don't feel isolated and the programs and initiative set forth by mere washed the Boston police department\nAnd some communities stakeholders like Conan Harris my brother's keeper on Saturdays smiles at Powell these are names of of folks you see out in the community always um during the right thing I just like to thank them and the community because you are making a difference one homicide\nIt's too many we have forty seven now I think the numbers would be much higher if there weren't people who have come forward and help families out\nUm all that being said they also have a true sense of justice and they realize to some folks can't be rehabilitated on his side we have to rehabilitate them with programs out there they are incarcerated\nBut once they're done so aren't doing so then welcoming them back in the community but the community deserves a sense of justice as well\nMy guess is Boston police commissioner William bras he's been the commissioner now for two and a half months or he served as department how many years\nThirty five to two years as a kid I sleep Boston police could I Am thirty three as a\n... I Want to get into your experience um I I think people\nYou know do not I'm just maybe do not appreciate what it takes to literally rise to the ranks and when you mentioned\nThat you started as a debt that says more about using anything that uh someone would say or do you because you obviously started at the ground level and I've worked in a way I Want to talk about the experience what lessons you've learned along the way and I lost when like people to give us a call six when seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty\nIf you have a matter in your neighborhood did you want to draw the commission as attention to be happy to McKinney gets ... about individuals however uh if you have been a concern in general concern and you want to talk to the commissioner about what's going on your neighborhood that's fine\nIf you're calling from out of town that's fine as well we have an extraordinary police commissioner here in Boston, Massachusetts we love the city\nYou compare the crime that does happen in Boston compared to the crime that happens in other cities similar size up and down the east coast of America and elsewhere\nYou will understand then what a great job the the leadership of the city including commission of Ross had done over the last several decades to make Boston the city it is today we're going to come back we're mission of brushing your phone calls more conversation right after this [noise]\nNight side with Dan re some news watch never stops company ... news radio ten thirty [noise]\nCurious about investing in Canada based and learn more about how to invest in the booming cannabis industry don't watch the high time investor women are at high tide investor dot com high times investor dot com\nI sold the corps offering will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with unqualified by the U.S securities and Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative\nInvestigating shares of common stock by tenfold in corporate votes you can reference the investment of suitable only for persons who can afford to lose their entire investment\nFurthermore investors must understand that such investment could be a liquid for indefinite period of time to a public park uh currently exists for the security is if a public market develops following the offering it may not continue\nTo send a copy of the ... circuit which contains information about high times holding court the offering and other related topics including the risks of the investment please there's a high times invested dot com that high times investor dot com I immediately or investors in hard times holding court but are not associated with is offering media and its affiliates and not responsible for the information contained his message the information include the times better dot com or the information\nFiled the securities and Exchange Commission\nThis day and re with another Ronald there'll be success story\nMy name is Eric about eleven years ago as strong gusts of wind slammed the car door my elbow and that's not a good thing when you're a massage therapist like me I thought\nThe pain go away with ice and he got worse over time pain was so bad I couldn't even racist golf club inside I Need to change my career I heard about ... from the radio ads and decided to contact Dr\nFracking after my consultation I learned that was a candidate for ... therapy instead of my treatments right away I've had five treatments but to follow ups and now on hands\nFree I can actually raised my golf club the gang ends on back to work at full strength plus ... therapy paying I strongly recommend ...\nThis is Dr ... therapy as an injection procedure that helps generate repair damaged tissue wondering into your pain contact me at Boston ... therapy dot com for complimentary fallen consultation that's Boston P R O L O therapy dot\nCom nah I again rail into the kitchen options and no one was the largest kitchen and bathroom re facing company when we we face a kitchen usually includes a laminate granite\nHer boss counter but forty two percent of the thousands of kitchens we if we face didn't need account or are you one of those homeowners that not a new counter on top of those old cabinets would make your kitchen beautiful ... sorry ... who's now\nYour only option keep your counter and Paul kitchen options let us transformed those cabinets\nAnd don't work of our just dial pound to see on your cell phone and say the key word re facing and you'll be instantly connected to our office bitch and knocks re facing saves you a thousands and you'll have a new kitchen in four or five days not four\nOr five weeks has always will be will be easy loses received seem to sign off the entire project when they dialed pounds to fit the key word re facing kitchen options also has an outstanding website my kitchen options dot\nCom [noise] be prepared for your day with the W.

wonder okay how do you become a Boston police commissioner well uh I just learned a that up until the age of twelve is Boston police commissioner wasn't even living in Boston so you came here in a really rough time for this great\nCame here in Nineteen Seventy five and it was a tough nasty\nTime right help from to a health from Hillsborough Maryland eastern shore of Maryland and I was on a farm for twelve years or through the family hardships I came from Hillsborough Maryland to to Boston in Nineteen Seventy five\n... did not have us in the Boston did not have a good reputation\nRacially tumultuous times in a foreign country boy it was like wow what's the issue between black people and white people and you know my mother and the community they explained everything about a federal decision to desegregate the Boston school system which which cause a lot of heartache in the city both racially\nAnd I'm with government versus communities\nWell at that time uh and I remember it very well I was just out of law school I thought the judge made a mistake in not incorporating some of the\nOther more lily white suburbs are in that in that conversation and I know that medical exists but I was recently in Atlanta which of course was the heart of the old south and then the next time you spent in Atlanta but\nUh it was apparent to me at least from what I saw that all in Atlanta as a southern city even today is more racially integrated on a\nOn a on a social level than Boston you're going to restaurants or you know you're going to restaurants to this day in the back bay and you won't see a lot of diversity among the clientele but in Atlanta I don't know if you've had experience or been to some of those southern cities which I think\nUm the amount of officers being killed um yeah that is on the uptick but then there's something that um I'd be remiss if I didn't make you aware of the number one killer a police officers as they die by their own ...\nSuicide I'm aware of is a tough job I'm\nIt's negative a lot of the times and do what you are machismo culture of holding everything in because we surge view um if you hold instincts too much and and you don't address it and that may manifest into dependencies depression and ultimately suicide so\nThank God for the American foundation a suicide prevention in our peer support a unit of BP we've teamed up\nFor in September for suicide prevention months and we let it publicly be known that want force when officers are not robots we have feelings I suffer losses and you may react to them in certain ways but one thing a parent\nShould be able to address those issues what professional help and not be stigmatized when you do\nExactly how it was funny last Thursday night we had representatives of the ... in which is a whistle organization as soon as they are public as a whole\nA and um I had the opportunity serving the board of directors of that group about Fifteen Years in the Nineteen eighties and Nineteen nineties while I was the Taliban's you for that was great great organization they've served about six hundred thousand people over the years and that's another issue I remember as a reporter a commission when we would cover\nUm what we thought might have been a homicide if it was a suicide isn't mentioned\nAnd I think that that contributed to the stigma in my opinion um I can remember one a double suicide as a matter of it wasn't a murder suicide is a double suicide too young women and couldn't put it on TV at the time because that was still sort of the standard and I think that was a mistake and I think that now I'm\nGoing to talk about things more and um it really helps when you have the support\nOf the people in the community I Know marijuana is is a great support of of BP when you have 'em again what's happening across the country when you have a mayor steps that steps forward and say listen I support our first responders are police department\nAnd um\nWe have the ability to police ourselves but I support\nPolice department goes a long way because it's often a thankless job\nI Want to ask you how how was the um I I wrote a story short story this morning to one of the police cameras are in New York City had actually caught on fire or started to smoke and now they had taken the police cameras the body cameras off police in New York for for you know for safety purposes\nHow is the least camera program working in Boston and then I'm going to take a break and go to calls were happy\nTo say that we're looking at January um to introduce our new body camera program and right now we're working\nOn the offices of another mistake and is that\nThe ... the the pilot program when extremely well okay when extremely well one thing was apparently the officers like that for the most part overwhelmingly and the public ... officers feel safe ... excuse me officers feel safer and so that the public but\nOne thing in Boston we need the input from the community um on\nWhat type of policy we want and how these cameras should be rolled out in introduce and as well we have to be fair it is a change of working conditions so we have to deal with the unions as well and rightfully so I'm not change of working condition\nI'm not a police officer but if I was a police officer I think a body camera is helpful because it shows the average person the sort of garbage or the ... police officers have to deal with I'm not talking about the individuals I'm Talking about the way bigger treated\nAll we have some stories for you know yeah well good\nStories and we are batch dirty or would it shows what we go through a definite that's\nExactly the point that I Wish we saw some of those stories on TV because I think and I'm ... suggesting that that just some of the\nThe ... the police officers face and they have to be still work um and I know I Would not\nBe All right I mean some some some of the videos you wouldn't believe it to the side you know like no way no one would talk to a police officer that\nWay I well I my suggestion and again you're the commission as though I'm only a making a suggestion it wouldn't be bad to maybe once a month or release the the the three worst or whatever just to\nGet will look at that just a thought just a thought I remember some of the programs that they had in the past that would show hey what it looks like to be

running for attorney general I'm On the Republican ticket or you know and so they had a commission of bras\nCome they should've grass I saw you at the gold star mothers club on hand off\nOr not the guards that are lined up less them\nYes and you gave a great speech and I'll tell you what it was great senior that struck a commissioner I just want to ask you what your thoughts are on as you know Rachel Rollins is probably going to be the ...\nDistrict attorney for Suffolk County and she's got a whole host the crimes that she said she she where we are off as well refused to prosecute and they just want to get your thoughts on that and what contingency plans ... that the city have a\nChoice J I I think we got the question hang on we got less than a minute left so I Want to try to give them a chair that we just were talking about that off you know you're almost read my mine's don't hang on Jay going\nOK okay quickly um I had the great opportunity to meet miss ... in my office and we talked about the crimes on that list and we talked about her ... what she meant\nAnd our discussion I'm really focused around the first time offenders and diversion programs and that she would be ... to the community but we met and we talked about it and I talked about the community has a right\nTo have a sense of justice and um of crimes are committed in Boston we will be making the arrest\n... that's a straight in straight into the points yank\nIt is it's just that it got to have somebody to prosecute it on the other ran down I mean that that to me it's it's quality of life crimes that she says she's not going to prosecute and now we're\nWe're gonna we're gonna we J just you know where we're really running out of time and we expect to have on\nThe last well she said I was going to ... that and again like they have to do it first offenders and diversion programs but I'll let her speak to that\n... and ... and we will have Iran hopefully maybe even before the election to get some clarification and Jay thank you very much for your call\nThank you Dan Slater good speaking with you I think things are they care\nTo miss it William grows going to have you back a solo flight but I'll tell you got to be a lot of fans out there that's for sure if they do in a great job two and a half months down and break teamwork you betcha you bet you will have the mayor in\n... and the men and women at the Boston police department and my brothers and sisters in Massachusetts major city chiefs\nI Hope I'm Out the mayor was listening tonight [laughter] I think he will feel really good about his ... thanks very much for banks and\nCommissioner William bras and he know folks who left their numbers you'll get a call back on certain tomorrow we're coming back right after the ten o'clock news or don't have to talk about that Honduran capital K coming up caravan coming up from the south\nRink central the global leader in cloud communication and collaboration solutions for your business for free trial visit brings central dot com rings central communicate collaborate and connect\nTo to seeking a different office\nWhile you know in a sports terms the they use that term a red shirt is used when somebody goes to college and spent the first year not playing that sport you know Senator Warner wants to red shirt for two years out of a six year term\nSo she can run for the White House that doesn't help the people at Massachusetts when they need somebody down in Washington working with them for them\nAre really pretty much every single day right now I'm In Washington is clearly in gridlock they need someone who's got a rational voice and I think that's the other differentiation between myself and the senator is that is the tone and tenor of how you serve in office I think\nShe spent a lot of these debates talking about the president and how he uh you know acts in office I pointed at the fact that she's made some pretty derogatory comments towards people serving down there as well calling Republicans I'm you know who are looking to fix health care you know asking for Americans blood money that was that was an actual term she was and there was another time when he actually talked about how she wanted to cut\nA Republican bodies open I think it was to\nSee if they had a heart or something like that it just but again these are kind of things that you know some sort of sounds silly but they're not and they they lead to some negative feelings out there in the public and in fact when she called for the elimination of ice or the immigration and Customs Enforcement agency\nYou know what ended up happening was somebody from Cambridge is a supporter of hers put a five hundred dollar bounty to for somebody to shoot at an ice officer people take\nThe words of US Senators pretty seriously and I think when Sarah Warn make statements like the fact that the criminal justice system is racist front to back it really since the negative message that divide just had his ... at a country and so now you just had a I Will be crushed on the commission for the Boston police\nReally a great guy Greg police commissioner of great appointment by mayor Walsh\nI I think one of one of the ... and under mayor Walsh and when they go ice within the first week at a community center where there was an incident where officer upstairs or being attacked in a community center\nFront desk wouldn't let other officers and they try to come to the assistance of that officer and it could have escalated into a real community problem with a chief a commissioner gosh I I Believe I met with them and let the or\nA community center now that that was not the right way to act with police officers and [noise] um\nI think that's a good step that's the kind of thing that happens when people can\nBring people together and let them know maybe what they've done things aren't but not do it in a public way to change people and again I think senator one tries to say things that are provocative so she could raise wrong profile I don't think people want to senator that does that I think they want someone who's going to focus on that that needs that we have right now and and where\nWashington can help us and um and I think that's I think that's needed more than ever\nTo have what is the response been you out a debate obviously on friday night here in Boston you to debate last night you have one more debate coming up when is scheduled for\nOctober thirtieth it's going to be believed channel five ah WCBS and its final debate of probably in the studio a so it'll be you know why and it's like last night had an audience but um again a chance to have another\nOr where we highlight I think where we differ and those issues\nAre that's a week from tomorrow night if ... if if I'm doing the math correctly and my head today's the twenty second the twenty ninth to be next Monday a and that would be the thirtieth of which is a Tuesday night what's been the response so far to the first two debates I'm frankly undo welcomed or by the amount of coverage\nThat the globe specifically and to some extent the Herald has failed to get to these two debates\n[laughter] well you know I Will say that when the oil doesn't cover it uh I actually am happy about that and I only say that because they tend to lean a little bit further left that maybe the papers but at that and if they didn't feel like there was a great reason to celebrate you know those two debates and I don't think that was\nBut I think that we did pretty well I was very happy with how I think everything came out\nAnd you know what I normally and I was I was wrong in this because normally what the global do following a debate of that magnitude\nIs a day or maybe a day or so later and I thought maybe certainly Sunday at the latest\nUh they would have had several a quick critique send my I've got a pretty good memory of other\nCampaigns around a Massachusetts overtime big campaigns and you don't get much bigger than the U.S Senate and they would I expected the globe would have had five or six different columnists a critique the debate and of course it would have been overwhelmingly\nFive to one or six to nothing that that Warren had won the debate\nAnd the fact that none\nNo critiques of that debate in the globe appeared that convinced me even more so than just listening to the debate itself that you carry the day has she figure it out we're burn Massachusetts on as it shows that\nI Know that was well it's amazing to not that she doesn't know which uh city right there on the\nCable how to pronounce it there was a British down there called the ... bridge and all of that go ahead\nRight amusing I mean still the indictment was that I was\nBasically involved with an anti Muslim group it could be anything further from the truth it with some friends of mine on the Cape who were putting together a pro police rally\nIn memory of ... and it really for her to turn that into a political attacked on saying it's anti Muslim truly ridiculous on its face of course she won't would try that and she's doubled down but that's sort of our tendency is to say that she's never wrong I mean she even\nTried to say that she never really said law enforcement of the criminal justice system was raised as she's tried to say that she didn't use that attack well she did and it's on record we have a you know we have the AOL\nAnd of course she has she made that comment and it was called net roots convention in Louisiana I call it not roots\nBy the way it is a pilot or and You're welcome to that if if you lied when I Want to do is I Want to get some phone calls because we didn't get a chance the other night\nToo and talk to people who watched the debate as we did hear on friday night and react to it and I'd love to invite people to join the conversation and talk to you and a great and I'm again there are a lot of people who that was the first impression of you\nOr I Know that there are people who are committed\nTo um a tour Elizabeth Warren's a reelection which is understandable um as an incumbent US Senator\nYou're always going to have you know a certain percentage of people who are who are going to vote for the incumbent and I know that there were a certain percentage of people who um uh who are not happy and and I guess that that's what I'd love to hear from folks are either from whatever perspective\nOn it You're welcome six one seven to five or ten thirty triple a nine to nine ten thirty I moved you off quickly the night 'cause I Know you were going to an event over in West rock spread I assume you had a pretty good turnout it that it was over at the ... one of the um uh I'm fine establishment on Washington street in West rocks from actually\nThat's actually going to be tomorrow night tonight I was meeting with um some voicemail agency a representative from mash a mascot so actually tomorrow night will be in the west rock spray then I'm looking forward to change the folks there\nSo you can go on like well we wish your post debate party on on friday night I thought you were heading the west rocks ready for that\nOh friday night yeah I got a I Can't remember that I'm just thinking about last night\nAnd I you know it seems to me was over the ... uh the the ... the ... the curry over in West rushed we maybe I was wrong and that doesn't matter will go to phone calls will take a quick break my guest is Jeff deal he's running for the U.S Senate here in Massachusetts or he understands that um\nThat look the odds are against anyone who runs against an incumbent and particularly when you are a Republican in Massachusetts but if you'd like to\nJoin the conversation and offer a I'm a as a comment of support or if you want to ask a question maybe this is an issue that you're still unclear as to how Jeff deal stands six one seven to five for ten thirty triple eight\nNine to nine ten thirty would get to as many callers as we can I didn't want to keep Jeff\n... all night long but he's more than willing to handle a few calls to jump on board let's get it going six one Seventy five or ten thirty Tripoli nine to

I Would have a minute and he thought it would have a minute and vice versa as we went back and forth on different questions so it was more structured and basically\nYou couldn't respond back after the owners had sixty seconds\nAnd that says you know many pay grades above my um occupation but if you could do like a lightning round of God chose with chess yes or no it was\nA Senator Warren do you believe and the rule of law yes no yes though are we a country of laws do you support sanctuary cities do support you know what I mean just all of these words you know I don't know that we used\nTo serve the full six year term theory elected that'd be nice though\nYeah why ... ... and will you be pure reelected well you go on TALK radio why why haven't been available whatever but I mean I Know they have to be yes or no questions and I think that to just get all these no no no it was what just mail everything will just put everything on a show but real quick\nI don't think he wants to admit to that format way [laughter]\nNo but I mean if he's asking her questions just yes or no question\nThat I shouldn't have it as well the answer would be but that is more complicated than yes or no answer\nTo your service\nGood luck and um I Hope that you're going to Washington for us\nThey go out and I'll say\nStop and shop picking up meat in the house I'm sure it's sometime soon to\nKnow when I was did a series of guessing no questions with Jimmy Carter when he was running for president in Nineteen Seventy six\nI hit him with about seven or eight yes or no and he played the game answered yes in should know and some friends of mine said that made them both for Jimmy Carter because he actually would answer questions yes or no true story well let\nMe I got the debate on the thirtieth maybe they'll throw the yes or no they don't\nThat again that I doubt that she would comply with that format that's my own I don't know Lucy\nAnd then new Lindy around with Jeff deal grenade Linda\nHi Jeff I fly a ... a share and I believe that you are very fair to me like I'm a people person and I think you're going to chop down in Washington I have no doubt he will get it\nAnd I watched that

get top three political a shit what three ... immediately solved for your child\nThat's a great question go ahead Jeff good luck with that that's a good while right\nWhen he wrote that lamp and the the first thing I'm gonna tell you is the big crisis without a doubt the drugs that are coming into our state into our country arriving families of loved ones um it's devastating a family members that are trying to struggle with it well trying to hold down a job right and that's why this\nYear at the station so I think the opioid epidemic um I think the second thing we want to do is continue to make sure that we grow jobs in Massachusetts while we have a booming economy and where we have really low unemployment I've traveled the sections at the state where um some of the some of the town and some of the cities are\nOn in the prosperity that what we're finding some of like Boston for example I Want to try to help spread some of the economic boom around the state by I think making sure we incentivize businesses to to find other portions beyond just buys\nDecides to and yeah and when we\nLook I think making sure that we have the funding for education is critically important I first got into\nPolitics because that was serving on the Finance Committee in the town of women are education uh you know needs weren't being ... by the state and federally we can have a chance to help to it so I Want to make sure our town to get the resources to make sure we have the best educated kids that are lead our future so they were ...\nMirror I think that's pretty good answer thank you very much for your question was going to war I'm a great night Jeff deal will have you back I Know a and again if Elizabeth Warren wants to ... debate you that is an open invitation right here in the\nUh the knight's studio and um I Would look forward to it I don't know I'm listening as we look forward to let's put it like that stay there Geoff what's your best way to get in touch with you to help out your campaign\nShould go to deal for Senate that county I ... for Senate dot com were running a bunch of ads stuff you can help maybe offset the costs that great but we can send you a free bumper sticker freelance science to go to jail for Senate dot com\nA call back it's kinda like musical chairs I've tried to explain it to you so that all of you have a maximum opportunity to call sound like it because in ... and he says call one\nUh we don't track it and we don't see how they can call again that our so that's\nWhat we got to do and um I think if I'm not mistaken looks like the next caller if I'm not mistaken will get it I think I did call it correctly so you that was called the number eleven is already in the line is that correct Rob give me the thumbs up there yet uh and so if you are ringing now caller eleven already has the price to call a twelve sorry try again\nNext time now I'm the big story we told you a week or so ago when we first heard about this a caravan of people coming up from\nHonduras Guatemala or this caravan has gotten bigger as time has gone on a there are now I've seen estimates of as many as\nSeven thousand people seven thousand people heading north or in the Caribbean or these folks from tough part of the world yeah um there's a lot of poverty there's a lot of corruption in Central America\nAnd um people are trying to escape it perfectly understandable instinct\nIs no doubt in my mind that if I Lived in Honduras Guatemala a and in some of those other countries I Would be heading north or if I had the ability\nTo physically actually make that trip now there's lots of questions about the group that's heading north at this point I'm One of them certainly is a how was this organized or was it paid for by somebody how are people getting a out of\nCentral America it's it's a it's a track of at least a thousand miles maybe more now this happened last spring if you recall and last spring there was some interesting statistics that I heard but it's an eye on the CBS Evening news\nThey were apparently an estimate of fifty now do people who came north and again I think some from Guatemala some from Honduras some from El Salvador maybe in some picked up along the way from Mexico if you remember there was that big train that was dragging carrying people up no one\nOf those Fifteen hundred people according to CBS News tonight two hundred and fifty applied for asylum\nAnd again the reason for applying for asylum is that your life is threatened it's not good enough to say you'd like to go to a country that has better economic opportunity was the United states obviously does you have to have a a really a threat against you or your family to seek asylum\nOf the two hundred and fifty and this was the number that stunned me\nOnly three\nOnly three to this point had been granted asylum now that's a few months into that process I don't know how many have been\nNow ... I don't know how many are still under consideration but of the Fifteen hundred people\nApparently were involved in that first caravan two hundred and fifty chose to apply for asylum and three so far been granted asylum which means that they're a very long odds for anyone\nWho is walking who's on that track right now very long odds to think that they actually might gain access to the country legally or they may be other ways to get in so what I Want to do is I Want to hear from you\nAnd I like to know your reaction to seeing this swath of humanity heading north I think it is a um tremendous testimony obviously to the opportunities that all of us in America are blessed to have by virtue either of our birth or by virtue of the fact that we have\nA secure a legitimate status in this country\nBut the question now is what does President Trump and what does the administration do as this large group if this group is these seven or eight thousand that I've seen\nA the estimate of seven or eight thousand that is a multiple of what four or five\nOf the group that came in the spring\nSo it's an overwhelming number of people border patrol agents are dealing every day with people coming across our border illegally\nAnd there were some I guess who come across legally at a point of entry and request asylum so want to hear from you what would you do um it seems to me that the choices are pretty stark\nAnd that President Trump\nOr has the obligation as the president of the United states to maintain the integrity of our border because if we don't maintain the integrity of our border\nThan the country the integrity of the country has gone we are the United states of America forty eight contiguous states Alaska Hawaii some territory's around the world and that's it\nAh now my understanding is that there's laws in Mexico and and elsewhere that said that if you are seeking asylum you have to present yourself in the next country the most the most contiguous country obviously if you're seeking asylum\nAnd you have to go through a country which is as dangerous as your ... as your home country or they might be an exception made there but what would you do and what should we do as a society I Would like to hear every point of view six one Seventy five or ten thirty Tripoli nine to nine ten thirty I think it's pretty simple\nI think that if there are people who are going to come here and assert asylum claims let them understand what an asylum claim is\nMy belief is that a lot of these people have been misled and that they had been told that there is that so called pot of gold at the end of the rainbow well when you consider\nWhat percentage of that first wave that first caravan what percentage of that first caravan had been given granted asylum three out of the approximate Fifteen hundred who made the trek north\nWhat's going on why is it happening now and who does it benefit I personally think the benefit I think it benefits the Republicans are but I could be wrong on that maybe you can tell me why you disagree six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty those are the numbers [noise]\nLove to hear from you what if you had the president's ... what would you tell him to do\nAs this crisis grows closer to the border it is I Would argue the equivalent of an invasion not an armed invasion but it invasion nonetheless coming back on nights I let's get it going [noise]\nLakeside with Dan re some news watch never stops W.
