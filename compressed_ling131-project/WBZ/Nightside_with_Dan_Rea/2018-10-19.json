thought were pretty much gone up again have as much to deal with people like ... I think that that's actually a number because it got fairly high number ... ...

I Want to address it both points because I look I don't know how many folks like Jessica in this country Jessica said that you know she got the flu but she's done pretty well she said that her children\nHad not um had survived very nicely is is I think where she was trying to say this but so I don't know how many people firmly believe like Jessica in this country what do you think it's two million three million I don't how many people\nI I don't think it's a huge number of I Know that there are I Know that in California there are a lot of their income planes have been court cases\nAround the weather and don't let let's pick it up but let's let's say it's three million people who okay ... avoid it and believe like just a good does passionately the vaccination actually causes more harm than good okay than than than prevent causes\nCauses more harm than than prevents but that's what they bright will we know that we have a ... million illegals in the country and as a study out of MIT that now is protecting\nThe figured it'd be more like twenty to twenty two million\nSo if you have three million Americans who were following Jessica's point of view and you combine another twenty two million coming into the country and we have no idea what their medical records are who they are where they come from and all of that\nI think that those are two big pretty big problems and wondering well with all the headache or than the last ...\nI was thinking more in terms of of children rather than the adults will the adult is harder problem because how do you find them but for children if they're enrolled in school they can be vaccinated like you said when they register\nFor so I'm with you know that it led to limit it probably would do that but I'm saying if if you have adults coming into the country\nAnd many of these adults or if you look at this Honduran caravan of the young men if they now or twenty or twenty five or twenty six years old I have never been vaccinated coming in mixing with al ... and that's going to have a big impact as well\nHey Don ... him up on my breaks I got to let you go but we're going to continue this conversation right into the next hour I promise and appreciate your calling your point of view\nGreat thank you couldn't have\nYou done we come back right after another dawn do enough and the nine o'clock news right here W.

for Fifteen Years in the Nineteen eighties into the Nineteen nineties and they provide a tremendous service will explain it for anyone who feels\nDejected despondent a ... ... even worse and that's that's the name ... we'll talk about all they have done for so many people were going to get everybody in here it was on the line in more barely in Quincy Billy you an extra nights I'd\nGo right ahead I had known that I'm doing great bill\nWhat's on your mind yeah the ring central nights I caught a line and should remind you you go right ahead\nYou know the okay yeah I like that just a two things to talk about for ... and Jessica are about the the vaccination is in the schools that gesture sharing of mine's me she may not be portrayed last May of a Christian Scientist that I remember\nI remember ... years ago that goes back in the six days there was a woman down the Cape you may recall okay is she had a five year old daughter or scarlet fever and she refused to take her daughter to the hospital and da da da di she works for a rare\nThere had been there had been I don't recall that case specifically but they have that she has to have been cases are and um it's it's a those are very difficult cases particularly people who\nWere involved in an organized religion and based on religious belief I don't think Jessica was base\nYeah every now and all that but as the temple ever sold right you'd show but I think much more a ... a set of now who believes that she had down to overturn so what's your other point\nYeah she did about Twenty years is water bucket anyway she she like a ... or whatever but uh as far as the vaccinations are schools I remember that I Want to uh I went to school or whatever and we actually had the dog and the nurse\nThat came with the school and then the vaccinations\nFor a ... a woman Jessica we're dry but then you probably saw that one because there are people there are people that can ...\nSay they may well let me just going to do it and and and all the kids got Don um and we had says or does it check on the culture of the spine we have ...\nWe had all that Baghdad and what were your wife do was smallpox smallpox that was a federal mandate that all\nChildren going into grammar school that they have smallpox vaccination\nAt ... I remember it well and they still do now and they still do but unfortunately I think there was some school systems that don't have the rule as well as they should really I got full lines are going to run again yeah they do\nOn Iran because remember they they they stopped doing the smallpox would they brought her back okay then\nI think there was a point I wanted smallpox was eliminated and I think now is beyond comeback polio I speak with her for all intents and purposes eliminate ... seems not to be making a comeback appreciate your call very much but we'll talk soon OK\nOkay our thanks to outline let me get to um\nRobert is on in California and Robert you were an extra ... cents I welcome the night side you're on the brink central nights I caught a line go ahead Robert\nHey Dan I wasn't going to call it it's a little while but and you get brought about what works night\nSo it's been an interesting night tonight Robert\nTo put a blood pressure cuff on while these calls are coming in and and and charge your blood pressures that come through I'd like to see the scientific data I'm Still alive my address your other callers yours [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing I mean first of all let me start by saying I get a flu shot every year all my children are vaccinated I fully support vaccinations that being said I'm going to throw a little fuel on the fire\nHere [laughter] it's just when they have\nTo go out here in California a religious religious reasons are no longer accepted port I'm not even I see your children to get them into school you have to have a medical reason\nWhy there's only like an interesting I Would think yeah when you ... being the progressive state that it has become it has become that they would have been gone they would have gone totally in the opposite direction\nWhere I just said well that you would think so by being all the atheists they have out here I could understand that direction they did go so but here's the kicker you can get a medical waiver\nAnd there's currently at all you need to doctors and the state of California now my grandson is it's turned four years old and he's getting ready for school and we wind up to private schools and my daughter is an anti ... flat earth or\nExtreme relied on her daughter yeah good for your daughter\nIs a kicker is my daughter is one of the most intelligent people you'll ever meet but you cannot move up these two topics\nLook I and I think that some of the calls we've had tonight to people I I Do I Do recall Jessica but she's very intelligent I just felt that she was yelling at me and trying to persuade me I just looking to have a conversation that's all\nSo here's the kicker this is what blew me away I went my daughter asked me she wanted to get this doctor down

possible\nWhen we go next to a rich is in Carlisle and you know Rob here we go let me I'm bringing up Richard Carlin for me would you please Rob\nHello Richard Grillo your next door nights I Know are you\nVery good thanks so much for taking the call Dan a terrible thing I mean the reality is is the way that\nUh these vaccines are supposed to work for our society is that they provide herd immunity that everybody in the herd is protected\nThan not want to get sick if Ninety nine out of a hundred people in the herd are protected than that one won't get sick but if five of them are unprotected or ten of them are unprotected they're kind of start getting sick and that's what's happening here\nSo I think why do you think there was so many people who are so passionately oppose because it's\nYour children and ... I mean I have children that you're you you have fear fear is the ultimate motivator so a mom wants to protect her childhood she thinks it sticking a needle in her arm hurts and if she thinks it's taking that needle\nWith some fluids and it is going to hurt our child she's going to think twice about that and she has that right\nBut your ritual questions where do we bring them into the public schools to ... to allow the societal institutions to enforce the rule of law\nAnd and the answer is yes then if if you don't want to comply to the to our society than than you need to choose a different place to educate your chosen not our tax dollars and that sort of thing and you know similarly with the anyone who comes into the community who we don't know who they are\nLet's let's let's give them the immunity that we give all the rest of the people who who we want to protect and yes there are\nContrary opinion yes there is research it yes there are opinions in the world today but there are certain elements of our society that we have all chosen to live on her and then one of them is to ah to protect the greater good greater cause of of all uh and and this is one of those though\nAnd I ... agree with you that but I'm concerned about the influx of folks coming here we've got four thousand folks heading to the border\nAnd those kids are there's a lot of people who tell me that they have kids now in ... public schools and into Lawrence public schools they're not being put in West in public schools or or or in you know where in public schools the going into the\nUh the public schools that probably are already overcrowded and I I just think it's a petri dish for problem simple as that\nRich appreciate your call very much thank you so much\nOf a goodnight Texas let's keep rolling here ... you're going to drop ritual me Rob please thank you very much let's go next to Diane in midway hey Diaa next on nights I go right ahead\nHi Dan how are you doing I'm\nDoing great diet and get a little tight on time but want to get you in at least two more and so you go right ahead\nOkay great well I really enjoy your show this is my first call in on that\nHearing night what is taking so long [noise]\nIce that may sound a little nervous but um you know and having a show I just want you to know that I and generally pro vaccines um but as we get older and a little older now and have more of our own experiences\nSome less it becomes easier to to be sympathetic with others experiences as well and I can tell you that with the flu shots I had tried to take the flu shot and and each time I take it for ... extremely extremely ill it's not ... the\nViral particles with in the flu shot that I had a problem with it except instead or in a way the flu shot and I get an awful awful a response to the flu shot so I Know I don't have\nDo you have to ask you is with that experience do you continue to take the flu shots or have you stopped\nI Can't I I cannot an eye out for a day and a half a silly out very well\nHow many years have you have you gone without the flu shot if I could ask\nAnd I've gone about five years about five years out the flu shot and\nHow you done in terms of preventing the flu without the flu shot\nSo far I hadn't I mean I ... and I flew I mean not to say that I ... I ... into the date that I Will ask you a check but I didn't like him and not not gotten all\nHave maybe have some immunity built built up from ... press pass at oh good that's great so you have your your change through experience\nIf they're experiencing here's here's my cake and you know there is no scientific data back out and I and I feel there is actual good good studies performed is to evaluate the except in the including metal heavy metal other ingredients that are still there and to understand what the potential negative aspects\nOf the ... of those other ... I think people will still continue to be a post that take\nLet me this is why and I this is an area that I'm this on this question why are they putting medals or whatever you you you you're using a phrase that I'm unfamiliar with along with the with the flu shot what what is the purpose\nBecause because it has helped it actually helps keep the virus on on the viral particles in this country that they want and healthy and basically they do studies to tell how long ... article can last\nOn the shelf and those other fit the ants either a help keep them on for that they are viable or to our fillers that yeah that that has some history that have shown that they are that they are okay for most people are and perhaps not for maybe five to Fifteen Percent of the population\nGrew into a very

and feeling lonely or Steve ... he's the executive director Lauren ... is director of\nCommunity education and outreach Emily Britain manager brief supporting Jonathan Goldman a volunteer coordinator so John let me ask you is I'm sure there's some people out there sitting tonight saying you know I might like to\nI'm a volunteer some time what sort of a commitment is necessary for someone maybe who lives in downtown Boston your office you told me as a west street right by the Boston Common or for someone who might live twenty or twenty five miles out of town what ... what's the commitment that's necessary\n[noise] absolutely we are most for volunteers volunteer roughly four to eight hours per week\nAnd we do ask for a minimum of eight nine months commitment or however some people are in town for a shorter period of time so we have accelerated shifting where they shift a little bit more per week and they don't and and ah they will shift for a less than nine months but typically it's at a minimum of nine months ...\nMuch training does it take for someone of you know relatively normal intelligence and who's motivations are a few or a who are looking to come in and and really try to help people and I assume not every volunteer is accepted\nThere is absolutely a screening process for sure and uh people uh uh go through and information session be interviewed references\nUm and uh there is a uh\nUh the training is very expensive to answer the first part of your question uh it's about thirty thirty five hours of training a and we really want to make sure our volunteers are protected volunteers or as comfortable as they can be to be ready to pick up that first phone call to be ready to answer that first text message so it's about thirty thirty thirty five hours of training\nSo so you mentioned Steve mentioned text messages I hadn't even thought of that I mean I've always thought of the ... and his hotline and all of that\nUm and obviously young people particularly now are probably more comfortable texting than talking does that make the job of the summer and it's easier or more difficult\nIt well for us we think it makes it easier from the vantage point of we have increased the access to help line and we wanted to meet people where they are so few preferred method of communication is texting you can now text us\nAnd then and or um you know came of over three hundred volunteers um some people have a more comfort with texting and some are more comfort on the phone but there are all trained to ... however either a vehicle\nWhen when the semester started it was ... it was a hotline right okay um so\nGive me an idea or between calls and texts I'm assuming those are the two major ways that people communicate us a sense of desperation\nRight in text has been a you know it's I knew a serviceman the fastest growing service so recently with exceeded seven hundred text or in a month's time\nAnd his own a percentage basis are you still is this still Ninety percent phone calls or\nYes so we're doing ten times that on the phone you know between fifty five hundred and Seventy thousand\nCohere so Ninety percent phone calls on ten percent tax other other ways I mean look I I I Know that there's a there's a face time into all all manners of all manner of communication is it just phones and text or\nRight now for the help lines service in support of his opponent techno emails\nUh no we don't do that and you're throwing up okay fair for enough I'm now all of you at some point I Know have staffed these phone calls I'm it must be tremendous pressure when you're sitting here particularly as a as a new a\nPerson on the phone the responsibility you literally potentially have someone's life and your hands explain to people out there who might be thinking about becoming volunteers are not only the challenge of that\nPeople who have had such deaths um I think if you were Dane a recently Noah was characterized as a suicide Twenty years ago it never would have been a suicide is now acknowledged you know in obituaries um\nYou just told me which stunned me Steve Moore suicides every year than homicides in motor vehicle accidents combined\nThat's correct so a ... suicide is more than tripled the homicide rate and um you know people just aren't aware of what we're talking about a hundred thousand suicides of you so I'm well across the country or around forty four thousand ... okay\nAnd that number grows by about a thousand or Fifteen hundred every single year those numbers do not go down let's\nLet's get a couple of phone calls in here uh from from listeners and we will give out not only the telephone number over the email address so you get in touch with the ... if you or someone\nWho's close to you a nice any sort of support Patty in in a new report is going to start us off this hour Patty welcome you were first this hour with us Americans go right ahead\nHey can I Do not I I think it ... years um [noise]

message because as you\nMay remember way back when um you couldn't necessarily see through what you learned later that things can change will change and you can move on and live a fulfilling life so\nThat thank you for sharing your powerful message person's story there\nHow how it could [noise] and for me I knew that I did everything I could show that was quite a while ago I think if there aren't any\nNorth petty proceeds to call very much thank you right now we go to Tim in which in Massachusetts Tim image the night side with well represented in marriages go ahead\n[noise] yeah I had a question I have a wife that's in a shady her age\nAnd she didn't exactly feels like that where she doesn't feel like she belongs to our she messed up their life and stuff like that the problem is is to get her out to stuff like that she doesn't drive so there's some evidence first ever\nGo to the person or are somehow you know get get them from the house of brain where they need the clock people\nThat are primary services through the help lines so would encourage you to share\nOur help line phone number with her and have her a talk with one of the um representatives in in Iraq crisis center and um you know share how she's feeling and share her thoughts and\nUm we'll do the best we can to help her uh feel valued and and and respected where she is\nAnd it's an honoring feelings\nSays a relative to say Tim\nThis is actually my wife uh she actually has been feeling like this for quite a while now where she feels like a\n... there's nobody out there that she can trust or that'll help or or anything and she just feels like why am I here on this earth you know and it's like I could talk church alum who outta my face you know and try to take care of her but it just seems like\nShe just keeps getting more and more depressed and now she's sleeping all the time\nThat she had any um in professional help for his own under any doctor's care\nWell she had gone to like a psychiatrist and also a case worker but I'm a I mean I I'm not knocking any of the case worker is a psychologist at the white she went to made her condition worst so now she doesn't even trust them and she won't voted them\nOh okay I'm I'm going to ask if anyone in the room wants to offer a suggestion obviously\nI'm not a professional in the room I Would say that uh if you have anybody in your family that she can talk to a religious people who you rely upon I don't know who will be within your social group\nOr that you could incorporate into the conversation I'm\nGoing to suffer a couple of things as I said I I Do think that uh\nEncourage you again to share the help line number with her she may just got the courage to dial the number it could help her and could help your a communication at home and then ah you know beyond that with with your call\nYou know maybe a fly and you could reach out we can talk about\nExploring some other professional support opportunity as well so okay
