calls tonight because they want to get people who come to this a theater the opportunities over these auditory the wax that are auditory a chance to ask questions gentleman when they got to do is they're going to try to\nTighten up your questions ... your answer is just a little bit not going to put a time limit but I'm going to ask you to tighten up a little bit Congress ... you talked about the difficulty of immigration\nAnd finding a bipartisan solution of some sort or we have the caravan from Central America still had ignored this saying seven thousand strong if in the likelihood that President Trump were to call you and ask you what did he do\nWhat advice would you give him on the caravan\nWell first of all it's pretty significant that Republicans controlled every arm of government in Washington for two years right now and our president does not know what to do he doesn't know what to do about this caravan because despite having Republicans in control all arms of government they haven't fixed our immigration crisis\nHaven't fixed it and it's a great example of a place where we need Democrats and Republicans to come together because we need to secure borders as a country\nWe should all be supportive of sick of secure borders were also a nation of immigrants or do told his story about being an immigrant or I mean my family they were there were several generations before a or a nation of immigrants immigration is always made a strong\nBut we should be promoting legal immigration we should all be supportive of legal immigration that helps our economy it helps our education system it makes our communities richer\nWe should give opportunities to kids like like the dreamers who were brought here through no fault of their own by their parents and have grown up in our communities are\nAmericans at every regard except for that piece of paper\nAnd Republicans Democrats independents people on all sides agree that we got to give them a chance we got to give them a chance so there was a Senate passed comprehensive immigration bill a few years ago they did some of these things actually strengthen our borders\nIt put undocumented workers on our tax roles so that they are paying the taxes that all the rest of us are paying that actually help reduce the deficit or would have helped reduce the deficit if it were passed\nAnd it gave a pathway to citizenship to folks like our dream is that's the kind of comprehensive immigration reform that we need and I saw this when I went down to the border recently\nWith some of the candidates that I've been supporting we spent not just we didn't go for a press conference and a five hour as we spent two days on both sides of the border we met with customs and border officials with ice officials they all said the system is broken\nWe met with asylum seekers and refugees and we spent some time and war is war as Mexico at a house for deported veterans thing about that\nDeported veterans that's a term that shouldn't even exist I met with a a ten year veteran the United States Navy he'd started on several destroyers working in the depths of the ship and the engine room proud history of service to this country his parents were legal immigrants his\nSons and daughters are all Americans he doesn't have any family in Mexico anymore because he was brought to this country as a young child but just because he didn't get the paperwork done when he was in the navy to form allies his citizenship\nHe got deported after after getting a DUI now do you ... a bad thing but I've had colleagues in Congress who have the wise right\nAnd those are the good ones and [laughter]\nLook great is broken\nAnd we need by far the great over there but what if Donald Trump said sap you still have been told me what should I Do with the terrorists and they're getting closer every day what should they should and southern thoughts so if they come to our border they should be processed like other immigrants who come to our border and that means that if there are people who are legitimately seeking asylum\nWhich is allowed by international law because there aren't coming here to take our jobs are fleeing for their lives from the gang violence in their home countries than we should allow them to come let me say Mr Snyder criminals we should prevent them from coming but that's exactly what we need to do let's say Mr Snyder agrees [noise] this is\nWhat Donald Trump\nHeard you're running for Congress and he said I got a call that guy's West Point Harvard Business school what and he's ... he's came here is an immigrant what should I Do if I'm Donald Trump about the care of it\nI I just wanted to make a comment does have\nCongressman however the reality is that the Democrats had control of both houses of Congress\nEnded up presidency under President Obama and they did absolutely zero about immigration issue that they claim they care a lot about 'em so it's it's it's not a Republican problem it's a Washington problem because they do not want to address the immigration issue\nAnd a ... a lot of reasons for it but you know the Democratic party\nSupports the concept of sanctuary cities which to me it seems that what the Democrats are arguing for is that the legal system in America the laws that they passed it says the market's going to a restaurant a buffet I'll take this law like this one this one I don't like\nThere is a way in America in in our system that if you do have I cover or\nYou'll elect people you change the law you don't decide which laws we decide to follow in which laws you don't decide to follow and put the weight of your political party behind it but that's what the Democrats are doing it ... there's been an issue that they've been attempts to reach a bipartisan solution but we haven't\nOne because the Democratic position is to resist no matter what the Republicans split on the table\nThat Democrats will resist the only thing that it will agree upon and maybe we'll talk about later is when it comes to spending your money on that they can find common ground but when it comes to any other issue especially social issues there is this and I do not you know I've been to California recently and you dry and cities of\nA a migrants just living there you feel like when I travel the world is like a third world country is that what we want to turn America enter\nOr Mr sided with all their respective on President Trump I asked for some help with the terror then you have to give it to be whether they should do\nI I Would definitely stop the uh this unfettered migration that is coming in America and technical means to do it through to create physical barriers to do that I think this idea of the wall you know has gotten this political\nA moniker and and and and symbolism because there's no way that you know\nStates that are higher ... have any democratic and that's because the Democrats were not the table I Will be at the table representing our interests are in Washington and I'll be at the table with the Democrats are on power or there'll be public entirely ... as a Republican that is independent voice so I'm not a Ninety nine point\nNine percent like a set most of the boats Ninety nine point nine percent with a Democratic majority are kind of almost every issue\nSo limited this first of all but you might want to respond to that cause the invoke your name if you if that\nYeah I mean that's just not not to actually the most bipartisan records of any a member of the delegation I work a across the aisle as much as I possibly can and I'm very proud of that and I'm proud of that and one thing Democrats have done though with housing is we have stood up against the Republican cuts to housing assistance because you're right\nA lot of people are not able to realize the American dream of owning their own home or of being able to just pay rent a today on places like the north shore\nAnd another thing that we have worked on a lot of my office is improving transportation access on the north shore so that even if you have a job someplace like on the ... or you can live here and you can commute back and forth because a lot of people for right now for example if you live inland where housing is less expensive it's just hard to get too\nSo you would have an opportunity to work in Beverly and live inland even if you didn't have a car if we had faster and more reliable train service if you lived in linen want it to work in the south Boston teased a seaport you really can't commute there today but if we\nPursue regional rail we build the north south rail link you can get there so there are different approaches to housing the direct approach through housing assistance is something that I and other Democrats have been proud to support against Republican cuts but there are other solutions like improving our transportation system that will help as well\nWant to get in a couple of more questions I\nCan just make one comment as long as I I think quickly showing them open is misleading you oh you have to do is Google CSPAN sets them voting record and you will see Ninety nine point nine percent voting with the Democratic majority there's a thousand bills in Congress adopt a hundred bills in Congress\nA thousand of them are by unanimous consent you can always add drew named ... bill and call yourself bipartisan by the votes that count the boat about money the boats about your taxes he votes a hundred percent of the time with the Democrats are advancing below sea and with a Democratic majority in\nCongress mold [laughter] I mean it's it's just ah it's just not true if I'm there for her to thirty five members of the house representatives\nAt last check I was the thirty fourth most bipartisan number in the entire house I'm proud of that records are not going to give it up [noise]\nWay this since\nI'm Mr Snyder um invoked her name twice and\nTalked about Nancy Pelosi you're going to support Nancy Pelosi if she dug becomes a the leader of the majority party again on November ...\nI I Am not and I've been very public about that I have respect for a service I mean she's the first woman to become speaker of the house when he sees had truly historic a political achievements in her career but I think it's time for a new generation of leadership in the Democratic party on hiring it's time\nFor another question\nHere\nGuy coming down on the ... got a bank quickly on the job and you're not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi now it's not quite sure you don't have a difference\nBetween me and said I Want to change the system I work with term limits set and wants to put younger leaders to stare at the same ... soup and expect different result just because I have a young younger Laos is stirring it\nThat's not going to change anything in the same amount of money and he's the second largest fundraiser for the Democrats in Congress and he got elected the first time around because dark money\nUh Citizens United money that we don't know where it came from about half a million dollars came in to sponsor of his campaign so\nDid you hear about all this going to take sides but he unseated an incumbent Democrat [noise]\n\nYes votes for special interests that says you can be looking at my\nRepublican you did I didn't realize it and they\nGave him a million dollars you can talk about bipartisanship\nBuddy votes a hundred percent of the time for special interests not fund them [noise]\n\nUh it was a Democrat\nBut as a as a senior or Eighteen year incumbent that I defeated in a in twenty fourteen burn to get here and ... and by saying that we need to be my more more bipartisan that he was too partisan\nBut you know the criteria I used to support the amazing veterans who are running across the country is is not their age many of them are young um but it's their leadership it's people who are principled leaders that's what I've been looking for\nBut I Will say to the point of of of young people you know when you look at the United States Congress it doesn't look like\nThe students in this audience there are a lot of young people in America who don't have representatives in Congress because we don't have any younger members and so one of my favorite things to do as a as a representative of this district is to go and speak to high school students and I and every talk by saying\nIf I'm Still here when you're old enough to run against me you should\nBecause we need a new generation of leaders in our politics and we need to make sure that young people have a voice in our politics\nAs well [noise] we're going to try one more question because we have for us as little time\nEver going to go to Atlanta got to be very ... very ...\nSandy from swamp sketch of what\nToday hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on politics what's your view on campaign finance reform stop the astronomical amount of money that's being put into campaigns\nAre ... campaign finance reform some people called an incumbent protection acts you heard that France or what do you accept\nMy I'm a huge champion campaign finance reform ah I think it's incredibly important that we get money out of politics yeah we have this system now that forces us to spend a lot of time fundraising\nAnd it's not a good use my time it doesn't help me do the job of representing you in this district there's so much work that I Want to do every single day in with the fishermen in Gloucester or with economic development inland\nA with so many good people in this district who deserve public servants who don't have to worry about raising money but sadly that is a system that we have a right now uh one of the things that the Democratic party has promised to bring to a vote\nIf we take over the house of representatives is a package of bills on Government Reform and campaign finance reform I Will be supporting that package we've got to get money out of politics decide\nThat let me get you on that same question is was paying\n... oh you have a campaign finance reform are you going to tell us who's ... who\nHas the money that's backing you are you going to tell us why you got ... all over the country campaigning for this for people that the same pack the same dark money back\nThat ... you ... that that is behind you a million dollars that race from special interests\nYou can pay for their endorse candidates so dark money is the bane of ... you know Citizens United and dark money's the bane about problems in money in politics and your knee deep deep over your head and dark money you campaign\nFor people supported by dark money your campaign is financed by dark money\nSome and I was assigned there\nBut we have less than a minute left I'd like to give you\n... an opportunity to have Fifteen seconds and I mean ... second answer how could people get in touch with your campaign to like help here\nIt's a joke Schneider for Congress dot com\nAnd I was I challenged the Congress and went to another debate that all the other candidates the governor or senator war and a half three debates\nSet and all that has refused any other debates this is the only okay you're not accept that they've been other attempts to debate\nWell let me right in with very glad he was seen by as politically there it was decided [noise]\nHow in touch with your attempt to their offices\nSo says WWW Seth Moulton dot com but if you do one thing Google women rising\nGoogle women rising it's an amazing video about the new leaders in Congress Google that watch that video see what new leadership can do for this country\nThank thank you both [noise]\n[noise] I think there's a clear distinction where we'll\nBack the clock those are the very spirited debate on transgender rights question three on the ballot here in Massachusetts\nThank you very much it's a sign of cars in molten [noise] another call\nFrom Ninety nine dollars a month to\nDue to loan roofing not gum now it'd be a great time to clean out your garage and donate that old car to cars for kids how easy it is called today one eight seven seven cars for kids are on line of cars for kids dot com\nAnd the annual ... board members owners and managers is this Saturday from nine to two thirty at the Burlington Marriott visit came died or vi any ...\nThe the yes position I'm here would be to overturn the law which is going to be a little confused tears when the physicians is to keep the law\nThank you very much I'm confused their position is overturned a lot so supporting the yes position a is Andrew\nUh the opposite because ups are supporting the yes position Paul Tucker they should have read this stuff a little more closely apologize Paul Tucker are served thirty two years in the Salem police department and he retired at Salem police chief\nAnd now he is state representative Paul Tucker from Salem, Massachusetts uh his spouse\nTall\nAnd can or the parents have three children and two grandchildren or he is a a graduate of the Massachusetts school of law and he's also he has a master's degree from Anna Maria College and\nHis undergraduate degree is from Salem State University a an easy board member or both the boys and girls clubs grader Salem as well as the Y. M. C. A.\nOn the other side of the issue a\nAh three uh is the president of the Massachusetts family Institute Andrew back with a Andrews described as a devout Christian a graduate of Gordon college not too far up the road from here University of Minnesota law school or he serves as a judge advocate in the United States Marine corps\nAnd holds the rank of major in the U.S Marine Corps reserves he's litigated immigration cases for the Boston office the department of homeland security uh Andrew and his wife Karen and therefore children live nearby\nJust down the road from where we are tonight gentlemen thank you very much um I\nUnderstand a that this is a controversial issue and it can be a little confusing as I just uh explained to the audience um so So Paul\nI I Know that you support the law I Do and you want yes and normally I Would go to you first however since it is Andrew's obligation to criticize the law\nAnd explain to us why he is in favor of eliminating the law rolling it back I like to start with Andrew back with first go ahead Andrew\nWhy should this law be taken off the books\nShort we worked with the coalition volunteers in the summer of two thousand sixteen to collect over fifty thousand signatures of Massachusetts voters\nIn order to repeal this law because we saw on this fall's past that it is over abroad as a vague definition of gender identity and effectively it allows any man at any time\nTo enter any woman's restroom locker room shower a homeless shelter changing facility as long as he claims to identify as a woman and that puts women and children at risk alright I'm\nPaul where I Know we're going to get deeper into the details here but why should this law stay on the books if it is as bad as Andrew his just suggested\nWell let's get right to the high ... first of all this is a law that protects people and it's unfortunate that I think the narrative it's been hijacked\n[noise] I think\nIt's unfortunate that that narrative has been hijacked pigeonholed us into something dealing with specific locker rooms bathrooms and nothing more the fact that matter is that's a very very small piece of much larger protections that are needed that will put in place when we talk about coalitions\nThe coalition that put this bill together and has supported it is bipartisan\nIt includes governor Baker lieutenant governor ... who by the way both have personally donated to the yes on three not campaign funds they personally donated and most importantly\nMost importantly and I say this as a former law enforcement official thirty four years five is chief of Twenty one years I got to I held the position of what's called the chief of detectives\nI'm proud to say that the Massachusetts major city chiefs of which I was an executive board member and the Massachusetts chiefs of police along with thousands of businesses\nSexual assault prevention advocates Jane Doe have come together in a true coalition to call this what it is it's a protection it's needed it says that transgender people matter it backwards\nTo the audience or I'm going to ask you to\nBe expressed that not a problem but again don't take as much time maybe from uh the positions here I'm not suggesting you're not upon and I'm just saying you don't have to apply to every uh every time fall space Andrew ... I don't know if you've got some supporters here are not as well go ahead and are well behaved\nI'm so into our inquiry into thousands Fifteen a Massachusetts commission against nation in my case in point\nA but the ... the commitment she's commission against discrimination in two thousand Fifteen\nAre said to the state legislature that they already have the authority to protect individuals against transgender discrimination in public accommodations because of the interpretation of state laws for sex discrimination which they see as including gender identity\nSo the only area that is different with this law now\nAre the bathrooms in locker rooms and showers because under existing sex discrimination law a there was an exemption for sex separate spaces that is not a multiple sex discrimination to say you have a men's room in a women's room but with this law\nThat says that when a biological man enters a woman's space and the woman objects because it makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe or violate your privacy\nShe can go to jail for objecting for up to a year or be fined upwards of fifty thousand dollars just refuses to let them in and\nTell the laws but in the books for at least again two years ... years okay have there been any prosecutions are that you're aware of uh for what you're expressing concern about\nNone of them aware of yet but as you can imagine one of the\nOne of the challenges we face is that people are terrified to speak out against this law um there was a a small in Milton, Massachusetts where a man I wanted to get a Brazilian bikini wax which is a rather intimate procedure wind surfing his male genitalia and he was very specific with the females foreigners that he's still has\nMale genitalia or despite identifying as a woman\nThe females followers that's far declined to do that service because he was a man and they didn't want to touch this ... uh but because he identified as female\nHe filed a claim with the attorney general's office for discrimination Republican combination and the way this law works he'll win and he'll force those women to touch him in a way they're uncomfortable with or potentially lose their business and Paul Paul Tucker\nWellbeing thank you and I appreciate that and one of the great things about this form is the ability really in front of your audience and the live audience\nTo really but some of these Mitt so let me just take these if I may one of the time\nOf the first is the commission against discrimination having jurisdiction here let me say this as a police official and as an attorney now for some Eighteen years the match commission against discrimination they do right where\nThey were great agency the decisions do not come anywhere close to the force of Mass General lives\nAnd I also say that I had that same question that Andrew raised so I took it one step further I actually wrote a letter to attorney general Mari Haley and she wrote back and let it and I shared with my colleagues exactly saying that that the M ... decisions\nIt's a good agency they do good work they simply don't have the force of law point number two and I've heard this a lot when it comes to the opposition on three\nThat somehow that if you see something say something that you're going to be jailed and go to prison and pay a fifty thousand dollar fine I Would ask people to take a step back and think about that from a common sense perspective\nDoes it make any sense at all that if somebody made a report to the police that they're going to be fine fifty thousand dollars in jail here's the facts the fax says that the underlying civil rights laws of over thirty five years ago contemplate fines\nAnd they do so only if there were multiple complaints multiple violations and multiple educations that these were found to be true over a seven year period\nPeople are entitled to their own opinion they're not entitled to their own fast the fact is that that's a red herring that fine is over a long period of time\nAnd they always let me get a quick response\nSo it's a ten thousand dollars for the first incident and it's up to fifty thousand dollars if there's three instance within seven years civil long period of time is how long you have to do with for instance she could do three instances one week for example\nOr if I'm taking my daughter to some lessons at the Beverly why she's changing the girls locker room and I see a man approaching as a winning outside the hall for and I stopped and prevent him from entering states use mystery of which my daughter's done that's that's potentially ten thousand dollars right there I'd do it you're Monday Wednesday friday that's fifty thousand dollars that's how the world war three solely break\nBefore we break I got to ask you Paul he talks about the um the bikini wax\nI read about that I Want to give you so let let's get back\nOn that day and again so a transgender woman from my understanding went to a spa asked for a manicure no no and her Brazilian ... men and women have fingernails I've got the lands right\nHere yeah it's for Brazilian Brazilian bikini way it is and then you can respond if it's\nThat good and it's my understanding that there was a discussion about a manicure and there was some discussion back and forth let's be clear this law gives no war if somebody does not want to do unless they they're denying it for discriminatory purpose\nI I [noise] I Would say that that sincerely held belief I think is is it's clear Isabel I Would also say and one of the things that may have been launched um over this debate is a crime as a crime it was a crime before the protections put in place it's a crime today\nIt's a crime tomorrow if somebody asserts that generates ... gender identity\nFor an improper purpose and I think part of this is telling\nThat a lot of the opponents argument is that what if scenarios what if this happens which could happen they may refile I'm waiting for the first case where it says somebody used to generate gender identity for less than sincere beliefs\nAnd committed a crime and actually asserted that as a defense I've been looking I haven't found it [noise]\nWhat does that quite frankly we went a little long in the first segment to take a quick break get right back more questions on the audience and brought back in the control room will also take some questions are folks want to call in and six or seven to five or ten thirty Dan re lied nights I talked about\n... college in Beverly, Massachusetts where you're

Rachel is Rachel we have a question like their please feel free\n\nYes first patients getting re for the night side I've listened for about ten years and learn so much like your\nUm my name is Patty and I'm In the town I live we have folks ...\nIn bathrooms its face\nUm [noise] I Would like to say that I have proudly voted no um I guess could someone just to explain to me why this is safe for women and good for the public\nOkay I think that's going to go to Paul Tucker in Seattle so thank you for that and we appreciate that even when it's as Congress molten said earlier sometimes we can have a difference of opinion as long as that opinion is based on fact and I think that's part of the reason why we're having this here tonight\nWe should not have exceptions of who we protect\nWe protect everyone and when we start taking people out of our community these are folks that that use the same hotels and restaurants and health and hospitals and and buses when we start carving out that we're not going to protect a certain group I think society has lost its way\nOur attorney general has put in very specific guidelines of out of hand all these issues how to handle any complaints she's cleared up a lot of this and I think that as a police officer for a long time my very very very first and foremost\nIssue and things I wanted to do is make sure that people were safe when we look at a community the police chiefs of your community no what about anybody else they know the people that live there new and old they know the streets\nWhen uniformly across the board the police chiefs of Massachusetts from small towns to the larger cities or Boston Springfield in West orange support\nThis is to protect everyone whether it's in a restroom a hotel I think it's a it's a sad indictment when it when prior to this Laura transgender person could work eight hours in a restaurant and then get seated at it\nAbel and be refuse service because of their gender identity this law is put in place it's been in place for two years there's been no object at all in any issues whether the bathroom or otherwise and I may add in that um some of your listeners\nMay have seen a front page story in the globe are about a month or so ago by a study out of a UCLA or the Williams Institute\nA non hotter send peer review study that came out and said that they could not find any difference\nIn the in the communities that had protections in place and those that didn't they found no difference I think that speaks volumes this is something that a joke neither side they took a plane and look at the facts\nPeer review it stood out to all the studies and I think that when we look at that that's another region of many that we need is protects\nI'm sure Andrew Becker wants to respond to a variety of the points that just made Andrew shore I I'd suggest everyone has a phone\nGo ahead and Google the name dead the mosque C. M. O. C. C. I. A. W. moss yeah that is one of over a dozen aliases used by a man called\nPaul Paul sharpen no who is a level three registered sex offender he was just arrested at ... college this past week up an angel or for trespassing now he's got a number of convictions for sexual assault and children\nAnd he has a habit of exposing himself in public but because his current alias these using right now is a female identity this law says he gets to go into\nAny woman's bathroom locker room shower changing facility or homeless shelter\nIn the commonwealth and I think that's terrible because it puts women at risk and Paul you not only voted for this law you voted down an amendment that would have prevented level two and three sex offenders from using this law how do you justify that so if I may\nUm the second time you asked about reporting and I know that there's been a lot about ... that that the opponents would say you know we're in danger for reporting we're going to be arrested we're going to be fine\nThat defies common sense first of all when people report crimes and they're trying to help the police the police are going to help them is certainly not gonna take enforcement action\nThe second part of that is that there are no signs in place reporting that\nAnd third I Would just want to add that in the attorney general's guidelines as well that if somebody is uncomfortable in a locker room there are privacy measures that can be taken they're very specific\nThey can be taken by the person's in there that can be put in by by the people that are running it and I think it's very instructive that the retailers association of Massachusetts that represents thousands of businesses from Rockport to province town to Greenfield\nNobody represents small businesses and they do they ... they are a hundred percent in favor saying yes on question three because they know what's the right thing to do if it was something that was going to hurt business says you can't imagine that they'd be all in the way they are\nDead or let me get into real quickly the number of points of poll raised in response to this young ladies\nCluster shore so more ideally the attorney general is on record saying to people who are uncomfortable with this law that they should just hold it so that's the level of engagement in protection she's writing for\nThe woman in a non question but it's a her guidance actually says some of the company of it here if you're worried about potentially improper unlawful conduct you're supposed to approach the person out of the year ... others and ask for example quote are you using the appropriate\nFacility and quote\nThat's pretty much all the guidance there is and again because of this law is built an existing civil rights law out of the term gender identity the laws are in the books to deal with race or religion sex and creed or the way this law works is again if if I as a father stop a man from going into the girls Walker and my daughter's changing\nThe law were treated the same as if I were telling a black man he can't go in 'cause it's a wide spectrum that's where those fines and penalties kick in because it's the exact same paradigm just with a different Patel winters that\nWell if it as sort of laughed about it I guess I'm not even sure where to begin on that one um I I I'll just say leave that sell totally disagree but if I may have actually found 'em to the young ladies question uh we're more regalia set examples of an improper or unlawful conduct may include\nLoitering in a facility for the purpose of observing other patrons that's exactly what you ask that's exactly what's prohibited conduct\nOkay we're going to get one phone call in here before\nAt least was a talk show telephone talk show where Paul who's also from way Lin\nPollen way when you're on nights were not in Studio but we had to go right ahead who is your what's your question and and to whom\nYeah thank you Dan a I'm a physician and a grandfather the\nComment and question Israeli towards representative Tucker um first of all as a physician I can say unequivocally that transgender that has no basis in reality of biology or medicine so this is a social construct\nAnd the society has the prerogative to have a certain rules and regulations surrounding what would it decides as desirable but it also has\nAn obligation to protect the the majority of the people within the society so a classic example is smokers are no longer allowed to smoke in certain confined space so in a sense this is a double standard you've got\nPeople that are very uncomfortable with men\nOr women in their private space is that don't really belong there by biology and you're saying that it's somehow protecting that small one or two percent that that have this ... a gender just for you that makes them feel like they're part of it\nI I really don't have to do that because it sort of hit\nThe ball daily limit ... and we're getting a little time to time here let me get a representative Tucker to respond to Dr Paul\n... dead and um I guess I Would just say a couple of things one is that um when we did make a conscious decision to say that we will not protect whether it's one percent two percent or any ... percent I think we're doing something wrong as far as a social construct says\nI'm I'll leave that I guess to a different take time I I'll just say this I don't agree I'm I'm a police officer among lawmakers I'm an attorney but first and foremost among has been I'm a father and grandfather two beautiful young ladies\nAnd I want them to grow up in a world where everyone is protective even if some ... percent that some people may not like what they're all about I'd say we protect a hundred percent of the people a hundred percent of the time [noise]\nFrom well\nCritics recalls a and I'm I'm not sure that answer the answer to your question but we appreciate your ways of the points thank you very much\nTo get one bite at least one question you'd go right ahead\nHi my name is Jodie and I am the mother and that changed that ten year old daughter country has had an ad\nThat and about a transgender boy as last this model greatly and ... and ... have they fly so on and you might actually how'd you find one of your children and they tell you the chance to ask\nA question I think it's a fair question what was your response but\n[noise] you know I've seen that ad I'm allowed to be clear I think when this law was repealed people will continue to use the facilities to make the most sense for them um\nWhat do we different is that my two daughters for example a who our daughters who have female bodies when they go into a woman space a if a male body comes in they will have their rights\nWill have the right side jobs go ahead [noise] they\nWill have the right to object I'm ... I'm a I'm On this campaign to protect privacy and safety so as I've said before\nThe existing law in Massachusetts prior to swapping past our recovers gender identity I just I guess the question that the woman asked\nI'm Andrew would be if I'm In the event\nThat you had a transgender a child would that change your view\nA towards your position on this law\n[noise] no I wouldn't have one of my sons or daughters and one of my sons or daughters are said to me that they thought they were a daughter or son I Would you know hug them tell them I loved them and reassure them that are family\nBelieves that every child is made in God's image male and female and his name [noise]\nDo it in the end of the ... the time here so I'd like to do is to give each of you an opportunity to to let folks know how they could get with you with your campaign with the efforts are to support your side again Paul Tucker with the yes on three campaign you want folks to vote\nYes I Do on the books as ... yeah that\nYou and if I may add given what's coming out of Washington now where they're trying to find transgender out of existence state laws of the front lines and on the frontlines of the yes on three years WWW dot freedom match dot org\nLet's start to fight here of Washington wants to define transgender out of existence we can stand up we did it for marriage equality we can do it again here in Massachusetts leads the way\n[noise] if folks\nWere either the audience tonight or listening at home we'd like to get involved with your campaign which is no on three trucks with essentially take this piece of legislation and repeal it\nThrough the ballot referendum question how can they get in contact with\nYour website the website is keep em a as a Massachusetts keep em a safe orgy keep them safe dot org\nThat's our website okay I Want to thank both of you\nGentlemen I think\nYou had all these sounds very well the audience was very respectful I Want to thank the audience I Want to remind everybody\nThe ten o'clock news had gone out my colleague memories that Franken will take over the balance of nice side tonight I Will be back tomorrow night at eight o'clock in the studio I Wish I could do this program every night for Endicott College not only because of the beauty of the campus but the cafeteria to\nYou all very much for having us here take\nAt W. these they'd\nBe any will ... vote for board members owners and managers is this Saturday from nine to thirty at the Burlington Marion visit king died or vi any door\nFor kids the easy way to donate your car Yoani today in your car can be picked up tomorrow got a card for kids dot com or call today one eight seven seven cars for kids that are called ruby\nFrom Ninety nine dollars a pound\nAlone ...\nW visa ...

a little bit of a student of history you know exactly what I'm Talking I'd well\nSad that's a that's an amazingly [laughter]\nIt's a ah and I've tried that can\nTry to get many of my friends I'm fairly active in libertarian politics and they look at me there's no borders exist before we use it and that's because there have been a lot of people who come into places and got a lot of really bad things\nYes and if you can't read history and up to see that sometimes it's economic and it's just hey that's a nice country over the west don't take it over is no good reason for it other than power mongering\nMhm that does happen exactly\nAnd but they also raise some interesting points and I and it it's in some of the things that I think you've talked about tool is the immigration system that we have such a complete horror show that even that you try to do it right\nIt's nearly impossible and what are the things that I have seen a couple of my friends are actually ... to\n... one is that a lot of what we have was rooted in the late Nineteen hundreds when they started to do all of them such many of which were driven by prejudices and other ... other very ethical behavior and the suggestion I've had I've heard for a\nFew friends of mine is why don't we just go back to the old days where it later they'll asylum to give you a TB test and if you're on the clean bill of health\nGo ahead and go find a job\nThe other thing that I have heard that I think might be a little more walkable and today such into the situation is come in with\nSome sort of a I D bum passport or a driver's license or something like that they do a criminal and medical background check on your mix or ... best to make sure that we're not letting everybody\nWho shouldn't be in the country in the country has some kind of a provisions for someone who as you suggested there are some legitimate asylum needs and there but there are what you were the most people think\nBut Willie strip it down to\nNot quite like going from Massachusetts to New Hampshire but make the hassle as well as little as possible now I Know from a professional standpoint that might create a little bit of a disadvantage for you but by the same token you will be allowed to concentrate on maybe some of the cases that really would batter more\nInjurious as to what you think about something like that\nWell so Charlie actually um it wouldn't effect because I structured my practice a long time ago when I first started to only take the best of the best you know ... and not just have like you know hundreds of people out the door\nI'm turning burns dial it when we think like oh you're a practice must be affected by trying to like actually no not at all um because I've always been um particular\nIn the cases I'll take 'em so that wouldn't be in in I don't you know I don't care I'll find something else to do a multi talented as ... you know we like when things change like you may be the best that you know buggy whip producer in the entire universe but you know when when we went from\n... cars you have to find something else to do that on that and wanted to and so so you're talking about having skilled type you're basically saying skills immigrating\nNot even necessarily skills but like when my great grandparents came here from a well my mother's side of the family that came from the Armenians who came from turkey and my dad's side came down from Canada\nUm you know they of course they did have to trade and such but most people came here could do something and we were in such a ...\nWell that theory that wherever we want again we're not out it was late\nWe're going to do all the labor can be used for something like\n... and that's the problem with that kind of the Ellis Island it sounds good in theory but we're just not at that level where you know we're not in a growth period\nUm so we want to make sure we have a handle on being able to take care of our issues first and have a solid but yeah like a small level of immigration\nAnd I wanted to go back to the original thing that people say back to you like you know about the quota system and well true that some uh you know specific geographical areas were kept out of America\nTwo wrongs don't make a right to passing the Nineteen sixty five immigration nationality act which\nBasically flooded the country with people from the third world it's the it's it's not this is this is the thing it's never been about race okay this is about the fat and plus you know they always say that that those original quotas we took were were racially based no they were because\nThose were our country's had similar like the you know are we were founded by a European a European Judeo Christian\nUm people's right and so we want to bring people that were like us that's not racist that's normal and so and then when you want to bring people from underdeveloped undeveloped are underdeveloped countries into a highly developed countries like country like ours\nYou're not having people um integrate the way they did like you said when your parents came or my grandparents came and that's the problem and it doesn't have anything to to do with the fact of like this is I'm just full stop anybody who use use that race card it's just like not it's not interested in having a real discussion and\nI actually was because it's somebody that didn't quite wanting to me and I would get a straight answer for you and that's one of the reasons I brought it up\nExcellent Charlie ... will flat out I got to let you go but thank you so much for coming in and have and kill them okay has a good night All right David Michigan I'm going to get back to you after the eleven o'clock hour so we're going to take a quick break and we're going to continue talking
