she's ... she will spend the next two years running for the White House and that's just not putting Massachusetts first\nYou know it's interesting I thought that perhaps um the question that should have been asked to her is whether or not if she did decide to run and we all know she's gonna run 'em if she would step aside as the United states senator while she ran and allowed a governor Baker to appoint a replacement or or if\nOr if she ran you know really full time which he resigned the office or and allow it in the in the event that you were to win next Tuesday that of course is still a

I work on the route Martin I went back to west or worked on the John ... ah towards the end of my ... John ... his term ended and that's what my opponent was elected or that we've never had never had a challenger he walked into the office\nI worked about three years under my opponent I was disgusted by the way he ran the office I saw a lot of favoritism unfair treatment a lot of special treatment for people that sort of ... a connection whether they knew what lawyer or they had a connection I Am sick and may decided to leave the office but shortly after I left\nI was recruited right back into the da's office by another find district attorney who's now a federal judge mark mastery audio and Springfield [noise] for for him for two years again handling murder cases\nRobberies drug cases are some pretty serious crime out in Springfield\nTo get a lot of if you got a lot of prosecutorial experience and you're running a joint do job early who's been in I think in office for at least two terms or longer\nAt three terms you've been in there and he's been at twelve years he's never had an opponent he comes into that\nJohn ... his ... that's not his fault if he doesn't have an opponent does now but he but you know there's\nA certainly doesn't out there and the ... and he's got a real opponent who brings in a real trial experience as compared to him who who came into the office he has virtually no trial experience that's one of the things I bring right over two hundred a jury cases which is a lot including federal court and superior court\nHey let's talk about window world could feel the temperatures where it is Halloween folks tomorrow's November you know what happens in November gets cold around here\nTo stay cold around here for six months frankly until about may first start to warm up as temperatures drop your energy bills will also increase\nI've got a great idea it says here is simple tip it it's a great idea called my friend Eric pie but he and his team and window world Seventy one to two two thirty four forty six look I said the my energy bills every season\nWhere seasons a year for about ten years because I replace some old drafting windows ten years ago for beautiful new energy efficient windows from window world those windows look as good today is the day they were installed I Wish I could bring all of the over my house to show them to you they lock in the winter heat\nAnd they keep things nice and cool during the summer but right now window world is making due to find your home and saving on your energy bills easier than ever you can get a house full of windows that's ten EnergyStar windows\nInstalled in just a day for only thirty nine Seventy nine how does that work out\nLittle is eighty five dollars per month with zero down\nNow you don't have to believe me although I Know you should but the folks at J.

Rockport Salem the Salisbury\nOkay you're running as a as a D. as in ... and I are what\nI'm running as a Republican right um\nAnd this is very important position because we approve the judges that the governor appoints\nMassachusetts we don't elect judges like most states do we elect governors counsellors to represent us in the selection of the judiciary so this is your in the citizens in court to who serves on the bench\nHere's my he's my question right off the bat if I was entering citizens for him with you rich I'm should Massachusetts voters continue the system as it is or should we directly elect judges in your opinion\nNo ... this is the best system in the country are representing its a representative democracy\nAnd the reason that's the best is it allows judicial independence we've got judges in Massachusetts don't have to worry about their mean being in the Boston Globe and then make a decision they don't have to worry that the defense attorneys whether he's going to donate to the ... campaign or not\nUm but then we do get a job like we do get judges as a result like Timothy feely who were there forever even though he's made some horrific decisions\nAnd it it might well make sense to have to bring the judge is back in front of the governor's council every seven to ten years just to go to the record um\nWell they they can also technically be recalled or impeached as well so that's another right and we got\nWe got rid of judge Estes last uh last summer for judicial misconduct\nThat ban one that's one that bit the dusty right on that so so what made you the Kennedy in your district did I assume you're running against an incumbent right\nI'm running against an incumbent Democrat um who's ... who's a realtor and uh there's also a libertarian running but I'm the most experienced person in the race why is that I managed\nA manage patent litigation I Do patents held a inventors ... patents and to make money off of the path of managed patent litigation so Seventeen Eighteen years I Do appeals to the patent system I'm not an attorney\nBut I Do everything you can do with patents without being in an attorney up and an expert witness I've seen some of the best judges in the country and the federal courts dealing with pat and cases and I want to make sure we've cut back quality judge I'm serving in Massachusetts because if\nYou if a citizen as in front of a judge in Massachusetts something's gone terribly wrong\nAnd they're looking to have a very good top quality judge that will listen to them have integrity and rule fairly according to the rule of law\nRead for mental juice again given everybody about four minutes here so tell us how folks up in Essex will kind of as you said the north shore and upper middle sex folks can get in touch with your with your campaign\nSure my website is rich Baker dot US\nWants to have some help ah\nThat's remember now that's a good one rich banker dot US will rich best of luck thanks

Republican independent or whatever you get on the ballot you step into the arena hats off to all of you thank you very much rich\nThank you how about a ... okay we're going to go next to\nA I'm not familiar with this person's name but doesn't it doesn't matter let's go to this ah next call ... is this is Jonathan\n\nJonathan who are you and what are you running for\nMy name is Jonathan rang my candidate for register of dates for ethics County South\nAlright well congratulations Jonathan this your first time running or\nA first time running for state district office of running as a Republican candidate and I'm challenging the incumbent Democrat candidate who's been in office for about forty years [noise]\nForty years that's a long time\nYes and uh one of the reasons that I'm challenging him as because I Want to be politicized the office or he used his office for political promotion not unlike a lot of I think a lot of candidates do but\nA particularly use the resources of his office I'm like the H R department to use the files of ah the address is poised to add to his campaign donors\nWith millions of how how how tough this to get people excited about someone running for register of\nDeeds it is it a lot of people don't know what the office is until you explain it then they know [noise] um the registry of\nTeeth is the uh real estate recording office I'm an ethics Kelly self Massachusetts has about Twenty one registries if dates this is where you're getting paid\nThe mortgage is a this is where it's recorded um so that it's a public document um and to have about thirty four employees of registry of of the right to serve dates for six counties south\nAnd um it's about a um two point eight five million dollar budget that's allocated to it\nAnd it ... and um the registry fees it collects about thirty six billion dollars worth of revenue for the state [noise]\nWhoa that's a lot of money or that that you were there in charge of so you can use the budget for two point eight and you collect thirty six million that's that's a pretty good profit margin from the ... for the registry I I Know I I realize you not the incumbent register I mean that's that's a good return for the state\nAbsolutely absolutely and the money's going you know everywhere and it's up through the job of the register to track where those\nFive no I Know\nYeah they have to manage the registry manage the uh the uh the employees\nAnd it all started and the the job is really important and it's something that we have to get the politics out of as much as we can [noise] um so and

County why not run as a Democrat why not run as a Republican\nYou know again that's a great question I get that all the time I've been a Democrat or bend a Republican I voted for both\nSo as Michael yeah so ... and Michael Bloomberg but you're not as rich you say I'm only kidding going [laughter]\nYou know I I bet it is intended for a number of years I ah take components for both the Democratic party in the Republican Party I'm real just running on common sense\nI'm running on a a treatment over incarceration I take a very a treatment over incarceration for non violent addicts I take it very hard line approach on gun crimes I've been a trial attorney practicing in criminal defense\nFor misdemeanors to murder cases for ten years and it must have been a small business owner actually own a number of businesses and the candidates sector you know I have a\nBetter or ... you got it covered ha ha me while\nI really feel well again the district attorney's waste and it's a combination of managerial experience and I'm happy to have that conversation all day long\nBut one of the defining variable between my opponent as I as I've been practicing as a trial attorney every day day in day out I didn't take any time off to a run this campaign in fact I had to take time off to separate times to manage to try superior court felony matters\nYou know I've been in this industry for a very long time my opponent who is a Democrat took a very left aggressive approach after the primary she actually came out and talked about Fifteen separate allegations in charges that she's no longer going to prosecute under heard ministry\nBut some of you know in in in defense of of ritual Raul in some of those were diversion programs and I think you'd support you you've talked about supporting some diversion programs for um for for small for smaller crimes\nYes sir and actually this is where my opponent and I differ I actually am in favor of expanding diversionary programs which currently stop when an individual becomes an adult and stuff like that I Will be expanding those from Eighteen to twenty five years old\nVersus my opponent who is looking to increase the age of a juvenile from Eighteen to twenty ... you know these are the differences here when we get into the nitty gritty this is rarely where I'm basing my decisions on experience and this is kind of an arbitrary a decision\nTo do than which one of us so called tougher on crime and trying to figure out where you are in relation to your opponent sounds to me like you're pretty similar\nUh well we certainly are both favorite treatment over incarceration but I got to tell you that meeting a I met with the patrolman this union I met with a commissioner cross I'm a a moderate um and I think it's fair to say that I have garnered the support of law and for a law enforcement personnel\n... without any ... any endorsements I Know I'm waiting for the Herald no sir I don't have any indoor things at this point there is no Republican competitor what about ...\nWhat about law enforcement endorsements were were have they gone in this race\nThey actually indoors in individual that didn't make it past the primary so one of a Rachel rolling competitors\nMhm so are they indoor singing the final election or I'm just wondering if you have any police agencies who are endorsing you 'cause there's always going to be a raise that's always very a very important endorsement to to get if you can\nCertainly it they got to tell you are running as an independent it's a it's been an uphill battle automatic underdog a we haven't received the police formal endorsement but they've certainly express their support for us behind the scenes I'm\nReading or to own it received a police union endorsements\nOr she

think if I got to come down a little bit there I Know it's I don't think he I I don't think he meant all white white supremacist but\nHe he's a he's a journalist he should be able to use his words don't you think jak why wouldn't you say that\nOh are you know first of all I I don't I don't really call them on the left I think that's another problem that the right those conflicts liberals and left by the way that's another shirt off\nWhere would you put a majority of the world is a liberal\nEither ... or even worse than that if he's a liberal if he if he's not able this is a guy who supposedly a journalist let me ask you this I Want to ask you a question about a ferret on you you know the comments that shark on his native uh I'm Jewish people over the years he's a virulent anti Semite would you would you agree with that\nYeah in fact he's actually use some of my research and an anti Jewish way when he talked about how many Jews on a stores and press the blacks\nAnd those are the old ... those are the old you know I'm you know blood libel ... are the people who are dealing with all the years but it's come at the other day about a ... the Jews are a ... he's a he's not an anti Semite because usa termites I mean it's uh it it is is\nIt's beyond or anything you want a reputed you don't even want to hear it but the point of the matter is that they did that's virulent anti Semitism and this guy ... lemon here used language that is\nImprecise at best and racist at worst\nOf it is probably going to walk it back I I thought you were going to talk about what the president fire about immigrants affect the mind of this killer a and fled to Jews being blamed for are immigrants and you know groups like higher that help immigrants [noise]\nI I think that for a much more\nDangerous situation I mean evidence that the president and his role model\nOf how I get that but but let me ask you this jak I have to watch what is that of course he does so\nOf course he does and I just said that but my question to you is this jak um are you I'm sure and if you disagree been great that's fine I have a conversation do\nYou distinguish between on people who make withdrawals from banks from ATM machines and people who robbed banks\nTough they both they're taking money out of the bank right right do you distinguish between legal immigrants in illegal immigrants\nYes of course I I think that Trump's comments I and I'm not here to defend Trump I directed against illegal\nImmigrants or people who want to come here illegally I don't think the Trump is making critical comments about immigration his wife is an immigrant his parents in law his mother in law and father in law are\nImmigrants let's be precise with their language is that an unreasonable\nBut I think what you're saying is that these poor people who are being driven away from Guatemala or whatever because of drug drug gang warfare in poverty they say that these people are filled with drug addicts and then dealers and criminal you know that's what he's\nThinking what he said and I ...

Trump with some sort of a global is the guy down in the Florida bomber or what's he I mean\nYou know it it doesn't help it doesn't help and by the way Don Lemon supposed to be a journalist he knows how to use language he knows how to use language\nOkay let's get a going here I went quite long with Gail which is fine and I hope to get will call me back and tell me if she believes that was a racist comment I think it was Keith a New Hampshire Keith welcome starting to some sour your next to Keith go right ahead\nYeah no I'm yeah now I wasn't really offended by by Don thing it's kind of like me I I Know it it can't hear it it it's a and just stay like how you're really offended by that right then and and and and and maybe we should be in a perfect world\nBut like in our country I'm white you know I I I live\nI grew up in a white neighborhood and I went to law school wide I went to church that was all white and then I moved into innocent in Chicago and I lived there for a couple of years and went to all black church and live and and I worked at least for the good guys I ... I left Chicago like am I going to the police of the bad guys and I that's how I that's\nHow I felt that I couldn't believe like this was that America as well as a black person growing up you know ... ...\nOkay I just want to do is want to make sure Keith again okay so you you grew up in the ... in ... whole just stick with Mickey for saying I Want to give you all the time to assure you happen to be black you said\nNo I'm white you're white okay fine okay so now you're white you grow up in New Hampshire\nI grew up in a white world right and and I went to a white churches\nIn New in New ... I'm just curious I I actually grew up on Long Island okay no\nProblem no problem there is it the only reason I say that is that your calling in the six oh three\nOr ... yeah well not only in Ireland okay so you're white guy grow up in Long Island thought the world was fine you went to Chicago went to a black church lived in a black neighborhood a and all of a sudden you saw the world differently from the perspective I assume a black perspective right\nYes yeah and it was more of a learning experience and and and I you know I'd buy buy what they didn't take me and I would buy with a mistake you know what I mean and so so I I guess when I when I you know what I'm seeing it I mean I I'm I'm a privilege and the sense that I learned a lot in my time and then there's the Chicago carrying my black\nBrothers and sisters being honest with me and when you're white in this country you don't have to think about a lot of things but they treated like the way you're saying that that's how they\nOften they treated the history of our country you know of groups and I know you're Black Sea and saw it and then you'll agree and I know you just say let's not right\nAnd unfortunately that's how it's bad and so it is that's just like how you feel offended but that's why I think people ... irritated by this president of United States who is supposed to be a cause of all\nPeople should know I don't think so hold on hold on to keep your coming a lot of ground zero one I Want\nTo just stick with the hair okay yeah yeah uh has there been racism against black people in this country historically\nAfter ... without question without question okay so now do we turn around and do we ah tolerate racist comments from Don Lemon because he happens to be black\nBut I don't think it was almost like he was saying like this kind of funny to think about it right like like the Muslim ban he wanted to ban all Muslims\nAre not trained to him oh well no I don't know what is the\nHe wanted to play he wanted to he said his ... campaign he wanted to ban all Muslims until we figure it out then he backed up it would just do the seven countries that are dominated this or that I understand that but why but what I'm saying is that in itself is racist because\nThere is there anyone who's educated and I think the the knees yeah I think anyone knows that\nThat not all anybody is bad so I mean the fact that he had to say that is like it it it's very when you when you're not a national power right and you look at\nThe power so again what I'm trying to get what they keep trying to um I'm desperately trying to have a conversation with my friends who just bear with me you can't just be with me so because Donald Trump said some things on the campaign trail which you and I might disagree\nWith okay that a little more than just a great great ever you want to ... whenever you want to call it whatever you want to call it okay whatever you want to call it I mean just like we are going back\nBut that ... that how you feel that's how people feel about\n... ... and I'm not depriving you that feeling keyed you can have that feeling\nYou get ill that you can feel the Trump is boring fish you can feel the Trump um is and again ... ... pardon me for saying this but he's kind of a New York guy walking around with a chip on his shoulders that you grew up in Long Island I think you can understand what I'm Talking about earlier okay fine\nSo now we have Don Lemon who's a newscaster right he's a newscaster on CNN and he's going to make a\n... right I as I understand what you're all day yesterday but but when\nHe's on the news castor he hadn't even who only\nThing he was getting you may not look how easily like your sentence by that\nAnd it's like why why don't we even talk about like the white terrorism that's going on which is worse than the other terrorism you know what I mean like we we as a white person we we don't have that and he was trying to get you to go back like why don't we know why\nNot do it on Keith Keith\n... we're long past that part of the conversation I think it has been pointed out by sociologist and sociology professors\nThat there are a lot of individuals in this country or who is engaged in horrific actions okay from across the racial spectrum and there are a lot of we can go back to a guy named Charles with many in\nThe Texas I'm a school tower the University of Texas school power which to the best to my recollection was the first I'm shooting it'd be random shooting people Nineteen sixty six we also go to the guy down in Washington or John Mohammed\n... who terrorized the district of Columbia we can go but what I'm saying is that that doesn't mean that all black people are bad doesn't mean all white people are bad and until all of us get out of this group think mentality which apparently you had at one point and you got yourself out of it good for you\nTo Don Lemon to do may do so I thought\nLet me ask you a question to ask you a question which country if you look at the LBJ that drive you get a picture of like even like I saw recently the current crop of in charge right now everyone's white so there is a bit but it's what people\nAre in power in not in power right and so when you're on power I put a little bit more responsibility and you're trying to understand the other side so you ... ...\n... have still being home by a lot of\nWhite ... let me ask you this is who he became chief teach you treat me like a Long Island and now here so just I mean with me who do you think has more power to keep me who does a talk show out of Boston or Don Lemon who's the CNN anchor\nI think Donald Trump and a lot of the White House to keep that in the deep I asked you a\nReal simple question and guess what you're smart enough to understand that question who has more power me on a radio station in Boston are done limits on CNN nationwide\nNow I Want you to the question is is a good job and I think okay\nWell we're going to just keep thinking that they can for not answering my question thank you for not answering my question because your inability why do you speak because your inability to have a conversation never mind it all go ahead I ...\nIt could be you know ... ... who is in the act upon it so we have a lot of our\nOur ... to eight minutes keep having a great\nNight we it's tough to

I mean you you can see the way they talked about it isn't enough to be treated fairly\nYou need to be made to pay for what your forefathers\nDid I I don't I was Steve ... again I didn't interrupt you I don't I don't hear it that way\nUh I hear in\nHis comments on you know that if you were to if you take those comments and make those ... issue\nThose comments by a white anchor on CNN or Fox or whatever or in and make the same sort of group comment you know you talk about he talked about\nI'm ... and there was a real problem ah in this society I mean we we did have nine eleven we did have things like the Boston bombing\nWe did have things like San Bernardino there was a concern we did it the shoe bomber we'd all of that okay we're all of that now at the time the argument was well the U.S has been yeah money have not has not been even handed in the middle east and we get into the whole question of how we treat the Palestinians et cetera the\nFact of the matter is there was a concern okay I'm now you get into calling it a a a a travel ban uh and and all of that we've been through those arguments and it just seems to me he was like enough in his comments\nTo uh yeah there are some of these I'm a recent terrorist in and go back you go back to um Columbine for example you go back to ah Timothy McVeigh a yeah there had been there\nHad been white and who have been horrific things just as there had been people of all races that have done horrific things and to get into that hole or above white men ... um that in fact we got to ...\nThat's that's racism and I just want to clearly identified and I I'm not interested in going\nWe're likely you're\nRight it but you're you're taking that is it Don Lemon that's the only thing and that's the only guess he's had that have said that if if you I mean you could just YouTube any of the crazy racist things that he has a guest and he had said\nAbout you know white males and the way that the power structure is treated people it is again it is it is it is it goes off the chart\nAir I ... I I don't want to focus Steve to try to do is just what I Try to do is just trying to focus on the one\nIssue now is a lemon says other things going forward I certainly remember this issue okay um I don't like that's all I'm saying so I just want to\nTake this and pointed out it's as simple as that Steve I appreciate your call thanks for going back a buddy talked too soon have a great night we're going to go next to Linda in ... Linda you're next on nice egg rather head\nDown and Hawaii is like I just wanted to make a comment that I thought it was a racist remark he made and what happened and Ken Lay fire\nWell Megan Kelly get fired one for making stupid remarks number one or two months but also a ... a a also her ratings are in the tank I think there were other factors in the in the ... in the Megan Kelly fiery funny thing about begging Kelly won Megan Kelly was\nA a basically crossings wars with Donald Trump she was a complete hero\nUm but again that that that's that status has evaporated very quickly with the rating started to go down a and and when she made\nThat comment um which again anyone\nI Would think with her intelligence and her background would understand that black face a has a um a a meaning in this country are which hopefully we have gotten past but obviously she hadn't didn't quite understand it that way so and I\nThink will happen to the guy for something nothing he's on he's on the news tonight while I think that's well that's all I have\nTo ... we don't get it is I remained chaotic you\nVery much going to go next six one Seventy five or ten thirty Tripoli nine to nine ten thirty to my friend could deal you're down in Maryland I get the most working here will bring good deal you're up high go do you how are you tonight\nIs how are you to an\nUm doing great what's your take on all of this could well\nLet me say this now everybody got my dad and drove up now you know ... you know I don't care who calls you you know no one loves you more than ... daily or I Would hope so [laughter]\nYou know whatever we say we we can't tell them in ourselves to be\n...
