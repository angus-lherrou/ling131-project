know what I Want to get on the state police and the banking eighty Dan I was I never expected that it'd be investigating\nOrganized crime but I was assigned in like Nineteen eighty four to work with the FBI and kind of spin offs from the from the ... the three Andrew Jewell trials um we were doing spin off cases and I was working very closely with you\nAnd those used on wiretaps and and the other of associations and it was at that time ... are coming to\nMy attention or he was already on the ... from a lot of other law for some people in the Cold War scenario but I'm at that time it became even more familiar with them in my role is organized crime investigative\nYou mentioned working with the FBI the FBI wasn't necessarily not everyone in the FBI was necessarily working with them the Massachusetts state police law enforcement a general you you were working with an FBI agency that had some corrupt agents who\nBolger essentially had corrupted or are they allowed themselves to be a corrupt and so it did make your drive an easier\nTime in the early on I mean I wasn't aware of that type of relationship then you know but when we decided that you know we had taken a probably a hierarchy\nOf of the mafia in Boston in ... when we look at the next most powerful group at the time of the most powerful a organized crime figure at the time was already bulging steel slum in you know I had gone\nTo ... and and you know my ... at the time but we should we like to try to get these guys and let's see if we can get\nInto it and the response back he went back to the FBI and\nThe response back from the supplies the FBI at the time was no that wouldn't have to do focus on that will focus on the cause an artist or in a you know when that could do the Irish organized crime so at that point I can I get my when I was wondering why\nI mean these guys or is probably worse than there are\nA good laugh here at the time and why will be under fire from it and then you know I found out later\nOn in life but at the time it kind of got my attention\nThey certainly did and and of course we know the names of some of the FBI agents over the years who you either interacted with or\nI interacted with their progeny when their time on the phone Rico each Paul Rico jak who was favorite FBI agents descendants ... John Connelly John Morris and there were others are as well so\nAre you begin to focus more and more you also with the head of the organized crime division ... with within the the state police before you became the head of the states away so this was really your life blooded activity for\nWhat nearly Fifteen Years I'm guessing\nIt was most of my career and I never expected to be actually investigate organized crime most of most of my career but the way it worked out I mean I come out of folks working like I said earlier you on with the FBI and I went back to the road for a while and colonel\nInnocent took over the state police she put me back in ... organized crime unit and a time when I went in there I asked him if we could target ball joined full I mean he said go ahead [noise] um and it was a lot of unsuccessful attempts by the law for some agency and so forth to do it but and it was a lot of what\nWas that the time the reason why is that on sophistication\nYou wait you wait you wait for him to make that mistake along the way of actually do but it's a much longer than that we have to pay\nFor the mistake if as I recall was I'm having a conversation with a woman from Iceland I'm\n... ... yeah and you know\nEven the neighbor who was the neighbor in Santa Monica and they apparently bonded over a a cat or a dog or something like that\nCorrect correct then you know and it's and the fact that data for Beijing came before United Sates Marshall it looked at it in Charlotte and was was sharp enough to pick up on it and say it was so we get a look look into this for the you know that came to that was a lucky break that we thought was going to be happening whatsoever\nI always thought that he'd pull into a gas station somewhere like in the middle of Iowa and they would be a kid from South the going to college out there and working part time and would recognize and that's how I thought the um uh that he'd be found out\nYou know when he ran is pat and we know I mean he had a place in Clearwater before he went on lamb down there you know like the beach you know he liked the sun you know we're looking at those different areas and we didn't really think he left the country after nine one one that was even more difficult to do that type\nOf travel but you know if you look over at Santa\nMonica where he was found you know that that fit the type of lifestyle that you enjoy so uh you know you know it the fact of the matter is that you get caught up there was a surprise to us\nAnd I are you convinced that he left I Believe he went to Mexico you convinced he went to Europe in er during uh during part of his time away\nNo neither am I.

him Joel welcome you know you're you're next on the ...\nYesterday even Dan how are you\nGood Joe uh we got full lines your your comment though I Want to just hear what folks have to say your car and just\nJust you know two two quick things here I don't think was the question of why I think it was more aware of what a national I guess my question to you you can shed some light on that's why we're seeing transcribe somebody times but they're quite\nWell he was transferred I Believe twice in the last week or so\nI Believe in Florida and he was taken to Oklahoma and then also home to West Virginia and I guess you got to West Virginia yesterday I think that's an amazingly interesting question or because obviously at eighty nine I don't think he was a threat to us scape\nAnd I don't think he was a threat to others I also thought he was in protective custody that he was one of the guys that they would have watched over like a father ...\nWhile they did say that he was in a secure perimeter are secured area where he was\nRight well how secure was that if one or more fellow inmates could we could go in and do it allegedly they did that's why there's white ... someone mentioned earlier and I think it's a good point and they need to investigate who ordered the transfer is if he was in such frail health\nUm why moving from one place where the I thought when he was moved to Oklahoma did he could have had you been sick and he was moved to a better medical facility white ... a great medical facility bedroom ... medical facility up here in Massachusetts but\nWas there was a clear any at any one point in time we're in and the other institutions that he was he didn't want to see in a medical facility on premise yeah\nI don't I don't know I don't know I don't think so I didn't read anything like that obviously a different times people can get sick or they might have to be moved into but he was not as far as I Know dealing with any um\nA life threatening situation where he had to be um it's you know kept in a medical facility those are all great questions you don't have the answers but there are great questions in gives gives us something to think about thank you so much\nFor anybody can shed light on tonight that would be great damp anybody try to have a great\nAnd I actually am I going back to this later as well going to go next to fill in the car he feel your next of the rings central nights I caught a line or what they had\nHello Dan Janet ... program I'm In the mid eighties I worked for the lady um lived a marine rode along the water in South Boston and she told me that early one morning she looked out and she saw the ... brothers engagement ... walking out which very early they walked out the sugar bowl wage\nAnd they came back and they are to wage and one of them were way with the shed and despair and they're always strikes me that we have a ... ... ... brothers you know the the ... one by one went the other\nYeah well then that's the most you know there's that story there's also the story of\nA Billy Bolger using his influence when I'm when Whitey Bolger got into trouble you had a he got him a job I guess as a nighttime maintenance guy at the courthouse yeah got into a beef with a judge over something and uh I think it was judged here the housing quote if my if my memory serves\nI just wanted to relate that story about their image you marry me\nYeah that's that's a great story though I think their relationship was close to the probably either one of them wanted to lead on\nAt All right thanks very much will have a great night we'd go no go next door Herman done in Hartford, Connecticut hello Herman how are you tonight\n[noise] why do you think\nYeah um he um he he's he's gone I mean when I heard it today I was surprised when there was some initial\nIndications that he died at the hands of someone else or\nShe'll still probably got wind that he was coming in and then in the morning to make a name for themselves what better way to make a name to knock off Whitey\nWill I get you make a name for yourself but you knock off Whitey he's eighty nine years old and what is that by you or another life prison sentence or if you if you're not under a light prison sentence you've probably just signed the rest of your life away\nYou know some of these people you know to them they're locked up for life so it's just an accomplishment to them\nWell I think so but even if your entire life I think everyone has a whole that somehow someday maybe we'll get slipped on appeal maybe there'll be some judges ruling somewhere I I just think there's more to this story or in in talking\nAbout Jack the trust of the show they got to this particular place\nWell I don't know why that is a problem well I don't\nWell why that would change I mean if if someone's in I think well\nYeah but even if there was a mistake that that means that they he was put in a situation where he where he was so close to someone who could have taken advantage of that mistake the timing too quick if he was in protective custody moved West Virginia and it was there for three weeks\nAnd and so now that\nI'm Talking with an hour's rice that's ours you guy Hermann us good question thank you my friend let's do that now let me go to Steve in Jamaica plains the will to get you in one more in go ahead Steve\nHi Dan how you

for locations visit Boston in ... dot\nA in a very busy\nI'm a facility for for certain Nancy welcome thank you okay so let me start off with Patti so petty\nA yes vote a yes vote on valid question one would do what\nA yes vote would create a law that would limit the number of patients registered nurses where I'm working at the bedside would take care of an acute care hospitals and Massachusetts so what what does that mean\nYou know acute care hospitals you said that the sixty two so yeah that'd be sixty two major ... and\n... it excludes ... term care rehab facility is the ... all of that\nAnd they're not talking about intensive care units icy use or anything like that I mean would I Would cover it as well but they would be covered as well right that there could be nurses at hospitals in who are working I use in working uh other other less a traumatic\nNurses can working at a facility at the same time but yes it's it's it sets and max\nIn other areas of the hospital I meant to say okay so how how would that be decided does does the law stipulate three nurses a or a three patients printers of fat\nThe nurses in Massachusetts after Twenty years of trying to change that that patient load in Massachusetts hospitals many many as we've been working on this\nAnd you know we work with the legislature early work with policymakers we work with are are um directors of nursing and all the ... the executives and the hospitals\nAnd we've been unable to convince them that it is totally unsafe in our hospitals right now because nurses are overloaded they currently there are no limits on how many patients now does take care of and so nurses are taking care of seven and eight patients and more in Massachusetts hospitals and what would this law mandate\nIt'll mandate that hospitals and the nurses together to develop and acuity systems so we can define work areas and what the needs out of the patients that's one piece the other pieces\nThat they each work area after many years have looking at extensive research and we'll have a definite maximum number of patients that can be assigned to a nurse now has can take fewer patients\nHospitals can move nurses around in the facility doesn't it gets very flexible but it means that no longer with nurses take care of\nAnd the patients and causing too many injuries to patients out in the hospital\nFor but the law or if the law if past yes does not say on the overnight shift the maximum number of nurses his five on the morning\nIt does say ICU is one to one or more wind to to avoid it does say active labor one to one\nThere are there are a number of hours yes which would work area which would be imposed by the law for best ... that's right it would be the law would would impose a limit so it means that nurse can still take care of a number of patients and their work area\nBut they can't be overloaded anymore because it's not safe\nShow than ... ... ... it seemed to me that you said there was going to be a negotiation the law would mandated negotiation or ...\nOh no no not a negotiation but given the fact that the laws would be such a limit smoking threat will get Monday ...\nHaving them all but it wouldn't have any of the in here as well so Nancy I'm\nCommon sense a lot of people say look I'm In a hospital I don't I don't want to be one of twenty patients that in that one nurse was assigned to a one to ten patients particularly if I'm In a in a situation where I Need a ... a little bit more attention so what's wrong with this idea while you opposed to it\n[noise] um I'll start by saying that I'm so very big responsibility to write about question because if it passes it becomes a law I'm just as it is and\nI'm ... I Am alarmed honestly about what this law would look like if it passed and what the consequences would have across the state in every single hospital um it forces the same precise ratios on every hospital regardless of the acuity of the patients regardless of what kind of patients they take care of at all times\nSo true structured too regimented and your point of view yeah and\nAll the numbers realistic that the law would impose\nThe the the issue with it I think is the rigidity of the numbers because the unintended consequences is that when a nurse reached the precise number that was in this law\nThey would be unable to take another patient even if they were ready to take another patient if their teams there clinical judgment they want it to take care of another patient let's say if their patient was ready to go home was just waiting for a ride it hospital\nBe fined if she took on to another patient who it\nWas so so the lives of the law does sound at them as yeah so the law has fines in it but to be Frank for me I think the bigger issue is you have this huge amount of moral distress for nurses because they are forced to either break the law\nA law like real law or take a patient that they want to take out of a waiting room or from the emergency department it's just it's the rigidity that's the problem is is our way write\nThe law nests can't break the law the hospital will break the law the ... the law is intended to have the hospital ensure that nurses have enough patience and known nurse who decides to take extra patience is breaking the law\nSo what would happen let's assume for whatever reason um the the the women was for hypothetical ... and there was a nurse who said oh yeah I can I can kind of help out over here because\nI Do that all the time and that's their prerogative\nTo do so if this law passed with the nurse with the nurses still have that prerogative\nNurses will make their own professional decisions I'm not saying they can't they can't but there is a law there to protect the patience I don't I don't\nKnow what it would have just want to understand is that let's say there is no consequences for the nurses the forget forget the consequence for the nurse okay if the nurse let's say for some reason said you know one\nOf three of my patients are are asleep and they're fun and I just checked on this other guy and I I sense that this nurse over here for whatever reason is a little less experience I'm going to help someone and she out of the good news over his or her heart and decides to help another patient\nA and is called on it or is there any consequence\nNo consequence for the nurses ... hospital\nAbsolutely not the only time as a consequence for the hospital is if a patient or a staff member or family member notify state health policy commission of a consistent I'm consistently breaking the law by overloading the pay the nurses with patients\nIf that happens ... commission has notified they've and investigate at that point if they think that and I was ... whoever whoever the ... they have policy commission has a a government agency appointed\nBy regularly appointed go no it's not new it's been here all along uh yeah in nursing professional no none of them now they're now they're in fact in bed with a Hospital Association were but so so okay let me give me a government agency\nHas an agenda which I think it's kind of the crux of the matter you know vote and that is a government agency coming in that come in well I if I\nHad somehow come in and like there's a law that this terrible thing that's going to happen and that's not true well\nLet me go see her that I'll get back at ... am I overreacting year or\nSo I I think it's really important you cannot walk back to the ... of this this would be a law now\nThe the issue is when a person break the law they are breaking the law you I write about the enforcement of the health policy commission and the fines but that's not the issue here the issue is you are asking a nurse\nLet's say a nurse in the emergency department who has three patience and the law says she's supposed to have three patients and her patients are stable and she feel very comfortable and she looks in the waiting room and she is extremely worried about somebody's mother your mother my mother\nAnd she said she wants to take care of that patient and bring them in this law would say that she cannot do that and so if she did she would be breaking the law forget the fines forget the hospitals accountability the nurse would be breaking a law and for me\nAs as a leader I Would feel extremely uncomfortable asking a nurse to break the law if she broke the law you tell me how would that look if something happened let's say for example something happened in just in the deposition they said to her how many patients will you caring for and she says for\nAnd they said don't you have a law in Massachusetts that says you're only supposed to have three this is not the way people ...\nMillion not limited Patty to address the hypothetical quickly and I got to go to a commercial break but just so let's assume the hypothetical AS Nancy put out there um what would you do as a nurse you know\nThis is about patience nurses will take care of patients don't matter what happens at the issue is this law is to protect the patients it's to and nurses are already overloaded we don't we cannot take care of\nMore and more patients ... is about the responsibility of hospitals and the failure to take care of this problem for many years that's what it is\nOkay she'll but just coming to the hypothetical if let's say the limit was three ... three patients and a nurse on of again the fitness of his or her heart said I I Know\nYou can share that with all of course no probably do it all the time left you an everyday thing now\nBecause once you're law passes you will have no effect\nWhat will have no effect it's done against the law front it's against the laugh at the hospital to assign a nurse can say okay well I don't want to clarify that I normally tell you it's the hospitals that is responsible for assigning\nDrove the hospitals if the hospital and the role of a nursing supervisor or administrator came down and said hey look [noise] um we got we got overloaded here I Know you do three patients we think those patients wrote a controlled ... other patients now all the time yeah but that would not happen when this law if this law was passed\nDid not include maternity at all she as she she agrees only included emergency departments at one level of the staffing did not replicate the requirements in the ballot question\nAnd use the average at night in med search it is a ... it's a it's a fine study but it's completely flood if you try to use it to to try to figure out what the expense would be in hospitals hospitals around the state including mine we figured out what it would mean for us and we are completely in line with\nWith the other two independent\nAssessments of what this would cost this is done you know the ... million dollars but this is the cost would be in Bor nurses right that's ... yeah it's very simple for example at the emcee isn't that a good thing\nSo so it would be and see what it more nurses or any hospital with a more nurses so the the big issue with this is that it is a blunt instrument to try to address\nAn issue that in some some hospitals on some shifts staffing is not perfect I Will be the first one to admit that every nurse that's ever worked with me would tell you I Am committed to staffing and I think it's extremely it's probably the exact most important thing we can talk about\nBut this ballot question would be the law and this ballot question has huge unintended consequences for access for two big reasons one it requires four to five thousand new nurses to come into Massachusetts\nWe have now is that if they're already going so well for one thing we have already have a nursing shortage we need we have twelve hundred openings and we need we would need a lot more nurses but that's not the only part of it it is a big piece of it because\nOf this law goes into place January first so I think we all realize we couldn't have four thousand nurses\nIn January but but even if it was delayed or whatever it'll do right I mean not supposed to be but let's even with that at any given moment this law is not lifted for any emergency for the Boston Marathon it would still be in place for the disaster that we had on the north shore for what Pittsburgh just went through this\nLaw is the law is rigid at all times there is no\nLimit you let me get Patty they respond to the rigidity and also the number nurses and I got to get to a break but I Want to give you a chance to respond\nTo the rigidity of the law if there was God Forbid it out of the Boston Marathon bombing isn't there some\nAny every hospital has a disaster plan that goes into place if there's a disaster before long before a dive in our cars for a disaster in an area so hospitals have those plans in place and they call in nurses and nurses do in that so that aside\nThe hospital industry has plenty of money to hire and nurses there is no nursing shortage we graduate thirty five hundred nurses a year in Massachusetts on this and he went out and hundred retire Eighteen fasten your graduate in four years\nAnd nurses young nurses cannot get a fulltime job in Massachusetts hospitals in the bus Boston area anecdotally I've heard that from the nurses but also they've told their professors and then and that they leave the state that people have had licenses young and nurses have turned around and left the state\nAnd I mean and again that's a limit on the whole Joe and I hate to do this you know\nAs a health care consumer as someone who spent fifty years on the Finance Committee in Brookline as a voter\nShown John John limit John I'm going to give you twenty seconds because I'm way past my bread go ahead twenty seconds\nOf fame somehow this has to get paid for that for the bottom line and\nOur premiums are going to go up who knows that the real data from the usual they come to cut\nBut I don't ... your ... your milk that Geron you already know correct that aren't what they said you're a ... a no vote yes I'm In ... okay I got to ask\nThat you inadvertently met Whitey Bolger suppressed by your

I'm who said\nThat she did say then the gate and just said it democracy is dangerous no profits are dangerous\nIn the wrong and I got to be honest with you shake your head ... Mary and I don't have a chance to go to the the videotape ... or the audio tape\nI don't remember that being said um I really don't but\nI thought she just said it within about ten minutes ago but they're just looking to make it better acuity tool for the hospital the staffing ratios on the floor that especially in the emergency room and too quick point just 'cause you get\nHome from Mary I'm going to hold you to the other standard how about a question make it a question 'cause I got full lines and I'm trying to be feared where everybody\nWhat what what's the question what I'm not sure what you want me to say\nI have a great and I hate to do this to you but I think I made it pretty clear that people should be prepared to ask a question okay we're here to debate the issue I appreciate your call have a great night let me go next to\nA I'm not going to be mean Patty you've heard me say three or four times here folks have a question I Know that she was on your side of the equation or I just want to ... I just want to get questions that's all because these are the folks\nWho are the experts um many of you know or have expertise as well but they are my guests tonight let's go to Karen Karen next on nice I'd go right ahead\n... high I still have a question thank God [laughter] so I heard Nancy eight and then I listen to a number of debates\nAnd the no side always seems to talk about unintended consequences I have to say unintended cause yeah yes and do what they do talk about that though is when they say to me it seems like intended consequences because\nMy question is why is that when they talked about unintended consequences\nThat they always resort to that cuts are services and programs and units\nThat are dedicated to those that make the least amount of profit for very profitable industry such as low um income community programs um programs for the mentally ill okay\nLet's give her a chance to respond to that gives them the question is ...\n... areas like what are the areas are they looking at\nMe as a vote I think there's a question in the in the summer could you respond to that place quickly\nSo I Would say that there are there has been a lot of hospitals that have articulated their fear that they would\nHave to consider cutting services and programs that are not profitable to your point when I Am what I'm focused on was when I talk about unintended consequences is access for patients\nI Am really I'm really nervous about what this would mean for it and again I caught unintended because I Do not believe that the people who drafted this bill meant to have this be\nSo dangerous and so devastating for health care in Massachusetts but but the bottom line is that what it would be if it passes we have some of the best hospitals and best quality outcomes in the country and passing this law it had a devastating impact on August ...\nLet me get a patio chance it was a great\nQuestion because I Do hear that unintended consequences and lack of access in fact the hospitals have plenty of ability to it and other places they can cut the uh the administrators and executive salaries and we we think that if they cut it by three to five percent they'll be able to pay for the nurses that they need in the hospitals\nThey can stop buying hospitals and other states some of these hospitals I'm In partners and stored or buying hospitals and building hospitals and other places partners building a hospital in China\nAnd and you know even even in um Boston medical center they've they've had a profit and I I you know to be threatening ... you know Nancy said was they were going to be bodies in the street and January and she said that in previous debates\nThey're rich any cuts in services will be done by a hospital that chooses to do that UMass medical center had cardiac rehab and a pediatric I'm a program and they explicitly said it was because they had too many Medicare and Medicaid patients and this is a hospital had profit\nOr your character thank you for the question we got a little bit of debate but like a fool lines will lick you get to a couple of folks okay\nThank you Karen have great night\nLet's go next to Jason in Cambridge Jason wants you to be really quickly to get you in one more room please go right ahead\nSure there's a a quick easy question right or the nurse with among doing this all along I just want to know who cares for the patients when when the sort of go on the lunch or great\nNurses in the news is due to write for lunch break I I'm not sure what that question stayed on\nThe ballot question says at all times and so it would require that the hospitals would have a nurse has to back up the other nurses when they went to a breaking lunch or if they do that now\nNow says don't get breaks and lunches now now they're all my life and union ... contract and and do you have contacts that you ask any staff nurse is that he or she gets to go to the bathroom and she has two or gets a lunch break or their fifth mandatory Fifteen minute break under the ... and uh our law\nWould say that most of the nurses cover each for each other at lunch they make sure their patients are ... you know safe and they make sure that patients are stable and they cover for each other\nOh so they're doing now so it sounds like we will be doing it also in the future where past this\nIs the thing passes they would have to we would have to have other nurses to come in and and be there because no one would ever be able to take more than the ratio that's in some ways\nWhat they do in ... California has sort of actually have rotating nurses and here also in some hospitals at Brigham and women's they ... we could cause a that team there was a team that came around and helped out the nurses that we could have a break but that doesn't happen everywhere that's only hospitals that have that ...\nAnd thanks very much I'm going to get one more question and let me go to Andy and deadly we're in deadly Massachusetts last night so Andy nice to be back and deadly guard at\nA thank you very much for taking my\nCall this really quick quick really quick\nSo the proposed law is ensuring that the public at the newly mandated ratios must keep an eye quote without diminishing the staffing levels of its health care workforce or more cleanly said without downsizing and the elimination of other services\nThere's currently thirty one hundred license respiratory therapists state of Massachusetts and as president elected in Massachusetts signing respiratory therapy\nI Am responsible for those betray therapists Patty can you guarantee me that respiratory therapist in the field of respiratory therapy will not be directly ... downsizing or eliminate show\nAbout ... of offset cost ... if\nAnybody cuts back respiratory therapists that will be that that hospital industry\nOkay I'm Sorry I Know that I\nFail to include respiratory therapists by name within the list of the health care workforce\nAlright so noted so noted I I got to leave some type of the rap I thank you and they said you call a lady that I Know that is I didn't think either one would convince the other um but I Want to thank you both uh I Know it's it's some passionate and controversial I got\nJust about twenty seconds of each of you to make a if you want to make a quick summary okay you must act residency\nLet me say that there's a reason that every single hospital community health center physician organization and dozens of organizations that give direct care to patients who Massachusetts has taken a position of no\nIncluding the mathematical society mass ambulance association of Vienna ... all of the community health centers if he wasn't voters don't know what to do you think about who is caring for patients why are they all voting now\nThat's twenty seconds I'm Patty give you the wrath well hundreds of indoors is across the state have interest and question in mind but I Would ask you to vote for questioning land to protect your mom your family your sister she died as your neighbors or anybody else who will eventually be a patient if they haven't been one yet\nPatti a Healy or is it favor the question yes uh she votes yes she's with the mass nurses association Nancy gave him\nA ... a chief nursing officer at Boston medical center thank you both I Hope that people have a better understanding I think I Do I and I hope people have come to an ... whatever you do get out and vote on November ... thank you both very much for coming in we're going to be back we're going to talk about\nPresident Trump's suggestion to end birthright citizenship with law professor Jack there in uh Boston University law school\nWell where did you want any weight loss is happy to announce its fifth location is now open it little didn't mess conveniently located at point plaza off root for Ninety five book your first consultation today\nStopped by one of nine Boston interior stores today for a living room bedroom or dining room furniture and accessories for your home beautiful furniture beautifully price for locations visit Boston interiors dot\nCom blooms Shapiro thirty five years of helping businesses stepped forward bloom Shapiro in Connecticut Rhode Island and greater Boston boom stepped forward [noise]\nW.

cover of Sports Illustrated are they oh that's\nThat's definitely the nice because\nIt was interesting to read the piece I forget whether it was who was in the globe wrote the piece that the vote for the MVP falls to five members of the baseball writers association and they're told I guess about\nAbout the seventh inning that they had been designated as one of the voting members and they they came close close to splitting the votes in ... they can have a tie apparently the five of them wanted to have a a a tie between pricing Pearson I guess it was in a global I think said well this morning I have to find that for your you'll find\nYou'll fears came a little of that for\nA well no I don't think that was pretty close that way no I guess that they basically said look we can't do a co MVPs uh yeah it it you got to pick one I was leaning towards ah to appear to be honest with you because I thought that his his were so important in so timely\nAt what price did a really nice job to pick up two wins\nYou know I think the world series is a good price for David anyway that's\nThat's a great consolation prize in great consolation prize for anybody on on the red Sox those must have been a fun flight coming home that's that is all I Know it had\nTo ask\nBut like I Can't find my um\nMy my my story here um I'll find it for you but during maybe during the brakes look here's the deal I'm we're talking about birthright citizenship\nOr Donald Trump today raised the issue once again a which is part of the fourteenth amendment one of the three great post civil war amendments thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth amendment\nAnd let me just read the ... the single sentence I guess upon which all of this revolves and then we want to get your take on it\nAll persons not citizens all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and other states where in they ...\nI I was pleasantly surprised to tell me that you thought this might have been a close to call but I thought you would assume\nWell I think that the the assumption has been for a long time that this this provision of the fourteenth amendment means that anyone born in the United states with the exception of people here on diplomatic immunity you know ... a diplomat that anyone born in the United states is automatically a citizen\nAnd that's been the assumption that Supreme Court decided a case in Eighteen Ninety eight that seem to take that view but I I think that there's been some doubt over the years\nExpressed about this and I think there's some room in the in the in the language of it\nI'm obviously the part about subject to the jurisdiction thereof it's been used for two purposes number one it was to exempt\nA bath like ministers and ambassadors foreign ministers in ... the other you said that was put to say that Indians warning reservations or in citizens and it actually took an act of Congress to reverse court decisions and grants all\nIndians American citizenship\nAnd then the first and then the first citizens right well they they were here before ... for the Europeans but they weren't considered until sometime in the early twentieth century which is a little bit surprising\nSad and sad\nAnd so but the the\n... the history of of this section of the fourteenth amendment is a little bit vague and first of all it was definitely designed to ... to to reverse the Dred Scott decision which said that anyone who was the descendant of slaves brought here from Africa could not be a citizen of the United states number on it was the\nMain purpose of that provision the fourteenth amendment or any of the Dred Scott decision is known as one of the great injustices\nOf all time in this country for its decision that no blacks brought here as slaves could be citizens but\nFollowed by plus he versus Ferguson a you know ... years later which was also flipped\nRight which said separate but equal is the proper interpretation of equal protection and you know the problem with it partly was of course that they were very good at and forcing the separate but they weren't so good about the equal part of insurance\nAnd they shouldn't be any either one I mean ... ... yeah so and see what's so you think ship\nIn it you know there are some people that say that when when a Congress aerobics amendment\nThey understood as granting citizenship to anyone who was born here who lived here whose family lived here that it didn't have to do with tourists or someone who might be Iran business or something like that and so and you get that in the language where it says\nThat people are citizens of the United states and the state we're in they reside in any case fit that Congress a you know the framers of the fourteenth amendment intended for this to benefit people who live in the United states but the reason I didn't want to the states and not someone who was just visiting\nSo they're sort of language to support their view a\nKnock knock through innings but not through an executive order\nNo but you know some people have said like judge Richard Posner used to be on the seventh circuit he was a law professor in Chicago when I was there he said that maybe Congress can write a statute to clarify that and make it through but nobody nobody has ever imagined that the president could do something that's dramatic\nThrough an executive order and I think it's you know also important to note the irony and President Trump making this claim since of course one of his big criticism of President Obama was his claim that President Obama was governing through executive order\nRather than the normal process of legislation for this this is just I mean it's almost laughable\nThe idea that the president could do that through an executive order so I don't know if he was actually talked to any real lawyer about this or if you just you know if this is just one of his off the cuff observations or something you heard on Fox News which seems to be the main source of of a a political and now\nHe he ... he ... he did say that the lawyers they said something to the effect that the lawyers who you talk to and I said he could he do I've no idea which lawyers look I Want to see could break I told you hold one second I'll let you go ten thirty but I Want to get into\nThe issue of

line up to vote for truly be\nInterested in it and I'd be interested in your take just you know for conversation\nI was happy to see Donald Trump showdown today with his daughter and with his son in law um I I I think it's important for the president and I know there were some questions about\nUh the the funerals had not been completed um but it's I I just think he's the president of the United states and the president of everyone in his presence I Wish\nI Wish that he would act that way and he's he's he's he's his rhetoric is so divisive and he said I don't think I think he has a little bit of a blind spot on this stuff you know calling the people in Charlotte\nCharlottesville Charlottesville very fine people I think we should I think you know for some of us don't really want to know I Know here for\nThese kind of occasions because he seems to be more part of the problem and part of the solution but you know I think it was right for him to to uh to go there because it is for his responsibility as president and if you could just I think stick on a healing message rather than a vice message he would do a lot more good\nThan I offered last week to write a speech for him and I meant that seriously if the if there's any one of the White House who was who was really smart at this point that he would tone it down and that would be leadership and his poll numbers would go up because I think that if people really believed that he could lead and say okay now look you know that the Democrats have been\nA also a pretty nasty as well and I think I'd be both sides or have some some responsibility not necessarily for the active Mad Men but for creating this climate jak that you know I don't\nThink anyone is responsible for what this person did these people have been doing
