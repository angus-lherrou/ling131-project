together that a musical interlude joining us now on the line is drawn Murdoch or many of you who um watch\nA cable network news or know him as a contributor to Fox News he's also a contributing editor to National Review online a graduate of Georgetown University and has an um\nAn MBA and marketing and international business from and why you throw a murder weapon or nights at ...\n... and where you could talk to you doing just great um we're talking about tonight I'm for the first couple of hours\nAbout the extraordinary uh I I guess you you would call it a news conference except there were no question today is the White House with Kanye West in a look ... west certainly has\nUm thought outside of the box um and he's paid a lot of uh he's been a target rich environment today for the American left on\nWhich the impact do you think um west now is is is full on board with a with Donald Trump I mean that that he was\nFor a while it it seems as if he was getting close to him and all of that but now I mean he literally physically and figuratively embraced him yesterday\nA guy metaphorically at a very physically have embraced the pressure and I think he's going to stay in in Trump's loving arms for the foreseeable future after the way he's been treated by people like Don Lemon and professor Dyson at my alma mater Georgetown University you know they could have said look you know cutting ear mistaken about this or why do you think about the other thing your facts are wrong\nThat's all relevant but an appropriate but a calling him a negro a saying that he this was a minstrel show I mean this is a kind of language that you would have heard back in the Jim Crow era or as far as the ... right back in the Nineteen twenties saw like a hundred years ago\nAnd uh that that they don't even engage in any kind of cogent intelligent argumentation it's just you know third grader second great name calling and that's pretty much the electoral level at which we see the left baby today\nWell it could have easily been been pirated by Bull Connor or less dramatics in the Nineteen sixties or to bring to bring in more current\nUm absolutely right and and it's it's ... it's troubling I mean I hate the idea that the left looks at people and says well these these are the physical characteristics this is their ethnicity this is their race this is their religion this is their sexual identity\nTherefore they fit very neatly into this box a correct and you happen to be African American uh well I'm a I'm American is black from up here and that's okay I I I I Know that's a distinction\nUm and and so you don't fit into that category but unlike Kanye West who I think it's had sort of this\nPolitical moment or does it lightning or whatever you want to call it um you have been pretty much committed to conservatism since um since you were young men\n[noise] yeah I in fact started working for the Reagan campaign ... as a volunteer is not high level of you know make a copy isn't any up bumper stickers but this was October of Nineteen Seventy nine so thirty nine years ago\nAlmost forty years I've been a part of the uh the GOP free market conservative movement and had been purely welcome I'm very comfortable here and make friends who've early on and who are still friends of mine and this is my uh my philosophical and political home and you know the ... has been wide open to me since I was sixteen years old\nAnd I think it's at the tip is open and then cut his just walked into it and I think what the left is afraid of is that he's going to bring a you know Fifteen or twenty or twenty five percent of the black vote with him and that's the case that Democrats are done they can pack their bags and go away 'cause they're not going to win elections if they lose a twenty twenty five percent of black folk\nHow long have you been treated 'em as as someone who obviously does not fit the mold that that a lot of Democrats would expect you you are you are a renegade you're off the reservation want whatever metaphor I Want to use here I'm In trouble if you've been treated overtime\nI think I've been off the reservation long enough so they don't really pick on me I can tell you that early on\nA back in eighty five eighty six when black conservatives suddenly got discovered it the people actual Donahue and others the media discovered oh my God they're Democrats or didn't vote for Mondale vote ... what is the um the initial response was kind of like finding space creatures are very curious to see what we look like and\nWhat we felt like a sawed it once you got done with the sort of initial physical examination that than the attacks began oh you're a sellout oh you're an Uncle Tom you're you're letting down your people you're betraying your race and so on and so forth um but I I've been around and I've been doing this almost forty years now and so I guess maybe the figure that I'm not going to change it and they pretty much leave me alone which\nLike I remember when Michael Steele was running for lieutenant governor\nOh in Maryland I'm not mistaken it was common practice that people would throw Oreo cookies at him\nUnbelievable it's disgusting and it's only black folks and ... and minorities who go through this you know if you are a\nA a white Republican and Democrats don't like what you have to say they'll say hey wrong with the mistaken their call hearty you hate the poor that make these kind of comments but they won't say you're white trash or you really wish you or Hispanic or boy don't you wish you were Japanese or whatever they don't\nStrip away from your ... white folks are allowed to to disagree with each other and still remain white if you're black and you disagree with the black left not only they say you're wrong they say oh you're not black anymore and I find that extraordinary and and it's only a among minorities particularly among blacks or this unusual and bizarre and totally inappropriate stick should exist\nWhy is that why does the left have bad visceral reaction because um I Would assume that most people whether they're black or white or whatever uh would recognize that a ... you have your point of view on my point of view and we can still be friends\nWell this is sort of the whole idea of the civil rights movement wasn't it the black folks actually are human beings and have dignity and an individuality and er you should be able to think for themselves and make up their own minds on things but when it comes to the political left if you're black you're supposed to be Democrat liberal Democrat you know vote for donkeys no matter what\nAnd if you suffer from that they come after you and I think the reason is for political reasons the the black population is typically about Ninety five percent loyal to the Democrats and I think the left understands that suddenly these folks start thinking for themselves\nAnd start yes either stop voting Democrat or start voting Republican they're going to be very very bad bad shape it can be really bad trouble um I Believe the rest of us in survey found\nThat a President Trump's approval rating among blacks is at thirty six percent now that's obviously not fifty percent or half the country but\nIf those thirty six to pass them actually vote Republican you have Eighteen percent of the black vote going to be a boy if you're in a tight race and you're expecting the black folks to come out and vote for you as a Democrat in eighty percent of don't here in big trouble\nAnd if it if it turns out to be twenty twenty five percent you're pretty much done\nI think the left knows that they're panicking about\nJoy let's let's get some phone calls we're full lines here I'm sure if folks would love to talk to you are my guests ... Roy Murdoch you've seen him as a contributor on Fox News have you been on CNN or ... I assume you're you're ... tied to Fox were you ever if that's correct were you every night on CNN before you may be a ... a contractual time\nThey don't do this to blacks I was telling your producer that they do this to people with disabilities I happen to be with women\nAnd gays or transgender Chinese or Hispanic [noise]\nIf you don't subscribe their idea of diversity isn't pluralism of ideas to Peru is a physical differences aside but they all want the same idea there's no [noise] you know individuality [noise] it's almost like the new servitude I hate to say that but it's almost like [noise]\nI mean you know they'll get homeless people to vote which is nice on paper but they want them to vote for him [noise] after dirty trick they don't tell you know I\nI think you make you make a very good point which is that uh you know they want you to be ideologically uniform they could look different in and have a different uh sexuality and whatever else that's cool right as far as what goes on in your mind that's supposed to follow particular script and if you look different from that you're in big trouble\nThat yeah we have a caller from New Jersey who's black blind and Muslim [laughter] guy from New Jersey one one of our best cars\nAnd and by the way Glen is one of my best colors he's become a little more conservative overtime win I think we started you were a little more over in the other side\nHere back in shape and you kind of leaned a little all by the way than a minute wait you know share 'cause it re she knew it would re\nAll right well that's good it's a it's a small it's a big city small town Boston Glenn always great to hear your voice today we'll talk say All right have a great ... next\nTo Rob in Charlestown Rahman Charles down your neck so nice I went to ... go ahead Rob\nCould get the Father's Day is a ... I'm sure it is a badge by saying what he said he got his credibility to question\nDoesn't it Kevin expert about\nGrowing up in a household without a father when he didn't\nMake him an expert so I haven't I don't want all you're doing I don't know why don't ... you can sell me a man that has expertise in that area so I mean I Want I Want to know why isn't he called out what he said I I I think it's crazy\nA glove you make a very good point Rob a couple of things one is that a county west does have experience in in growing up um I guess in a fatherless or largely fatherless home\nAs do unfortunately a large number of black kids and not just black kids and to the degree that that's an issue we can talk about it I think with a\nPersonal experience of course he's done something with themselves since he's now a multi multi multi millionaire was able to get out of that circumstance and I think that's certainly a a worth trying to understand and replicate and rather than try to learn what what is left his word how he did it\nOn what the leftist do is just dropping handles on them from a great height\nAnd I'm not I'm no fan of Don Lemon but I Do not believe that um lemon used the word I'm Talking ... I Believe that was used by a guest on his show and he chose not to call her on that\nCorrect but he did refer to the situation at the oval office yesterday is I think he should have minstrel show so he he's a little\nVillage come at oh yeah there is a and that brings back in ... in Philadelphia and all the Mummers parade\nDirect sure absolutely robbed great great points thank you so much as always corrupt participating that gives you a lot of great and I used to going to go to John John is in mending to Massachusetts the John welcome next on my side with the really murder\nIt's John Warner J. yes I did say John ... I said John John and they met the gentleman that Jay Jay LA Gen right\nThat's correct like John you're on the area\nI I watched I was born in a Catholic family wine trade Catholics and my father was blind faith Democrat\nAnd when I get old enough to think to myself around twelve I decided to be a Republican and then I get up what party and became a modern world and if if people do their research on the Democrats are acting just like it for fun is a great grandfather's\nUh the other one just started the KKK and anybody can look at a research it and they they have no tolerance for people with their own opinion\nMhm they they they think that everybody should just think like them to an art there in the fall but what's I mean Republicans yeah show so I'm\nGo as late as the Nineteen sixties John you had people like Orville ... I'm\nA ... you know what I was on how to bring the federal troops in ah to Arkansas and Nineteen fifty seven George Wallace\n... list are peak acts Maddox I'm a ... Albert Gore Al Gore's dad voted for Gore senior else or the new voting rights act will direct going back yeah so there's a\nThere there is a um\nThis is a heritage was in ... and Robert Byrd or run over who was a\nDemocrat leader until I think the late Nineteen eighties and he was in the U.S Senate until about five six seven years ago when he finally died in office\nAnd he was a former uh or going to organize or the KKK not just a guy went to a meeting once this extra recruited a hundred members under new klansmen into the KKK and when he was buried about five six seven years ago Obama was their Bill Clinton was there Joe Biden was there to bury this former clan organizer on believe all\nYou gotta you gotta John Gray points thank you\nI wouldn't want or they made it for about eight months ago no one will not get reelected in ...\nWell let's see uh ... let's say Geoff deals running against and we know Jeff deals as a friend of mine and uh and they for medical Kennedy ah I I Hope that everyone out there who is tired of Liz ... act\nGets to the polls in November sex\nAnd and but what do what you have to do okay simple I mean I don't know that would be a big upset or we'll see what happens next drawn if Jeff deal ... feature I Want you to call back and take a victory lap okay I have a great now whether you're trying to look at it is going to get a couple of more and I promise eat is Milton ... go ahead and do you eat is\nA damn good evening to you and you get\nGo right ahead I I\nYeah so um I live here with and I don't think\nIt's a really good because I have a feeling a lot of black college people out there who feel the same way he does but afraid but we have\nBecause we thought they got on the left it talk about slavery all the time\nAnd hypocritical because because they are keeping their own people but I think it will tell\nYou the salary is let me ask you know you just let me ask you if I could do without being too personal what is your background\nLive back wow it I'm going to do with it and I go up here I Am the outdoors that I've always voted Republican and I really would like to think oh I I like to be able to do my own shy but I don't want people to tell me how I should take it out and vote\nAnd I don't think I think that's exactly what Kanye West is expressing at this point it is\nA threat to write you you are a a a human being and a strong independent person you have every right to think of yourself make up your own mind\nAnd I think what country was just going to do is give coverage to people like you and people who are not quite as ... as you are calling the phone to say look you know hey I'm with ...

I think it's an interview she did in England in and talking about a civility and the fact that a ... that she's willing to put civility aside he\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nYeah when we went back a little kid I'll I'll be civil mommy once I get ... when I get my my what I Want\nHillary is just a gift that keeps on giving now we've also seen in action a lot of the domestic terrorism uh in the last few weeks I don't know if you saw the the ... in Portland assaulting motorists\nA and one commentator celebrating with Matt\nLewis who writes for the Daily Beast he's the Daily Beast columnist interviewed by CNN host and this guy had the audacity to use the N word now we all know the words you can use like the N word or the F word but now we have to add the N. word\nListen to this this was Brooke Baldwin supposedly\nI think a news anchor I didn't realize that she was a commentator listen to her up breed a a columnist named Matt Louis for the Daily Beast for having to do or die city to use the word mob but\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word totally a mop it is without a doubt that there's no other we're now\nIt's a little put a stop and what the mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August sick or not it's not what we saw chasing we've right what about\nWho were at the Supreme Court\nOn the wall what do you call that civil protest or without a mob I think it's easily along\nYeah and if there was a party or as we call it um out for sure come on let's ... you blooming now let me let me ask you a little had already as a mom or do you feel like that as part of the the weaponization of of what's happening now on the right\nThe weaponization on the right the only weapons that I Know that had been used real weapons\nWas the gun used to shoot\nNearly killed a Republican Congressman Steve ... at a baseball practice on a baseball field or a softball field\nUh in preparation for the congressional softball game the weaponization of words let's get it rolling here again all points of view are welcome I Want to I just want to pay the back to kind of a west and why is the left so worried about Kanye West\nRena is in east Bridgewater Rena welcome you were first is are and you were in the ring central nights that call and welcome\nThank you I ... I didn't have the ... I kinda liked what was going on tonight to talk about ... I'll call it but\nOver Twenty years ago I started in March so called London games at Syria and we started to be at the state house\nAnd I couldn't believe\nProgress shows said motherhood and I'm conservatives so I had an understanding why and I read a comic show will be missed ... yup I'm inside an American education\nAnd I also like\nAllen cheese I Would like to see him as fetch that show I ... and basically what the Democrats are here as fair\nGame plan book is a book called little radical I saw Lewinsky and so I ... and I'm like she learned all this stuff from the Chicago getting ... and his teaching it to people so I understand\nProgressive ... wherever you want to say they say hardball ... said basically focused on motherhood airing being nice and hey nice guy flu show well\nLet let me let me let me disagree with you a little bit okay if I can ah with with all due respect I think it's important to draw a distinction between the left wing of the Democratic party hard core left wing of the Democratic party and liberals I mean liberals are like conservatives in my opinion that's what I think that\nUh we can talk I can talk with liberals and liberals can talk with me and you and all of that but when you started to get out onto the fringes and the other night when I was in a an end over the messages school of law was challenged you a couple of congressional candidates\nTo call out to criticize the Republican to criticize some of Donald Trump's statements and the Democrat to criticize some of the statements of for example Maxine Waters what happens is\nThe we need to have people\nFrom the other side called it out I mean is it for a Democrat to call on Donald Trump Donald Trump says something over the top\nIt goes right by everybody but if Republicans said wait a second Mr President though uh that that's a little botch and conversely if someone looked at Maxine Waters and say you know no that's that's not the way it's supposed to work in America until we get to that point where we're we're going to be hopelessly divided\nIt we have to um be civil thought we also have to be for them and I think the best thing to do is um get the other side to react and ... ... the reactor\nIf we react we sometimes loose are um thought process so let them ... ... what we believe what was the thought process you know\n... there's a lot of fun to stand them there's a lot of progressives who have lost their thought process over a Kanye West ... fly like a man I don't really\nKnow I didn't know he was married to the cut it in a family yeah I Know how by its music I mean no no he's um enjoy things and I think that's why he's attacked because he could have a big influence\nAmong um people who really likes ... and they never thought that it would like trapped because\nMedia are always is totally after Trump\n... I don't I don't follow the Daschle and family very closely but I Believe that he's married to Kim chi Daschle and to me it's tough to do a because does she insisted as a I'm not an expert in that era reader and way past my break that you're much for your call appreciate them so I couldn't get your own with the really Murdoch okay\nWell I went for like ... I'm going to listen to him more thank you\nThank you hope you continue to listen to nights I ...

I forget what his first name was he did a heck of a job well\nDidn't quite do a heck of a job there were a lot of now there was a back and forth who was responsible the governor the mayor remember the mayor eventually went to went to jail at the time and there's ... ... but but they were a lot of\nPeople who who who who were appalled that that that this could happen our you\nKnow as African American you're right most African American vote Democrat\nThey're sure we wouldn't have gone to the deepest saying they have all black people that's what we were appalled by that that was just off the cuff remark he just throw out there and it was kind of the wrong way\nWell but what about if he said he again you know like that's what he said OK I'm\nBrett you're right I was telling your black America felt about it okay a lot of your listeners a little naive thing that all of a sudden black Americans are going to start coming to the Republican\nI don't know Roger that there were many black Americans at that time I don't recall maybe you do maybe your colleagues that from Howard felt that way but I don't recall many prominent black Americans who are calling Kanye West out at that time and supporting President Bush and his administration's response to Hurricane Katrina arrived I miss something\nWell basically it's called talking within house we don't era laundry out to the common war we will talk in the house amongst ourselves about our old\nOkay fair enough fair enough but again so now now they're going to um now where they are going to talk in amongst themselves about Conyers support for Trump or is that a different situation\nYou know same thing I have over Fifteen hundred friends on Facebook a thousand of them are from our they're up in arms with mhm right now if you saw my Facebook said right now it's ridiculous we in the community say he's a he's uninvited to the cook\nOkay why why why\nYou know why is the uninvited to the ... because he has a different point of view\nUm he's a little off he's a little off kilter right about now\nOkay you're just five for me what you mean by off kilter if you would\nBe a career is built on African American\nNo doubt he's ... he's a rapper any and yeah it's a huge ... following amongst young black young black Americans ...\nBoy so as a publicity stunt from a publicity side point we're wondering why he pulled this move because he just killed his audience\nThat allied new oil and I said earlier than average\nThat would suggest to me that that unless he wanted to destroy his career outright he must actually believe what he's saying\nNo I have no problems with a man thing when he believes but there's not going to bring more African Americans and the Republican Party and matter of fact he's actually upset most of the African American in America\nI Will I Will see Roger I appreciate your call don't be a stranger please keep listening to the show and give us a call I Hope you have it you feel you had a chance to express your point of view\nAll right I'm just I had to obey night folks remember what he said about Bush do you remember that I don't\nThink most of your listeners that you need to do it for you Roger\nNo I'm just saying about the most you because you've got people all over the country and a lot and probably won't even paying attention to him\nWell let me ask you a ... on a scale on on a grid scale so you went to Howard okay yep Bush's response to what happened in the aftermath of Katrina what would you give them an a B C D or an F\nF ... the\nHere we have people ... even when

session includes all the sounds of the operating room that clients are wearing the bows headphones and it's a\nIt's it's a quite a production and it's very effective\nOr the third session like in real

the ... what my brain is doing and I I Know how good I feel I Know how wonderful it is and why ... why I called back to what I go back to well now\nThat my my opinion on the subject is uh it's not a pound problem it's a pattern problem\nAnd these unhealthy patterns of a unhealthy nutrition sedentary living if they repeated long enough those those patterns become rooted in the subconscious so it doesn't matter what you intellectually no or what you consciously one for yourself\nThe ... the pattern always wins which is why my opinion why most diets fail is diets are focused on the symptoms not the problem if the therapy focuses on the pattern that's the problem is the pattern\nWhat percentage of folks who would uh participate in that form of hip no therapy\nEventually end up being successful\nI send out satisfaction surveys six months after I finish up with clients and about Seventy five percent of still happy with the results\nWill Carol I'm ready down in Burlington hypnosis

the same thing the older they get the worse it gets and that's because we continue to repeat the pattern of worry stress and fear on the road\nAnd with that repetition these these fears become more deeply rooted and we don't have as much conscious control over them they kinda run the show so hypnosis were able to kind of cut that connection and plan C just support relief confidence in comfort
