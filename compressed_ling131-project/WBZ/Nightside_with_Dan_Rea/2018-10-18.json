the the richest man in the world where the network that\nAt his peak of about four billion dollars on he sold arms to anyone and everyone to governments to non state actors et cetera and yes a Jamal

talking to Dr Frank and you may have a lot to gain\nMore than any that you're making me the other side yeah\nI was in the news radio [noise]\nMy guest is studio is a tops Fletcher School of diplomacy professor Elizabeth ... uh she has traveled the world I'm not only\nFor the U.S government as as a um represented the U.S government but also a in her career as an academic and we're talking about\nUh the murder or the apparent murder of ... or ... or was it like to do professors get some phone calls have you put on your headset if that's okay with you and do we have some folks are already waiting on the line um\nUh what my ... my last comment here before we go to phone calls and my concern is that there seems to be a real push\n'em by the media\nFor the president to do something to do anything and he seems to be resisting that push now obviously this fellow ... ... pretty well known 'em and wrote for the Washington Post I'm just wondering if he had been just a journalist for\nI don't know you know what a ... a major newspaper in Saudi Arabia or if it would have a really got as much traction as it has\nI think that there would have been the same amount attraction I mean this is ultimately a story about us Saudi relations right he's written a fire for that so when either had written for\nYou know a small newspaper or as in this case the Washington Post I think they would have been a lot of attention first there's the just you know truly horrific and grizzly story at south\nBut the other thing is there's a lot riding on the U.S Saudi relationship and what you know his death tells us so\nWho stands to gain for example for the ... for the ... from the disc crediting of Mohammed bin some on certainly you know the anti reform asked anti\nLiberalizing if I dare use such a term but anti reformist elements in the Saudi political and religious establishment they stand to lose um so the conservative hyper conservative stand to gain who else stands to gain from\nUh the discredited of NBS Iran stands to gain after all we know that you know strong competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran along\nA confessional lines Sunday and the former Shiite and a lot are so Iran stands to gain another country in the region that stands to gain and I think they've played a very prominent role ironically and all this another authoritarian\nUm government or Islamist government namely turkey turkey and Saudi Arabia there's tension between them because of Turkey's pretensions ...\nKind of ... the first among equals of the Sunni Muslim I'm and we're already states so there's a lot\nOf Saudis in somebody's in a war with with Yemen right right and it's right apparently ... ... ... not necessarily playing according to the the code of warfare right there really is a code of warfare right uh and I'm In in Saudi Arabia is very important to the United states so let's see let's see what our listeners have to say we're going to go first to um\nCalifornia Robert is calling in from\nCalifornia Robin is a regular listener out in California Robin you first sign of the rings central nice icon aligned with professor ... ... go right ahead Robert\nAid and can you hear me okay ... you're on a speakerphone I Am going to come out but I like that better\nOff the speaker phone is always better go ahead Robert\n... wonderful so I'm gonna try to connect some dots here and the professor can probably help out with this with this whole situation so we we got to go back to the early eighties for the uncle had gone to show the a lot of people don't remember those who ... who could also sold guys do but Donald Trump\nBought at around ... there was that was a larger shot in the world at the time\nAnd uh he ended up selling it to Donald Trump now later on a a friend of add on to show these out ... ... ...\nHe was one of the Saudi princes but without family he ended up belly Donald Trump out to the tune a probably a couple of billion dollars by interest in his uh different companies along those lines and he ended up buying back itself that what's really interesting is that at night to show the a lot of people\nProbably don't know this but he was he was married in a in a it was it go between starting my words are just keeping me today but he was a go between between the Bush administration and Richard ... to be specific\nA net behind the scenes cause show set up the meeting with us some Saudi diplomats in order to get permission to ever get sick you permission to invade Iraq in two thousand and three and a show give us kind of go between guy so he's\nThe youngster has while we were which ... not this the victim could show you're saying is on ...\nKnow his uncle Vietnam\n... is an issue of the ... let me just make sure that a professor um ...\nAgrees with your analysis so far 'cause we're throwing a lot of names and a lot of a lot of ... circumstances of this is Robert ... yeah the facts as you've presented them Robin are absolutely go ahead Robert Siegel right\nThis week when I was in D.C someone said to me okay the Saudis are finished in this town well placed inside her I I I I think that's a hyperbole um is this a game changer probably not a but the question then becomes what to do so there's\nCut all ties full diplomatic rupture at the other end of the spectrum it's business as usual this was just an unpleasant blip on the radar screen but then there's a whole host of things in the mental and I think that's where we're probably going to land on this somewhere in the middle so for example there are symbolic things like\nA secretary of treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin he's deciding whether or not in fact tomorrow would be given to figure out if he's going to pull the plug on his trip to the Saudi future investment initiative conference and that's a showcase event now by the Saudi Government and NBS at a time when the Saudi economy\nUh is is not doing that well um and we know that you know a lot of high profile figures from uh from Europe but also from the U.S I've\nAlready canceled their um their parents at the conference so that would send a powerful symbolic message that you know there's a ... their economic consequences even indirect from this kind of behavior another thing we can do is\nUm we could use a targeted approach we could use what's called the global Magnitsky Act\nAnd that's a piece of legislation that has the power of the U. S. has the power to freeze the assets on banned\nThe visas of gross human rights violators and we've used that I'm against members of the ... regime the ... government we actually use that against members of the Turkish government uh during the Brunson period\nSo you can't get into the U.S can't travel here your assets are frozen frozen again it's a targeted mechanism and it was designed in many ways precisely to be that kind of targeted a response not\nFull blown economic sanctions but something that targets the individuals\nThat are held on Iraq is not likely to sit back and enjoy that and this is a period of time we're about to rebel to cut off the the oil production coming out of Iran we're going to be more reliant this winter on on Saudi oil I assume even though that's a fun fungible\nAsset I get that we're ... we're we're relying on Saudi oil and the Saudis are relying on an Saudi oil let's not forget that this whole liberalization project of MBBS and\nThat Saudi vision twenty thirty I'm you know for liberalizing society reforming the economy really pivoted on him move away an effort to diversify\nThe kingdom's economic resource base of the country would no longer be dependent on the export of a single commodity to basically drive the entire economy so the economic rationale and the\nAbility to kind of you know tightened our economic squeeze on Saturdays on Saudi Arabia I think is actually there they may we may need their oil but they actually need us and frankly since you know um since fracking and and\nUm you know and shall et cetera et cetera our dependence on foreign oil in particular Saudi oil has been a you know has has declined and has made it easier for us to to exercise a kind of leverage to you on\nTalk of Google going forward in the next few days of the dynamic that we're probably going to see is more and more members of the Senate particular members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democrats or Republicans are going to be be rattling the cage for some action of the Trump Administration has put a lot of chips\nOn improving relationships and economic relationships uh ... vice Saudi Arabia\nPurchases military goods and other materials from the U.S [noise] um I understand the Trump administration's hesitancy in the short term to do anything dramatic but how long will the pressure last do you think I mean we're we're coming up on mid term elections and\nThere'll be a big snowstorm and the attention span is this is this a tempest that is going to dissipate quickly or do you think this is going to hang around\nI think it's going to hang around I think the midterms are really going to uh you know interrupt the attention span but let's not forget even before this event there's been a lot of talk and a lot of debate in DC about um re calibrating our relationship with Saudi\nSupport for the relationship with M. B. S. but also re calibrating the way in which we support them and most specifically there's been a huge debate in Congress about I'm suspending weapons to Saudi Arabia us weapons to Saudi Arabia that have been used to ... to prosecute the war in Yemen I mean the the Yemen the war in Yemen as a\n... a colossal humanitarian catastrophe it's a calamity ... literally millions of children\nUm it's produced just massive civilian ... off you know that antiseptic term we use collateral damage and so there's been a debate even before that says I'm going to run his some responsibility and that was like absolutely but I mean we're not supporting your on and we are I don't\nKnow yet it but but we're supporting Saudi Arabia\nSo we're providing targeting information to Saudi Arabia that's supposed to be precision and minimize civilian casualties instead you've got you know saw Saudi bombing missions on a on a on hospitals on schools\nUm massive civilian casualties there is a cholera outbreak the Saudis have been supportive of allowing 'em you know humanitarian medical assistance into Yemen so there's already been a discussion about\nIf and be one of NBS his signature foreign policy initiatives has been this war in Yemen presumably to contain Iran\nIt's produced massive blow back in terms of\nHow the U. S. has seen his ability to be a leader I'm In a move too fast too quickly and created too much damage so again even after the midterms through the midterms after the midterms this particular issue now Yemen War and us weapons used in the ... is likely to come\nBack and then final complicated question and the short answer always the lynchpin\nOf these conversations the middle east has to revolve around Israel Israel is not doing anything they're not saying anything they probably know more than they they're letting on right now but this could impact the balance of power in the middle east I assume at some point\nIt could I think again one of the things we need to focus on is the fact that ah the relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia has improved a firm that only under this administration again that speaks to the person of\nJared Kushner who's run point on the Saudi Israeli relationship so we there's a lot riding again on trying to sort of\nMinimize the damage to um Mohammed bin saw him on that comes out of out of this incident and and not relates to keeping the Saudi Israeli relationship going in the direction that it is right now\nProfessor Elizabeth ... ah I've learned a lot a in this hour hope my audience has as well thank you Dan a look to have you back as this this um this sort of a\nCrisis or either dissipates or erupts even further I think it's been a pleasure to talk with aspirin great loving to come back you will you will or we will invite should they wrote a great guess appreciate very much\nUh we'll be back to the other side of that ad o'clock news going to talk a little domestic politics little Massachusetts politics later I got to talk about the Jones ... forty years ago next month\nLearn how new treatments are helping those with severe asthma from the experts at Tufts Medical center now at W. busy ten thirty dot com slash health Massey\nAbove the fold we're going to get to that admitted dealing with this whole issue I didn't realize so little was going on in the world that um the globe devote\nThe above the fold headlined three days in a row to the Elizabeth Warren ... or so the article on the news article by Maggie\nEsther and again this is the New York times so this important we're not talking about Breitbart News here if Senator Elizabeth Warren thought they're releasing her DNA test results showing Native American ancestry neutralize a Republican line of attack she was wrong\nThe test pilot proof strategic preparations for a likely presidential campaign datsun\nUnderstood understatement did not placate President Trump who was mocked ... Warren as Pocahontas and once promised a million dollars to a charity a pro choice if a DNA test substantiated her claims of\nCherokee and Delaware heritage well I don't think that one out of one thousand and twenty four\nWhich I mean there's a infinitesimal percentage we talked about that the other night and her announcement of the results angered many Native Americans including the Cherokee Nation the largest of the country's three federally recognized tribe be tribes\nDNA testing cannot show that these weren't as Cherokee or any other tried to secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation Chuck ... said in a statement tribes set their own citizenship requirements not to mention the DNA tests don't distinguish among see numerous indigenous groups of\nNorth and South America the test ms Warren took did not identify Cherokee incest ... specifically\nIt found that she most likely head at least one\nNative American ancestry six to ten generations ago now we learned earlier this week that\nThe average American the average American of European descent who has been here for\nSome time probably has more Indian Native American heritage that Elizabeth Warren now the article by Ross do that um sounded a similar a point\nAnd he starts a lot of smart people believe Elizabeth Warren the senator from Massachusetts is the front runner for the Democratic nomination and twenty twenty\nOr we said New York magazine profile claim she's winning the invisible prime rebuilding campaign networks rolling out policy proposal brewing insiders intimidating rivals which he released a biographical videos featuring her Oklahoma and roots and answering Donald Trump's Pocahontas jibe with a DNA test proving that she does have\nNative American ancestry I don't think you get really call it native I mean it's like one out of one thousand and twenty four up with six to ten generations\nAgo Jonathan Bernstein of Bloomberg View called the video the latest in a series of solid moves Warren has been making to persuade democratic leaders she can take on Trump\nNow the columnist says I Am not meaning he is not a democratic insider oh campaign professional so for all I Know Warren may indeed be impressing her intended audience\nAnd I can certainly think a worst people for the Democratic party to nominate that a woman who has white working class roots as well as academic credentials and a half buried past ... had a real docks intellectual\nGo read my book the two income trap seriously have no idea what he means by that but running for president in the age of Donald Trump requires above all inability to hear what John\nHeilemann and mark helping once called the freak show back when he was considerably less freaky that requires a deafness dealing with scandals and gas an accidental blunders inability to know when you have a wrestling move that justifies getting done in the mud and when you're better off sitting on a top rail enacting superior to the ...\nSo when Warren's main encounter with the freak show has evolved who claimed Cherokee ancestry which was an issue and her last Senate campaign in two thousand twelve before Trump started\nIn with his nickname and from her initial response to the story through her new DNA test for bottles with the president she has demonstrated a conspicuous lack of political commonsense and again this is coming from someone who is I'm\nA ... a Republican functionality so my question is this\nPretty simple everybody knows what happened that I'm Elizabeth Warren's sat on this\nQuestion on this dilemma for five and a half years the most that we could ever get out of her or when we asked her and the reporters in Boston asked her about proof of her ancestry back in two thousand twelve with this\nOne was in Brooklyn restaurant a cop or more Wall Street performance when she was asked again are you part Indian\nMy mother\n[noise] if there was a more way if there was it the more ... sending condescending manner in which to deliver an answer I think if you looked up the word condescending or in the dictionary that would be a picture of Elizabeth Warren anyway my question is real simple\nUh and I know it's one that many of you probably have thought about and that is did this um series of reports in the Boston Globe in her release of these D. N.

Dan White and Harvey Milk were elected in Nineteen Seventy seven there were sort of like a new wave a politician in San Francisco\nUh over the years there has been a I'm a almost a caricature portrayed both white in milk\nWhere we're milk kind of comes into the book uh aside from the fact that obviously these two assassinations happen these two events happen so close to another is that he was a supporter of Jim Jones a lot of people don't realize that\nThat a lot of the folks in San Francisco and even nationally I'm Jim Jones was not some fringe figure he was not um you know like a Charles Manson street person type guy\nHe was someone that was very much in the in crowd so much so that the mayor of San Francisco George Moscone appointed him or to the housing commission San Francisco and he quickly became with my ... what's going to support\nThe chairman of the housing commission in San Francisco which is pretty scary thought when you think of how he treated his tenants than in Johnstown that this guy's essentially the largest landlord and the city of San Francisco you don't see that with other people\nA ... you know whose names are set in the same breath people like Ted Bundy or Charles Manson\nThis guy was very much I'm In the establishment in San Francisco and it says something about that city in that decade it was sort of the hangover after the high you know you had the summer of love have asked for Haight Ashbury all that stuff that was going in the Nineteen sixties and that was a whole lot of fun and all of a sudden you have the hangover and it's not so much fun\nYou have the seventies Liberation Army and the kidnapping of Patty Hearst\nYou have this group called the new world Liberation Front that is putting bombs they put a bomb on the on the window sill of Dianne Feinstein\nThey would send candy to different office holders and they'd be bombs and and the ... you know Russell Stover candy box ah there were um weatherman hiding out there was obviously I'm the zodiac killer the zebra killings there's all sorts of craziness going on in the Nineteen sixties and into this issue comes people's temple\nAnd want to do things you forgot they were two presidential assassination attempts on Gerald Ford a\nBite was it Sarah Jane more where I wanted and that was the one in San Francisco right and then there was one Sacramento by squeaky fries review from which Sacramento is not that far from Jordan Cisco northern\nCalifornia I'm so it was a wild wild time and of course San Francisco still has a men's problems but what I Want to come back to his the central figure a Jim Jones who eventually would lead was it three hundred or more\nThis is nine hundred and Eighteen people that were killed including Jones\nIncluding Jones it was a mass suicide and these were people who were poor um who had a basically given everything everything to this guy who portrayed himself as a messiah\nAre and who people believed it it's an amazing story it's an amazing book called city Jim Jones Harvey Milk and ten days that shook San Francisco I did not recall that the assassinations followed so closely on the Johnstown\nMassacre shore that was that was nine days later\nAnd um I think history you know the the history that's told us that Dan White killed Harvey Milk 'cause he was gay and I got a very close Harvey Milk was guy because our milk was gay I got a much more complicated version told to me one of the guys I spoke to was the end whites campaign manager chief of staff\nAnd a business partner he's ... he's gay and\nWe're going to get to all

Harvey Milk and others tried to stop the ... the article from from being published and it was stopped for a while but finally it comes out and at that point I'm a ... on mass hundreds of people's temple members go to San Francisco airport in the summer Nineteen Seventy seven and they go down to Guyana\nTo this um jungle community which they had set up three or four years earlier and um\nYou know this was in the middle of jungle ... British guy on insurance and I remember back in the day there was British and French ... well this is now yeah this this British guy anti but it's at that point it is a guy on and then you have an independent\nUm it's run by a guy named Forbes Burnham who's a Marxist and so that's part of the law for them but the other part of lawyers they are a hundred miles away from Georgetown the capital and so you can pretty much do whatever he wants\nAnd so they go there um and they sleep because they're afraid you know just a ... a few years earlier they were accused of rigging the elections in Nineteen Seventy five for for mayor of San Francisco\nThey do the investigation and San Francisco who's in charge of the investigation Jim Jones a second in command he's in the da's office [laughter] a threat so that's how much they had their hooks in the city but the world was falling apart you can only hold that together for so long and so they they ... they scramble down\nTo Diana and\nIn speaking to people who are down there a lot of them described it as rather idyllic before Jim Jones got down there but once he got down there literally for six hours a day he had these loudspeaker ... that everyone was hearing and it was just all that you were hearing was Jim Jones\nA you know who ... who ... who plays for the airplanes head of the ... well they had money like you know we talked about before they they have people who are signing their houses they were signing a checks they really didn't get to keep their own money they may have had a couple of bucks spending every week they were living community you know maybe Seventeen people in an apartment or something like that and at times in San Francisco\nAnd the rents were a little cheaper back then um but they they um they had millions of dollars and in fact in the very end they give three million dollars to they let three people go and they said take this money to the Soviet embassy and give it to the Soviet\nUnion so [laughter] they so they didn't do that I Hope they kept if they drop the money 'cause it was so heavy [laughter] it was literally they literally dropped the money walking on a I'm On a railroad track and said this is put throw this down the sisters India is Indiana yeah okay so so they get to China\nOr in all of a sudden I'm the investigation pursues them a congressman Leo Ryan uh within I think he brings one or two kids he also brings a um a an NBC reporter\nHe brings a number of reporters go down there with him John Harris John Harris was one of them um and they want it to go in and talk to Jones and on the night of November seventeenth everything was fine um it seemed fine on the surface\nAnd at a certain point this man that I interviewed Vern ...\nGive us a note to um to John Harris because he thinks Don Harris says the congressman cars don't Harris's looks more like a congressman to Leo Ryan and yeah and and so John Harris doesn't notice and then he looks at it and some little kids niches on him and from that point on things got very dark very quickly and jumps down\nNow dawn Harris was the NBC reporter who was working out of the Dallas office the Dallas NBC bureau and the reason I Know that is I was working with John Harris is camera guy that day that very day in Dallas\nUh we had gone to I have gone down a to do a Fifteen year anniversary of the assassination of
