and the car when I cut your story and my daughter that quickly we might as well a lot of uh friends with I Know very level at the college with my daughter I used to walk up that large college\nAnd I can tell you very clearly how we remember hotbed they mistreated her her job I'm including\nIf she had to work directly with with the faculties and they treated so badly when he had to speak for herself these people have no tolerance for independent thinkers they hope that crazy so badly that she had to quit when I Do I'm not the price was ... when\nWas the woman who was working for the school was she an employee of the school or was she a student maybe on a work study program\nNo actually she was a an employee of the school\nShe graduated with my daughter very nice lady but they all she had a depression over it you know they they always want her to tell us to do what ever they want and she couldn't decide otherwise\nYou know so they don't really like that well they want to run yeah so I'm not that is the price both ... and all that that's a set of calling\nWell that's an interesting story that than it is truly is consistent and chose a closed minded miss\nA and also they get to watch on an academic ivory tower and they think that so they write their gods gift to the world and you know that's the they've got a they've got to maybe a couple of degrees from colleges and they can teach in a college and that therefore they know everything\nThey want ... and it didn't make believe that they actually like running the show you know\nI've slowly they either there's always yeah your ... your daughter force okay\nYes thank you and that would be like\nA great night let me go next to a gym is in Pembroke timber your next of nights a lot of women close\nIn age than

could carry a accusation with no ... cooperation and you know at the end and then\nPeople in champagne on senator Collins because it had she stood behind cabin on in her\nSpeech was so well thought out and had her research and\nYou know had fat and and and now I don't know whether that democratic\nLiberal I mean it is they don't care it's like they like your other caller was saying like no one thinks that the south it's like a drink in Kuwait and make it so awful that bullying and gas or at and and you know\n... you know disturbing you know I don't want to I had a family and it's it's

thought it was rice in ... I don't know the asked whether they'll do they'll do testing on that substance in whether it was or not\nIt still is way beyond way beyond the pale and if I was about to say it was a voter in Maine irrespective of how I felt about the Kevin ... vote I Would be offended that as senator who was sent there to represent me would then be subjected to\nA not only this sort of um meant you know psychological abuse but the physical abuse of receiving a letter at her home that might have a poisonous substance I mean that's the sort of thing that is not supposed to happen in in in in a country go either\nWay and I know when Donald Trump or you know I didn't vote for him on you know he can be alert and can buy all ... now I asked him why can they not a politician or an aunt and buried there back in\nTime but who on is that what what did you think when he called Stormy Daniels horse face today I mean that's\nNot bad no no no that's not saying that we got like\nA foul mouth New Yorker that he is yeah but on the stand they sell them any politician that are grown and now with a smile on that failure and that white thing and that's why in the whole time and then you find out that feeling that\nYou know that's not accounting of you know come on and off at the way Donald Trump and giving you you you get what you say you know it it it tell you that I carry it I don't know\nWhether or not there the big influx of people is that they had a party and going to Republican tight because people are democratic liberal I guess\nThey're just trying to think well what if I can\nSee the midterms that's for sure maybe not in Massachusetts will see around the country they did me thank you so much keep calling have you stopped by the window world show room in Pembroke at at at all since you're in Pembroke it's\nNot like the I ...

I've been thinking about something like that for such a long time but I grew up Porter's nicer she did you did it's more it's polished and he was exactly\nBut I always wondered about whether the warrant it on my key and all of these extra mile wide open and bring them into support them over the entire life and their families\nWell they're not they're not going to do that because they don't see it like David I mean it would be nice if someone who really believes that set an example there are are there are a church groups that um have gone out of their way to help people who are here\nUm and you know churches historically have been\nOne of the great supporters of people in this country that is what churches have always done in this country across the the religious spectrum so there's nothing new about his idea but but but Davis idea what would the brilliance of Davis ideas it puts us as you said on the individual\nAnd it says it is okay you believe that you really want this to happen why don't you make it happen on your own well\nI'm just talking about those politicians sort of always whip up a political party over something like that and it is it for the people will just to pay the\nBills go the other people you know which way that you're on avenue in Cambridge oh lake street Cambridge got matches that\nIt probably never been in all those loans because it's so ... ... ... one of those people will be nice day\nLet's see if there's any one tonight in the audience who would actually step forward I Would assume hey maybe maybe President Trump\nA lot of it would honestly off of that and say look if you want to assume that responsibility for a family or whatever or because they seem to be a lot of families coming up step forward and and we will do our best to get them to make sure that they're not people who are criminals\nAre and if they seem to be\nSincerely sincere asylum seekers you know what happens is the process as you claim asylum you say look I Need protection I Need asylum because if I go back to my country I'll be murdered ... that's pretty much what an asylum seeker would say\nAnd we have a hearing so what happens is if they go through the process to a point of entry\nAnd and present themselves as an asylum seeker we're we're compelled to at least consider their their claim\nBut during that period of time someone someone could care for them so I Want to give them\nRooms room in their home I think it's a brilliant idea I Wish I had thought of it Michael\nAnd maybe the president should step out and say to two people not only elected officials but rather than middle Americans you know the people who are out there who are very concerned and say you can step forward you can file an application and we will we will put you in touch how would I think it's really\nThey\nThey're like appreciate back it up David Breashears that's keeping roll it Tina is down in ruins socket Rhode Island Tina welcome you're next on the rink central nights like coal and what do you think the idea\n[noise] um well\nI'm kind of a simple correct and I were to ask you kind of a quest center on the ground it better than other people I ... my mind how many people that are coming in right now that said mom do that and I'm either come in and buy grow I don't know how do they find out that they were on their way like lay down or something\n[laughter] I don't know\nI guess I kind of implied in asked that question I think these are much more organized a than than the national news media would have us believe meaning meaning I think that the word is spread and I suspect that there's probably\nIf I I'm guessing now but I Would guess that there's some financial considerations here and then there are people who are profiting from this and who are organizing vis\nA vis this great caravan uh and and I would love to see some real investigative reporting done by some of our networks are major newspapers because you're right I don't think it's just spontaneous that all of a sudden two thousand people wake up one morning and say let's hit the road jak let's head north I don't think so\nBecause basically what I Know it can affect on loving people coming over here\nNow they these people are American can on Central America South America how what my idea that maybe ... maybe ... is more organized and political backup but if you're my aunt there who had an ordinary\nRent you ever consider coming here to do if I'm president I wouldn't want to work with Mexico I heard were ... ... ...

and they could put up let us say a bond for a million dollars\nI think I think a viable idea there would be to get a hold of Mexico get a hold of Guatemala I get a hold of Honduras get an old any other country in between bought 'em all a an on doors and let all these countries along the way no that we're not going to put up with it\nOkay there you go to our country between Guatemala and Honduras by the ...\nAnd then they need to stop it right there\nRight so you send them back or what the president is doing the president saying well cut off the foreign aid\nExactly and it has to be that way hey here's my point that I really think the only way we can determine how many people how this is going to affect us is if we take an actual had can't we can't do that without a moratorium I I think that the best way of having the approach to take and I mentioned is it for a decade now are better\nYou have a national ID card for everyone\nHow can you hold on it\nWhat what their status is just like if you're if you can drive a semi truck or you can drive a motorcycle or a school bus or what have you all you know what your status as far as\nIn this country that card would identify you we have a photo ID could even be biometric it'd be set up for any benefits to the person would get any loans any job anything\nAnd we we would know exactly how many people are here and depending upon the economic situation and other conditions we know how many you\nKnow and that's a whole subject and I'm going to bring that up some night in the not too distant future the idea of of some sort of a national ID I think that's an interesting idea\nA and I and I I I don't want to open that can of worms up right now but but you have prompted me to make sure we'll do something on that\nAre in the not too distant future I'd give you my word on that okay thank you Dan\nNice to have a great and I appreciate your call going to go next to Susan in Chicago Susan how are you tonight\nI take it you know our jeep off that is\nA Jimmy Buffett second cousin\nHe's kind of a billionaire Warren Buffet at Lehman Decatur, Illinois I bet he enjoy he's actually a share of the wealthiest sheriff and the you know and the ... state shouted he's written a book at the state border crisis and he's very anti\nThat law enforcement and he is saying basically that people in Honduras are absolutely desperate it's very dangerous spare the drug cartels have taken our\nFarmers' land to care for forest to join gangs they are coming here because they are desperate because it's dangerous they can't be said sent back\nApparently the United states government has to work with the government of Honduras hit there is one uh extending some kind of financial aid I don't know about manpower but uh maybe some kind of military advice but you know didn't we do that in Columbia didn't we\nMaybe we should indeed Honduras and make it the fifty for state how would that be\n[noise] well I I think if people want to\nStay in their own country will how big is sheriff buffets farm\nWell he you know I don't I don't know about that but he he does know about that he's got a lot of patrolling\nTheir weapons training and he's got to be very wealthy if he's\nIf he's um a buffet sun right\nRight and he is a philanthropist but he is very interested in law enforcement\nTo scrape by the same ... you know they should bring some folks that his farm\nWell anyway the situation in Honduras it's horrible and needs our help the president can help in some way and also Congress can change some laws\nUh apparently unfortunately the union's control the border patrol and there's a lot of red tape and regulation and makes it difficult to act immediately in and out there where it\nSays that you that I don't think the unions are the problem from what I understand the the border patrol agents have very much concerned about what's going on I wouldn't want to be a border patrol agents a tough job\nWell that's true [laughter] anyway the the border is porous close it up in one area they'll come in and now they're\nI mean the thought that you have of of of working with the hunter and government maybe sending US military down there may be a military would do better in Honduras clean out some of those drug gangs for the hunter is government than than others than we had a success in the middle east\nAnd to that point is I mean I got an ... they would obviously prefer to stay in their own country that they they can't uh the conditions are so horrible\nAll right well that's what they're saying in the middle east to the same we can say we got to go to Europe so\nI mean that's a little bit of a cop out I think that if I that people in their own country should take control of their own country but that's a different story well we'll talk about that again Susan I Want to give ... OK okay thank you talk to you let me get market in a ... mark going to get you in here before the break rather had\nOkay I'll be as quick as possible for I Am the benefit the benefactor of America's hum I'm willing to take and immigrants\nSo you're the beneficiary or a benefit you're the better\nSorry the beneficiary sorry I wouldn't exist if my great grandparents went all out and during those ours on drums and my father's a Holocaust survivor yup great so\nWe do have a tradition of taking those who are in in peril my question is more of a general one\nAt what point do we draw the line and say this really is a humanitarian crisis and we need to bring them and you know you should ... should Roosevelt bought the Jews and when he knew about what was going on in the concentration camps and it was\nRigged I agree the Roseville fell down and that but here's the question should we bring in the entire population of Honduras Guatemala and Mexico\nObviously not on my mind is what should determine I'm not arguing on either side I mean I figure it's\nUsually do mark ... I'd like to hold you over into next on if you don't mind sure I think you're you're raising the issue which we need to focus on you stay there will continue this conversation is the next hour we'll start with you we got Paul in Dorchester good root for you you know the number six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten throwing the Hondurans are coming the Hondurans are

saying yeah it's nice don't get it it's very nice but\nUh anyway uh so look yeah last time to actually you know for those who do not did not hear us now\nWe get new people join us itself we are I'm sure mark has been responding to a recommendation to David from Cambridge man we're talking about a group of about two thousand sixteen hundred two thousand hunter inch who were coming north they have a\nLeft their country they're now in Guatemala or let them Allah as we say more appropriately and they're going to go into Mexico and then there'll be at the southern border to couple of weeks from now it'll\nBe a big story so mark was making the point as the um son of political refugees yourself correct\nYes so the grandson Frank Craig ... okay so glad you and my father was a political refugee as well sure and your point was so\nMy point is we looking down the road on doors isn't going to go away you one hundred percent correct with that but the question is is at what point does it have to get for\nThe people coming up should qualify for refugee status before we have to say take military or police action and that is that's what I'm really curious about is if this isn't going to go away how are we going to deal with more and more people coming to our borders\nAnd especially since Mexico can't financially or absorb them I'm sure we make a another an up NAFTA like agreement but that would have to do with um\n... you know we just did it NAFTA like agreement a vote one that\nDeals with human rights as opposed to a traffic um commerce where all three of the largest countries in this hemisphere well share in some responsibility for taking in refugees and or helping\nI I yeah I got an idea and I'd be interested in your reaction to this we're very generous country we we accept a million people every year I think we could accept her more to be honest with you I've said that before so in my conservative friends get very upset with me when I say that instead of accepting a million we've we could accept it we could accept two million\nA year but the reaches a point where you have to say look\nIf the entire population of Honduras wants to come here what do we do and maybe instead of having troops us troops in\nDealing with countries that we obviously had a great deal success with\nMaybe we turn around and we said or ourselves well we have a military presence in Honduras in Guatemala those countries would have to go in and we wipe out these gangs and we make those countries livable were given lots of aid to those countries over the year I don't know where the money's gone I assume it hasn't gone to the people\nMay have you with maybe we have to go in and install some some offshore Terry in governments in places like Honduras Guatemala and maybe even Mexico I don't know I mean Canada does okay by itself um\nYeah ... well I agree with Ron Paul that\nI'm not a foreign aid is way is taking money away from poor people on a rich country they're giving it to rich people on a core core country um and if you ... as\nAs corrupt and such a violent place where we really should look at what we're doing in terms of a foreign aid situation but I guess my question is is on a humanitarian quite well well we'll get to a point where we will take and Hondurans as refugees what\nWe have to answer that with military well their military answer\nWell that's ... that's the ultimate question the question is is we have a policy that says if you you can present yourself for asylum you also didn't go to ... and you could request\nA visa and you can request the right to to come here um and and it's a long line it's a one line how serious it to people in other parts of the world let us say in Africa or Asia\nWho are living in dire straits how fear is it to them for them to to have priority given to countries that have happened to be neighbors or near us\nUm and maybe the plight of people in Mali or or uh or other countries around the world bank would dash might be even more horrific\nWell is exactly that's what I'm asking is what would it take\nFor indoors to become a country that we would that would we think of like in Africa in order for us to look at them or what's going on down in ... on doors that they're sending so many refugees are far away\nAnd what do we do in the interim I don't know where we draw that moral point of the sand that says or more we're going to give you an equal footing or we're going to go in and have a military\nResponse to this or un\nWell here's the thing here's the thing mark when you really think about it okay um what Americans love to do in the winter time they'd like to go and travel and go to sunny places for why why do we not why can't we turned around and say look we're going to turn they're talking about they can't wait to\nGet into Cuba or are busy oh yeah I'm not wait to get into Cuba well okay you can't get into Cuba right now because the Castro family still pretty much has controlled ... why not say look what I'm On a must be David ocean front property\n... let's let's let's unleash the forces of capitalism on Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador oh there are plenty of places in Mexico where people now go for them you know for wintertime vacations and they're not\nAfraid to be kidnapped anymore either\nWell depending upon where you going you know I mean I'm of the biggest thing is but I'm just saying yeah let's turn it into let's turn into a positive smart you re grace questions I Want to have to say please keep calling the show we we love we love the thoughtful conversations thank you have a very nice\nTo have a great now we've got polling Dorchester coming up next less and Leo and room for you what do we do this is a quandary this is a great conversation tonight six one Seventy

I Love my opinion is I Love my Celtics but we also got to talk about some of these issues because look think about it if we had the ability to going to say for sure is and clean the country out in a week I mean you they have to know and go in there and just\nBlow it up look them away\nIt it just won't it won't work\nBut it's been tried but again you have to have been sending aid to Columbia for years as from us with a cocaine comes from and show that they gave an amnesty to all the the marches groups in there that are going to shut up their Supreme Court\nI just do not\nHave to sometimes you have to deal with bad people but but I still I'm I'm beginning to think like my idea of go in and just clean them out and make let's say Honduras Guatemala make him an example say look we're going to go in you go in with the\nWith the cooperation of the government did exist we will protect you we will go in we will find the bad guys clean them all out we will allow you get back in the seat and then ...\nWell setting in the Marines is that a new idea but we\nKnow it's worth it as well as George well didn't it [laughter] ... applied to the\nWell what would happen in Panama look what happened in Grenada your the little revolution in Grenada didn't last long did it we went to the Dominican Republic that trying to think sixty five up I remember that remember okay and just think if we hadn't gone into the Dominican Republic in Nineteen sixty five David ... might not have played for the red socks\n[laughter] do you really know how to put everything together\nYes yes I Do\nI Want to wall I like All right if we hadn't had spray paint on 'em and everything and those\nThose crazy rich left wing or movie stars bailout walls 'cause they had them all around their homes\nYeah but the only thing about and this is serious about the wall is once they build it are they going to maintain it so it it does sound silly but I always thought we've got to put tolls off the Puerto\nShelley it might pay for the thing and keep it maintained then somehow figure out what they should have the new world the same time it was settled up\nHere I I think we should we should have tolls coming into the country no tolls going a little absolutely it's like the tunnels got to do that and they want to get one more and I was actually a very very very\nMuch going to go from John in Framingham to John in New Bedford ...

interesting point tonight and it was on my mind and I'm really glad that you're you're discussing this with\nMatters in Central America or Twenty years too late with it as a matter of fact we should've taken this Twenty years ago as a matter of fact we should have done it when the Berlin Wall came down and that's\nNot live it's it's it's my viewpoint I agree with it but it's not presenting it I'm just presenting it was from former west chancellor of uh for chancellor West Germany helmet Schmidt\nIs that you guys are down there taking care of things in Central America\nYou know you need to be doing that\nI didn't really have a Schmidt it talked about that but that's a great point\nYeah he did and if you want it to find that interview with Charlie Rose\nIt is a really good Nineteen eighty nine and it's a really good interview it's one of those that I save what I was a youngster and heard it but that was Twenty years ago that we have ... they were saying to go down there and show the world that you can manage affairs in your own hemisphere and you add a little bit more respect\nTruly a brilliant brilliant project I was unaware that to be really honest with you a and a and I'll see if we can find that but you're right here we are we've always said there was a point in time where we ruled in Central America\nAnd uh and and we influence Central America if there is if there's some we we must know who these guys are that run this country you can't tell me that we haven't pinpointed with these drug operations are in\nEl Salvador they must have contingency plans to\nGo in and knock those things ... am I correct or on my right or wrong on that\nI Would say that we it is easy for us to find out I salute eventually\nYou know I don't I don't believe we have the right in our hand but maybe somebody has a they can spy on them however they however the government does it but nevertheless you know\nWe are being invaded by those drugs here and it is killing Americans and it is messing up our democracy and it's messing up our homes and messing up our lives and we need to go down there and take care of it\nWill ... is nice W supportive kind of stumbled into that thought
