C. news radio ten thirty one never saw [noise]\nPaycheck until we get paid back our personal loaned to her family and we are now finally like many other businesses getting a chance to get ahead because the tax reform has taken the largest corporate tax rate in the world off of off of our back then it allows us to do a better job and more companies are doing investing and people are suppose\nKnow this is the Republicans scam\nThat is cut taxes for those at\nThe top and then make everyone else pay for it that's what the Republicans want to do right now\nAnd that's the fundamental question about who this economy works for me is working better and better and better for a center and center and center slice at the top\nI was just out on the picket lines with all local twenty six you know what they're pitching for the one job should be enough to support people because that is the lived economy also right here in Massachusetts we need an economy that works for all of us you know I talked to her the overt patties bar\nAnd she talks to me about taxes you know what she says she never gets to take those deductions for offshore drilling and for\nFor a having money in the Cayman Islands and for doing some kind of reverse wop and Ireland\nShe's a small business person and she said the problem is right now under the Republican tax bill she pays full freight while the ex songs of the world the giant corporations OK world they pay only a tiny fraction returned\nYou know and the previous administration we saw a tax policy that basically drove capital out of our country the trillions of dollars off shored and now we're finally seeing companies bring that money back into the United states back into the economy that's what's giving us a better chance to have a future for everybody people being able to work less judge them\nMore pay in their households and uh you know I think again was yes well\nLet's talk about it that tax cut really worked for all those tax cuts to those giant corporations you know what's actually happened to median wages\nIn fact adjusted for inflation wages in many of our industries are actually down slightly there's no doubt if you were a huge investor than if you're a CEO those tax cuts really work for local\nYou know I can put it on interest everyone wants to ignore the fact that Ninety percent of businesses in the United states have twenty employees or less she wants us to think that all corporations are these evil empire that are just trying to suck the money out of the economy Ninety percent of and you know Jesus did not get\nA ... billion and you have Ninety percent of businesses under twenty okay I Want to hear your new ones go ahead representative and you can have companies with twenty employees or less you have business owners that\nMake sure that they pay their employees before they pay them so I work for a sign company out of a New Bedford is fourth generation running that company right now\nThey made sure that they took less than some of their employees if the economy wasn't good so in bad years they make less and good years maybe they make a little more of a generally they're the ones putting food on the table for their employees by making sure they're paid first that's Ninety percent of our businesses out there\nAnd that's the problem this tax cuts wasn't about Ninety percent of our businesses it was about the giant businesses it was about the billionaires and those are the ones who walked off with the big money and they have left everyone else behind ... employees\nOur viewer wants to know how old you vote you'll go first to your representative\nShort so we have anti discrimination laws in Massachusetts that covered this I felt when we debated this in the legislature that uh there was already protections in place I Want protections in place that cover everybody from Massachusetts and this law in my opinion creates a loophole that creates a situation where someone\nSexual predator potentially could come into an inappropriate area and potentially\nCause a problem for\nUnderage people that would be inappropriate and\nIf you question that person if I were in there for example with my daughters and somebody were to questions or ask somebody like you know the rest of them\nWhat was going on I could be subject to find or even jail time I felt that protections in the law into discrimination protections were already in place and that this does not protect a certain portion of our community thank you Senator Warren\nI Will vote yes on three to continue to protect people against discrimination\nAnd I think it's really disgusting not to not only does Mr deal have Donald Trump's back a hundred percent of the time evidently as vice president Pence is back\nA hundred percent of the time and vice president Pence is pretty much made his name on discriminating against our algae Beatty cue community and stirring up hate whenever possible\nThis is about a provision that says let's roll back and say here in Massachusetts somehow it's okay to discriminate against one segment of our people because of their gender identity no that is not who we are in Massachusetts\nWere bottle we're not discriminating against anyone when you try to protect rehab discrimination laws already in place\nI Try to protect their is absolutely no evidence\nThat people who are transgender pose any threat to anyone any more than anybody you know we actually agree with is we actually agree on a thin however however deleted permit people to discriminate law ...\nLaw provides a loophole that someone who is a sexual predator could go into a space a locker room and claim that day they identify in a different way and then just drop in front of somebody of the opposite sex and that is what this law does it it's not about just when he's out a loophole that can be exploited\nThis is the kind of ... ugly smears that tries to say there's a vulnerable groups let's keep them separate and let's make up stories about the kinds of threats they pose\nThis is just wrong it's ugly and it's wrong it's what Donald Trump does its ... vice president Pence does and this is what the person who wants to be the next senator from Massachusetts does know\nAnything further all move on\nYou know I think Senator Warren again continues to talk about Donald Trump and vice president Pence because this is what she's all about making sure that everybody knows she wants to go to the White House she doesn't care about your how she cares about the White House that's what Senator Warren keeps trying to hammer home\nBrief response here he represents you directly this is just ugly Donald Trump is ugly on this topic\nThe vice president it's ugly on this topic and Jeff deal with ugly on this topic I'll give you ten seconds or so if you want\nYou know the president has made it clear that he supports the LDP taking community as as well as I Do this is a law that has a flaw in it and that's why I'm against\nIt All right I Do want to move on and and let's stay on the subject of law I'm you'll start for senator\nRachel Rawlings the Democratic nominee for Suffolk County district attorney has stirred up some controversy by lifting a series of crimes including shoplifting malicious destruction of property and\nDrug possession within tend to distribute that she would not prosecute as da ... instead of by her account to save money and ease the court system logjam by close\nDiverting those cases to services to get them help or some sort of restitution and quote viewer Patrick wrote in to ask is she right or wrong was born one minute so\nThink that what she's trying to do is to say let's get realistic about how these low level crimes are actually you know how they're used to try to manage people and how in some cases\nThey actually just make poverty a crime people who can't afford for example to be able to post bail and therefore end up incarcerated over voter offenses that most of the time would just be thrown out I wanted to say that I don't know if she has the details right yet I think she's still working on it\nBut I think she's doing the right thing she's trying to ask the right questions about our criminal justice system\nShe's asking what makes us safer and what makes communities work better and I support her in those effort you know I'm a we have drug courts now for example here in Massachusetts and\nThat means we've taken people who legally have offended to have broken the law and said we're going to divert them and we're going to put them somewhere else\nPerson and better for the community thank you\nRepresentative deal one minute you know in Massachusetts we've actually pass some legislation criminal justice reform this last session or that I was in support of that does try to decriminalize\nCertain drug offenses we do have the drug courts we have a veteran chords for people who may have committed but shouldn't be come and go from an amateur criminal to a professional criminal and I understand what the\nAh Rachel ... is is talking about to an extent however the fact that she includes things like evading\nThe police officers as something\nThat she thinks should be decriminalized is wrong and I'm Glad we're talking about the criminal justice system because Senator Warren very famously in Louisiana said just a about a month or so ago that is the criminal justice system that is racist from front to back\nI'm wearing a PIN tonight from the Boston patrolman association the union that has endorsed me is never endorsed a Republican for the U.S Senate in their history because they understand that I have the support of them and Elizabeth Warren has made it clear\nThat she has a disrespect for law enforcement it does to the point where she actually wants to get rid of ice immigration and Customs Enforcement the people that work in partnership with Boston police and police unions across the state also endorsed me\nAnd it's gone so far with her rhetoric to actually have encouraged a Cambridge supporter of hers to put a five hundred dollar bounty on killing an ice officer that's how far it goes well\nWe have many dedicated many dedicated public servants in law enforcement and the court system on all the way through on Fort Smith does her role at work and I have supported then and supported them strongly\nBut there is a problem in the criminal justice system right now and it is a problem based on race study after study after study shows that African Americans compared with flights are more likely to be arrested more likely to be prosecuted more likely to be wrongfully convicted and more likely\nTo be given longer sentences that is a problem in the system and we need to deal with that problem and the only way we're going to deal with it is to have a hard conversation about what's\nOn so I Wish I could spend more time in Massachusetts to see that we have the lowest incarceration rate in the country next to Vermont we are solving a problem of trying to decriminalize and keep a people of all races out of jail and I think that it's working here in Massachusetts we have a ...\nWell it starts actually with the United States Congress in terms of what it is at the federal government levels that we make illegal and much of that all is something that we need to address directly what\nWant to talk about the safety of police officers\nI have just worked with the parents of slain police officer\nSean Gannon he was gunned down and his mom and dad Denise in Patrick worked with me on how it is that we can get done off our street weapons of war do not belong on our street we work together on better gun safety\nAnd it's something that would help our police officers and everyone else but your worst by the n._r._a. and you don't embrace any of those changes that we need to make our country safer\nOn guns you hadn't with all the law enforcement agencies that support me I think they know that my stand in the interest that lawful gun owners are not the problem the problem is we have people coming into our country that\nHas brought in drugs that are trafficking drugs I went on a gang unit right along in the city of ... where I talk to the officers they put their lives on the line every single day to try to get these drugs off the streets\nThey go into a house they get into a car with someone with guns with heroin and they are trying to get those drugs on the street then we have\nA state Senate that is trying to promote sanctuary status that would basically allow these people here illegally with guns with drugs to stay in our country and you promote open borders you promote sanctuary status and you want to get rid of ice the agency that identifies and deport those people here under cutting law enforcement\nI was just in Wayne at this morning we're officer checked into\nWho was murdered by someone who disarmed him with a rock\nTook his gun and kill them with rocks these law enforcement officers right now feel like if they use the force available to protect themselves or citizens around them they'll be the ones on trial and not the criminals are going after the criminals they are allowed into the country through your policy\nSo let's move to immigration but before we do I just want to be clear\nYour endorsed by the n._r._a. and one of the things that we help make our police officers safer and everyone else in the commonwealth of Massachusetts in this country or to put in some sensible done reforms that are supported by the overwhelming majority of people here in Massachusetts but you don't do that because the n._r._a. says no\nUnfortunately taking the risk of bringing families across now\nYou know I don't want people bringing their families across the border in dangerous situations I Want them to immigrate into our country legally when we have the temptation of an open border that's when these things happen if we secure that border then we make sure that the laws are followed and the people aren't put at risk go ahead sir\nNo one's supports an open border\nAnd in twenty Thirteen I voted for bipartisan legislation that would strengthen our border security I think that is a sensible thing to do it with a compromise and part of the compromise is that it said that are dreamers would have a path to citizenship\nThat people who are here for not documented will have a path to citizenship\nThat people are here on temporary protected status will have a path to citizenship that we will clean up the mess around our visas and make them work work for people work for families work for this economy it's a sensible approach and we have three introduced it we have pushed for it\nAnd repeatedly the Republicans have blocked it\nAnd Donald Trump after wealthy everybody near a deal last year walked away from it\nSo we need is we need an immigration system works and that means that has two parts to it if it is about our security but it is also about our values and when ice\nHere in Massachusetts goes after people show up to testify at a trial when they threaten people so that they want to report crimes when women are afraid to report domestic abuse because they're afraid someone in their family or one of their neighbors will be picked up by ice\nDoesn't make anybody any safer but we need is a system that makes us safer but that is consistent with our values\n... you know an ice in Massachusetts has done is they've taken forty nine members\nOf MS Thirteen and Lawrence off the streets who had enough ... to kill half the population of Massachusetts about a year ago we prosecuted about sixty one numbers of MS Thirteen gang in Boston somebody was killed just a few months ago on an east Boston beach that\nPerson was apprehended by ice and that's where we need to do allow them to do the job of identifying those criminals who are here illegally and committing crimes they're the ones that are keeping a straight saving you want to get rid of that agency wholesale briefly amount I Want to move on to\nThe this agency reformed because an agency that can't tell the difference in the risk between a seven year old girl between a woman going in for brain cancer surgery and a terrorist or a criminal is an agency that is not working is not making a safer and it sure does reflect our values\nI'd like to move on and squeeze in one last question for a debate concludes and you go first here senator\nAnd Thirteen Years since the last time Congress voted on money saving military base realignment enclosure round and pressure has been building for another round of it the late Senator John McCain was calling for one before she passed away\nDo you support or oppose or view well from what we're doing with our defense dollars even if it meant Massachusetts jobs might be at risk one minute please so\nYes I Am now on the Senate Armed Services Committee and one of the things that I have to ask for on the armed Services Committee repeatedly is that we actually do an assessment of the budget you know that\nIt's an amazing thing that threw out the rest of the budget [noise] we actually do the accounting to see if all the numbers add up if everything is accurate and yet with the military budget\nWe don't do that so half of our discretionary budget is basically right now on audited and only the other half of the budget is audited I have pressed hard for them I have\nI have worked on legislation on this and so far the department of defense has resisted and still not met their legal obligations for an audit of the defense department\nBudget psyche representative deal one minute I think any agencies state agency and certainly do fraud is making sure that we're spending our money correctly when I Lived a valid question in two thousand fourteen to stop the gas tax and going up automatically every year without a vote\nPeople than we need the transportation money or the bridges and roads have crumbled our bridges and roads are being fixed right now the fact was we weren't spending the money in the right places and so we proved that the money was being wasted we do need to make sure we look at those are the agencies like the department of defense however we also have\nIn Massachusetts for diamonds you know partially open now partially commercialized Weymouth naval air station is gone and is now being developed a privately we have Otis we at West over we have Westfield a air bases we need to make sure we retain our military bases that we have\nAnd also I Believe there was a potentially going to be an army uh insulation in Boston we weren't able to secure it was under one on the committee now\nThis is a unfortunately something where I think with her trying to basically go against the president at every turn she's never going to have a seat at the table in Washington that I can provide and in fact when he talked about military and talking about veterans this is also the same center that took one hundred and Thirteen Days to respond\nTo a veteran from low who had been contacting her office response\nSo one of the things we do very well here in Massachusetts is that we have a lot of research\nAnd I have been a strong proponents on the armed Services Committee for making sure that does research dollars go to our facilities here for example I was able to get a whole new building for a Lincoln laps it's going to be really important for the region or for the work that's done in Framingham\nFor the work that has come to make sure that the base up to a standards where it can handle a more aircraft and the like\nThis is important but what was the only thing is also important to me sitting on the armed services is the people\nAll three of my brothers were veterans and I take very seriously my responsibility to veterans I answer questions why office got back to the group that you're talking about that did that open letter and I got back to them ultimately personally\nBut here's the deal when we're talking about our veterans this is another problem we've got in government works for it works great for the giant contractors it's not working for our service members so one of the things I was able to get for it is that our National Guard\nWhich was there a promotions are approved we're taking long long periods in Washington months before the approval actually paying for it so they had to do the work even though they weren't getting the pay and they weren't getting the promotion and their jacket\nOur hair on the ground and I got the law changed on that and so our National Guard here in Massachusetts and all across the country it's not to have\nMore money more promotions faster about a minute left and you get it\nShort my grandfathers were both uh army veterans my uncle Vietnam army veteran I certainly respect the military and I certainly want to make sure that the soldiers\nThat have served our country put their lives on the line had the resources they need\nA factor they put everything out there for us tells me soldier home in Massachusetts has civil war era construction we need to update and help our health care system for veterans\nThere's not as many women practitioners serving in the VA is way more women serving in the military I Want to make sure we take care of them as well and so having a me down there with the the the table in Washington that senator why won't have basically being the main obstructionist in the Senate against the White House is going to be a big difference in what I can deliver\nWell that just leaves us wanting to see the next two debates candidates that's all our time thank you both very much for being here and that includes this evening's debate a quick reminder before we leave election day is Tuesday November ...\nPlease get out and cast your vote there watching count on our election coverage here on WB Cheney and TV thirty eight final thank you to the

B. C. news radio ten thirty with a new one never saw\nThat when you read the news time nine o'clock cloudy fifty four and Boston clouds from somebody breaks tomorrow traffic and whether together coming up good evening I'm don't hope nobody abusing news\nUm the uh that\nConversation again gave deal and opportunity to talk about Senator Warren staffers are in New Hampshire and other ... other ... presidential primary states\nIronically that question which started with the murder of ... and the ... in the consulate in Istanbul to Saudi constantly in his ... is the bull ended up talking about\nRelease of taxes um and and transparency a question three uh which uh started off the second round here uh in in in tonight's debate question three was a viewer question dealing with question three on the ballot or a yes vote would keep\n'em legal or the the requirements that had been passed which allows transgender individuals to\nUm basically use uh facilities depending upon how they perceive themselves a loose Warren says she will vote yes Jeff deal said no I'm basically again Warren condemned\nDeal a disgusting to vote no she then if it wasn't good enough to go after Donald Trump went after Mike Pence um accusing the vice president as states of stirring up hate you know again this this was what this was what was said I'm\n... from\nDeals perspective um again he used that as an opportune make the point that lives with why doesn't care about your house she cares about the White House then have a question for was talking about eliminating some prosecutions for some ... prosecutions for some crimes and it was sort of ...\nDo you agree or disagree or neither the me answer the question directly it was really a a a yes or no question\nI'm\nSenator Warren was much more open to it a ... and shift you're much more skeptical and the gave him an opportunity to raise the comment that list Warren had made about the ... the criminal justice system being racist from front to back\nI think on that issue that question a deal probably was the strongest of the night he\nAlso was very strong unquestioned five question immigration a in which Senator Warren talked about the failed efforts for immigration reform that she's been involved in by the Senate a deal on emphasized\nHis endorsement from the ice union and also the his endorsement for the Boston police union there was a question about base closings which kind of morphed into a conversation about the defense department budget an audience of the defense department budget and there wasn't much of a difference\nIn their answers both of them are in favor of auditing or every government agency I suspect that Elizabeth Warren would like to get to the defense budget I'm very quickly or in terms of style\nAs I said I'm Senator Warren appear to be the more aggressive which is interesting because she is the incumbent she seemed to be much more intense\nI don't think at any point during the debate did she even crack with someone to call a glimmer of a smile she was lecturing judgmental both of them very prepare to the issues deal relaxed\nA and I'm In a in a setting that that frankly\nWas his first people got their first impression of Jeff deal I think the one that debate um and\nI I tend to ... I I tend to try to try to be skeptical of my calls as I can be that's my take on it um I think if you like Liz warn you went into the debate you liking lives ruined it came out like English one if you went in\nPredisposed to Jeff deal or both of them did very well in terms of their constituencies\nBut I think that those in the middle if there are any in the middle and if there are any at this point who are undecided I'm Jeff deal will will do better I think that the the polls and the next few days will show that I Want to hear what you have to say six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty people have been on hold you\nThat's my take you don't have to agree with me at all you're more than welcome to join the conversation we'll talk about this for awhile tonight so if you're having a tough time getting in right now is because the lines are full I promise these lines will loosen up let's go to Jason in West Bridgewater Jason your first is are the central nice I caught a line hope you watched the debate love to know what you thought\nIf I can yes I did watch or they are one takeaway that I had from the debate was Elizabeth Warren claim that Jeff deal with an anti Muslim rally on April twenty second yes I thought that was bizarre and lie\nBecause I was the state chairman for the Massachusetts college Republicans and Jeff deal with at our convention that day he was not an anti Muslim around\nWell I don't know and he seemed to be perplexed by that as well I'm sure that the fact checkers are at Boston at the globe and the heroine will be checking on that I it's very easy to talk call any organization anything you want a she talked about I think was act for America I'm not familiar with that group to be really honest with you\nUm I don't know where Jeff deal was but let's sort that out um but I Can't imagine that Jeff deal would be at a group that would be actually anti Muslim could there be groups that have been characterized as anti Muslim because perhaps they are opposed\nTo some form of legal immigration or oh the oh they were they were in favor of the travel ban which of course Senator Warren characterized as a Muslim ban and it was not a Muslim ban again it's it's all however as a lawyer\nElizabeth Warren knows whoever frames the arguments frames the issue tends to win the argument but we'll find out Jason of again that twenty thousand a day maybe he was at another event as well I don't know\n[laughter] yeah well see I mean that our convention the whole day so it must be managed to squeeze out\nAt night say how long did did your convention last April twenty second she also was obviously she was well prepared she was she was fully for some papers at that point to try to read the date and the name of the group so she could have misread a date as well but how long was a representative deal as your conference that day\nI Believe here there for ... for ... it was a substantial part of the day we have our ah we have our agenda posted a Jeff he'll campaign posted it on their Twitter catcher in the air here as well as the agenda\nOkay well we'll we'll certainly try to to fact check this as well I'm sure that others will be fact checking it ... I assume as young Republican you probably felt deal did pretty well and I\nI think he did phenomenal I think that his priorities are straight I think that he's focused on the people in Massachusetts and I was ... Warren has reiterated time and time again she after Trump she's after tense but she's not sticking up for the people in Massachusetts and that's what it boils\nDown to she's running against Donald Trump and Mike Pence but but they're not on the ballot or this this November So they will be on the ballot and twenty twenty so maybe should get a chance to run against them that this could be exactly or a dress rehearsal hey Jason thank you so much for the call appreciate it\nOf course thank you have a great night six one Seventy five or ten thirty Tripoli nine to nine ten thirty and we'll just take them as they can we do not screen out calls here if you however you saw this debate let us know let's go to David in ... David you hello David you're next on the ring central\nNice I'm not sure that they\nDon't get the knock it out a pack a day a warrant made so many attacks on Donald Trump it showed that she had no no understanding of any any agricultural educational labor issue is nothing like that at all\nWell I'm sure she as understandings of those issues David you might disagree with her understanding of those issues I think by focusing so much on Donald Trump I think it re re raises reinvigorated the whole question she's been getting some criticism from Democrats [noise] that\nAh it's not now the time to have released a DNA test results by the way the DNA question was mentioning parents ethically early on and that was it uh many people expected that to be a dominant issue it was not tonight or that is that is for sure [noise] um ... that went right by the boards early on\nI had a command of the facts you know the names of the time basis in that state he knew so many other looking more information and I was really prepared she she could do is to wind during when Donald Trump heard me Donald\nTrump there just aren't trying to get that\nA lot of what I I tried to keep counted dimensions of Donald Trump I\nCan't ... I lost count it has to be at least over two dozen mentions of Donald Trump by Senator Warren alone that's for sure David appreciate Scott thank you much\nUsually well come down and\nHave a great and I keep listening tonight side six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty all points of view are welcome here\nI'm sure that there are people who agree and people who disagree would take a very quick break coming right back on night side will handle as many callers as we can all you have to do is call in and we'll talk with you [noise]\nNight side with Dan re a news watch never stops W.

good bait and I'm Jeff that's all I have to say\nWell short and sweet me to the point um I I thought it was an excellent debate um I really did a and I figured that reflected well in Massachusetts to\nVery prepared candidates I thought this stylistically deal came off them much more poised much more relaxed and frankly much more senatorial\n\nI think the real quick was about the borders and you know how she's for sanctions you're letting the illegal and all that\nWell I'm not going to all my brothers they explained to suit up by a go let's go to Steve Down in Freetown sitting down and play in this county I think Steve how are you a free towns in Plymouth counties and not know factory and lift because it was pretty close so what was your to act tonight's debate\nUm I got to tell you I was kind of confused on two points one my wife cynical and order on um a teamster and um I had a hard time understanding that once you start a little while and was talking about the tax plan um my wife and I getting up an extra hundred and twenty five dollars a week and I pay right\nAct the act but I I don't understand more\nAbout that well maybe your ... you must be like the the one percent I guess Steve\nOh yeah we're the ones that are I and the other thing is I'm I'm going to be I'm going to be honest with you Dan of immigration is a is a big issue to me ah unfortunately my mother I'm twenty five years ago was hit by an illegal immigrant ... and I like to say that on a Sunday Morning at believing church\nShe was jumping rope but my son and I'm not following through the day or she didn't walk for very long ever again she spent the next Twenty years of her life\nIn a wheelchair and the nursing home because of an illegal immigrant\nYeah and and you know that in a ... weeks who are in favor of ... of illegal immigrants who say well she could have easily been been run over by an American too I mean that's that's what they'll tell you\nYes and they they said that I mean many times are hard to\nTell me that on the job because of local talk radio some of the people who I Am in ... and it it kind of bugged me I'm the person working here and it was the second time this have been caught drunk driving first high ... caught it brought back into Central Falls you'd be back\nIn Central Falls on the second time when he hit my mother at one o'clock in the afternoon when she was leaving at sixty sixty two years old well look I I Am kinda jaded on that I didn't understand it myself\nWhile understandably so Steve\nYeah we get the next Twenty years taking care of her as much as we could all because of because of our job taking her out of out of the nursing home it can be whether or not I I'm very um I don't understand how anyone can talk about eating meat gets a difference between legal and illegal\nImmigration and they have no problem with that Steve you nailed it and and by the way a cage Stanley the guy that killed her had been deported five times so they were too many of these cases Steve I Want to get one more in before the hours up thank you so much for your call and keep calling the show\nAt a good evening to sleep every night let me go next to going to get a poly in him\nOh you an extra nice girl had you're going to be our first ...\nI Can't thank you for taking my call sir and saying hello to Jeff deal in person I was one of the many that worked with him in the grass roots are made that he led that successfully repealed the gas cat forever guy said there's no question as substance style preparedness\nFacts being fought the people of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl\nIs our man I Want to also expressed that I Am severely disappointed and John Keller number one Elizabeth Warren was like a ball that got let out of the gate at a rodeo her prime mission with to attack and negatively frame\nI'm Jeff deal that should've been stopped she kept interrupting him and that should have been stopped and I feel they were so many issues pertinent to Massachusetts that shift deal has worked tirelessly on\nThat Elizabeth Warren has not been involved in that are that that I'm\nHighly ... said a lot in a minute I'm up all my ten o'clock break and therefore I I got to let you go let me just to send John it's uh I Know John very well I\nWould have been more uh I probably would have been tougher on the list with war but\nI think overall he's a really good job tonight and um basically what you see is what you get let's see if the voters see at the same way okay\nLet's ... thank you\nProbably have a great now we're going to keep on this dial now six one Seventy five or ten thirty AAA nine to nine to thirty we'd get Stephen brain St Vincent and lo and room for you\nKnow the Salem on the front of gentleman's reads on Pickering warm fuzzy sophisticated waterfront destination ... and for business travelers book today Salem waterfront hotel dot com and then they're gone\nAdjust a deal in my opinion much more relaxed or he also was much more restrained and in stride and uh she was deal was restrained but deal made his points and I felt that it on style anybody who watched that debate particularly the watched it for them if they ... this was the first exposure or the first look\nAt Jeff deal I think you come away with a pretty positive viewpoint now again Warren supporters are going to see it as as Warren a victory and I think the deal supporters will see it as a deal victory\nWhatever whoever you might support or however you might feel you are welcome to call the show and joining the conversation six one seven to five or ten thirty Tripoli nine to nine is\nThe number all points of view or accepted a and allowed to make whatever point you want\nA I've made my um my judgment on it I'm sure the Boston Globe of drew ... drew it will view it quite differently tomorrow\nUm but that's okay I I Would expect nothing I'm I'm speaking as a commentator but I'm also speaking as a journalist who's trying to look at this with a journalist I N who\nPerformed better in that set of circumstances again her Elizabeth Warren stride and see did not serve her well tonight there was not even a moment where I thought she smiled\nClearly she did what she wanted to do I think Jeff did what just deal did what he wanted to do but again from ... in stylish style of these debates there were equal substantively neither one of them the only gas that I\nHeard was when Warren accused dealer being some sort of an anti Muslim really I have no idea what she's talking about we're still trying to research that for you let's get to the ... six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty\nTake as many points of view as possible particularly if you all the calls that I hadn't been for Massachusetts if you happen to watch this debate or the state you can weigh in as well even if you're not a voter well we're going to go first off to Stephen ... how are you tonight [noise]\nHey good evening how are you good what's your take on this um the ice off\nKnow who she is paying as her campaign manager or political consultant but she needs to get a refund a bad strategy or who advised her that was a good idea it was shocking like she she came up to the challenger\nIt's how she looked not the person who was already in a senatorial seat she she looked terrible\nShe's in that house in the driver's seat in his in his state that has a deep blue state uh and and it almost sounds to me is if\nShe must see some poles which are causing her some concern I I don't know he's not\nCampaigning that's the problem she had on the campaign were now two weeks out and and she's not campaigning I see no signs out you see very few ads she's she's taken for granted and I think what you saw what would that thirty point Paul is ridiculous like cut that\nEasily and half the w._b. ... from September and if you were to Fifteen point lead now you just gave up you've probably you're looking at about seven to eight point swing based on that performance tonight he could've cut into that thing he can be down around eight or nine points by the time the system because there's another one on Sunday and she'd better\nYou know she'd better figure out that her main problem it's likeability or she is not a popular figure in this state so you know you're not going to get independent if they can't find a reason to like you know and there was nothing there to\nTo really like with the way that she came off message we get the same thing all the time we get it the one percent and like that caller a couple of calls ago the Teamsters Union guy is seeing more money in his pocket and an accountant to his wife as being more money than who is that you're talking about and they never have\nSpecific people they have these amorphous terms that only helps the rich her message\nIs try it if it's two thousand sixteen it's Hillary Clinton it's failed it didn't work the last time I I just don't know where she's going with this I don't know what are your campaign is about to be honest with you\nIt was funny I there was one point it it's also I think she she doesn't come across in my view in my view genuine she's an academic from Oklahoma who taught in law school which is great OK doesn't mean that she's any smarter than you roommate\nUm she has an expertise in in banking law which I Will acknowledge but when she says she talked with rupee down at patties bar\nI Would love to know how many times she has actually been in patties bar or how many Times She's been in any situation where she talked with someone like Ruth ... I mean it just sounded\nShe she knew a wine and cheese ... shafts every job let's be honest now that I'm On now I should say the Idaho\nSo she she titled Ruthie down it patties bar now if you could have picked two names\nThat would probably be more stereotypical okay Ruthie at patties bar I mean I\nDon't think so maybe you\nShould have maybe we did the data to testify Irish blood I [laughter]\nI don't know that God so I was as a deal supporter and again I'm trying to bend over about oh I'm looking at\nThis I was just looking at the debate I was planning to vote for deal because I don't care about the but the whole Dunkin donut rays of I I legitimately only listen to it on this day on your station but I ... when he was looking at and I was shocked to taken aback\nWith the whole demeanor just that came to the radio she was just you know a pit bull on things that she didn't even need to be a pit bull on it and the repetition of Donald Trump that's going to get you exactly what you have the support in the state it's not going to get the independent I I just don't know\nShe'll she'll she's going can we just clarify and maybe you can help me is she definitely almost that Donald Trump safe [laughter]\nEven think she hates my pets I don't know anyone that guy in the world all the stuff is a is a sneaky little devil they'll go out and drive a couple\nOf numbers to remember it two thousand dollars in a presidential year\nPresident Obama a defeated a a Ben candidate former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney I think it was sixty three to thirty seven okay you're began almost by thirty points yeah\nVery significant victory she beat Scott Brown I think it was fifty three to forty seven so there were a lot of bright well in this state who um who voted for President Obama did not vote for Elizabeth Warren and I I don't know I mean she's clearly the favorite\nUm she should be the favorite but I don't think she helped with her performance tonight\nI take it out in the Sunday\nShe really needs to come back sometimes otherwise he could have this thing like I said between seven and eight points going into a week and a half ago and and if he has any momentum she's going to actually come out here and campaign I kinda thought that they'd have to think a little money into this race I'm surprised they haven't\nWell as the as you know it it's it's the independence that will decide this race it's the independence well what do you know Democrats too\nIf if the polls start to don't don't be surprised if you get a little ... as a Schumer thing he just sunk three million at the end of the campaign in New Jersey and other blue state don't be surprised if a week and a half ago maybe a week to go you know you start seeing similar but Lauren ads because she's running a little bit scared and you start seeing some money infused here wasn't shocked me\nWell if you see that then you know again you know that that that's been some kind of you and I think\nShe looks she looks scared tonight for them on the night\nShe must be seeing something or his campaign must be seeing something in the polls she went to the knockout tonight and I think she shot herself in the foot at least tonight I'm going to let you go thank you Steve Lewis' say but I have\nA great night six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple a nine to nine ten thirty points if I Want to hear from sworn supporters who really think Warren\nDid well so far we haven't heard from you I'm maybe they exist maybe they don't exist feel free I'm not gonna give you a hard time I want to hear as many points of view as possible I also went over to the busy box office here and give you a chance to win a pair of tickets to see hairspray the irresistible few good show guarantee W dancing the night away\nThat shows live on stage at bill ... music theater from October thirtieth through November eleventh you got to be caller number ten\n... ten six one Seventy nine three one ten thirty you want to buy tickets for schedules and Showtime visit and his empty dot org great venue and it's a it's a great price so be calling their pretended he got the two pair of tickets six one seven nine three one ten thirty the phone lines are already lining up coming back on nights I'd [noise]\nNice side with Dan re news watch never stops W.

watching it on\nTV and you'd be amazed at how many people are interested in\nSenator Warren uh I'm trying to be as respect for that kind of Manchester showrooms jail because she's a very powerful senator and incredibly outside of Massachusetts\nI dare say she's the most popular senator outside around state now in the state\nI shake her popularity is not [noise] I don't like her but she is a you know gone to potty lodge she's got that showed up however Dale is really working and he's doing well with the independence from what I've gathered\nAnd that's my surprise election\nYou never will

I I\nAm I Am I right 'cause that's all\nI can go for ... for anybody but it goes down says that they are the panel out so on and on um\nI I I\n...\nMy understanding and I I think I'm correct here my understanding is that early voting in Massachusetts begins on Monday October twenty seconds so that would not this coming Monday now before you haven't found before you go down to the switch town hall Linda\nI Would ask you to make a call a Monday morning I think I'm right I'm going to try to Google it now here and find out\nBut I also would make sure particularly if that's going to be the first day that they're ready for you don't want you going down the town hall and not being able\nI ended up on stage so they sold them on our lives that yeah you should get out of town hall\nOr call on Monday or say his early voting underway they may have I don't know as much about this as I should uh I don't know\nIf the early voting is from nine feet to for a nine to five or if it's limited during the day uh I have\nA finite planet at that time how about that and I hadn't gotten at ... or ... ... um I was saying I Want a lot of ...\nI I Can't do it on our land for guys that I I I ... ... ... ... ...

where are you OK show locations in dates early voting begins on Monday Night at eight AM and it's open in the last seven PM and is your let me ask you this is your town\nHall forum were located at

eight nine to nine ten thirty is a real night\nWhen we get to eleven fourteen and our first caller from out of state we have Chris in Connecticut Chris welcome how are you today [noise] very well are you good are you a Connecticut residents or are you a Massachusetts resident traveling through Connecticut\nWell I was the Massachusetts residents Phil\nShow twenty four gene registered Democrat and I this is a topic for a different night but I think I could still vote\nIn Massachusetts if I wanted to never let me off the role even though I've been out of state for years I guess if you're a Democrat you can vote your whole life Massachusetts\nWow that they should clean those rules that that that's what they're supposed to do so so ... did did you get a chance to listen or see any of the debate tonight\nI guess my point is that following its appointed to the debates\nDon't have more nuance because the whole issue it's important to me is going to control and it seemed like Elizabeth Warren unfortunately\nLost her mind again and just talk about Donald Trump which could have your own and by having a more nuanced discussion about gun control and\nIt just turned out to be black and white about an hour a support and it's just this appointee strong like\nWe'll never have a really good wants discussion about that issue\nIs she gets so stocks are you trying to be left to go off the chew the opportunity to focus and really attack your own it you know just Scott's a you know\nNot everybody wants somebody's going to get away from legally ... there's some of the laws that he doesn't support but\nI think could've helped her viewpoint it she just\nAnother blown opportunity so it's very disappointing\nWell you know Chris you're a very intelligent and sophisticated person because you're looking for some nuance and I'm and I say that with ... with complete honesty um but I think what happens is the political consultants on both\nRepublicans and the Democrats tell their candidates kiss keep it simple stupid and I think that they all do that they want to all talk in soundbites and make those points and I think that's a mistake for voters like you\nWho are looking for some ... some just a more complete and several inches sophistication is what's new ones is what you're talking about\nThis shit you slide into just a\nParty line she's not president so counterpoint I didn't know the other owners or the debate but what's on the radio came across very good\nI totally disagree with them would at least so if I was voting and wouldn't vote for him but ah you know she's just not for me\nSo oil okay so what do you do in a situation like that okay so you sound to me like you're a Democrat\nAnd you're not happy with Elizabeth Warren if you were in Massachusetts and you go to the polls than you what what would you do\nHold your nose and vote or would you blanket\nWell I you know again and that's the most important issue to me I greatly affected by each town and other events and uh\nI'd have to vote for but uh [laughter] like what a lot of politicians their personalities are very negative and\nUh I just wish there were better leaders to communicate which I think are very important issues\nWell you know it's it's great when you agree with a candidate and then you also find that Kennedy him or her to be likeable\nA and for those of us who call for those of us who liked Ronald Reagan he was really likeable guy okay ah he didn't have a a a nasty edgy about him I think he was tough don't get me wrong\nAnd at the same time I think that there were people at the Democratic than the Democratic party who liked Bill Clinton now with the bit of a role in all of that\nBut he likeable Elizabeth Warren is not electable person per se and Donald Trump or is not a likeable person per se and it's funny that they're both so kind of I think the the the flip side of the same coin\nAbsolutely I agree with you that but those are different generations the Ronald Reagan's uh that civility on and uh\nIt it really doesn't serve them because they seem to be president to really address anything they just\nLike we we we got it all up for the for the good of the country we going to get that civility back I did a debate\nA couple of weeks ago week and a half ago now a demand scoot along with\nOh with politics today that it it it was it really infuriated me\nWell the thing let me just so people know where we are talking about the current secretary of the army's got any mark Esperanza yeah educated West Point a he has a a degree from Harvard University and also a doctorate from George Washington he was an active duty military guy who was involved in the first Gulf War\nOr he won the ...\nHe was honored with or received no you ... I always say the wind is they they received a legion of merit the bronze star the ... the department of defense metal for this thing was public service\nOr the vote was Ninety three to sex and the only six who voted against him right Bernie Sanders ... in\nThe um senator Kamala Harris from California senator Merck Merkley or who is from Oregon and then Markey and Warren\nThis guy oh what works for Raphael and he was a a vice president of government relations for rape you know which is a big this big company here in Massachusetts yeah there you go it was nice my sure probably only my show that you will have heard that on\nYeah I I\nI I like your show by the way a great deal I mean I don't listen to all the time but every time I Do um I really love listening to it and I'm actually\nIn in regards to the the debate uh I kinda wish you were the moderator and and that John killer um I saw was was too partisan a torch was this and that's just my\nJoy at Johns drugs in a tough spot there um and and again John is is a real gentleman and he is very deferential\nUh I think I Would be deferential as well but I don't think that the Warren campaign would have wanted me as a moderate I wouldn't be fair and ah yeah I must say that I Would end up ... I did\nA debate in two thousand town with Charlie bigger develop Patrick and Tim Kaine all um and you know I I I can do on my it was a reporter for a long time John in television and I was most\nHonored when people would say to meet you watch on TV all these years I have no idea what your politics are\nDoing a talk show I get to in a matter of fact I'm obligated doing a talk show to be honest and express my opinions Yeah John appreciate school you know we're going to be ... not too far from you at ... college next Wednesday night\nFor a talk the boat and we will be ... we will be having a conversation we don't call it debate for an hour from eight to nine or\nWith not only congressman Seth Moulton who's the Democrat incumbent I Believe from your district\nA but also a gentleman named Joseph Schneider who's the Republican they both ironically had very very impressive military records and um we appreciate the fact that a lotta times incumbents duck those sorts of events but I think the\n... yeah I was a marine and a lot of us way back when I mean you know so far Iraq that well that's about all\nThose reports say John I hate to do this you great for okay do you continue called if if you happen to get to edit ... next Wednesday the twenty fourth please come stop and say hello again ... eight to nine eight o'clock will be the case you ours um we're right on Wednesday night the twenty fourth\n... joined talk to you again and have a great now that\nI uh I enjoy that a new color I'm not a new listen nobody knew color six one Seventy five or ten thirty Tripoli nine to nine ten thirty were heading in the home stretch here for the first time again we got a couple of open lines if you want to get in will get you in right now what was your reaction to the debate tonight the calls\nAlmost overwhelming we had been extraordinarily insightful and I want to hear from you and I'm looking for some people in the ... thinks she really did well tonight I think she played to her base very well\nBut I don't know that that was her most important function tonight I think the base the word base will remain solvent I don't think Jeff deal will pick up any votes amongst committed warned voters I'm not sure she played adequately to\nUh the independence to folks who are actually going to decide this election six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty\nAnother week of night side is coming quickly to a close please feel free to join the conversation [noise]\nNice side with Dan re a news watch never stops W.
