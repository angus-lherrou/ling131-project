that I feel that feels that he's not kill the is that while this lady took a long time in coming forward and one can understand why\nIf you look at other people who have been found guilty along the way they were\nYou know a green and you know that they were paid off other people will pay off\nThat they were on the plane and not know quaint and high school\nYou know right away a lot of those agreements where with members of Congress that you and I paid for back dragged disclosure agreements I Want to see a list of those payments I don't want to see who the money was paid to I didn't want to invade anyone's privacy but I like to know what how much money was spent on behalf of center is so and so and congressman so and so\nHow long until we never will find out\nIf I get ill so I feel so bad to this person because anybody can just open up a can of war and it's like he did and I don't think she's long but if anybody will continue to do this to me thirty five years ago\nAnd the man has had a hint of anything and so so the idea that people came forward and everybody said something happened in high school but we did anything about his twenties or thirties or forties and\nYou're right we've been told that generally when people engage in this type of behavior or they they do it on a serial basis they can't help themselves\nRight and on and [noise] you know and I and I do feel sounds something could happen but I don't take it with him and fulfill a\nCenter city we get you down as a yes\nGood and I hope I really hope he gets into\nParenthood will notice that well maybe they may have to put it off because this is one senator herd up which is understandable so having a Monday I mean let's I Want to make sure everybody has their all hundred senators who should be a

hit that hey that's okay well do we got to give it to you know maybe not they're not ...\nWell I Would I Would vote no and it has nothing to do with the allegations that has to deal with is a wide view of that could have power and there's a case coming up I Can't recall the name before the Supreme Court about not\nBeing able to try that one on state charges and federal charges and she seemed like he would support that and I just think is\nThe ... the power that they that get a branch are just wait till it than that but I did not support him from the beginning\nWell let me let me I don't know that that particular case but let me run some that have\nThat case what was the case that to do with um it it's a\nIt's either one of the court said that tail or coming up before the Supreme Court and you know and he said that um you know he changed his mind after ... when the president said even be investigated and I think that getting way too bad that like the ... broke away from England it gets\nThey didn't want dictatorial monarchy all hours\nOh no absolutely no one is that why so let me ask you I Know that may be that if\nI can let me try if I can just to get a little conversation going here on this because I Want to make sure when you tell me this case beer had they'd cases and ... and let me do you remember the Rodney King case in in California\nOh well I I ... and I saw that and now I only happened was there was a good\nThat's good just going to try to give you some information because it's it's interesting and it might apply to what to do this case you're talking about\nSo Rodney King was a I'm an African American or black gentleman who was involved in some sort of a police chase a and when the police the all white police officers caught him um he gonna he was beaten up um and he was um\nHe was really a pummeled and the case was tried in a local court I think it was down in California and the officers if I recall correctly were acquitted and then civil rights charges were brought in federal court and\nThere were some convictions and that's a case where the sort of a a dual\nA responsibility both federal and state law correction yeah some argued at the time the debts double jeopardy that by this guy had been acquitted and now he's being tried the second time is that the type of case that you're talking about\nThis ... yeah on it I Believe it's similar but it's saying that um that yeah that someone can't shouldn't be charged on federal and state charges and I'm I'm a maverick calling it that detail but I'm the report that added rating on\nAnd said that it that it can be used as a way for someone like Paul Manafort it could be a part in on federal charges cannot be tried by the state\n[noise] also accepting boats\nMotorcycles

it's going to happen pretty quickly and rescue all of you to assume the role of the United states senator and tell me how you vote is Europe if you were on the line and want to tell me why that'd be great to Steve is in Wellesley Steve welcome next on nights I'd how are you\nBegan thanks for taking my call my yes I Would vote for cat without a heartbeat you know what's sad all these people leave some people are all left they hate his guts they hate Trump Scott's he kept it a lot things he did nothing wrong with\nI think that he's a decent guy so eight drinks barreling through some ice\nThey hate us what do you think\nWell I I tend to agree with you I think that there were people who said that they were going to be opposed to whomever\nA President Trump nominated he nominated a guy who is a ... a creature of the Bush political machine this is not a Trump bite or this guy worked in the Bush White House he was just pointed to the circuit court of appeals the second highest quarter the wind by George Bush in two thousand and six he is a\nI think one of the mold of a John Roberts than Clarence Thomas [laughter] um [noise] no no no Clarence Thomas was appointed by a Bush forty one but I I don't think this was this was a fire breathing conservative uh although a lot of my liberal friends will disagree I'm\nAn NBA at one point when Obama was destroying the country and the race baiting down south with alec colder we didn't go short people at softball games flattening papal Maxine Waters and telling people they have no business being air because we had different says\nWell I mean the guy the guy that ... that shot I'm Steve ... at the ... he was a nut job okay and are there had been incidents the the woman who was run down in Charlottesville, Virginia by a nut job\nBut when you have members of Congress like telling Maxine Waters to confront people then you have members of the U.S Senate who had dinner with their family or and they're they're forced to leave restaurants that's way over the line that\nAll yeah Daniel absolutely right I mean what what are we coming to is it got to be a civil war in this country\nWell hopefully not a civil war like we had in the Eighteen sixties but I think we're so separate now it's almost like we are two countries that there's a ... yeah ... that's not good for any of us\nKnow it's not Dan hey thanks for taking my call I'm Still a lesson\nThanks to keep listening right now we're going to go next to where we're going to go to bill is in Pembroke we lost Roberta there I Hope she comes back bill in Pembroke hey bill how are you tonight\nOr are you doing that couldn't\nBe better which would you vote on this uh if you were a senator US Senator tomorrow built\nSo I I think God would have said no you got to know and I'm\nA I'm I'm saying I'm definitely independent or a cat or a Democrat um the the thing that\nProbably um [noise] was\nMost going [noise] want to point um [noise] ... um got her fired and he portrayed himself as a you know a a good old boy I mean I'm not a\nHow is classmate really portrayed about um\nAcross the board on and he said listen guys I I'm part is our party than in high school\nArt party in college but I never went to the point Tom I lost control and um\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas that was that was a fender bender uh small claims court okay it it was it was ...\nBut now you're now you're in Washington and you'll be accused of being a gang rape is I I if you could have well here's a you'd ... you'd be a better man than I if you could say well it's\nDefinitely got to be a better man than you or me or is it being considered for the Supreme Court and if he can't handle on self under those circumstances that that's what concerns me\nI Would have been equally concerned or maybe even more concerned if when they asked him about this he said you know in a monotone said no I must\nTell you I never was engaged in gang rape I'm not a serial rapist than if\nWell eight now he wasn't accused of rape was ... and have caught the woman that woman but she wasn't rape or she no no no\nBut there was a third or the steps swept Nick swept me or\nSaid that he\nMocked judge had been involved in parties tend parties they spiked to punch and were lined up outside the door in a gang rape so uh she she never got a uh she never testified because I think she was off the wall\nBut that was the sort of allegations swirling around and I I think that\nThat I think would would rightfully justifiably upset\nMost anybody but I think it ... you got to you you probably have kept your composure in that case and I'm Glad you did and it says that well that has any like\n... ... ... ... in terms of composure I mean\nHe should have known better I think um I mean he he's a professional lawyer it a lot of experience he's got good qualifications in terms of the professional qualifications okay uh and uh but this is just conjecture all of course because I think he's going to get confirmed and I'm\nThe only thing that was the main thing that worries me he made a statement about what comes around goes around like I'm going to get even with you guys when I when I when I'm On the Supreme Court\nI Do I Do I didn't read it that way I think have you ever heard people say karma I didn't hear what they mean by karma\n...\nWell you know what they mean by that is I interpret it is that if\nIt if it is I treat you treat someone badly yeah that is actually somewhere down the um the line will be in a position where someone would treat us ... that's ... that's the interpretation I did not get it all a sense of him saying oh I get an interview in front of the Supreme Court\nYou're in trouble I didn't get that sense of that kind of like just a warning that that in the uh in in the entire atmosphere in which we all are floating around here on this little or called Mother Earth\nThere if we're if if we take advantage of people maybe they'll come a time when someone will take advantage of it that's what I think they mean by calm but anyway but anyway it was oh ... ... call great call thank you so much\nThank you thank great

when you first um heard of that nomination or were you inclined to\nSupport him or or not\nWell not after I heard all the details so I don't know I Know I Know you can't ... now\nThat I Know you came out like I I you came out as a no but I'm Wondering if when he first was nominated what was your initial instinct\nMy initial instinct was the guy was a decent guy until I heard what a what a real creep somebody who spiced up punching rapes women as a ... well that will not beyond Supreme Court\nThat was in Alex ... first of all that that one now we're now we're in um ... the third allegation um that\nThat I Know I Know but I I was there and I can tell when I tell my my swimmers by\nMy my hat race than what I heard him you know lying on on the stand those it was ... have you ever been

defense witness or what what did you get to\nAll of them all the above that doesn't matter\nWhat oh so you're okay but here's your kid events again you're not even given him the idea of allegation here you're convinced this guy's a rapist ales spike the guilty\nHe's a guilty man he should not be on the Supreme Court no way to if I was surprised even though even though I'd order I'm an independent so yeah I Do hope that I I kinda like Trump out I was I was pleased to hear the unemployment rate today was was was awesome so as I Want a good job in some way but rough and\nThat's our

don't blame them okay and I hit my only you know if you go to other countries you'll see leaders have their way with women\nAnd not only find ways to raise a bottle we should follow the standards of other countries that's\nNo no no no I Want to go back to the punch\nYou'll go spike in the punch post something\nVulgar or offer rough President Trump will get his way to make sure I was trying to figure out how you distinguish between\nThe allegation which is unproven that he's spiked the punch and the ... I Know you do Eddie ... allegation that he spike the punch and that he engaged in a gang rapes plural against\nThe president's own words on the bus and the fact that well let me do I know it was and I don't I'm not a\nSet of problems but I Do I I I'll tell you look at it I I think that ... has it just respects law he lied under oath and that's wrong\nOn my bike by we'll see you later okay I have a great night grabbed that I Hope six one seven to five for ten thirty triple a nine to nine ten thirty\nMike ... a ... dropped a bad word that's why my ... with us any longer has got nothing to do with his viewpoints although I really enjoyed\nThe comparison and they were comparing and contrasting six when seven to five or ten thirty AAA die tonight ten thirty were tied up here at our votes yes and no is this close here as it might be in the U.S Senate back a night side up to this\nNight side with Dan re news watch never stops W.

in high school where it is pretty much even though it was playing sports and stuff\nYou know pretty much on the right now well you know what I I I get it but I got to tell you know\nHe he said he work at a safe way she rat and thinking about what the idea you were in a safe way\nIt'd be already graduated this attack that happened in Nineteen eighty two I'll tell you it was all back back\nDated and

time listeners since Larry click days\nAll my I'm not a very yeah it's not a very often color but I just have to call in\nI'm Glad you tell us what you're saying thank\nYou I'll tell you I think that\nUh Kavanaugh was an unfortunate choice I think Trump could have made a better choice and this has nothing to do with the allegations against them mhm\n[noise] I been watching the hearings and I did not like his demeanor because I feel that he feels that it's oh him just like Hillary felt the election was owed to her he feels like he you know I worked my tail off and now it's my turn\nAnd I feel also that he's a little bit of political hack can he lacks the demeanor the temperament nothing to do with allegations I wouldn't vote for him now because the Democrats are playing so dirty like Schumer said he will do everything to stop whoever Trump point\nSo anyways so you just signed that we will budget Jon Tester load here because all of a sudden you just shocked me you've gone from sounds to me like ... to maybe yes\n[noise] I don't I think Trump could have done better\nOkay with a better choice I Would have preferred at different candidates because I really don't like having all the other hand I think you can to let the Democrats get away with the dirty trick I eat I eat a I don't think I'm eating is what\nDr Ford said happy I don't think that is a reason for him not as a woman\nI joke that the reason why you should not win confirmation so let me have a let me\nLet me ... okay I got a Sarah let me call to vote are you going to be your it's time for senator salary from Pennsylvania\nUltimately when all is said and done are you a yes or no [noise]\nI'm going to have to be a yet and hold my nose because okay but what happened and the terms that I cannot left the Democrats put in\nA real quick question because of fascinated did you have a specific candidate in mind that you would have voted for who who who did you would have wanted to nominate\n[noise] I'll tell you I didn't do very much research but I was talking to one of my children and one of my sons told me there was a woman very religious conservative judge\n... a barrel and Amy Barrett has was her name yeah\nYes and he thought that she would be a much better justice\nAll right we've got you know our do me a favor come back to\nCrack coming against a woman it would be much more difficult for them to bash a woman\nAll they would have gone after Amy Barrett very easily because she is adamantly pro life right\nYeah so that's that's worth that it's a sad state of affairs on his way to pick somebody out\nBut I Would vote for him because of Schumer and all their dirty tricks I've been watching it and it's just been driving me\nCrazy I'm assuming you voted for Trump in two thousand sixteen [noise] I did I did I Do not regret it one day I'm no that's fine I'm not I just I I like to do the sort of it's a mini focus group for me I Love to pick people's brains and try to figure out where

the real deal medical roofing\nFrom Ninety nine dollars a month\nDue to loan roofing dot com I can get free Medicare informational seminar with Blue Cross Blue Shield of math to register ... eight hundred to two blue group ... science seminar\nNow within that context there's many many issues so let's put aside you know I Would vote yes for Kavanaugh right but given the events that took place and the drama that took place it brings up many other issues about this entire should the me too movement\nFalse accusations what is innocent until proven guilty et cetera and what I find interesting is a number of the talk show people who are today supporting Kevin those same people attempted to destroy me or how we are being one of them as you know or people\nLike that again when I when I really would like to do I want to focus on you yeah that's what I'm Talking about on this show and if there are other people that you've had a problem with it and I don't need to I don't want to litigate that here because this is nice I Would then right and I hope you understand right so\nLet's not use people's names but the issue of\nUm one of the issues that brings up an Dan is there are things like laws are applied in different ways to different classes of people\nUm [noise] there are people for example who are sexually assaulted people um who get away with it\nThey don't get mug shots done a guy like me when this happened to me it was outright dismissed and people went off and use that against me and those same people are saying oh isn't that horrible what's happened to Kevin now and this double standard in American society when we're out there on the road at the everyday working person at is tired of\nThat so let me ask you who you are you ... do you want to explain then do you want to explain since you've introduced it I wasn't going to ask you about this I didn't have an interest in that but why don't you explain what you were talking about there because they think some people might be a little confused here and I think in fairness to you\nYou did have an incident um which was brought up on another talk show I'd like to give your a brief explanation because they really do want to focus oh I Know I tend to see it on your ...\nBut it's part of the ... you're looking at a guy's got four degrees for MIT created a seven different companies in Massachusetts is probably the most qualified candidate to a place in the Senate and what you see in the midst of that is what we saw in the Kavanaugh hearings is the fact that extremely qualified people are destroyed by people\nBecause of political reason for any book and just just I just want my audience not to get confused she and I think it's in your interest if I could be so bold since you brought it up and I didn't intend to bring it up why don't you just tell us without getting into great detail you had a some charges brought against ... I was I was ...\nFalsely arrested and it was outright dismissed because this woman had done this to other people mhm outright dismissed and people use that and put up my mug shot when they knew was outright dismissed that's worse than cabinet what occurred to Kevin now and uh it was done by people paid this\nTalk show host one of the candidates and I want to bring this up then because the same candidates who are saying they support cabinet was wrong with the same people who use the same techniques and I think the American people are tired of this that's what we're seeing with the Kavanaugh hearings again and I think it's important\nThat I should because it's not an important discuss what's important ... well I tell you what's on ...\nBecause if you feel you were mistreated by another talk show host okay um would you have every right to feel if that's the way you feel\nI Would either take it up directly with that talk show host or take it up with my lawyers because I don't want to waste the time of my listeners I Want my listeners to learn about you from you during our conversation\nAnd and the only reason why even asked you for a brief explanation was because you introduced it in effect I used to live a tribute to eh wasn't going to end this was a larger\nIssue of not me so you have to let me finish this it's about destroying people's characters that's what this is about and when you start doing this to people like Kevin out me and others you have the extremely qualified candidates who start wondering why should I entered this pet\nBut I'd rather ... and ... have you talk about your qualifications well they're not going to I Want to pivot to that if I can okay her um and ... before I give it to that um because I I Do want people to learn about you [noise] um you\n... an ounce as a Republican and now you're running as an independent uh and it the the the past that you've chosen as an independent which few exceptions as difficult Bernie Sanders was elected as an independent Angus King in Maine two senators from New England were elected as independence\nOr and you've chosen a difficult past that won't be a party structure why did you choose to run as an independent\nI chose to run as an independent because the Republican Party in this state is it relevant\nAnd they're actually an arm of the Democratic party there's one party in Massachusetts and we can discuss is I gave the Republican were like I gave the Republican Party wherever I went and you know this because I was the first Kennedy to now to set up a formidable candidate in fact if I remember you said you know maybe you should ask the other guy not to run\nAnd the entire issue here is is here you have a guy who ran\nI ... I was getting all by the way I don't mean I was like I think what I think what I said I was\nI'm a confused as to why two qualified candidates you ingest deal would not either run against each other or or or join forces or whatever that that you both seem to see the world fairly similarly we both your Republican he was Republican at the time\nUh and you're running against a very high profile Democrat who probably I think if not definitely he's going to be running for president and maybe be the next president or at least the next stage of the Democratic party so so I just want to get to your decision you decided to take this task of running as an independent\nThat's a tough tough road to take well it\nIt why if you look at Massachusetts you know we just had a ... as you know we've sued UMass for the fact that they're trying to deny us access to the debate stage and in that discussion judge stern said you know what's fascinating and he told our lawyer this Massachusetts is a state of independence six nearly sixty percent of the people registered here on enrolled EKG independence\nOr however what happens is both parties bully people and they make only about forty percent of it to force people to choose the lesser of two evils if you look at both of the other candidates that are running neither of them wants to be senator one of them wants to be president the other is essentially a being groomed to be lieutenant governor\nAnd I'm the only one who wants to be senator how do you do that then well I can get into it but I don't want to waste your\nTime on who it was I think anyone who is when you open up another issue which I think again\nYou're so involved in this I Want to talk about your efforts to get on the ballot or I should say to get on the the stage and you mentioned a federal court case that has been argued in a in federal court is that a major victory in today yeah we're going to talk about that but yeah the ticket break it to make a litter the money my guess is a\nSheet of ice dory or he is an independent candidate for governor and uh he is is that an empty set of excuse me strikes using because all of a sudden we hear lieutenant governor thank you for that correction\nOr we're going to find out about his battle to get on to at least as many I guess platforms as possible\nThere is a case in federal court that I Am somewhat aware of and uh she will bring us up to date on with that case is and maybe some of you haven't even heard of it so that's we're going to talk about and we'll also take your phone call six one seven to five or ten thirty AAA nine to nine ten thirty nights I Would then right would come right back [noise]\nNight side with Dan re news watch never stops W.

fact the U.S Senate was using it at the time my latest companies called ... we have a technology which let you create medicine faster and cheaper for example we discovered\nA combination therapy for pancreatic cancer in the record loving months and got approval by the FDA um it's a technology that came out of my work at MIT\nWhen was that discovered or three years ago and we got FDA allows being used well it's an empty ... well we have what we have a partnerships with form of them do you understand we building a platform is basically as disruptive as the technologies emailed than where we can literally a look at the known science and model molecular pathways on the computer so for example we've\nLooked at all the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's we spun out of company on that we're doing one for a a less are we any closer to solving these mysteries our technology is going to let us do that and how soon do you think well I'll give you where we're at for them for example on the Alzheimer's and\nWe built the molecular understanding of the first in the world and we're starting to test individual compounds and we're looking at a combination therapy basically the future is going to be cocktails\nIt's not going to be any one drug and part of cocktail just food food is really a multi combination therapy suicide asylum\nBut for those of us who are sixty five or so well well why don't the thing is this going to be available go go and do and I wonder if I'm Sorry it on I ... I I Want to find our Dawn Dawn with how soon realistically are where how far down the line and well it is as\nWell I once we understand the mechanisms there's a lot of data that shows\nUm are you talking about Alzheimer's I some right doesn't Alzheimer's is a is a mixture five different major mechanisms newer inflammation tangled ... but it's not any one ... so some of the data showing that viruses cause Alzheimer's another set of data showing for example inflammation which can come from diabetes and diet\nWe're not disclose what I'm trying to get at is for people who really well right now there are\nPreventative things we can do that I mean there are certain supplements for example I don't want to ... this is if I were you I Can't advise young you're not running ...
