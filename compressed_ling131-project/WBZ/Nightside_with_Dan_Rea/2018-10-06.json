I think initially most people thought well the FBI will be in charge they will do what they want they'll have a week that should give them enough time with the resources they have\nBut according to people who were inside the FBI or close the FBI sources they were not really able to do everything they wanted to do they were guided by the White House ah there were many people that were not interviewed was that because the White House didn't want them interviewed or the FBI felt they shouldn't be interviewed one thing they could be interesting in the next year\nIf somehow the Democrats take control of the house or the Senate there could be hearings\nOver this whole investigation we may revisit this again after the first year if the Democrats take control of one of the houses they may want to look into what were you told who told you this why did you talk to this person why didn't you talked to ... that person so this may not be over yet\nAnd the White House was saying that they did not put any parameters on the FBI investigation that you're you're you're saying that that it was fairly limited in its scope\nIt appears to be a new one is saying absolutely what actually took place 'cause we don't really know what took place there have been suggestions that the FBI was given a lot of people to interview and they did not interview that well the question then becomes why didn't they did the FBI feel\nWe didn't need to talk to them or were they pressure directly or indirectly by the White House by the Judiciary Committee or what and these are questions that just haven't been completely answered yet\nAnd and in looking and listening to the comments from both Senator Murkowski and senator columns you sort of see where this decision making split senator Collins focusing specifically on the sexual misconduct charges and say we will be ill served in the long run if we abandoned the presumption of innocence\nSenator Murkowski saying look I Believe Brett Kavanaugh is a good man it just maybe in my view he's not the right man for the court at this time\n... this was a very tough decision for these three people flake Murkowski and a ... uh I sort of was wondering about Jeff Flake I thought in the end he might just say I just don't have enough information about him I just um\nNikes side with Dan re the news watch never stops W.

and all kinds of patient people I watched doctor for the whole thing maybe see some things\nI'm a stack something way cooperate with our story anything and I thought nothing and\nI always believe Brett Kavanaugh but of course we're waiting for some proof and I I feel sorry for him ideally was tortured um I I feel embarrassed or the chemical\nGiant Feinstein\nNo we're not coming out in a timely fashion\nIt was very very embarrassing cutting the night show due process\nTruths came to light and by a margin but it wasn't enough to put him over the edge and I am I congratulate him and I congratulate the Senate and show happy\nIn the wake of what transpired over the past two weeks or even back to the latter part of the summer if you want to go through the whole process Susan do you think we're we're just waiting future candidates on a host of jobs and levels in government from putting them so\nYeah I think people are trying to take more higher position or they were able to be scared and um I feel that the whole thing to me was very suspicious timing the way it came out I judge Kavanaugh no\nAnd the beginning that he would have a rough road and you really want to cry about going back to Nineteen Ninety three credit jar when he was trying to orange right hand man he put together the star wars and Monica Lewinsky in Libya tread everything that went on from the\nDark days of the Clinton White house and not want it and I do know that you would have a rough road and who they saying that ran on it it's like they had\nNothing and they wish to talk about all things like I said I Would put them through and you know maybe they're maybe there's more to this is where is the last thing on Earth Day and I'm proud of judge Kavanaugh\nSusan I thank you for your phone call\n...\nNumber six one Seventy five for ten thirty you can call us toll free at eighty nine to nine ten thirty leaves me hold it for some time don't just from New York ...\nOh hi good evening job bank today I'm like oh my pleasure\nYeah well my question but I just I disagree with a number of your callers I Wish that the Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation was not advanced than um I don't feel that he is the position\nI'm just you know primarily never mind the allegation but just in terms of what would be turned judicial temperament that in front of the confirmation committee and you know I I feel like what we're seeing is more of a a\nJust a a a privilege\nTo continue\nOr denigrate shade of women that it's perpetuated by the cage okay\nDo you think this top this process would have been a lot different if he hadn't been so contentious on Thursday of last week\nI think it would have been different if she hadn't been so contentious I I you know I I don't think that it's necessarily would have been I mean I think that at the at the ballot the two\nPeople I think you know the American public is sort of treated to the spectacle as if the Supreme Court justice is going to be\nA partial which is how we always prefer to think of acting but you know I mean the list that President Trump to choose for the Supreme Court nominees for the Heritage Foundation and the service organization and I believe that the the the person that\nIs the editor heritage organization the Heritage Foundation they said that you know President Trump could try to start at the list they would have had\nAny you know it didn't matter to him who was actually nominated\nSo it it it's it's obviously a party that appointment don't matter what so I don't really think that the process would have been any different regard lives of how he acted and I think that the way Kevin I acted in front of the committee you know\nThat I think what we're saying is what happens when the elite part question as to their behavior and held accountable for things that they've done\nWhat it is a good point I think there's no question that most appointments if not all had been partisan to a degree but I don't think we've ever heard a nominee expressed that out loud it was with as much anger and and and and frustration as he did a week ago Thursday\nAfter I mean I completely I completely agree with you there you know I mean and I just wanted to go I just wanted to go back to the point I mean I'm uh\nI'm a teacher and I flipped so let me just tell you\nWhat I asked students to cricket plagiarism 'cause this this reminds me of some of the behavior that we like Trump so on\nBut I Would I have a candid patriotism them over it\nWriting shocked generally because they're being held to account for something that I'm like if I if I go down in front of like a true cuter in and do a Google Search and I get it it is going to be your paper colored drain but she said\nYou know let's say with the law was discovered Michelle Obama's words twice\nYou know people sort of shocking first grade because you'd actually be held to account wagging judge Kavanaugh is called to account for his behavior as well as granted a younger person is reaction is one I cannot believe that somebody you can find out about this\nAnd I apologize I Apologize for not we've got about twenty seconds left but you do something very important it is a teachable moment with ten seconds what do you teach them talk about what your students come Monday or Tuesday\nI kitchen it's very very important to a threat to the state that democratic process to get out and and I don't really care who the person votes for the third part of the problems that\nAre I I I'm Sorry for cutting you off I thank you for your call you raise a very good point we've got to take a break and go to the news will continue the conversation on WB Z in just a moment\nSalem waterfront or ...

radio station\nA and sometimes I mean everybody has got stories about how a social media has been a wonderful way to keep in touch with people they would have completely forgotten about or couldn't have contacted or\nA stay in touch with their grandchildren or whatever [noise] uh but people also have lots of horror stories about social media is well\nWell it's the immediacy of it as well in the current stage and the fact that you have an occupant at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue that loves his Twitter and so three four or five o'clock in the morning you got instant message is going out from the president of the United states to the entire world\nAnd presumably and we don't know exactly how this process where it's we've heard that uh you know his people are deliberately misspelling stuff we don't know how managed it is but it certainly appears that in a lot of the communications that come from the president or are in fact not going through a filters\nAnd that was really quick evolution ah our current president was by no means the first computer age president he wasn't even in the first social media president the previous president or a had his blackberry and use social media although\nNot nearly to this extent but we went from that sort of very modest use of the White House of a social media to now as you point out the president oftentimes completely bypassing the usual ways presidents\nTalked to the people which was to press conferences and through a mediated messages and certainly mediated through their own people are now we have you write his\nHis total body of Twitter output in this first ah ah ah you know less than two years of his presidency presidency has been substantial\nWe also touched upon something a little while ago which was the etiquette of social media so if you pick up the phone it during your fiftieth anniversary dinner well better be worthwhile taking that call\nThe the the addiction if you will to getting back to people immediately via social media and the freedom to say whatever's on your mind without concern for consequence has changed\n[noise] right and without actually having to take the time to ah to think about it I mean a a there was\nA ... you know into well first of all every one of us out in our pocket are carrying around an international transmission device and reception\nDevice or a which is something entirely different it used to be with you left your house you were out of communication until you got to your office or someplace where there was the telephone with a wire connected to the to the wall [laughter] uh and then of course we got a a wireless phones but you still had to be within a\nAt close range of the base be the cell\nPhone and then topped by the smartphone\nHas allowed everyone to be wherever they are practically a and whenever they are to be able to get messages and a ... and send messages and that makes for kind of a ... a a form of communication in that you are able to uh respond so quickly\nI mean you know before by the time you call someone or sent them a letter or a waited till you at a meeting with them or you know you might have cooled down rethought things all the rest\nBut no one can simply respond as it's not quite as immediate as the way your knee goes up when your doctor hits you want it will ever [laughter] but it's pretty close to that which by the way is why\nThe October or whatever it is it's two thousand Eighteen I have still I'm a I'm not on Facebook I Am not on Twitter I get it in enough trouble uh speaking by my voice faculty meeting I certainly don't need to be tweeting\nSo these are safety measures on your behalf for safety and then you also\nIt is right I did just that uh uh it's not something I think is a ... a good way for me to be computer communicating [laughter]\nBut you also brought up the addiction factor [noise] um I have a feeling if I had a Facebook account that uh because it is there I Would be checking it multiple times a day\nAnd let's face it with all of a sudden you know your old third grade English teacher pops up or your old high school friend or whatever the temptation to ah engage in finding out what the what they they you know have to say it all the rest of it\nTo me I think would be overwhelming I could not not look at that kind of thing to say that I don't care what any of the people right past started doing there are things that Facebook or a would bring me that I think I Would actually\nWe like and treasure but I ... to me the cost of time and potential uh a misuse it all the rest of it ah ah isn't worth the benefit\nWhy did you speak for a number of people who think it's very important to disconnect so that they can reconnect in a different manner\n[noise] right and and that's I mean ... and I think that is true if you're you know when your when whenever you see two people who are\nSitting across from each other in a diner and they're texting each other that seems to me a little bit of not quite right\nOn the other hand we do also have to remember that this is a big country it's geographically huge and uh we don't tend to stay in the same place that we grew up in in all the rest of it and there are a lot of people who will get of course can't afford to be having face to face\nInteraction with all the people that they like good or they love because they're spread out all over the place so uh I I Am by no means categorically dissing social media I think it helps in some cases\nUh in wonderful ways to be able to keep people together in ways that they never could have done in the age of the uh the telephone or the letter or any of those kinds of things\nI mean I I I'm fifty nine and I remember uh when I was first I'm a a talking over the summer to my future wife who was a couple of states away long distance calls were like thirty\nDollars for Fifteen minutes that's an incentive to take paper Japan no question about it\nThat that is a that is true of ... and ... the kind of thing that the kinds of thoughts by the time you translate them into words is to get on to a a\nA piece of paper is a very different kind of communication than that which you can uh you know quickly pop up with your problems\nAnd uh I don't think this has been around nearly long enough for us to really understand the impact of that big a big change is going to take a generation before we kind of figure that all out by that time of course will be too late to do anything\nAbout it of course our guests are Dr Bob Thompson from the buyers Center for television of

conversation to get going on that's um our\nInfluence or put it this way how much are the masters of where that they are influenced by the media television do you think they're conscious of it\n[noise] well that's I mean that's one of the big the the influence of the media on who we are as one of the biggest questions that comes up in that you know the study and people who think about the media\nAnd it's a complicated situation obviously there is an influence on what we watch is how we behave\nOr they wouldn't be a multibillion dollar advertising industry they're pretty convinced by paying all that money that they're influencing us by making us by this stuff but there are a that they're selling so I think we can acknowledge that the other thing is I think a lot of it so we think back a outside of our own expertise\nA lot of what we know about a lot of things\nWe know exclusively from what we obscene on uh uh uh in the media it on TV in the movies [laughter] I'm I'm not a biologist uh everything I Know about the mating habits of marsupial\nI learned on PBS I'd ... so yes it is influential but\nHere's the example I always get bit at least\n... makes us think about this a little differently um ... I grew up in the baby boom generation so uh I grew up with and uh\nThere was forget pre marital sex on TV there was no marital sex on TV or husbands and wives slipped in separate beds that was it was a very kind of much pure family values oriented TV [noise]\nAnd the argument that we are what we watch so that what we watch makes us become who we are\nIf that were true the generation I grew up in should've become the most Norman Rockwell ... family values oriented generation of all time because we were watching hundreds of hours of leave it to beaver and father knows best Ozzie and Harriet and in fact\nThat baby boom generation did the exact opposite he presided over a cultural revolution to change that completely rejected what we saw on those TV shows it's all that's a long winded way of saying\nI I think that's a really really complicated question and it's hard to kind of in\nSome cases I think we're very influenced by the media in some cases we resist the media in significant ways\nDot com high times holding horse offering will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with unqualified bother us securities and Exchange Commission the security's are

we are talking with Dr bump Thompson for the buyer Center for television in popular culture at Syracuse University let's go to Phil in rock we're going to be failure on WB\nCraving and a good evening Dr Thompson how are you I'm doing very well how about you well I was absolutely are starting to hear you mention a TV a\nDocumentary that is actually being streamed on a uh Internet platform that I own called the film detective and that is what you just mentioned the Amos and Andy anatomy of the controversy\n[noise] All right I got the title a little bit wrong you're right that's on\nA we have a classic movies streaming service that we've been running for several years and the distributor of that is actually\nA very dear friend of mine Scott so and that's that's the that's the only piece of a video that documents the Amos and you show it actually has hosted by George ... that's right and then he ...\nHe gets kind of a background of uh he goes to the minstrel show and and a black face it all the kinds of things that are the reasons why Amos and Andy was so controversial um and there's also at the end of it it must be a good six minutes of clips from the old show\nNow it's it's absolutely fantastic because it gives you a ... understanding of what it meant\nTo a lot of the African American actors too many you know really we're looking at it from a different perspective wishing that it could be back on I mean if you look at the shows like the ... or ... or that was stereotypical itself but that didn't have the negative connotations that Sandy yet\nRight and you know I I think and I should I should have brought this up but the last caller I think the other thing was that\nIn it to the Andy the TV show\nThat the show was portrayed the characters were paid by black actors I think one of the reasons that Amos and Andy has such a cloud over it is at the radio show which was the first big Jayanti it in a radio back in the late twenties would network radio it was just emerging\nAnd of course the Amos and Andy radio show the hugely popular radio show\n'em a Amos and Andy Black characters were portrayed by two white guys the creator of the show and I think that's one of the things that has made that show the very title Amos and Andy so on palatable to people because essentially they were\nThey perform that show in audio blackface\nYes point but then you have to also look at shows that trade Asians as well so if you look at a lot of the Charlie Chan or the the mode of films that's right ... the seventies absolutely similar you know sort of backlash\nBut they they would never taken off and buried and I think with what happened with Amos Danny the street from my perspective a\nUnless you're going to see it at the museum of television and radio and or an institution or it is readily available to the un you too but it's just interesting is the first time that a network has actually taken something buried at the ... [noise]\nYeah no that is true that is a show that pretty much disappeared from broadcast TV but it is as you point out it's available now from a a all kinds of other sources but\nUm I highly recommend anybody that they they start out with that documentary because I think that really does lay it out from a number of different perspectives and gives the historical context of what still a very troubling show but uh I think we're thinking about\nPhil thank you very much for your phone call it's nice to have you with us on WB Z we've got a few minutes left with Bob tops and I have to ask you a question because you've got a podcast that is coming out very soon that focuses on the fast and furious two series as a benchmark for society I Hope I'm describing it properly it can you elaborate on what this will be\nYeah well first of all I'm really impressed that you found out about this because it's not even up yet and I didn't do it one of my colleagues at Syracuse University a doctor Sharif slippery um did it and we do a one hour episode on each of the uh the movies\nUm and what I Love about doing this kind of thing is you know a lot of people think that some theories okay there's a bunch of cars they're crashing they're dragging seats down the street and all that kind of stuff there's tanks and submarines and all that sort of thing but\nThat is a series of movies that if you scratch the surface\nAll kinds of extraordinary things\nCome out and I think that's true of so many of the things that we don't take a a that we don't take that seriously um and it gets back to that caller or a couple of callers back about paying attention\nYou can take things like the fast and furious movies and if you actually watch them carefully and pay attention to them all kinds of wonderful treasures come pouring out of them\nSo enlighten the undone lightened what sort of treasures will be greedy well my favorite\n... and again ah it's been a while since we had these conversations but uh uh my my favorite are the amount of one of my favorite novels of all time as Moby Dick and the fast and furious series is filled with\nReferences to the great American novel including at one point when they actually use harpoon stirring the car chase\nIncluding another example where uh where a white car as the white whale attack say ship\nWhich happens at the end Moby Dick hum that shift at a tiny little piece of the uh the the little secrets and nuggets or a ... if you um uh if you really carefully watched the fast and furious movies\nNow how does a movie like that sustain itself when you lose your star in the last ...\n[laughter] well it and they did a very nice of the ... the brand new paramount network or fairly paramount network today a documentary not too long ago called I Am Paul Walker about him um uh but they I mean he was a major loss but let's remember way back\nWhat was it a Tokyo drift but I think was specimen furious three if I'm not mistaken a that didn't ... it so it's it's you know it's the kind of thing where it's it's more a that series was\nAn ad about an attitude on the other hand uh Paul Walker of course was an important part of it\nBut it's a pleasure I could talk to you for hours about this and so much more with relation to a popular culture social media and the world of TV but thank you so much for joining you're working on a book on the history of television was correct\nAnd we'll get a book about the history of popular culture to culture before television now the circus and all that kind of stuff matter of fact uh Boston W H is showing a a a American Experience to part on the circus that starts Monday I think I'm going to be on that\n... we will keep our eyes and ears open and thanks so much for joining us at the beginning of the Columbus Day weekend that was so much fun thank you are pleasure thank you Bob ... Thompson from the Blair Center for TV in popular culture at Syracuse we will continue conversing with you at six one Seventy five for ten thirty or you can call us toll free\nEight eight eight nine to nine to ten thirty it's a holiday we're going to be discussing the world of ... wine beer and spirits with Ryan bologna and Randall bird coming up next right here on WB seat news radio ten thirty\nSalem waterfront on ... ... more of a V. sophisticated waterfront destination ... and for business travelers book today St Louis waterfront hotel dot com\nFive billion visit burning still this week way you would think if the hairspray have my north shore of music theater and eligible to win a five hundred dollars a\nCall\nFrom Ninety nine dollars a month to\nThe loan roofing ...\nW E Z buses WXXI K.

the fifty one votes needed one of the Senate confirmation vote is expected to take place tomorrow Collins announcing her decision during a forty five minutes speech this afternoon on the Senate floor saying she believes Christine Blasey Ford who accused capital of sexual assault never done\nAnd then all of a sudden out of nowhere the renaissance a disparate on I think by a lot of the ... and people rediscovering all this stuff's all of a sudden brown good started coming back into this thing and those are like anything that's aged so you know are basically started with you know ride bourbon and scotch\nWhisky category is really what what what grill and it's still growing\nAnd I don't see it as a pendulum swinging back and forth we knew that the death knell of the vodka thing was going to happen when they actually had and this is no joke electricity flavored vodka as well as menthol yeah tobacco flavored vodka\nWe ... we we did actually a are we actually have said that this is can't go much lower than the sewers producing those ... well we could have a couple if you're like ... we actually were doing it we actually do a segment called da ... rip products off the shelf and we actually tried them\nSo for about three weeks we were taking down a a product called odd car\nAnd they had a brand name of the brand name they had a flavors were electricity fresh cut grass and ... with ah be humble popcorn the golden butter flavored ... yeah ...\nPopcorn is actually a a decent combination but the country or even ...\nYeah yeah I think when we had the electric the electricity one in in Randall like did to a licking a battery\nIt was it was it was awful but you know what's interesting huh Josh is that when you get into these kinds of things you actually sell more by being negative about it because you're making up how bad it is and it's like they're\nSo huge spike we were the only ones to sell out of that right because you know people would say no it can't be as bad as you're saying I said Oh yes yes it is\n... ... actually the funniest part was we would have people that would come in like we we had to sign up as heard on its the liquor talking for the electric electric flavored vodka and I thought it was going to get your enemies yeah well I probably would have I thought we would have people coming back and asking for their money because we tell them how bad it was\nPeople were coming back and go wow you are right so people than trying to share it with their friends and relatives who I it's amazing yeah yeah it does taste terrible now try this you know like when you're sitting at a restaurant oh my God this is so bad here try some\nOr anything I'm somebody comes up a smell this you know it's going to be mad at anytime I might be as I say this but they're not going there not you can tell it's not going to be good\nSo that that's that's how things devolved to what extent with vodka and other retail items but in terms of the growth of people who are making their own craft beer people who are experimenting with winds that heretofore we would have ignored simply because of where they came from right what what what led to that interest that growth that\nSo that Internet yeah the Internet and I think everybody was looking for something new and you know whether they say in like Randall set a pendulum swing what's a what's all this new again and you know that was out of the emergence of of of of the craft cocktails subtle little that whole thing going back to actually looking at\nProhibition and pre prohibition or drink recipes and seeing what different flavor combinations they could they could make I mean the ads you know they were trying to pump in more flavors into vodka\nWhen you had flavors and other things that could just be that are readily available and let's be honest with you at the time quite cheap\nI mean really you know we're talking about bourbon set of selling today you know are on the secondary market which means somebody bought in retail and trying to reach rather well not re market thing yeah area that are ... salad ... and reselling for hundreds and hundreds of dollars we were talking pick up saying you know he could bring a pick up some rye whiskey\nFor you know twelve box um and then you make a great cocktail out of it and all of a sudden you're you're you're the newest crazed and bartending\nAnd I I don't want to say that that the home kind of experimental people getting involved with it has been accelerated by the Internet because people can find links to some information and delve really deeply into it and also kind of mentality that's that's\nI've seen that I blame on what I call the whiskey hipsters but hipsters where the identity of the ... yeah so I called the ... the identity of the person is based on I Need to have something that nobody else has or that I'm the only\nKind of um arbiter of taste or knowledge about this and so are you see all the different things whether it's beer wine or even the spirits fracture into these real esoteric\nVery deep dives into really bizarre areas including crazy crazy I ... that people are just going off the chart and then and then winds and whiskey you're also seeing the same types of trends as well even the gyms like the off the charts a juniper or other flavor\nProfiles that are taken to the nth level to the point

bad at that I was picking up after my dog is it ... it looks like\nThat but it's it's it's it's powerful it's potent yeah an edit it as you guys have said earlier this evening it may speak to some people that may drive people away it's a it's a smoky the meaty kind of an odor yeah which is used specifically to make sketches or it can be used in a variety of it\nWas always used as a power or heating source so if you had a cold home and he didn't have standing trees to cut down would you would dig up these ... and people to this day on the island is around Scotland and Ireland still harvest is uh to heat their homes or their pubs or whatever\nBut when you're making whiskey you're going to have wet barley a part of the process and you need to dry it out so they would toasted\nOver these uh bricks of ... that were burning and smoldering the heat and the smoke would kind of affects the way that the grain tasted and it makes it very distinctive aroma which we call a PD aroma or a smoky aromas and that's spelled P. A. T. right\nA lot of people confuse it with peat moss and things other things but it's more like a\nJust compressed vegetation that will become colon ten thousand years but we like to say we're we're making whiskey\nThat we don't we can't wait that long so thirsty and you can burn it that long and we and depending on what the content of the vegetable matter is\nA will change the way it smells and the way it looks a somewhat ... and the way it will react to the with ... with Heather and low shrubs\nAnd stuff down by the water may have seaweed and ... which gives them an either dynamic I Am this way I was doing like band aid so we're we're in we're running around while they're trying to give these tours and show us official look at our beautiful distillery in more like a yeah pick any ... for that in the bag and\nAnd uh we're basically stealing a little bit of the island or each time that we're well we're actually we actually took\nA ten I consumers with us uh over over there too so they actually get to cut Pete so er during the trip they actually went to the ... and actually cuts breaks of\nPete how easy it let's just for listeners who haven't been to a ... like you're climbing into a fog and water and well and it's kind of like that are she\nKind of low grass and when you cut through the top brass layer that's growing on top of the ... it's kind of like a a wet soggy dirt or clay\nAnd so you use a special tool that looks like a ton of a flat shovel\nAnd as you dig down into it it's it's a heavier because there's a high water content\nI'm at a little bit like sticky clay and then you throw it up on the ground and let it aired dry and that's what you have in the bag that for you know it becomes a much harder mass and there's very little water in it so it's ... burns and smokes\nAnd what you're doing to that grain is going to be similar to smoking a meat for example in a a barbecue situation but you're actually toasting the grain and importing to smoke it s\n... over toasted or over people try I mean they I mean that's the whole point a lot of these things are we talking about like juicy New England style\nEyepiece how much how much ah how how much hops can we get into one\nAnd it might be what points or you're not even tasting how we're over the top it is right\nYou're getting as much ... parts per million of this feeling of this feeling all a compound that it's doing at the ... and then when you just tell you taking some of it away\nBut what we were really interested in is\nThere's different people from different areas made up of different ... matter and the problem is is that you can't ... taste the difference between them because well the whiskey gets in the way\nThe whiskey that we have or when it's labor labor is right and we said well how can we actually see what the differences in with Pete and so what we decided to do was actually take a a cheese\nInvestment advisory services are offered terrific be wealth management below the NFC the registered investment advisor no statements made she'll constitute tax legal recounting advice\nThen you'll be the gets results for thousands of New England business sense if you want to grow your business listening to this\nThis is Dick ... president and CEO of the Boston savings bank we have been advertising on WB gee radio for\nOver Thirty years and in that time we have seen a lot of changes in the banking industry the one thing that remains the same as a partnership with WDC radio this relationship has proven to be a very successful strategic plan and helping each Boston savings bank achieved the success that has had in the Boston real estate market whether it's promoting\nChecking accounts residential mortgage is a commercial loans the w._b. the audience represents customers that east Boston savings rank is trying to reach simply put\nWB she gets results these Boston savings bank if you're looking to maximize your advertising dollars I strongly recommend WDC radio as a means of communicating to new customers and grow your business\nFor advertising information called six one seven ... seven Seventy one eighty four I'll go to W.

done huff WB Z news\nThe and all of the barrel and all these barrels we eventually come to what we call would management is like okay we're gonna we're really going to start looking at what barrels were putting stuff in and how it's being age how long it's being age all this stuff at the beginning what he's saying it was just having that in the ... yeah I mean it needs to go into battle sticking in the barrel we need to get we need to put it in ...\n... barrels that we have that doesn't have anything in it that we ... we can fill out with whiskey or whatever I like to think that you know so people wonder about one is is aging thing happens putting a name for the barrel for length of time\nYou would leave let's say a London on a ship that would go to the colonies and you'd have your daily rational but whiskey\nAnd it would go in raw like ah moonshine clear right by the time you got to the colonies and a little bit was left in the bottom of the barrel or because all the sailors were happily drinking it um it would have been aged and taken out of the color of the barrel at the port in the colonies maybe in the Caribbean they're\nGoing to refill that barrel because that's what the containers that they had with rum and that rumble age on the way back to the trip back to for example London or Glasgow or wherever they were coming\nAbout and that's even said when the British Empire and as even the same thing how we got you know four to five wines and distilled spirits that wine itself the line with stocks boiling\nWell and all the way they saw what will make a condensed wine and when you get to the column Marshall just to add water and make a mistake to wind but if you were saying this is really good at the higher alcohol proof\nI Try and it's not it doesn't work the same way doesn't river you can't ... you can't undo still something ... you know I Can't make it back into why now it's brandy yeah making it back into red wine or white wine you're you're actually have to put it\nBack on you know you can't make somebody on pregnant yes\nThat is hard to reverse Sylvie they're all just get back to the girls barrels where the cardboard box of their day and then because there was such a a a plethora of barrels they weren't corporate it into\nThe distilling of liquor ... you're right because that's what your ship the liquid and so now you have people using ... for like let's say for bourbon bourbon has\nTo be made with a virgin chardo battle it can only be used once was announcing or bourbon ... so now you can use it for something else now it's going to make its round just going to go to it's going to go over to Scotland they're gonna they're gonna put whiskey and it's kind of relaxed yellow for ... for an ... so this battle is still\nIt's gaining another life and that's the same thing that we actually um I actually poor few while we were on break a whiskey that we actually aged in a wind ... made and what type of wine is this is Roberto ... which is a Spanish red wine\nYeah and it's become a kind of a hot region and so now like I mean a a a fad a trend that region or an addition to being the temperature is hot in the area and it it makes a really robust kind of great that that has a profound effect on the taste of the wine similar to the ... but I think\nA little bit more limited ... yeah and what we've done is actually taking the whiskey I'm a whiskey that uh we put into\nThat barrel and you can ... you know I always say you know radio is a great visual medium that's right in the city you can only lived in that area actually has a radish shoot you it is actually this is like the this is like the ...\nOf whiskey right now you get that that are sort of pinkish shoot to this that you're getting from the line mhm and but when you taste is you're going to get the influence of the line on the whiskey and a lot of things right now are getting the influence of the whiskey on the line but what's he's always been done in wind balance it more fortified ports cherries\nRight the abundance of harm a muddy areas they bind in suburban barrels only means that a lot of stuff as an expert battles because they're abundant and they can get them pretty inexpensive in comparison to a Sherry back\nBut you just mentioned to kilos as well that are being changed whiskey barrel and then what ... yeah but why are with dark I get suddenly you have a clear with the with the urban or whiskey ... how does that impact the taste of how long it back and say oh\nLet's let's look at the tequila if you have in an age tequila is generally called the Blanca or clearer silver\nBut then you're going to have a rep his auto which has rested and that's up to a year and then the ... which is getting a a year to an extreme you know which is three years and each time I've talked about a step you're going to see an increase in the color darkness\nAnd the influence of the would kind of being reached out to those flavors coming out of the wood and going into the tequila so yeah they don't have\nTo kill as whereas years ago and I don't mean to you know judge or personal experiences but when you were drinking here to kill a maybe on some regretful a spring break trip it would have probably been clear harsh and fiery\nBut now the world is waking up to age to ... that are more of a sipping kind of experience and very similar to the whiskey is\nYou didn't the dough shouldn't have having to have to deal with the salt and lime close by ... sister correct I mean that has a point that was a ... for every moment of the ... the whole point was getting\nAnd to the point right correct I that's why you do shots of doing shots to get to the point which is in a lot of cases is getting ... we're not at that really would not have those sort of stages anymore it's enjoying the journey of exploring what you're drinking\nOr knowing about what you're drinking and actually having a a a little bit better experience on the way to the point\nToo but you just as you just use the term sipping which often is not associate it this is Sara Lee with with having ... ... exactly as a very big qualitative difference I were to take a brief break I Want to come back and continue some of the discussion of the history as well you mentioned rum\nLong synonymous with Boston but you've told me earlier the scene there's a connection with Medford as well and I know yeah

I think most people look at a beer and say oh that's dark so it's a quarter or stout but what they are qualitative there are there are similarities but there there are definitely differences a goes to gravity it goes to how they're made\nSo there is there is a difference and actually a lot of the ... or actually\nI find I find personally my beer guy will probably yell at me now when I go back but I find them a little bit lighter than the porters I did the porters actually\nHave more of in a way in ... where it grab a task run\nOut of your generally looking between porters in St out at a darker beer almost like a coffee colored and with a Richard darker kind of taste more like dark chocolates and coffee so putting a Duncan kind of coffee connection with this is you know it's natural it really is Randall\nRentals drink coffee so he doesn't know the the the the love and the affiliation with the subtlety\nDealing with these well it ... the cars the advertising says okay you're going to taste of Dunkin' Donuts and this and you do on the back end but it just it it's not overpowering\n[noise] so I have a I have a couple of actual questions into this exactly how they're making this um I doubt they're brewing this much coffee\nAnd I have an inside sources say there is a um a side of an extract that they're using to do this but the thing is the same extract that Duncan using some of its products so the flavor profile is very similar to some of the price you're going to get out of Dunkin' Donuts", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Nightside with Dan Rea", "city": "Boston", "day": "06"}
