I mean you and the members of the media deserve a lot of the responsibility for this there's a reason why Congress and the media are at all time lows okay\nLet him finish but it's usually folks [laughter] I told you got to get better [laughter]\nThere's there's a reason why is it all time low was no one asked me these questions on the trail no one but when I step up here it's the only question members of the media want to talk\nAbout we talked about we talked about the Columbia gas crisis I had some other question is this is but it's a simple question is is you can't you can't wait\nTo get to the folks don't care they want their roads and bridges fix they want the sentinel off our streets why he want their children are safe is\nDifficult for Republicans to condemn and outlandish statement that a Republican makes for a Democrat to Ben condemn an outlandish statement that a Democrat max I'm trying to get\nTo the problem is all you want is condemnation well ... I Want what more do you want to fix and not fight there and I'm running a campaign to fix infrastructure to solve the opioid issue okay if I spent all my time we're here tonight in an hour I might get Fifteen minutes to talk\nI'm not going to waste that on condemning people the job of congressmen is to bring people together to reach out to people into their daily lives make their lives better okay for her to go to\nAnd there will be able to say yes and move on but go ahead or [noise]\nSo I agree the role of Congress is to work together and try to get things done especially a\nYou know for working and middle class families and putting them first but it's also to hold\nThis administration accountable so when you have a president who stands up at a political rally and make fun of the doctor for it after she basically opened up a dialogue that we should be continuing on sexual abuse so that we can eradicate that behavior from our culture I think it's okay to condemn that comment [noise]\nThe motivation meets today to keep guns away from people who are going to do to harm to themselves or do harm to others and you get there with background checks but we can't get we can't get legislation passed on that we can't even get a debate on the house floor because of the n._r._a. lobby they don't want to even open the door on that\nThere is also bipartisan support for no fly no by if you can't fly on our airplanes because they're on a terrorist watch lists you should not be able to buy a gun these are common sense gun reform and these are the things that we need to get to work on and make our communities and our schools safer\n[noise] wrong with that question as well\nSo quickly I look I'm a strong supporter of the first amendment the ... the first time to manage the entire bill of rights okay\nBut the tenth amendment ... one size fits all prescriptions out of Washington don't work\nAll right we would not want in Massachusetts to live by the prescription that they hand out in Texas likewise Texas does not want to live under Massachusetts law I Do not believe\nAll right so I think when these one size fits all inevitably you wind up making one or two states happy and forty plus states unhappy\nI think the important thing is to make sure that law abiding citizens are not stripped of any of their constitutional rights\nWho's talking about reciprocity for example you mentioned Texas people from Texas can drive in Massachusetts on their driver's license I realize driver's license is a different than guns but we have reciprocity in terms of driver's licenses we have reciprocity in terms of uh licenses and privileges um Second Amendment is an absolute right ah\nWe do not have reciprocity I think that's the point is getting at\nI Know I understand and at the same time it's the tenth amendment where you don't want to force individual states didn't necessarily have to abide by each and every other states rules\nUm being said you know there's two sides to this coin um do you have folks who drive over state lines and now without knowing it they're committing a felony um and then their work history has destroyed um\nIt's a concealed weapon that they didn't get a background check on [laughter] I mean this is exactly why the federal government\nYou know is in place because if there are no background checks in Texas and they\nCan bring their concealed weapon into Massachusetts it puts us at risk and so look we're not saying we're taking guns away absolutely not but I think that we can get behind background checks wrapped around it I Know you're sitting there and do background checks in Texas I'm not saying that but I'm just saying that's why these federal laws exist to ensure that there are certain\nSafeguards in place so that our state ... state laws are protected right now they are at risk because there is no reason to process\nThe lord if we had a federal background check then would you be okay with a reciprocity concealed carry if we had a federal ... across the country [noise]\nThat's a good question you know right now I really am a\nI really want us to find some common ground on some really basic on reforms because there's a lot to discuss here in a gun a common sense you know gun reform package when there's a lot right there's bump stocks there was silence there's there's [noise]\nBut ... background checks to me it just seems like something that\nYou know both Republicans and Democrats could get into a room and hammer out and I and yeah I Would I I think that first and foremost we should be looking for those opportunities\nSo that we are not ignoring the survivors of Parkland anymore so we are not ignoring the fact that these mass shootings are happening all over the country we have to do something\nOkay we're going over here to Eric yes your\nCoffee I Would first like to say I'm a huge fan of night side and you're presenting both sides of the shows both sides is straight my question to both of you is what will you do about the sex trafficking human trafficking and drug trafficking coming across the southern border\nOkay well let's take that first I Want [laughter]\nSo there's no question that we have to a shore up our borders we have to invest in a border security we have you know\n\nThe reason that I was actually created was to protect our borders right from human sex traffickers from drug trafficking from keeping contraband out of our country unfortunately this year we saw it act you know\nIn a way that just didn't represent our values because it you know it's separated small children from their families and very inhumane way\nNow that's not to say we need we need ice to enforce those laws we need to protect our borders we are a country of laws and we need to enforce those laws so I don't want the um the two I Do think that uh ice needs to be\nEach transformed so that it's more on it's a mission uh with protecting us from those trafficking uh\nOffenses but I Do I I don't believe that we that we are as Americans we think it's okay for us to treat a family so inhumane lanes ...\nYou want to comment on the question [noise]\nSure border security is an absolute must without it we're not a country [noise]\nBut there's a bigger issue it's the rule of law\nThe first thing that I Do when I go down to Congress as I put my hand on a Bible and I take an oath to uphold the constitution and federal law\nWe must put an end to sanctuary cities you cannot run for an office where you take an oath to uphold the law and run based on telling other people they don't have to obey the law what good does it do to change the law when we're not even going to we're going to just disregarded\nThat's an absolute must I'm the only candidate in this race who is against sanctuary cities and that's part of the problem in Lawrence when the feds sees the fat and all that could kill half\nThe population of our state they got no help from local authorities because of Lawrence thanks very policies okay we need a lot more legal immigration a lot more All right we have the jobs we need the people\nBut the fact is we cannot exist as a country if we set aside the rule of law\nLet me try one more quick audience question Eric to over here who's who else was waiting are no those go to that\n\nQuestion for both candidates were distract it's at the\nEpicenter of the lime disease epidemic\nIf you should win this race what will you do about the lime disease epidemic and particularly the innumerable men women and children suffering from acute Lyme disease and unable to receive coverage for Lyme disease care from their private and state run insurance a medical insurance on what you have\nLess than two minutes left I never would've imagined that question is a good question though something serious and I understand that so I can get a quick thirty second response from other view so I can give you thirty seconds of the\nBook I think that we are right now we're seeing that we have to uh extend coverage and using Medicaid for example to extend coverage for mental health I wasn't actually aware of um the fact that you lack coverage on I think it's one of the reasons why we need to send more people down to Washington who are going to protect\nA ... a health care coverage for people with preexisting conditions because that is that is how we bring dignity to our health care system so I'd be delighted to look into the issue you know more so that I can better understand uh\nBut I think you raise a good point and that and certainly if it's if it's a more concentrated here in the third congressional district I'm going to become an expert on it very quickly\nRick your your response yet I see you're fidgeting dance but I feel like we're probably running up against the time I honestly I don't have enough time I think at this point to answer the question and and give us both um you're given a joy to give a quick response oh OK real quick um Medicare for all single payer is what a lot of folks talk about remember one thing single payer\nMean single decider and I want to talk to all the seniors out there\nWhen they talk about Medicare for all at this panacea forty four million people who paid into the system their whole life on Medicare they want to put two hundred and Seventy million people most\nOf whom have either not paid in the system at all as children are only paid in for a few years there's absolutely no economic way that is possible unless you ration the benefits of our existing seniors we just cannot go there\nOkay we're very tight and time your folks want to get in touch with you Laurie how did they get in touch with you got to go right to that\nAbsolutely so Laurie ... dot com I'd be delighted if you'd follow my campaign and I would love your vote on November sex Rick\nYour applause Rick how to close getting in touch with the\n... green for M.

we won't well he had a little bit of an accident with a with an ankle um and I can identify with that so we have a lot of similarities team going except you're the dean of law school and I will never be the ... or a professor at a law school\nSo I think everyone for being here today and like to start off with a judge capital into a judge if we talk about the mystery of the court system there's probably no court system which is more mysterious than a quarter which you said\nThe juvenile court you might agree or disagree but can you explain to us a little bit of your responsibilities as an associate justice of the juvenile court\nYou are right everyone is very um has questions about the juvenile court because by our own statues and standing on us everything that goes on not quarters confidential the public cannot come in and unless it's they use the full offend a case where children are tried as adults\nSo whenever I'm asked to speak everyone wants to know what goes on to juvenile court we saw was the same rules or civil procedure at the same rules of criminal procedure\nAnd juvenile law is that a little different than days at the case law is very specific\nUh we handled delinquency beautiful offenders as I said where children are tried as adults we also and um [noise] handle the our age child requiring assistance that can be found by parents and schools and the police\nAnd we also do state intervention cases which uh Karen protection cases\nAre parents into guardians allowed into the proceedings\nOnly the parents and the guy in ... and there are times that I don't even allow step parents and it's like a logical parents\nBy law and what about lawyers I assume that these children always have the right to\nSome data we represent our lives that children have legal representation in the delinquent days in the camp protections mother father if there's a God in children all appointed attorney\nAnd so you are one judge in one juvenile court there are the juvenile court in every county in Massachusetts I assume that's correct okay and how many judges are assigned to your course what\nWe have five judges I Am um [noise] I I sit in Milford excuse me in deadly Fitch broken my minister so I Do the satellite courts and then we also have a satellite counter circuit if you're with us okay uh and then we have\nFor the judges who said all the time in ... one judge said one day no sex\nAnd how's the workload at this point door closed tremendous uh it mostly go to a tremendously bad [laughter] the workload I mean that any given day I could have fifty four cases in my court alone\nAnd um you know it's it's emotional work we deal with families and done deal with the children and as I was just talking to judge ... my my background is in teaching\nAnd I found that it's certainly beneficial because I'm teaching the parents and teaching the kids you know because\nWhen parents come in with the state intervention cases many of them don't know the process and it needs to be explained to them and the same thing with the children although I Do treat the children like they my school children so I have a personal interest and all of them\nNow you have been in the on the court I think uh I noticed since two thousand eleven\nNow I'd just celebrated my ninth here in August is\nI'm Wondering if you've ever\nIn a situation where you might have been out at a public event and\nSome young person came up to and said hey you might not remember being but you're healthy along the road\nLife well you know it's funny that you say that\nA few months ago I was at a mile and a ... with a friend of mine and this woman came running out of the store and she said touch cap you want to just kept going on and I looked up and I recognized her right away she was about maybe Twenty years old\nAnd she said you saved my life thank you so much in she she just granting gave me a big hug and the kids [noise]\nAnd she said you committed made to the Y. S.

I'm I'm not looking for you to take a position here but I Want to give you an opportunity as you sat back\nUm was a distressing to see that or is that just part of our system where politics invariably a is involved in the three branches of government at the federal level including due to the judiciary [noise]\nWell one way to uh answer the question without commenting directly on um events or personality is I think is this you know tonight we're here in what I Would call the court of public opinion and everyone here\nIs entitled to have an opinion and perhaps does about almost anything and your opinion can be based on complete knowledge of the facts it could be based on some knowledge of the facts or you could have an opinion without really having any knowledge of the facts and\nAll the opinions are entitled to be respectfully considered and I can't insist that you accept my opinion\nAnd the court of public opinion and uh give up your opinion but in a lot caught in a courtroom where I happen to be today and I know judge justice cap you wanted was that's not the way it operates we don't have the luxury of coming into that courtroom with opinions\nWe come into the courtroom to listen to evidence and we also have rules to follow we don't make most of the rules that most of the rules are made by the governor and the legislature\nAnd we have to apply those rules are and look at the evidence and then make a decision and so I think if someone were to sit in a courtroom over some period of time and watch the way a court conducts business\nThat you would come away even if you don't agree with the decisions you would come away thinking that people are treated respectfully people listen to and uh and decisions I made that people have to give a reason for\nGoing I\nDon't think the last six weeks I've reflected well on anyone involved the Democrats the Republicans the process\nUm the makeup of the Supreme Court and um even the rule of law has suffered as a result of it I think people think that politics influence is far too many judicial decisions I think that's an accurate but I think that's the feeling that was left\nFrom the hearings over the course of the last six weeks I had the benefit a ... a year ago to attend the first circuit judicial conference and Justice Roberts spoke at the conference along with justice briar\nAnd a Justice Roberts who if you haven't heard him speak before is a is a real genuine human being you know you can Google his speech to his son's high school graduation class um and it left me with the impression that they're at least some adults in Washington who\nFree vets patriots software dot com\nPatriots software\nIn favor of gay men [noise]\nYou doing Lynn will build an insurance plan that protects how you live today

com\n[noise] gotten one Seventy five or any number to call [noise]\nJoin the conversation\n[noise]\nFinal segment coming up here it's a ... school of law that end over ... will get a phone caller and give you folks in this studio audience that idea about this is really a talk show let's go to I Believe Steve in Cambridge one of my best callers is on the line Steve how are you\nGetting Dan good evening panel it's Senator Elizabeth Warren has recently said uh the the criminal justice system in the United states is racist [laughter] [noise] yeah I Would hope that uh one of your panelists might respond to this statement [noise]\nOkay let's see if we get one or more of the criminal justice system I certainly think that's a huge overstatements Steve that stand re a lead to get a a comment from either the judges or dean corn\nBut I was just talking to a judge asking us about this\nI Believe that in our court system everyone is respected and everyone is treated with dignity it makes no difference what race they are are in the background we have just for us clientele\nBut I Believe everyone is is treated family I don't see it in a collection of that is a direct answer on judge Agnes or\nWell I I think it's it's a more\nProductive to talk about people rather than systems because systems are abstract then I think if you look at the people at work in the court system and the public deals found more often with staff\nPeople at the counter and the clerk's office to probation department the court offices a tremendous effort is made a to work on how people are treated and as a justice capital and upset to ensure that people are treated with respect\nAnd when you come to the subject of racism the law itself has evolved tremendously over the thirty years that I've been a judge\nAnd there is a much greater degree of accountability for the decisions that judges make that couldn't be impacted by\nThe color of someone's skin or they're ethnic backgrounds are and um it is not uncommon for a cases when there is some evidence that they may have been a factor for cases to be reversed and sent back for a new trial so I think the court is acutely aware\nOf no it's not just overt racism discrimination or but the implicit the implied sometimes the unknown a racist or discriminatory factors that may enter into decision making\nAn overdose before we talked to coin a caller I'd like to say that um I the judiciary that we see today is a much more diverse judiciary that it was Thirty years ago the follow up a judge I guess this statement and police departments and there are a rope police officers but police departments there in many major cities now\nOr the police departments a majority minority so uh that statement that Senator Warren made I think is in my opinion overstatement and probably may have been relevant fifty or more years ago but I don't think it is relevant or accurate today judge ... the same coin\n[laughter] I agree with everybody promoted [laughter]\nI agree with everything Dan has said into the judges upset but I Do want to say this I can understand where the sentiment that underlies or her comments come from\nUm if we think that people of color of the people of modest means get the saying a level of support or justice that I'm a Kennedy family member gets than we are mistaken right resources and status matter\nUm and it shouldn't matter because we're all supposed to be equal under the law but let's be realistic um where you might have started your journey and or the education you received and who your parents know and it's not just in the justice system it's in the real world is well out in business and everywhere else\nBut but let's be honest with each other it does make a difference where we may have started a journey and and what we look like and it shouldn't matter less\nI also always talk about when you inject politics I think senator war this is Dan Wright was injecting politics at a place that they needed not to be injected in my opinion if she was going to say that I think it would've been much more accurate if she applied the the phrase geology in the language the Jew gestures and didn't pay with as ...\nBrush another Steve from Cambridge thank you for the question appreciate very much we'll talk so let's get another question from our audience ...\nHi I'm John Dean coin what's on the mid term\n[laughter] I'm up for the two judges\nIn the interest of do miss to find the court I both of you deal with procedure law quite a bit I was wondering if you could pick just one procedure that people commonly make a mistake on either young new lawyers or non lawyers and try to clarify for somebody to understand\nWell in my car Rome I hop on rules sex which is now it is because there I\nTend to be some attorneys who will walk in and hand motion to the sessions put and expecting it to be heard right then and there\nAnd not realizing that you know there it has to be seven days and hands in ten days by mail and everyone has to process noticing the opportunity to be heard and that includes the attorneys and the other side\nSo sometimes attorneys will say that's OK the up and I say no you need to look at it and you have to you know develop your own argument you need time and self rule sex I have it on my bench I pass it out all the time never\nRules six okay particularly on the exam [laughter]\nDon't know if he's going to be a lawyer but I think it's going to be a comedian judge architectural hope that there's so many of those already I might I might just\nTo say in a general sense the importance of facts and not just the the law\nSo many decisions are depend on what the facts are and when a lawyer stands up and tells a judge you know judge this these are the facts but there is no you know support for that statement there is no after David there's been no testimony to support those facts\nAre that's usually a going to be a motion that fails\nUm so I think that we you know judges and lawyers a\nNeed to appreciate that everything begins and often cases and with the facts [noise]\nGood question um we're we're coming very quickly to the to the end of the hour and\nWould be remiss if I didn't ask each of you or to just um maybe a share with the audience at home and with the audience hear something that you would like to take away from this hour I Know was covered awash and hopefully we'll be mystified much uh\nThere were but be we could do many hours of this but is there are just a a closing thought a parting thoughts that each of you would share with us you know Fifteen seconds\nShow show my point is where my students and others who are listening\nOr every one up on this panel or or lawyers or you want to see it at the big table you got to put your working now a and B a lawyer to try and improve justice what many have you don't know is Dan was involved in one of the more important cases the Joseph ... case\nOr in the last Twenty years look it up um he did the right thing and got to move the government to do the right thing even more importantly so\nI'm with a law degree you can accomplish great things\nThank you thank you for a church\nI'm sitting\nHere and I'm looking out at the audience and in Nineteen Ninety I was sitting there and I was forty years old\nAnd one you know taking on a new career and ... did I ever think that today I Would be sitting here as a judge I Love my job I caught myself the other day getting off the bench and saying to myself and I speak to myself quite openly\nBut I Love my job and a and a great law school education and Joe ... many great colleagues and he\nSaid was telling dean coined many of the uh attorneys in my court in Pittsburgh and lemon string deadly a graduate just math school of law and told them I'm going to have a class reunion said my courtroom\nJudge I got about five said yeah I Would say in\nTeaching for over twenty five years and I would strongly urge you to think about the extent to which one lawyer\nCan save lives are just as a physician everyday saves lives you can transform people's lives and provide people future who had no future at all so don't give up on your dream and uh and and you can change the world in the\nAnd if I'm going to be a little tougher I Would say dereliction of duty\nOf some of the media not calling out the current mob tactics of the left and let's talk about moms tonight I Want\nTo hear from you six when seven to five for ten thirty\nAnd let's start off by defining what we're talking about that's always helpful because I think sometimes people talking past each other not I think they know a lot of miscommunication happens that way\nBecause people are so so ready and so eager to make their point and get in there and seeing or that they're not even listening to the other person so\nAnd when I'm Talking about ... tonight I'm not talking about the mafia or other sorts of\nBad criminal mobs I'm Talking about other kinds of criminal mobs\nCloaked under the guise of protesters I'm Talking about the months that we've seen the last two weeks\nNow surrounding the Kavanaugh hearings that people banging on the door at the Supreme Court um some zombie mobs I'm going to talk about in the next hour\nThe mom in Portland, Oregon just the stopping traffic and nearly taking down an elderly man who got out of his car it's this video is atrocious and\nWe can talk about that but the other point I Want to focus on is that the mainstream media it's really trying hard to deny this is happening to minimize it is what they're doing their minimizing violence which is\nReally interesting because after this month long discussion well photo discussion I Would say over violence against women now you have the same party\nThe same people\nWho are preaching about stopping violence against women perpetrate violence against everybody else including other women including Republican women you know for example um I have to look it up to the person that called senator ... Susan Collins a rape apologist\nFor her vote any of that like really I Know I Know everybody just\nWants to someone to have any rules anymore but I'm a stickler for you know the sorry I Am American and that is what separates us from the barbarians\nAnd a banana republics of the rest of the world is that we do or we used to believe in some rules um you know basic rules basic law and order basic\nPremise that if you have a problem you you address\nAnd approach that problem through the appropriate channels that is take your case to court take your case to your Congress person\nAn orderly fashion you know perhaps maybe make an appointment with that Congress person or a senator as opposed to attacking them in an elevator\nAnd committing a series of criminal acts as I see it you know things that\nYou know an orderly fashion but no no the mob doesn't want that they want chaos they want and violence and this has to stop and and everybody needs to call it out from every end of the political spectrum and from every corner of the media and what's really disturbing to me is that on CNN\nThere is this in the last couple of days there was it's unbelievable I just I Can't even believe I guess I really guess I should stop saying that because everything's believable these days because everybody is just completely relinquish any semblance of\nA civilization and everybody feels entitled to do whatever they want whenever they want as loud as they want it and just the rest of us who believe in safety for our personal selves in our in our family um have to just sit here and stuff it well now I'm not going to stuff it I'm going to call it out for what it is and it's\nCriminality it's not protest okay protest require a permanent\nThat's the way we do things in America\nLegally and rub Brooks me an excellent point we were talking before I came on air ... as he so is do we put it a mob does not have to be thousands of people a mob can be just a handful month can be three people must could be two people they have weapons or if their if their hands themselves or weapons\nThem it does that's what I'm Talking about I'm Talking about this attacking of administration\nOfficials and then Ted Cruz and his wife in restaurants on private property enough\nWe need to stand up against it because this is going to get someone hurt and it's\nIt's not funny it's not appropriate and people have to learn how to deal\nWith their disappointment Trump was elected okay you know it's two years ago do something if you want to do something about it and get yourself elected go run for office do something hard I don't know go to law school if you want free health care than go to medical school like do some name\nDo something that requires you putting on the effort to effect positive change but what you're not allowed to do is run around the country attacking people uh in encouraging violence and\nBecoming a perpetrator yourself now here's the conversation on CNN where ... one of the anchors ... Baldwin was talking to\nUm she was talking to one of the one of the contributors and she said she wanted to move past the AMA word\nBecause and I'm quoting her part of the weaponization of what's happening now on the right\nOkay so see you see that do you see now now mob you see what they're doing now when somebody says am word\nOr you know the letter and they ... right and then they say word it means you we can't say that word anymore we all know the words like that\nThat you're not allowed to say so when they put mob in that category now they're telling us that we can call out a mob for what it is the am worried she doesn't want to talk about the N word are you kidding me [noise] and then there's this\nEric Holder former attorney general top law enforcement official of our country\nThis is pathetic and this is quoted him\nTo a cheering crowd apparently quote Michelle Obama always says when they go low we go high no no when they go low we kick them\nWow insight to violence much Eric Holder this this is unacceptable politicians on the left the Democratic party pleas for the love of everything that is wholly in this country and for everybody's protection there has got to be some same Democrats in that party\nI don't know in the mold of Joe Lieberman even Al Gore back in the day when he was a moderate I like I'm I'm I'm scrambling to come up with names of somebody who might have\nSome modicum still of love for America and love for\nDoing things in a temperate fashion to calm this down that's what I Want to talk about you're listening to night sides Marie said Franco filling in for an array\nLike side with Dan Rather news watch never stops W seizing news radio tens or [noise]\nDoes your plan for retirement and corporate tax efficient strategy because we think it should ... certified financial planner and cofounder of S.

up all pay the legal fees\nAt a Trump rally unacceptable\nYes and uh the um there are good people on both sides when somebody was killed in Charlottesville unacceptable and so I think that\nThe mob

give me a specific\nUh okay I'm Sorry I Can't give you a specific it's been a while but during the elections\nBecause he did that we don't they see you know I have a hard and fast rule mark no conclusively statements know generalizations if we're going to have a debate on the issue we have to debate fair enough\nFair enough so why I just wanted to say that I Do think that what we're seeing on the left is a reaction to what we had seen on the right um\nI disagree with that will two wrongs don't make a raft first of all that lot\nSaying that they do make right I'm saying that one now though a bond with that when they go low we go high they didn't see that\nWhen Al Franken left and and and Trump said that he he left without a fight you refer to easily in a way seems like a call to

um\nSo that's I mean that's kind of not germane um and when I see\nSo so you're saying that Michelle Obama said we go high and it didn't work well with all the wet windy you lose when election and now that entitles them to just\nGet in everybody's everybody's faces stopped traffic sit all the way\nTo phrase bill Marr a I think he says I think you know where he says I agree with that\nThe only way

a leader show you can correct me but I'm pretty positive that night that did not happen and the Tea Party people again I don't agree with a lot of you know the things on both sides but\nUm I I if I if I'm called upon to tell the truth the truth is the Tea Party did not sit a bunch of people have crossed Ninety three and high traffic and cost a lot of people time money and I'm aggravation\nAnd then

Obama was a Bill Clinton and I didn't agree with them but they don't they get a lot to do will crush them saying to states and that's the way the process work\nAnd you know we weren't out there screaming and yelling and and dance around and causing the sort of issues or or the sort of distractions\nThat you've been describing you know with them while you know there have been happening within the last a\nCouple of weeks or so and it just mhm it's just such a you know it's such a\nDetriment to to how society should work how democracy should work and it's just it's just it's really disheartening it's very disheartening mhm\nWell my well my first of all I have to I'm honored thank you for calling in um I take that as a high complement and um it is and that's why I'm Talking about this because it didn't happen it didn't happen during Clinton didn't happen during Obama with Republicans doing that\nAnd you know people always like to point to this oh well Mitch McConnell said we want to make a bomb a one term president and they as if that's evidence of that that the Republicans acting as badly as um as bad\nAs the Democrats are now and I kind of I just to sit mesmerized at the stupidity of that statement because\nMitch McConnell saying we want to make a Democratic president a one term president isn't normal that's what the opposition that's what the opposite party does write the opposition very much so and he didn't say we're going to take them down by any means necessary you didn't say we're going to bang on the doors of the of the Senate and we're going to\nRoute be rowdy and we're gonna\nWe're gonna get you in all the places where you eat you know and what what was the thinking in your face they that's how they did it they did it through elections and you know through the process right\nRight toward the process and it's just such it just so just heartening to see what has been happening and again garbled so which side you are in terms of you know the the capital or thing or other things have been happening in the Trump Administration\nI mean in all honesty you know I I was not and I'm Still not a Trump guy you know I was I was more about your went after McCain back when you know he said those statements\nBut again he's approaching United States right now and [noise] you know everybody to go ahead and the process is what the process is and it takes to get to do what people are doing\nRight now which I don't recall ever happening in the past in terms of a a bomber and then is ration or Clinton the desperation or buts about Pearl is hard back 'cause I go it's just unacceptable\nAbsolute that's it they ... that is exactly right Mike and that's I mean I keep saying that um because somebody has to take down the left the heat the heat or several several several notches 'em and get everybody to calm down and\nChannel their frustration whatever you want to call and I think I'm being nice by the same frustration but channel it in the proper procedure all method that's life that's how life works\nAgreed and you know I Would I Would stand up and and argue against or really be upset about somebody doing a ... a democratic you know
