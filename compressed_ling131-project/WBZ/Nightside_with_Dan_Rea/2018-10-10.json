they sent a big signal to the world markets that this stuff was for real\nAnd it's been fascinating me watch every state down the east coast suddenly decide they want to get into the offshore wind business because of the work that we did here in Massachusetts and I take tremendous pride in that\nIn addition to that one of the only states that's invested in storage\nStorage is ultimately how you really bring deepwater wind onshore wind and solar to the fore because it makes it possible for him up those assets that they can be used twenty four seven I think in many ways we are moving in the right direction and we're moving aggressively were leaving the country in a number of these areas\nFor bottle not nearly aggressively enough uh we've got eight hundred megawatts of offshore wind up being a developed a in the near future\nEight hundred more to come we need to be doing it much quicker than we currently are we should mandate the development of the additional sixteen hundred megawatts\nA governor bakers put various constraints on solar development we've actually lost jobs in the solar industry as a result of it I Would lift those constraints we need to be much bolder about this I Want to I Want to come back to the question there's\nA point about natural gas we were just reminded or because of this tragedy and the ... valley you know somebody lost his life\nUh many people were injured there are thousands of people whose lives have been disrupted by this\nGovernor Baker and I have a different philosophy I think about the role of government and uh this is an area where it's a really important reminder governors there to protect us and the state agency that was that is supposed to protect us\nFrom ah the gas companies and keeping us safe the federal government told the Baker administration weeks before the ... valley incident that they did not have enough inspectors I Would hire multiple times times the inspectors and make sure we're being proactive and overseeing the gas company sequel time\nWell first of all I'm safety is everybody's number one priority on this and it's a joint relationship between the state in the federal government the managers are natural gas infrastructure [noise] then that's federal government that came to review the Massachusetts pipeline safety program gave us fifty points out of fifty points so perfect score\nOr an addition to that in two thousand Seventeen\nDeep EU the eleven hundred investigations which was far more than they've done in any of the previous five or six years so we need to do more on this yes and that's one of the reasons why\nAfter the the Lawrence\nNorth Andover in Andover incident\nAs an abundance of caution\nThe deep you is putting out of bed to bring a third party to do a top to bottom review of the entire natural gas infrastructure in Massachusetts and the policies and procedures that are in place to protect that but this is obviously something we all need to take seriously and I've spent a tremendous amount of time up there ever since the end is that um incident\nAnd the disaster working with families with shelters with the mayor's with\nLocal officials and others to do everything we possibly can to make sure people get their heating water back safely frequently\nGo ahead it's not enough and you know the old Republican playbook a smaller government\nOr has shown us what the consequences of that are ... the federal government in this report said there weren't enough inspectors and the regulatory regime the oversight regime relied on the gas companies that are selling governor bakers campaign coffers to basically oversee themselves\nAnd that is not the way they should work I'm going to hire multiple times the inspectors to make sure government which is the one institution has only interest is to protect us is overseeing a the gas companies and the work they're doing on our gas pipeline infrastructure go ahead\nThe by the Trump Administration and the Republican Congress posted at the time\nTo basically punish colleges and universities\nI don't think we should be public punishing colleges and universities I think we should be investing in Mr Gonzales one minute\nIt wasn't originally proposed by competent pending legislation on beacon health for a while but here's why it makes sense because the status quo for education system is not good enough\nAnd it isn't good enough for our transportation system I'm going to aim high I'm going to take on these big challenge I Want every child and family and the state to have access to high quality affordable child care preschool I Want a young person in Brockton to have the same educational opportunity as a young person in Brooklyn\nI Want her public universities in community colleges to be affordable and debt free for any rather than who wants to go without being burned by student loans and yes I Want to fix our transportation system so that it actually works for people\nAnd we need to invest more to do that and this proposal is fair it would raise a billion dollars which would get started in a meaningful way on these agenda items and these universities I agree they are important to our economy\nBut based on the average rate annual rate of growth of these endowments over the last Fifteen Years they can afford this tax do everything they do today and air dominance will still grow I Am I Believe the more important to our economy is our people and that's what I'm going to fight for ... for the first\nThing is if you think about what my opponent just laid out it adds up to at least four or five billion dollars annually all by itself so his proposal\nAs misguided as it is doesn't come close to covering what he's talking about actually paying for so let's get into the discussion about what he chose to make his decisions when he actually had his hand on the Tiller when he worked in state government\nUnder his management of secretary as a sectarian ministry of finance it cut her early childhood education by eighty five million dollars at the same point in time that state spending grew by six and a half billion\nThat's the decision he made when he actually had to make a choice we've increased spending an early childhood education over the past four years by over a hundred million dollars that's the choice we may\nThere's a lot of fuzzy math they're out but I'm telling people what I'm going to do is governor not what I did when I worked for governor Patrick and what I'm going to do for as governor is actually trying to make progress on these issues that are holding people back affordable childcare and preschool is huge\nAnd what governor Baker's doing isn't nearly enough to make a difference for people to make it affordable for everyone\nAnd to provide the high high quality services that will make a meaningful difference in kids' lives evidence is clear on this in his game changing for young kids and it allows their parents to go to work\nI think this is the thing we can do that can have the biggest return on investment for kids and families in this state and yes I Will ask the wealthy to pay more in taxes so that we can do it because I don't think where we are right now is good enough what bottle\nWe invested over a hundred million a new money in this because we believe it makes a big difference too but we actually made that decision to invest a hundred million dollars when he was in a position to make a decision about whether to invest in this or not he cut it by eighty five million dollars\nYou know he can talk all we want about the fact that he's got a billion dollars to spend you just gave you for five billion dollars worth of items he wanted to spend it on he's not going to be able to spend on all of them and that means they'll go back to doing the same thing that he did before which is not delivering on a commitment not delivering on a promise an over selling what's possible here\nIt's not true and back then I was managing a budget during the ... the great recession worse fiscal crisis estate had faced in decades\nOr I Am saying I'm going to raise taxes on the wealthy by a billion dollars in my first year and two billion dollars more in my last year so that we can make these investments and and it is a lot more and we'll make a lot more progress then governor Baker who refuse he he at the same old Republican playbook\nNo new taxes and we know what we get for that working families being left behind\nWell go ahead if you want you already spent a billion dollars of the two billion of the three billion or whatever it was on our transportation conversation now he's spending it on our education conversation even though he's put more money on the table than what's actually been proposed that addition to that we did spend a hundred million more on early childhood that because we believe in it\nWe also increased total state and local spending on K. through twelve education by nine hundred million dollars five hundred million from the commonwealth four hundred million at the state at the local level we have the highest graduation rate we've ever had the lowest drop out rate we've ever had [noise]\nWe believe investing in education and we've had the opportunity to prove it we put our money where our mouth was people\nTime that I'm going to have bonnet small ball status quo stuff\nIt's inflationary increases it's not what we need the Baker administration is about to get sued by school districts across the state\nBecause they're underfunded and they're huge disparities in our public school system I will not accept that as governor I Want us to aim high and make a difference the most important thing we do collectively through government is ensure that every single child has access to great public education and I'm running to make sure we deliver on that apple ...\nThis is talk about the status quo if I was the status quo governor sit still be thousands of homeless families living in hotels and motels and Massachusetts their art if I were the status quo governor we wouldn't have a huge offshore wind hydro program going on to replace a third of our fossil fuels\nWith clean renewable energy if I was a status quo governor Bridgewater state hospital would still be a stain on the commonwealth reputation instead of the hospital that was supposed to be you talked to families there it's like night and day with respect to what that place with like once upon a time if I was the status quo governor to health connector\nWhich crashed\nDuring the previous administration and left hundreds of thousands of people struggling to figure out if they actually held had health insurance or not [noise] wouldn't be working which it is and is now serving two hundred and Seventy five thousand people here in the Massachusetts\nWe've done a lot of really important and good things that I simply do not buy for a minute this notion that we've been a status quo administration alright go ahead and have a response\nAnd then I Do want to move on it's not nearly enough that's not an ambitious agenda there's so much more we need to do to make a difference for working families in the state that so I'm going to fight for I'm going to provide bold leadership on climate change you were forced by a court\nTo to make progress or you got to the grade from climate organizations who think you're not doing enough and you're not\nSo I'm going to provide the bold leadership we need we are going to aim high one of the things I Love about the state is we have always been a leader we've always believe we can overcome any challenges we put our mind to it and work for and that's the type of governor I'm going to be will come back to one more issue in this job though at\nWhen he is still around the state budget\nCuts that department of children and families so that's about as little guys you can get you're talking about the most at risk families here in the commonwealth of mess he cut their budgets by over a hundred million dollars\nAgain when state spending went up by six point five billion so this has nothing to do with the recession\nWe've increased spending on D. C. F. by a hundred and eighty million dollars because we believe we should be investing and the little guys and the little girls and the moms and\nAre associated with that agency we've hired hundreds of social workers tons of clinical support case caseloads are as low as they've ever been we took office forty percent of the social workers at the sea of were licensed now it's Ninety nine point six percent and we've hired\nLiterally hundreds of administrative staff discipline\nTheir work that's what I talk about when I talk about helping and delivering in a real way to people in Massachusetts who really need the government to perform\nEqual time then I Will move on go ahead\nOr it's not enough on telling people what I'm going to do as governor\nAnd we're going to aim high we're going to take on these big challenges they're going to make a difference in people's lives and being honest about the fact we're going to the wealthy to pay more in taxes so that we can do it and it's it's a very clear choice people are going to have in this election as we're hearing\nA you know for governor Baker his his ambition is to improve management of some areas and to me that's not good enough or we need we deserve more from our governor particularly now when we got a federal government that has taken us backwards and so many areas it's it's more important than ever than we've got real leadership here\nAll right let's move on to another question that's actually related here you've been talking about taxes and working families Edward an unemployed older worker rights to us quote\nMy immediate need is property tax reduction I'm paying twenty percent of my income to city hall what little ear administrators shouldn't do to give me some relief end quote Mr Gonzales one minute\nWell part of the reason there's so much pressure on property taxes is because the state is falling down its constitutional obligation to adequately fund public schools\nSo I have a plan on like governor Baker to raise three billion dollars in taxes on the wealthy\nTo uh invest in education and transportation and we're going to say we're going to increase the pie in terms of the states support for public school districts across the state we are going to reform the formula that hasn't been reform for twenty five years to make sure that we're properly accounting for the costs of school districts have\nAnd that will relieve pressure on property taxes at the local level governor Baker has no plans to invest more in our public school system he's proud of the fact that he's managed to provide inflationary increases in good economic times and that is not good enough\nFor governor Baker one minute look I just first of all I'm ever would would I Would say that we have supported in the past and have continued to support an advocate\nFor giving people a property tax relief or over the age of sixty five and many local communities have chosen to do that we think pursuing that on state wide basis would be a good idea as well\n'em to not punish people who just don't have any any money by holding them a by holding them in prison simply because they can't pay their bill\nI think those are all good things and I'm Glad we done which goes all his one minute\nI think our criminal justice system is the biggest civil rights issue of our time\nOther huge racial disparities and arrest ray and incarceration rates and we need to take this on I've got a very progressive agenda\nOn the legislature thankfully took the lead on this and a path to build it takes a fair number of great steps in the right direction I think we can go further in some areas I I support eliminating all mandatory minimum sentences except for murder\nOr I think we need to make sure that we are really investing in a diversionary programs to make sure we are addressing the underlying causes of crime like mental illness and addiction\nUh I think we should eliminate cash fail and reform our system that season fines even further to make sure we aren't jailing people just because they're poor which is happening\nUm we have a much higher incarceration rate than most other countries in the world were jamming way too many people for way too long we're not getting the outcomes we need we can make communities safer and I'm going to provide the bold leadership to make sure we get there for a bottle [noise]\nUm well first of all I agree with several things that um my opponents on um I Would say two things I part of the reason we took on their Bridgewater state hospital issue\nWas because of the horrible tragedies that have taken place there over the course of literally Thirty years um and that was a tough problem to solve but we solved it and\nI think in many ways where many people think about the history of incarceration here in Massachusetts Bridgewater is usually the thing that comes right to the top of the pile I'll give you another example um for years here in Massachusetts Thirty years if you're a woman who is civil they committed due to a problem with respect to addiction\nAnd you've got sent the Framingham state prison with no treatment\nWe changed again working with the legislature in a bipartisan basis we got legislation passed the creative treatment capacity a ... state hospitals so if you're a woman and you get committed to substance use\nDisorder is she'll now actually received or they do they not receive treatment at that time state hospital or I think in many ways um we have a long way to go on this issue but I Do believe here in Massachusetts we're making progress and the final thing I'll say 'cause I think it's important for your audience to know um Massachusetts is tied I think what Vermont\nFor having the lowest incarceration right in the country I'm\nAt and when I say lower I mean it's literally like hugely lower than it is and many other parts and I think we've done many things right we have a long way to go but we do a lot of things well\nFor a bottle it's still way too high and um the governor is still sending people who are addicted and haven't committed a crime to the department of corrections facility and planet\nOr where they are getting the treatment they need and I would and that um one one other point that's related to our criminal justice system which is our state police or their\nCorruption is rampant at the state police there have been eight people indicted three people who pled guilty for crimes committed on governor bakers latch Nineteen months ago the first incident of abuse was reported it took the governor twelve months to propose a series of reforms\nIt's six months since then and the number of those reforms haven't been implemented\nHe needs to take charge of this and\nIt's interesting to me he hasn't fired a single person at the state police were there a number of troopers had been investigated and others who've been at people who oversaw this had been able to retire and run off into the sunset with our taxpayer funded pension money you're going to fire someone at the state police governor\nWell let me start by saying first of all that many members of his own party or my opponents on party called his accusations and demands with respect to the state police political Monteith I'm\nEight troopers had been referred by the current colonel that our leadership team to the attorney general of the U.S attorney for investigation\nForty eight every single indictment every single plea deal though there are people\nWho are administration and the colonel actually submitted to law enforcement to review and determine if they committed a crime [laughter]\nUm I think the thing is outrageous I'm Glad we blew up true be which is where the vast majority of this was going on and by the way it's been going on for a long time there's documentation and public records show that this was going back before our ministry shouldn't even began we discovered it we pursued it and we ended and I think that's exactly the way we should have performed\nGo ahead Mr ... governor ... then governor for four years and this has been happening on his watch and he just hired\nNineteen months after the first incident was reported just hire someone to take a look at the payroll and personnel practices at the state police ah it's unacceptable\nAnd there are a lot of people who I've been talking to who are very frustrated about what's happening there this kinda thing\nImpacts people's perception of government which is dangerous when government loses credibility with people because government is a positive force in people's lives that is the vehicle through which we empower each other and support each other and protect each other\nAnd we need to maintain the public's trust\nAnd governor banker with the state police has lost it and it's taken way too long to get a handle on what's going on there I Would fire the colonel and I would put someone in place who wasn't an insider and who would come in from the outside and have credibility to clean up the problems at the state police go ahead\nColonel do the investigation she led the investigation she's the one that gave the data\nTo the U.S attorney in to the attorney general that they could then use to prosecute the violators and ah [noise]\nAnd and pursue their uh their behavior\nI think the colonel is doing the right thing she put GPS devices and all the cruise or she set up a quarterly audits for all overtime work you have to go face to face now both of beginning in the end of your shift she brought an even why to do a full review of the of the accounting financial and administrative practices department and the final thing I'll say here because it's important\nYou know that first string they started the polls Nineteen months ago that my opponent talked about\nThey actually had to do the work associated with determining where that went before they could actually submit the documentation to the attorney general into the U.S attorney and they wanted to make sure they got it right well guess what they did and that's why people are playing out now and while the U.S attorney is issuing a arrest warrants for these guys and they should equal time sir [noise]\nNineteen months since that first report\nAnd it was a lot of media reports of other problems that ended up kicking the Baker administration and action on this side good enough you can make your whole case for being governor that you're going to be a great manager and then over see an agency that are in fact multiple people who've been indicted\nOr taking way too long to get a handle on it\nAside from other problems that the environmental police ah which we've been reading about in a number of other agencies I Am going to clean up and take charge on these management practices and six managers but the big difference between us\nAs managing while isn't good enough for me I'm going to aim high take on some of the big challenges we face and make sure we make a difference for working families across the state\nThat on that note gentleman our time is up thank you governor Baker Mr Gonzales we appreciate it\nAnd thank you for watching a just one important reminder before we say goodnight if you are not registered to vote please note that the deadline to do so is Wednesday October seventeenth voting day of course is November sick for weeks from

from\nBuying an honor to be done on last night\nRomney lie on the from the\nDuring the second half debate I think the first half of the debate I'm Jake ... ah did very well second half of the debate or where the governor focused upon the tax proposal\nThat Mr Gonzales is putting forward a and also the comparisons between how much his administration is spent on a lot of programs like schools and\nI'm a homeless programs and all of that uh versus some of the cuts that were made under the Patrick administration went shaking so this was the secretary of an administration and finance question from a listener from a from a viewer I should say about property tax reduction as well\nUh there were themes themes to this debate and I'm curious if you picked up on the same themes I did a\nJacobs Alice or who make no mistake about the fact that um he is\nSignificantly smaller than the um well over six foot governor Baker Baker is probably six six six seven six eight somewhere in that vicinity of\nJay ... is a five three uh and he joked about his own stature last week and kind of refer to it as a David and Goliath\nA standoff if you will uh he um he accused the governor\nThe bigger opponent of engaging in small ball stuff well Jay Gonzales insisted he was fighting for the little guys uh he talked about again taxing the wealthy and talked about aiming high all sooner interesting metaphors that he used\nUm the governor uh basically characterized the MBTA ... as a mess but the mess that he and his administration are trying to improve and fix\nOr there was a question in the third segment of from the moderator John Keller from channel for about lives with Warren's comment on the criminal justice system is being broken from a racist I should say from front to back\nA Baker chose not to attack that are really not even criticize that comment by the senior senator saying that he agrees there were problems that need to be fixed well Jacobs\nThat said look as far as he's concerned the criminal justice system is the biggest civil rights issue of our time\nAnd he proposed a progressive agenda or in which he would eliminate all minimum mandatory sentences except for murder\nOr he also suggested that he would eliminate\nCash bail then there was a discussion about the uh corruption and the ongoing investigations are at the Massachusetts state police whatever ... or ... the prosecutions of course have occurred on the watch of governor Baker and Kevin Baker sort of tried to deflect that still\nA it's a it also again I'm just this may have been the first time\nThat many voters had a chance to\nTake a look and and and they listen if you will to Jacobs ... um he is a a both he and\nGovernor Baker I think are very\nSimilar they they may be very dissimilar inside but I think they're similar in terms of experience having worked uh in prior administrations Baker having worked obviously for Bill weld and then\nHaving his own administration and Jake and tell us having worked for governor Patrick I think the the clearest difference between the two of them and the difference that I think Jay Gonzales was trying to emphasize and he did I think emphasize\nPretty effectively is that he would raise taxes he said that he would raise three billion dollars in taxes one billion dollars in taxes increasing taxes on the wealthy\nAnd two billion dollars in taxes if I have my fingers ... strict strike that two billion or taxing the wealthy\nWhich would take a constitutional amendment in Massachusetts by the way a and\nA billion dollars in tax in colleges and universities\nSo you you have I think a classic\nProgressive Democrat and Jacob's Alice who is essentially looking for the government to do a lot more for a lot more for more people and you have Charlie Baker\nAs a Republican but a moderate Republican certainly distancing himself from Donald Trump and distancing himself\nFrom Jeff deal the Republican Senate candidate and no one no one having much comment about Elizabeth Warren it was absolutely no question asked that I can recall\nOr really no comment made the only reference to war and that I heard was the comment that she made a a which generate a lot of controversy at the time and will continue to generate a lot of current controversy the criminal justice system in her opinion races from front to\nBack so now that's my take on it\nI'd love to know your tank I Would love to know if any minds have been changed if you\nAs as a consequence of listening to this debate tonight are more likely to vote for either one of these candidates or less likely to vote for either one of these candidates the two top races in Massachusetts this fall the U.S Senate seat\nWas withdrawn defending her seat a and Charlie Baker a Republican defending his seat as governor\nAnd both of them sort of stepping away from the fray that the other is involved in um\nCharlie Baker separating himself I think from Jeff deal a and I'm In ... I think would\nI was surprised he didn't actually a brace more uh of what Elizabeth Warren has stood for because his platform and his policies very consistent with all those records so that's my take

lose amongst Republicans agree or disagree let's go to\nSean and Sean intro said hey John you were in next in the ring central ...\n... an hour at great what's on your mind tonight\nWell um I didn't catch the debate I got out of work but I Want to um\nThey have Charlie Baker and um\nThe other guy uh chickens all us have a lot more in common you realize when they both got when a Baker get out of government he wants to run the healthcare company and when Jay Gonzalez a level of government and finding it he also went and ran a healthcare company\nOf which I worked for\nSo I Know Jake ... dollars and I don't know him personally but I Know very well afterwards and went through years with him I don't want to say what I did but uh he's a very nice guy very articulate but a lot of this\nCompany question that he's a right no of course he left the nice guy there's no question right good good yeah\nYeah I have to be at that level yet to be a people person at that level so my only critique of Jay I'm is that a company it was the head of a loss the Medicaid contract and before that\nHe knew that that he left the company before that was announced to go run for governor satisfy only knock on him that he should have turned it around but you know maybe I should give them the benefit of the doubt but I just wanted to point out that both of them had that background and health care and\nI'm voting for Charlie Baker that must be something about Massachusetts that loves to have um you know that's the split thing between the government being Republican and be a Senate and House Democrat\n... does that ... that has happened to like let me ask you this what do you think about ... the Saudi then hey I'm going to raise your taxes and I'm going to drill not your tax is going to raise the taxes on wealthy people and on colleges and universities that some\nHe talked about that a week ago Wednesday night when he was here in Studio he's going to raise taxes by three billion dollars going to tax the wealthy and tax colleges and universities the wealthy to imagine\nColleges and universities one billion\nYeah I think it's got the\nYou know I mean I understand that the wealthy people but colleges and universities even though like you know they're not all like Harvard that have thirty two billion a down that\nA lot of these people there's a lot of these colleges are struggling and closing that you know so I think it's a really got the move on his part I don't know they'll get it um but uh I'm I'm supporting Charlie Baker I think he's level headed and uh I I think that the um\nYou know from what I Know from Jay and again I give them the benefit of the doubt I think Charlie it's a much better candidate\nUm\nI I just like personally how he's conducted himself and um\nYou know there there was one point which I thought was interesting and and again you didn't listen to the debate or you didn't hear the debate so I but at one point\nOr ... basically looked at Baker and said you need to get out and you need to ride MBTA in computer at a commuter rail seemed to get out there and uh and talked to commuters I'd love to hear from some\nTea riders or a commuters and see if first of all if they're satisfied with the service they're getting a and if they're not who do they blame for it because obviously ... is hoping Jacobs I was hoping that some MBTA\nRiders are will will turn around and and and vote against Charlie Baker because of that aggravation or any good\nTransportation this country and the state has been like the immigration policy and and the country it's it's really always been a problem unless you know\nYou know the big dig all the problems the cost overrun the MBTA transportation just seems to be the real issue in this state you know that that can never seemed to get it done\nWell we spent twenty two billion dollars in the big dig and we were told that when the big dig was done everything would be taking care of well the big guys done\nAnd twenty two now again is people sort of world news really non our money is the federal money it's federal money well guess what\nAh there's plenty of other programs in other states around the country everybody gets their piece of the action and eventually that right that's right and then he cost us I don't know it was interesting statistic that I think it was John Keller\nQuoted which I did not realize it said that Boston drivers spend more time waiting in traffic than in any other part of the country including New York and Los Angeles\nI got to be honest with you having driven a little bit in Los Angeles many years ago when it was a nightmare a nightmare I find that statistic\nKind of hard to believe I don't know how they figure those numbers out by the way but\nAt this coincides with the program it did a little a segment on this on sixty minutes the other night about traffic in California and and how people when they're in the tropics they're much more laid back there doing yoga they're passing the ball\nWhat they would chat thing was because of California that people are much more laid back about it where on the east coast a maniac and and ah you know where where a competitive and academic and you know rushing to to get what we need to be\nHis [laughter] I didn't see the CBS or the or sixty minutes piece I can understand how someone might be trying to do yoga in the car but well he's a passing a ball what do they do I'm standing outside the ring yeah yeah I like\nIt a point they were trying to make was\nBecause California is always considered a laid back steak that they adopt a more laid back approach just sitting in traffic a than we do on the east coast I mean you know you get road rage on the east coast you get all that sort of things and what they were just saying\nI'm not sure I agree but there was a jet thing that people of California much more laid back on that as far\nAs I'm getting to places I'm not sure I buy that but that's what they were saying let me\nTell you people in a lot of in a lot of cities in California is watching the paper today of a A N people demonstrators are blocking traffic in Portland, Oregon out in the west coast that we are seeing what's going on in San Francisco\nYou have to literally walk over drug addicts and homeless people in the streets of San Francisco\nOr that aspects of California I Hope stays out of California drawn together on thank you much\nOkay my friend ...\n...

everything and how we improve things and\nI'm the one thing I wanted to hang is that I might have be\nA minority in this but I ride the commuter rail often enough [noise] and I think on to him the train from limited to fish for on how much schedule when ... when they put that in track and for good and twenty sixteen [noise]\nAre they the training a much better schedule\nYeah he's joining an afternoon schedule\nYeah he talked he talked about that so that he took credit for that you're absolutely right\n[noise] and the people that can only for a friendly whenever I called ask about time they very friendly [noise]\nSo you're so you're happy and you're likely to vote for him to I assume vote for him to be reelected\nMake it that I don't know enough about that that the president that you know\nYeah that's the only guys the advantage of the incumbency no doubt about that [laughter] they got a record in ... as if it's a good one it helps if it's not so good it doesn't help so much and thank you so much great theory of linking him ... to let's go next to Joe Miller's Joe you're next on night side you're ... or the debate on the governor's race go joke\nIs are high didn't takes taking my call\nI listen to the debate and basically what it boils down to a tax and spend Democrat grow government and [noise] I'm Charlie Baker how how much he is a Republican he wants to cut costs and get the most for a dollar basically that's what it boils down to for me\nSo I'm assuming you voted for him four years ago and you get to November huh I did and you know give him a grade so you voted for him how happy are you with much sort of a grade would you give him a C plus oh that's not a great great\nWell it's good enough for where I Want to work with what the legislature that's as good as he that they are going to let him do okay let's face it um but I can I revisit the election four years ago with Martha Coakley well sure go ahead\nI I I remember quite vividly um abortion came up in that election and I think the thing that soccer was she wanted to allow sixteen and Seventeen year old young ladies to get abortions without their parents' consent\nAnd I believe that was a hot topic issue and um I I think that's what's soccer in the end\nWell she lost by forty thousand votes I'm not sure that was the issue but it's I was a\nLot of big issue for parents to know a lot of\nPeople vote on that issue there's no doubt about that well there are some parents who don't want to know joke there are some parents not ... not all but some parents would like to know some parents wouldn't like\nTo know I I agree Jan um but I just think that was a defining moment in a ... to ... for the Democrats for\nYears ago I think that that Martha Coakley who I Know and who I liked very much personally but I think that she also carry the baggage from two years before when she sort of when she ran and lost the Scott Brown and had some real missteps in terms of\nNot shaking hands with people or or comedy what am I supposed to do shake hands outside Fenway Park I think that she's a tough time shaking that image of being a bit of an elitist\nI Would like to see how a Democrat would really act if they didn't have such fringe portions of the party actually just dragging them to the left\nTell you this I think that what the more they get dragged left is going to hurt them eventually maybe not a mess\nIt's just been a lot of places around the country joke\nI agree ... listen I'm going to cut it off and let someone else had a crack at it thank you you\nHave a great night Joe let me go to Alan Boston as you are an extra nice to have got to get you in one more in al go right ahead\nDance always a pleasure to talk to I think it shows great I just want to\nSay that I'm Glad I listen to the debate tonight and then senator I'm Asian about some of the ... both of them a gentleman I had some good ideas someone that I didn't agree with the one thing I met my main point was basically I kind of agreed with Karen but I think\nOverall it and and be kind of gets that route and like I Know it's a perfect certainly but it just kind of get ... like when they talk about the transportation system that always gets brought up in the money and everything\nAnd I I agree with some of the other cars and the tax the taxes are already way too high as it has so I think both both guys had some interesting ideas\nI think it's going to be the end up there in ... elections coming up in November\n... I I Love your enthusiasm here's my question did you vote for Charlie Baker less time or no I could I voted for bigger guy actually that give them a grave he's been governor now almost four years what sort of agree would you give them\n[noise] I mean I don't want to ask I personally am I going to look at the end it was but I don't know I don't know other what other people\nWill be able to be I Would not a bad grade I'm assuming if you give them a B a B plus likely going to vote for him this time around as well\nUm I was the only thing I didn't like I I got a great idea about tax or some other universities I don't I mean I thought those kind of good ideas or that your caller said and um yeah\nI probably wouldn't vote for a while I'm leaning towards back you're correct that is a clear issue Baker says ... says yes and that one that one is very clear and people can understand it sure appreciate your calling you as always thank you downgrade now let me go to Cathy in ... after your next on nights I go to Jeff\nAnd I'm I just wanted a real quick I think that that that Baker had shown real leadership in terms of the Columbia gas situation um you know from a standpoint of someone who is ... ... for the past ten years you know\nThose red tape EU a duck it many many times I think there's a lot of change that needs to happen on not just from that perspective of electronic but also from gas and the tea and I think some of these issues that are coming to light to highlight some of the ...\nThat we have on the bus um I think you know Charlie Chan and ... and when you kind of care to what we went through a poor thing she thousand eight and governor Patrick\nAnd you know people without power here for two weeks it was you know no one knew what the hell to do with my French well\nLet me ask you this do you do fault him for allowing the situation to develop in the first place I mean this is this a lot of old infrastructure up there and all the\nFacts here and they were in the ... debt free placing pie you know that night I stayed up and I was reading some of the docket information going back\nIn may when Columbia gas tighter placing the hype and you know it's kind of astounding\nThat all these things get kind of slide under the radar and I think now because at that and you know because it is something that just happened in ... we're going to change that Bob and I think that's really important that people face ... went on and ... Hitler\nYou know will the people that have gas you know we need to not to let it go and help that oh well they'll change that far\nI think it would all agree on that things can be a good you know one of the war much of a night to the\nCallers on the line or we're going to change topics uh apologized but I Wish you called earlier will take a quick break here comes the ten o'clock news dawn how we

making stuff up in the hopes of making a few bucks running a phony book let me get that white out on the table\nThat is very true it is very true and you know I have a strange about it and I think it can appreciate this because I you know I I think you're a man of facts\nI think that's [laughter] I Am right I Am\nYou know I I Lived my career and even prior to that as as a woman at facts and you know when I go to work and you know I'm market and many times to make believe story there's a lot that aren't you know like one of the films that most proud of and that we did is called hidden figures\nAnd so we've we've been involved in some really amazing storytelling but I go to work and I kind of live in the world is a snake believe but then\nYou know I Would happen is I lost my mom to all timers and I was broken and broken hearted I was craving and not long after I started saying goes to photograph so here I Am you know by day I'm I'm I like the nerd rate amongst all these\nBrilliant creative people that I have the luxury to work with and then at night is when I Would see these photographs of post that looks like they transferred out of a new the\nChoice let let me make sure I understand this uh you're grieving process and everyone who's yes the parent not particularly a parent who I Believe you and your mom or pretty close and as as most people would be with their parents but there are some people enough it's you've got a great relationship with them off\nSo you did you take up photography oh you always a photographer\nAnd you know I it actually no no no to all the above what happened is um like everybody else you know I take pictures all the time of of interesting things with my iPhone or Android whatever you just search isn't enough\nAnd I would look at my outlook at photographs and on it for the night that it happened there was\nUm [noise] I call it a birthday but you know if a bird ... slams into a window kind of leaves that residue where you can see the feathers and this ... she where the peak it through the window but there's there's no bird so I took a picture of it\nAnd the background of this picture it\nSpectral spectra looking woman and I'm like what is happening\nWhen I say anymore that when you say spectrum is looking woman okay so that's a ... for a ghost now yeah when we think about ghosts would come up on Halloween and we think about Caspar\nThe friendly goes to sort of like the little white she'd end the long run and and the big guys that's not what you're talking about\nNow that it's not until like talking to lift\nThis woman had a um she was wearing a long dress and add a human looking face\nAnd I started you know I I consulted with very few people at this time because I thought I was absolutely crazy and you know is a bit on the skeptical side but that skeptical from a place of Irish you to believe skeptical I was in a place like\nYou know okay maybe I'm kind of teetering on the edge here\nSo we so you're first picture that you did you see this spectral looking image yes or a bird that hit hit your car windshield is that is that which it actually\nHit our kitchen window okay\nWe went on a trip and came back and I see this\nThough yeah sure I broke and I called him members of the window Jetta the bright than all the time right right and I think it would take your dad what compelled you to take a picture that I mean that's a\nGreat question and I think it can help me because it on a I can see like the beak and the head and living in others and I think I was just enamored by the fact that there are also wasn't a dead bird in my property so it was like oh look look what happened kind of thing to send out differently and that's crazy\nYeah yeah that's\nIt I'd rather than I had that happen and generally the bird is below the window dead but there was no I heard\nBut but but somebody has to do with the bird was there whatever right okay right so you see you see this spectacle image now or are you sharing that with friends or you want it to yourself for no no of\nCourse I'm not you know I Am no different\nThan you know a majority of folks in our country which is I don't wanna look like a crock pot you know I didn't want to alert of anything I had no idea that you know what was going on in my studio studio that made and marketed the film pulled her guys\nYou know all these things are swirling through my head\nAnd I'm so fortunately have you know a few very close friends that um are not judging\nWhich is really amazing traits so ah but the thing is do your best and never judge anyone 'cause you never know what can come out of it and uh so I I started I was sending this a long and I have a friend who was actually a gifted psychic and her name is Brenda and Britain\nSaid um she said open your eyes my dear you this\nAs a guest and I'm like why\nAnd like oh my gosh I opened it goes portal an eye gaze completely had a panic attack about the whole thing\n'cause I didn't know anything but but luckily I had her and because I had her I wasn't running up and down the streets of Los Angeles screaming or hide your kids hide your wife forgotten ghost in the neighborhood I guess she was at least calming me a bit and then I became intrigued\nSaid actually taking lots of photographs\nAnd the ... and all of them and not just you know around where I was like out and about in the world and then there's the craziest thing that had not that that's a crazy and I\nThought what crazy thing happen next was that it you've heard his age right people use age I'm very Native American heritage to like clear spaces and so I bought which could have ... you know been equivalent to a ton of each\nAnd every day I Would go out and saves the property and you know I I Would have my dog home or with me and I would [noise] you know say the Lord's Prayer I was looking for whatever I could to protect the phase one day I didn't I didn't burn all the way down so I sat outside\nAnd I started just taking pictures of the smoke to kind of pass the time then I look some truth to photograph and what crater saying\nWhat I saw and every single photograph and I'm not exaggerating every single one hundred percent\nThere weren't ghost because they were using the smoke has like a canvas for me to see their image and if anybody wants to see any of these they can go to my website right now actually at their home not when you're driving and to Jay Julie rieger dot com and you can see some\nToken eliminated that you can see the smoke\nLet me give the the website and also again we're talking with the book and I had a guy called me the other day I Hope he's listening tonight I'm who said that\nHe goes to this hard I think it's in a band in car and he he goes to the

R. dot com so you can see if we on four or five of them right now\nAll right so ... and the other thing that's important for me to emphasize is that just\nIs the chief data strategist and media at twentieth Century Fox responsible for marketing a lot of big films avatar did pool the fault in our stars the book people monks others now I mentioned to you today I just have had before Dr Mary knew\nWho wrote a book to heaven and back\nUm it it has a little bit more of a I think a religious aspect to it than what we're talking about here but Mary Neal isn't up to ... to surge in Jackson Hole Wyoming\nSo we're talking about too extremely accomplished professional intelligent women\nUh who who uh who had on this show and in Julie's demeanor Julie's comments are very similar to uh to Dr Mary meal we're going to take a break\nOr if you've had similar experiences if you like to compare notes ...\nHer book the ghost photographer a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe bottom line folks let me give it to you the bottom line the bottom line is I'm Talking to someone who's a I'm a very successful person in the broadcast industry uh twentieth Century Fox\nAnd she is convinced\nThat she has seen ghosts\nThrough the camera lens and has the photographs\nTo prove you can agree you can disagree that's fine for you to join the conversation\nI Am a very skeptical person well Julie ... I Am not a skeptic will take a break six one seven to five or ten thirty triple a nine to nine ten thirty ... years by the way they really good reason\nA the founder the owner of it's amazing metaphysical store and uh in LA called the crystal matrix and she is incredibly gifted psychic channel or a teacher she's just think that is on and so I call her\nAnd I tell her the story and she says oh my I've never heard such specificity from the other side\nAnd I think it was and she said oh well it's obviously your spirit guide she's you know truly we were all born with spirit guide or something like ... you know call them guardian angels or angels world bored with them and if we are willing to be open and pay attention they could only help nudge us in life\nYou know to do to go to the right direction and I said well that's a really good thing because I really could have hurt that woman in the car in front of and she said oh no baby it wasn't that woman's life your guide was saving it ... or\n... well ... and I'm like what\nFrom a you know from a religious point of view guardian angels others would call to conscience um but you're not talking about a conscience or a guardian angel thing there you're talking about somebody interceding and protecting you\nYeah heck and an audit with an audible voice right it's not like them I had no I heard it like you hear me\n... I totally hear you my guest is Julie ... uh her book is the ghost photographer how long have you been able to photograph ghosts when when the\nUm [noise] probably five or six years but and if you don't mind can I jump in and tell you one more thing about that story\nThat is the most ... credit part about it this year that\nAfter after work that day I called one of my friends who I called earlier and that days did not pick up the found her name is Pam and Pam is the sister Mona who was killed in the car accident and was there as well as her husband [noise] and I called her and I tell her the story and she said do you want to hear the other half of your story\nAnd I'm sure you know and she said I I was in bed when when you called and I saw you calling and I went to reach for the phone to my body was paralyzed she was not one time in my fifty one years in that spot isn't done when I've asked to do\nAnd she is so that you would have had an effect on the phone this was before the accident this was before the accident fish or yes\nThat was one of the five people usually don't you try one at all I've\nPeople yes and what show incredible\nTo me about all of it is is if you think about the collaboration the coordination that to happen and the invisible part of our world right that had to happen in order for me to be sitting here today being able to touch on the phone\n... there there are some who would refer to what your friend experience as sweet paralysis or weekends away in the middle no but you wake up in the middle of the night right yeah you think you're here you're really asleep you here's your your friend was not asleep when you were calling her whenever she\nWas awake and by the way then I have a whole chapter on sleep paralysis for people if anybody suffer asleep paralysis I got a chapter for you on how you can actually get it fixed\nOkay well look we may talk about that as well six one ... for ten thirty Tripoli nine to nine ten thirty my guest Julie rigor\n... again for those people come in and out of the show as you probably can understand Julie working in the media\nShe's an award winning president chief strategist and head\nOf media what are you a lawyer titled access okay but then it ... it ... emphasizes the my audience who you are this is not someone who is making it up because she needs to make some money selling a self published book no\nShe's responsible for marketing such notable films as avatar did pull the fault in our stars and the book the so she's been in this business the media the movie business for twenty two years I think she told us\nMay may twenty seven who who will be ... years twenty seventh and ... and uh and she's talking about her experiences I'd love to have you join the conversation and tell us about your experiences or if you want to try to explain away to Julie\nOr what this was a ...
