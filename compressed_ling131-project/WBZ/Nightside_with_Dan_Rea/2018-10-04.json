Penn through before\nYou go to phone calls are going to ask ... the question asked him to answer the question that I posed\nBefore the break and what sort of a grade would you give the bigger administrator and specifically your opponent governor Charlie Baker uh on the Columbia gas situation the explosions in the fires and the havoc that has been impacted three communities north of Boston and also in terms of maybe what was or wasn't done in a dead yeah but what what the response was what sort of a great\nSo I give to different grades for after and before\nA I think on after I'd give them a be um [noise] you know I think I Would I Would want to get this resolved quicker than by November nineteenth for all these families whose lives have been disrupted I mean this was as you mentioned this is a tragedy someone lost his life\nUh many people were injured a lot of property damage and there are thousands of people who are whose lives have been seriously disrupted because of this\nWe we should be doing everything possible to get this issue addressed as quickly as we can there twelve hundred and fifty national grid workers who are locked out of their jobs right now who aren't being utilized for this um maybe there's more we can do to get it done quicker but I'd say probably be on the reaction the problem is\nUm we can't just all be about reacting to these issues and\nUh I Am very concerned about the lack of resources at the state agency that's responsible for overseeing the gas companies and making sure this stuff doesn't happen and keeps us safe so I'd give him a D for a his work before this happened\nUm the federal government weeks before the explosions in the ... valley warn the Baker administration that they did not have enough gas inspectors\nAnd there were two uh for Twenty one thousand five hundred miles of gas pipeline infrastructure\nUm I've said I Would hire multiple times the number of gas inspectors we'd get away from the system where we let the gas companies basically regulate and oversee and inspect themselves and report what they do to this agency we would take an a proactive approach to overseeing their work to keep people safe\nGovernment plays a really important role and this is a maybe a different philosophical difference between the govern myself but I think we we owe it to the people the state to do everything we can to keep them safe and if I'm governor we're going to hire a lot more gas inspectors and strengthen our oversight of the gas company\nWell let's see what the callers have to say my guess Jay Gonzalez Democrat running for the ... and he only won the the the the prime rib and he's also the nominee at the convention or and he will be on the ballot against Charlie Baker November six\nDie in is in Somerville Diane welcome your first of the rings I think the ring central nights I caught aligned with ... he's running for governor Hi Diane\nI like to do me a favor Diane I'm assuming you're on a speaker phone okay not anymore excellent you know the ... it doesn't the audio sound better Jay ... people don't understand that believe me you know we can hear your clues about go ahead Diane\nI'm One of the things that I'm a stay on the gas pipeline issue I'm Kelly bakers uh for a more natural gas pipelines across the state and he also had a fundraiser\nRight after that disaster where he received a ton of money from ever stores the executives\nWhen I'm there with the people he gave the contract to clean up this mess to I'm Wondering\nIf Mr Gonzales has a feeling about that and if he would have returned to those contributions donated them let's see what he has to say I am\nSo thank you die answer the question I'm On the contribution peace it it definitely doesn't look good I mean campaign finance laws are there for a reason to make sure that a wealthy special interests don't have undue influence over public officials\nAnd it doesn't look good whenever source or was awarded this this emergency business in two weeks later they're giving thousands of dollars to Charlie bakers campaign\nUm this is a problem for governor Baker a in a lot of ways\nHe his uh there's something called the Baker loophole where he's been somehow they figured out a way to collect checks of forty three thousand dollars from wealthy donors and funnel it up to the national Republican Party and back down to the state party for his benefit when our campaign finance laws only allow a thousand dollar donations\nThe developer say we could do it faster we should we need to um governor bakers put some ...\nIn some place on a development of solar power that I Would get rid of net metering kept\nA he has a new charge on residential solar so the amount of solar development that's been happening is really slowed down we've actually lost jobs in the solar industry here in Massachusetts under governor Baker after ten years of growth\nUm so those are some of the things I Would do to accelerate our transition but this is not only a threat that we need to deal with more aggressively it's a huge opportunity for us\nThe clean energy sector is going to be one of the fastest growing sectors in the world over the next couple of decades and we could create thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs right here in Massachusetts for lots of people if were intentional about it but we need leadership to do that and I'm going to provide that leadership\nI think about Cape Wind Jim Gordon and his group lost a lot of money and Cape Wind which was supportive I'm not mistaken by governor Patrick yeah\nUh and it was opposed by Ted Kennedy yeah and a lot of other folks on the Cape and I'm not sure if I'm if if the wind or interests or looking as bad as of [laughter] as free lewd or going to be willing to sink as much money have no idea how much can win last night but they lost a lot um\nYeah so so the situations changed a bit since then because the the areas offshore that had been permitted by the federal government to develop offshore wind or further out than where Cape Wind was going to have more expensive to drill though\nA bedrock maybe but but uh the rates now for other technological advancements over the last year or whatever where the energy is going to actually be pretty cheap\nSo um this is something we need to do it's actually going to I think at the end of the day results and cheaper energy for people cleaner energy\nAnd we need to take this on I mean we're seeing the impacts of climate change right now and the projections for the near future for Massachusetts in the Boston area and sea level rise and all this other stuff is scary so we got to get serious about it\nAny thank you much for your phone lines wanted to go to a few more dollars okay thank you so much for your call appreciate it have a great night six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty let me go to Peter in Boston Peter I want to get you in here thank you for your patients Roman ... democratic candidate for governor\nIn ... uh no I just wanted to ask Jay so there is that a lot of talk about the money and all ... late tonight and I just want to know ... if you'd be willing to take that now at our a money Sledge\nYes and I have taken it Peter and we asked Charlie Baker to do the same thing and he refused\nWas it was the other way threatening give you money no I don't think they were threatening to you I'm not sure I'd be their candidate ... or ... or\n... or you know there are a lot of people feel very strongly about this issue I Do too um and the enter a clearly has a stranglehold on people in Washington and they donate to the Republican Governors Association that Charlie Baker benefits from and uh you know there have been examples where he has said\nUm it's been reported there's a CEO of a silence or company\nWho said uh who gave lots of money to the to the Republican Governors Association who said that Charlie Baker committed to ... that if Massachusetts passed a law which legislation was tending to eliminate the ban on silence there's and Massachusetts Charlie Baker told him he would sign it so\nIt's an example of a big wealthy donor\nI'm trying to weaken our gun laws here in Massachusetts to Charlie Baker said he would support it's not OK in my view um we see the water is happening across this country we need the federal government to strengthen their gun laws um we certainly shouldn't be weakened them here in Massachusetts and I I don't think it's a lot to ask Charlie Baker to not take NRA money\nFeed a great question thank you thank you for the call yeah of course I have a great now going to go to Hayley\nIn Boston got a lot of phone calls here J. Hayley in Boston Hi Hailey how are you you're on with ...\nAnd bad I just wanted to ask on the island and and the kid and I rely on public transportation or what kind of why it's now ... ... ... public transport system\nHaley thank you for your call and I want to say you are not alone [laughter]\nIt's the number one issue people complain to me about out in the campaign trail and I've actually gone out to ride the tea with a number of different people on different parts of the system to get a better understanding of their experience and people like you are extremely frustrated\nSo I've been honest about the fact that we need to invest more to get the system to where it needs to be we should not be raising fares on riders right now\nWhen we're giving them worst service uh people are getting stuck in trains are on crowded commuter rail cars I was on a commuter rail recently where it was literally dripping water over some of the seats and people couldn't sit on them as they're packed standing in the commuter rail\nTrain 'em they're huge issues with our system and we need to invest more in it that's why I'm and asked the wealthy to pay more in taxes Charlie Baker has NO PLAN to do that he says don't worry I'm an jak upstairs and the system's going to be in a state of good repair in Fifteen Years that's his plan and he hasn't even really said how he's going to pay for his plan\nHow old are you not acceptable how will you be Fifteen Years Haley\nThirty five\nWere ready to go to school if I could ask I'd be good for you I went to law school that's a great institution tax Haley appreciate your call yeah have a great now I got to go a little further west a jury if that's okay with you got to go to Robert in California Robert welcome\nHow's it going right but she goes oh I got a question for him so then I called them before and I work a lot of almost could do some work with you I dunno what Bernie Sanders rally or into a Trump rally and one of the comment\nThat I hear from people use specially stay tissues are disingenuous I Want to ask you if you can be on his tell me something good do you like the Republicans have done is your story tell me something bad but the Democrats have done it in your state\nThat's pretty that's a pretty interesting question shows you a question [laughter]\nI'll I'll give you one thing that I I thought was good that Charlie Baker did which was the earned income tax credit or increase that he proposed a which made a big difference for\nA lot of low income working people in this state and you know those are the type of people that I'm running to help uh so that's one policy proposal he did that I liked um in terms of Democrats and one thing that I didn't like 'em there was some legislation pending at the end of the the session this year in the legislature including\nA legislation that would have increased funding for public schools particularly in low income districts would change the formula\nUm that uh has been is now out of date or to me that we're adequately funding public schools and that legislation didn't get out of the legislature which the Democrats can fail so I was disappointed by that I think that's a really important issue it's a huge priority of mine to\nMake sure we're we're giving every child in the state access to great public education\nRobert challenging question a good one I like to get one more call in from Massachusetts okay\nI could ever do not let me go\nTo Neal in Charlestown just a round the corner from us here Neal next Sunday side with chickens Alice\nI'm One of the lockout gas workers and I just like to know why you think I'm going to bake a won't get involved in out of the lockout I mean he clearly has the power to you know authorizes utility companies especially in the name of public safety\nOr Neal I don't know why I'm as we were talking about before he clearly has a very close relationship with the leadership at the gas companies to fill his campaign coffers that may be part of it um as you may know I've been out many times standing with you and your colleagues\nBecause I think what happened to you is reprehensible\nI don't know how it's legal for you to be locked out literally locked out by national grid or your ... your pay stopped your health insurance taken away from you it is it is reprehensible in my view um you know there's one thing when it comes to reach an agreement at the table and negotiating on a contract\nBut there's no reason that they\nShould have locked you out of your jobs and put public safety at risk in the process because we've got a bunch of temporary workers a lot of safety violations have been filed and the deep you or the state agency that's supposed to keep us safe on this has been unresponsive so I've got your backs I'm when I'm governor I'm going to work to make a difference for you\nYou and uh I and I am going to do what I can to help resolve this\nOr Neal I'm Glad that you know the wire here were flat out of time thank you much good luck on dragons allergy folks want to get in touch with your campaign that has to be an easy way we've only got a few seconds left the hours flown by got to have you back go at\nIt is and I look forward to it that they should go to my website Jay from a dot com Jay y number for M. A. dot com\nThat has to be the simplest or J. number the number four image so six\nOr ... J. A. Y. the number four ... coming in and we'll have you back or before November ... second opportunity to talk with you thank you and that's like a new campaign we come back we'll talk to a law clerk\nClerk not only for red cabinet but also for his uh also Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy will be back in the night side right after this\n... been sponsored by Blackstone gas Columbia gas ever source liberty utilities national grid and unit to start saving energy and money at ... dot com\nBust in that city runs that I'm lying in Boston interactive Connery station's bravo\nLying in motels dot com fast Boston another call\nFrom Ninety nine dollars a pound\nThat's absolutely right [noise] uh I work with them every day for a year as cork in his chambers from two thousand two thousand eleven and then um you know I've known him for ten years we first met at Harvard or when he was teaching a course about separation of powers that was one of the students and the class\nAnd we uh you know we remain closed for the past ten years\nSo what have you saw it and you also clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy I'm ... and and cabinet clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy if I'm not mistaken correct\nThat's right okay so so it is a very um um\nSmall fraternity if you will of those who either serve at this level or as judges are those who served at this level as clerks\n[noise] what have you thought about\nWhat some people have described as a circus in Washington and the last few weeks\nSo I think when the grandma that\nThe best line about circuits as he said they're supposed to be entertaining and they're supposed to be safe for kids in this process has been either um you know what we've seen I think is a of a vicious um attacked by Democrats and I think that they have a\nPursued a strategy that has not served Dr Ford well as not served judge Kavanaugh well certainly Hassan\nServe any semblance of due process and a democratic norms well I remember that they first learned about Dr Ford's accusation and July, July and they said on this for six weeks while\nThey arranged to have an attorney for her and the attorney arranged for a graph and they laid and wait and then they ambushed judge Kavanaugh the Democrats did at at the moment when it was going to be most advantageous to them and most harmful to his confirmation chances and it's just part\nOf a strategy they'd been pursuing since before they'd ever heard Dr Ford and that's a strategy at the way for the sake of delay it began with this nonsense about document production\nEven though he produced more doctors that he not many in history and explains why they asked him one thousand three hundred questions written questions after he'd already testified in person per week everything they've done has been delayed for the sake of delight but this is really a new low because you know they're exploiting the issue of sexual assault a\nSerious important issue for their own partisan political gains\nI assume it never make an assumption but I'll assume that at some point you probably had to have been approached by the FBI early on a as a former clerk I Would assume that the FBI would have wanted to get your impression is if one is that true into if if it is true can you talk about it [noise]\nIt's it's not sure I'm I'm sure they talk lots of people he's worked with and maybe some of the other forty eight clerks that he's hired over the years I\nHad a ad they asked me I Would have told them what I what I told every ah every reporter is asked um and that is that you know judge Kavanaugh as a person who's ward I came to trust a in a way that I frankly don't trust very many other people's works in the in the whole world\nBy eat on a very short list of people who I who I trust and uh\nYou know in terms of lawyers who I worked with um you know I think he's he's one of the most thoughtful I'm best lawyers that are that I've ever ...\nOkay I I have a perception on this and and I'd like to if you want to respond to it you can if you if you don't want to that's fine I always look at things through the prism of politics and I don't see Brett Kavanaugh or as an ... an instrument of Donald Trump meaning Donald Trump I think\nUh his nominated a judge or who is much more ah in the tradition of Anthony Kennedy a and a judge who really made his um his bones if you will politically or in the Bush White House and was nominated by George Bush\nTo the to the circuit court of appeals so I think for some reason a lot of the Democrats are assuming that the judge Kavanaugh is a puppet of would be a ... of Donald Trump I don't see it that way am I right or wrong\nFor a judge Kavanaugh ah is not a puppet of anyone ah not not not of George Bush not Donald Trump not not of anyone I\nYou know the judge I worked with every day for a year or was faithful to conservative legal principles like extra wasn't in a rich was him but he was absolutely independent when he came to approaching each case without\nAny passion or prejudice for a particular policy outcome more for a particular party and that's the kind of cheap and for the past twelve years a if he does it get confirmed it's that kind of justice he'll be on the Supreme Court\nI'm just a couple of final questions and I give Ghana I appreciate you doing this and and I know that it has to be difficult for you because you are I'm sure I'm not I'm pleased to having to do an interview like this I'm sure there's plenty of legal issues that we could talk about which would be much more interesting probably\nA but it's a great interest everybody he's been characterized for\nA cat or a caricature or or as somebody who\nIs a drinker you worked with him on a day to day basis I assume at some point you were with him in social settings can you tell us a he's was there anything in his character did you solve which suggests that alcohol\nWas something that that was not that he could not control [noise]\nNo absolutely not\nAnd what about his his passion he's been criticized for being um to passionate and his defense or a that is that his judicial\nTemperament was on display that is that the theory that is now being floated your your response to\n[noise] you know I think that [noise]\nUp the process that he um was speaking about is a process\nThat everyone should be outraged about even if you're not the one whose family is receiving death threats even if you're not\nThe one whose name is being dragged through the mud even if you're not the one who's kind of ambushed by senators on the Judiciary Committee who is cold you evil and said that for a walk in the valley of the shadow\nOf death Cory Booker sad about Kavanaugh's nomination even if you're not a person in the arena ah\nI think it's it's reasonable uh to be outraged about this and uh you know it had he not had he not been outraged I I Would have been outraged but he was an outrage\nAnd ... or you might have checked him for a pulse [laughter] yes yes\nYeah I'm less less less question and that is your what thought would you want a U.S here in New England who again he taught at Harvard but most of my listeners and never had a chance to be in this company never had a chance to 'em again work with him work for him clerk with him clerk for him\nUm one final thoughts and again I appreciated the time you gave us tonight but I just would love to get a final thought from you as to what we should be thinking about as this evolves and the next day or so as you know the FBI report currently ... arrived at the White House perhaps even as early as this evening\nI'm senators will begin to review it or individually tomorrow and ... the majority leader um Senator McConnell has indicated that he hopes to have\nA vote or on the issue of his nomination on his confirmation I should say a Saturday or you know that the the the heat or there's going to be a a ... a\nLot lot more fire and a lot more he coming in his words in his direction as someone who knows what should people who do still have an open mind in this should be thinking about as this week as this week wears on [noise]\nWell [noise] when it comes to his qualifications or people should know that he served ... years on\nThe second most important core of the country is indicated by the Supreme Court Thirteen times which is unparalleled record he's probably the most qualified nominee to the Supreme Court and two or three generations and then when it comes to the accusations made against him I Would want people to know that there are many men who I've\nWorked with who seemed Eisen who seemed successful conclusion isles I honestly might not believe in that situation I'm not one of these people who believes that all sexual predators are mean to everybody a spot on a very short list of people whose word I trust\nBrett Kavanaugh's on that ... and every day for a year\nKnowing him for ten years having been his student seeing firsthand\nThat he's the kind of person who would rather lose a job the tell a lie and that's why I Believe that Cabot all without reservation and without hesitation\nLet's question assuming that uh the the final votes don't break his way or the any circumstances under which you could see him voluntarily withdrawing his [noise]\nI Hope he does some withdraw you know he said he's not going anywhere and I think he's I say that I don't I\nDon't play by the selfish reasons I think that it would it would reward or that the misbehavior by\nThe people on this traditionally committee that launched this fish is ambush and they were both very poorly for future nominees so you know I I Hope that the culture there I Am cautiously optimistic a\nI can tell you that since um the nomination he's been quoted in\nEvery vote lots of newspapers the Washington Post the boss that well that's good for your time she's appeared on\nNPR News ... gray water of a radio stations around the country Fox News or I don't see an appearance yeah I see a CNN he was he was interviewed on CNN on July first\nThat was before the nomination and he was he was interviewed or I guess on CNN on July tenth so he made a couple of early appearances but he doesn't seem to have been on CNN or MSNBC recently [noise]\nAnd you know there have been any repercussions in his life has he been attacked at all uh for standing up for Brett Kavanaugh\nI I I I didn't ask him that the research that I did didn't indicate that that was the problem I'm sure I I read it I saw one of the headlines tonight that I Believe that\nThere's some six hundred and fifty law school professors who have signed a statement saying the Kevin O's should not be appointed to the Supreme Court that doesn't surprise me because as\nYou said it's so political I mean Kevin ... received the the the highest possible rating from the a BA or as a judge right\nAnd now a ... these these allegations are very few of them were cooperated if any there have been allegations I mean I don't want to go through them we've gone through the last couple of nights\nAre now it is sort of turn from was he an abuser or was he drinking and was he blacking out I mean it it it's it it it just seems to be shifting ... and now there's talk about his judicial temperament and whether or not\nUm he handled the in the big questions from the Democratic senators which were frankly very hostile way he handled right well and I'm\nSo even if he didn't handle those well that does not necessarily speak to a lot except that he was under I mean a tremendous amount of pressure\nOn the other the other thing too is obviously as a judge you're going to be recused you will recuse yourself from any case in which you might have an interest in any way right\nAnd uh and obviously his his good name is on trial as much as his potential position and the Supreme Court is on trial as well so I I I um I Would have ... if\nHe wasn't passionate I Would have been surprised\nKnow I was really happy to hear Alan Dershowitz on the other night and last time it was actually [laughter] and he I mean he was very brave because you know he says\nAnd that not all women simply because they're women a need to be believed and not all men simply because they're men a\nNeed to be believed and that there are a significant number of allegations and accusations\nThat are totally false for many many reasons and I think ... is the kind of guy who says what he thinks and does not care about people are giving them the cold shoulder on Martha's Vineyard\nWill Allen has the stature that he is burned for\nOver a lifetime of us of teaching writing on being available to speak on controversial subjects and also in the courtroom or if he's if he is a if the lawyers lawyer a law professors law professor a thinkers thinker ... there's no one in the law\nThat I can think of that I respect more than Alan Dershowitz there's a lot of issues that Alan and I might disagree will use agree with each\nOther I disagree with them a lot of issues also but I have to respect\nHim and and and he ... he is doing this I'm In countries inching of what maybe people would if it dissipated\nHe would've done he has taken politics and removed it from the equation and he is looked at the situation I'm almost as a doctor\nWould look at a patient on the table and the patient in this case I think he sees at risk as due process and presumption of innocence and all of the great standards and principles that I thought\nWe all agreed upon but I guess I was wrong\n[laughter] All right thanks a lot then Steve thanks for your call is always appreciate it can you\nDo not six one seven to five or ten thirty Tripoli nine to nine ten thirty a little bit past our break we'll
