B. C. news radio ten thirty or the news was never the\nWB news time eight o'clock cut some showers fifty nine in Boston periods of rain tonight\nThat was taking place here in Massachusetts specifically up in a large area um where they had where where we had\nU.S attorneys in New Hampshire and Maine a who identified to attorney general sessions that there was a very large heroin problem of overdoses New Hampshire and Maine and a lot of them are coming from drug trafficking Massachusetts ... office here along with\nMy agency homeland security investigations the FBI da ... U.S Marshals\nWe conducted a one day multi agency operation which was specifically targeted at heroin distribution of fat no uh mostly which was being running handled by transnational drug organizations which operated primarily out a large area\nSo when you see trends national drug operation you're talking about a group or an organization unfamiliar with Rico statutes are here in America racketeering statutes these basically rackets but when you say trends national they have um a contacts not only here but in other countries around the world\nYes yes specifically we there's a large amount of heroin traffic and fat no which does come up from the Mexican border as well as a a large amount of narcotics that come up Vita waterways from the Dominican Republic up through Massachusetts okay\nThe um ... let's talk about fentanyl because that is a kill heroines a killer too but ... is a real quick killer um what is the purpose of anybody even messing around with something never mind heroine but with ... is it like to get\nThe next time to get next high and unfortunately here in Massachusetts but we saw was a lot of prescription drugs a lot of capitals are being laced\nWith that now I'm much like the U.S attorney said in the press conference the amount of fat no that was the that day by officers and agents was enough to kill it had to have state population from Massachusetts\nWe have seven million people in my last a recollection so we're talking about could've killed three and a half million people yes um and so this just sets the background now I don't live in Lawrence or I Know the mayor of Lawrence Dan Rivera who I think is a is a good guy and not going to get you know the political discussion but that's not the point\nBut the fact of the matter is that there is this operation going on in Lawrence some will say okay you you were rest a bunch of people in Lawrence and if they know the heat Shawn Lawrence they're going to move to Pittsburgh are they going to move to low how big of a problem is that just just tracking these folks down\nIn you know it's extremely hard especially in the narcotics trade in in ... as well as those that are um illegal immigrants that are you know that have the skill to hide within an immigrant population in almost be nomadic and not settled down in one place\nWell that's that gets to one of the one of the issues here and it is clear that not every illegal immigrant is a drug dealer knowing suggesting that but there is a percentage of illegal immigrants that are basically importing\nPoison into our communities which not only will kill\nYou know in in the perfect world that subject should have rolled over into our custody we would have worked hand in hand with the state um to make sure that that you would appear for his um his court dates so they could get justice here in the state\nBut we still keep track of all it would have you kept in custody or ... we would keep them in custody or we would know that that the agency or the county was holding him on our behalf\nIf as long as you know for ... counties in Suffolk\nCounty fine okay uh and then goes to trial a depending upon the result of the trial a guilty or not guilty guilty he would serve time\nHe would serve time and then at the end they just wanted to come to us that while he was um for instance while they're in uh Massachusetts Parma corrections we would they would still go through the immigration process I'm at that time did go in front of immigration judge why they were still in state custody where they found a portable or\nWhatever the case may be able to show me if the neighbors was guilty of oh yeah sure civic to somebody so let's assume for some reason the guy gets acquitted\nOkay you would still happy if he would still be in custody or in acquitted he's still hopefully would get deported if they are illegal\nHe would still just like any US citizen he still have is\nDue process to go in for an immigration judge to plead their case where the state or be removed um but if someone's convicted they would come into our custody and then they would get a formal deportation officer and uh uh order from a judge and then we would facilitate that removal\nOkay we're going to take a break um I guess the studios hotlines he's the acting field office director of the Boston office of ice we're also

eight thirty six ah I'm In studio with a toddler science he is a with the ice office in Boston he is the\nDirector I get that title specifically the acting field office director for all intents and purposes the guy in charge of the ice office here in Boston called lions who happens to be a native of this community we're joined now by Jessica Vaughan\nOr who is the director of policy studies at the center for Immigration Studies I Know Jessica is been listening to um taught in a in me this hour and we'll welcome back Jessica who's been a guest before this program Jessica how are you\nI'm doing well been great to be with you\nWell thanks very much Jessica and uh it's been so interesting to talk with taught it I I Know you probably know everything that we've talked about but it every time I have a conversation like this if it makes me I'm\nEven more frustrated when when you think about the implications of the lung case a and you think about the cities that are now so called sanctuary cities let me make one point and I want to see if you agree with me and this there is no definition of what a sanctuary city is or is it not as it is or is not as would you agree with me on that\nActually no I mean there are there are different definitions that people have it there is where I made them in federal law okay with that definition is in federal law it they don't use the word sanction\nBut the the section of the u._s. code eight us codes Thirteen Seventy three which says that no local state or local government can have a policy\nOr ordinance that prohibits local officials from sharing information immigration related information with federal immigration officials and and that is exactly what sanctuary\nPolicies do and that is exactly what the policy is and the city of Lawrence and a number of other jurisdictions in the commonwealth like uh Summerville even the city of Boston to a certain extent they impose some restrictions on the Boston police department\nSo that's sort of a reverse a definition if you will of what a sanctuary city is so\nMuch have to not run afoul of the tenth amendment to come and daring anti come and daring provision the federal government in most cases cannot force local governments or state government to do its job\nBut what this law which was passed in Nineteen Ninety six and signed by then President Bill Clinton dies it said you can't prohibit your local officers from sharing information through\nLike just like just like local police in Lawrence or\nWherever it was amazing with the FBI or with another state but they haven't acted local policies that in my view are unconstitutional and running afoul of federal law saying that they can't talk to Iceland\nLet me ask you is is there anything in the pipeline to challenge to challenge these policies um because obviously they're they're they're all around the country or I I read the I read the news was Arizona decision twenty ten which would indicate to me that a federal law preempts immigration law\nThat's right it should Trump should Trump state and local law and California passed a really egregious state sanctuary law that that does not permit any jurisdiction in California\nTo share information with\nLife [noise] I'm pretty much almost every scenario there are a few exceptions um and this was passed over the objections of the state\nA sheriff's association and many many law enforcement leaders in California the Trump Administration is suing California and uh try to prevent the implementation of that law and they succeeded so far and getting parts of it struck down but the main parts of it if not yet been blocked\nHigh times holding corps offering will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with

illegal immigrant nobody really wants to do anything short stretch report chocolate seems like it's a you know up anyway but my question is really a chart\nOr maybe the gas this but you have all the federal government has the right to our oldest sister's ... century city you know they've done not anywhere in the country\n[noise] actually I think Jessica can probably talk to that because her organization does help um local municipalities with that I think Jessica ... knows\nA lot of them can hurt on the pocketbook\nGoing let's let's no you're right you're absolutely right Kevin let's get adjusted gr involved in the conversation because she thinks will actually give us some information that might be helpful go ahead Jessica\nYes there have been it there are the Trump administrator and now that it was going to withhold certain department of justice grants for law enforcement agencies from sanctuary jurisdictions if they have to comply with the um the federal laws\nAnd a number of jurisdictions actually change their policies because of that um especially West Palm Beach Florida Miami Dade County in Florida and a few others Las Vegas and\nThey there are some people came around but other jurisdictions instead chose to sue the federal government like New York city Philadelphia San Francisco and some other places in California\nSo a number of federal judges have found that um that the Trump Administration can do that for different reasons one said that they didn't think Philadelphia was a sanctuary which with you know kind of eyebrow raising when you have the mayor of Philadelphia dancing on camera announcing their sanctuary\nScene that you know\nAnd I'm In California fighting yet I'm In the city of Los Angeles in particular believe that it was denied some major funding\nBecause of its policies although you know it also could be because their grant application was then you know compelling enough\nBut the the Trump Administration is committed to trying to do this and some members of Congress to our as well but as we've seen in so many re than I'm In the immigration policy changes are attempted changes\nSome judges are stepping in and um and blocking the Trump Administration from doing that and a lot of this is on appeal now and so we'll just have to wait to see how it comes out\nAnd there were a close ally hazard here that they're doing it but I just asked questions\nOn hold office in ... there were a lot of federal judges who ruled against the Trump Administration Jessica as you know a on the so called travel bans a and eventually the U.S Supreme Court has upheld the travel ban go ahead Kevin\n[noise] so yeah I work in law and I set up trade shows and suddenly trade shows we get some on you know people to come over and they jumped right in Oregon I actually called ice up two years ago or three years ago when Obama was in office and I said\nWhat was going on is that we get somebody to come over and take a page and the guy actually he was honest when we said we don't have to help to do that\nOkay so I Hope you get good now\nJarred in the office but my question it really would it be a money money well spent to go after the employers corn ... Tejpal\nAnd having such a thing you put them out of fire all illegal immigrants okay sort of breaking the law by hiring but I don't have any employer you know put them on a Charlie what that is that is that something that is at the forefront are really not used much\nOr do you guys use that quite frequently no actually the fact that you point out\nThat actually is a part of homeland security investigations who does excellent work a hearing and specifically in Massachusetts in that area or they do excellent um you know law enforcement investigation into just to those type of a crime that you're talking about\nYeah okay so they are going out to the employees you don't have much of that\n... doesn't have to do this you might want to get a couple of more in before the hours up okay it's at the game Rachel thank you very much appreciate your ... go to Eddie and also in\nBoston next time I saw her on the head of the rings central Neistat caught on line ... [noise] I\nAm from Boston we got that already going Hi so how could it because I'm a U.S citizen for six years I met in United States for twenty two years but I have a family member\nWho's been in in the United states for Thirty years and he got his domestic disputes the other day\nIn ... in it in a court on the north shore ISIS detained because at the time oh it's a theory immigration status was hum\nThis fire but he's he was the case pain in the past two years\nTo get it it seemed like gracious Scottish uh\nIt is I think with all due respect a time or litigate that here tonight and I think when you shoot I don't know who your relative is\nI think you should inform them that they got to get a good immigration lawyer to battle their case I don't want to get into the specifics because they don't want to litigated on the radio\nThink I've given the best advice there [noise]\nIf if he's legitimate ... Franco is a great immigration lawyer or if he's not legitimate you may want to find another two big races lawyer I have friends who I went to law school with a ... their immigration attorneys that's what they got to do okay [noise]\nAll right All right thank you for for you how are you one before you give\nToo as well and congratulations becoming a citizen you did it the right way thanks very

killing people a lieutenant governor who was hanging around with a\nDrug deal of courage euro and attorney general who does nothing in Saturday nothing about any of this\nYou have a ... thing but that's not the purpose tonight we can talk politics any night okay the purpose than I really is to try to make people better understand how difficult it is for ice to operate\nA and the restrictions that had been put upon ice oftentimes by politicians you know who you mentioned in others we haven't mentioned but\nWhy do again why why they call them as\nBeing good I'll tell you why because the politicians listening to people and the people who feel like you and maybe feel like build from the north shore annoyed yelling as much as you need to as as much as all of us need to rocky and I'm being honest with you if Ninety percent of the people said to\nA governor and attorney general a mayor look this is wrong and they knew that they were going to have to go to the beat up for re election that changed in a heartbeat rocky none of them and doing it in my opinion upon their philosophical deeply held philosophical believes they're running it through the prism of politics since I guess\nDon't stand a human nature\nAll right so I'm I'm a ... like the quake like the Enron\nAnd I hate I hate is I Will talk politics or the other night thanks rocky not tonight we're going to

fentanyl are in the last hour you remember we mentioned actually taught lions mentioned that the sentinel or that that was available here could've killed half\nOf the population to Massachusetts like more than three million people so that's incredible and and the ... the point is that it's it's one thing to say well someone's here illegally\nAnd they're not here to hurt anybody and they're trying to do all the right thing okay that's fine but when you're talking about ... and you're talking about other people who are here illegally and breaking the law glad I didn't mean to interrupt you train of thought\nBut we're not all good people it's like saying all American citizens are wonderful people\nWell you know here we're not Charles Manson was an American citizen but he wasn't a wonderful person go ahead Dave [noise]\nI agree [noise] you know I Would just add that\nI agree with you hundred percent of what I say about any anybody scaling up hurting anyone crushed get a\nTear it anybody to see it working company why the company's ... tractors ... meal like what do I work in people but you know what they're also making money for themselves so that school at all the people that I then any taxes that they have less\nOr what whatever the case may be put\nSome on it if the people that are listening and call and they get angry because there's a cry they'll do anything\nWhich I think what should they do but I'm just curious what you think they should do the pay is rated\nI think that people need to realize what it is political and the only power that object people so if you really rarely get angry about any of that stuff\nYou need to send an email we need to just show separate takes two minutes to an email or phone call\nPeople do if you don't do anything and you just call up and and and sit on the area that happen a lot and gets all the boats Democrats what most guys thank you very\nMuch salt take it easy to appreciate your call um six when judge Jesse ... do you want to comment on um on Dave some observations\nIt's true I mean people do need to speak up and let their lawmakers now\nHow they feel about it how they're affected by the decisions that are lawmakers make um I Do want to comment on one thing though about um you know we as Americans cherish our tradition of a generous immigration policy and we admit\nAbout a million legal immigrants every year and there are another four million people in the world who are eligible based on their family relationships are having been sponsored by an employer\nTo come here legally and show it it's a slap in the faith and not fair to the people who are using our legal immigration system tolerate millions of people here illegally whether they are criminals or whether they're nice people and and many of them are nice people but\nThe immigration system we set up to say that all the nice people in the world get to come here\nWell here's the thing Jessica I'm a really nice guy okay and I want to go to a Red Sox game this weekend and I don't have a ticket so when I think I'm going to do is I'm just going to walk\nIn and crashed the gate and I'm very legally what's gonna happen to me at Fenway Park I assume are going to get thrown out right even though you're a nice guy even though I'm a really\nNice guy and a Red Sox fan you gotta pay your your your ticket and you got to get here legally yes some taught aligns wants to jump into it\nNow I you know I just really wanted to say one thing to him when it comes to that [noise] and I would I kinda hope\nIt you know you gave us the opportunity in a forum to let you know people Massachusetts know about ice and one thing that I really want them to know is the men and women of ice go out there every day\nA new law enforcement officers they put their lives on the line to go out and the rest of the worst of the worst when it comes to immigration and it it's it's really disheartening with the whole the boss ice movement\nBecause like you said there are plenty of us citizens that we'd love to get rid of but even if one percent of all sexual assault say in this in the country are committed by someone that may not be here legally that's one percent of victims we can save or stop a crime if we move that element out of it\nBut I mean we we often refer to the Cape styling a tragedy the woman who was walking with her dad on the pier in San Francisco\nYou talk about Matthew Denise from Milford, Massachusetts still young girl Molly from Iowa I'm now again someone could say well that person could have been hit by a truck the next day that's true but they should not have been killed by someone who was here illegally Jessica we got to take a pause\nUm taught is uh is is going to leave us now but taught I appreciate you coming in tonight and making people understand that your job is complicated and it's difficult and it's been made more complicated and more difficult\nBy judges in my opinion you don't have to agree with me\nBut I just want to say thank you for giving us a fair opportunity to to explain our side of\nAny time in in the case that we alluded to the the lung case and thank you for correcting me on the spelling on that\nHere's an individual who was on the cusp of being deported but because of the decision by the Massachusetts state Supreme Court or he was released a he had been in the process of being deported but he was released\nAnd the two or three months later he assaulted in and robbed in Ninety two year old woman in a wheelchair or and if that doesn't make everyone boil because blood ... blood boil because\nMay not have been Ninety two year old grandmother in a wheelchair but if you are lucky enough to have a Ninety two year old grandmother it could have been her so taught

I Believe so yeah of course they would be upset yeah you know like I'm Sorry hold on Jeff got John wanted to make our would come and go I wanted to just say that you know\nIn any community a community is built\nBy many factors many different pieces it's not just the town elected officials it's the businesses it's\nThe schools it's the religious is um houses of worship mean communities are supposed to work together for the betterment of society and when we feel is if one of those pieces needs to be removed\nWas short changing the east coast I think of what it means to be a people who live together as neighbors trashed backed one in her\nRight here's one thing they're faster\nUm\nWe we as Chris just have to remember that not all of that my editor bart's\nRight most of truth in what year it will come to globally and sugar or do we care judge because we don't know if they will choose the war you\nKnow insurance you know I was just this idea no magic anyways I'm here I'm not trying to bridge people what ... trying to say is they are\nThe religion is atheism okay they may not recognize it as a religion but they are is for ... in their lack of belief is the most evangelical Christian and day you're\n... you're right you're right that's the ... and trying to make\nYou know I'm not I'm not trying to say that they are you judging yeah it's just we're getting there\nIs no they are at least now\nThe three of us know the sub current your belief that you do have most of that are not at a bar\nOr in a bird I got your point just thank you very much for your call appreciate it very much okay I have a great night um wherever we will continue on this uh I promise you and I I'm I give you my word that I Want to have you keep us posted on this\nUh and if folks want to get in touch with you they can just contact due to the congregation church of Canton pretty easy very easy a website\nIs cc\nDash Canton M. A. dot O. R. G. and if you write to pastor at cc dash can't an M. A. dot O. R. G. you'll get in touch with me and a Dan I Want to thank\nYou so much for us Stay with your meal yet I'm running out of time for this hour but we'll have you back please keep us pull absolute and I did called the superintendent if she wants to come on that's fine we can we can continue to debate with her or with the lawyers it doesn't matter will set it up\nThat gangs are much rubber intimately or we're gonna come back right after dawn how the eleven o'clock news final are nights I coming up on the other side\nBeach town in a situation like this Canton\nOr what happens is that the uh the the the elected officials often uh they ... why do they ... well you have some town that has a that\nAgain like Canton it's a lovely community ah it's not necessarily the wealthiest community in the state it certainly isn't the poorest and one of the things that are the elected officials are always concerned about is trying to keep the tax rate as low as they can\nUh and they fear about having to raise property taxes which causes the bulk as well as state aid that most towns in Massachusetts a run on so in a situation like this the\nPeople who are in the leadership of the community and whether it's a school shooter schools community school superintendent to board a select when\nThey get this letter from some official looking organization with a a few sites to some legal cases and they figure oh we're first of all we do know that this is worth it ... why do we want to defend ourselves against this I mean we're just up the easy course of action\nIs to eliminate the prayer at the high school graduation\nMuch kids you know I mean why don't they don't pray it but now what about you know what I'm saying is going to potentially cost us money so therefore well we're going to\nDo is where I got a will will roll over will roll over\nOkay well that's fine um but Americans tend not to roll over or at least most Americans that I Know so what should reference to ... and others in Canton do in my opinion is I have suggested getting contact with the Rutherford Institute\nAnd file a lawsuit against the tax\nFile a lawsuit on behalf of the citizens of Canton\nOr that their First Amendment rights are being a deny uh now I don't know if that strategy has been used in any other community across the country or not\nBut I think at that point the same a quiz wing leaders who would who would roll over and\nCapitulate because there's some pressure coming from one direction of a legal of lawsuit a legal fight well\nLet's get some pressure coming from the other direction so that's the strategy that I Would suggest so what I'd like to do and I really would like to hear from you on this one and particularly if you're from Canton from anywhere else do you really think it is offensive\nFor a non denominational prayer to be offered at a\nHigh school graduation it is beyond my capacity to I guess emphasize I guess I have a lack of empathy uh when it comes to those who are offended by that\nIt doesn't offend me I Can't imagine why anyone would be offended now if you are\nSomeone who's easily offended I guess you could be offended\nUh but I Want to hear from you and might that far out of step I don't think so you know the number six one seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty so the question I'm asking is do you think I'm giving\nA a good suggestion don't want to call it legal advice just want to call it the suggestion to um those in Canton who are upset by this move\nNow again it doesn't matter I guess to the vast majority of people in Canton maybe it doesn't matter to you but as we eliminate and eradicate any vestige of religion from the public square whether it's\nAgain something that they acknowledges Christmas or or acknowledge is um um Hanukkah\nOr in the public square or what we're doing is we are becoming much more of a non believing nation and one of the things that has I think held this nation together at its core during times of crisis\nIt is a fundamental belief\nThat all of us deep and are so understand the must be something bigger\nThan us as individuals out there when nine eleven occurred redo people flock to\nThey flocked to church they flock to churches it's as simple as that uh when uh when the United states was involved in the great wars with the church attendance go up or did it go down\nAt times of crisis we fall back on either our religion or a belief in God\nAnd I think it's a shame that champion is so easily influenced here by one threatening letter from a group that spends its entire existence or sending threatening letters\nTo force communities to eradicate the ... any vestige of religion it upsets me\nHope it upset you I'd like to talk about it because again I Do not think people in America should hide their faith under a bushel Basque so I'm going to open up the phone lines if you want to talk about this let's have added whether you agree or disagree I'll be more than happy to entertain your conversations on either side\nAnd if you don't want to talk about it then maybe that proves the atheists to write an innately Americans are willing to give up\nA veer beliefs they're embarrassed by their beliefs and they certainly don't want to put their beliefs and their\nThis report for their beliefs are publicly six one seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty and I will tell you this if we ever lose our fundamental belief in something bigger than ourselves\nWe're making a huge mistake let's open up those phone lines right now Rob six when seven to five or ten thirty Tripoli nine to nine ten thirty from wherever you are you don't have to live in Canton I'd love to hear from you if you live in camps in Massachusetts but if you live in
