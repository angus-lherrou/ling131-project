dot com we've been talking about the excitement over the mega millions lottery jackpot this week there are a lot of negatives potentially on the lives of lottery winners here's an example of what can happen at your workplace\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say I'm going to keep going in my work every day like always know you're not you know why\nBecause every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful because they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life's not going to change Oh yes it absolutely will you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to\nSatisfy what they believe is how much money you ought to give them so\nIn addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you've got to do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live easily do Google your address not only strangers but\nCrux might come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to\nExtort from you blackmail you\nSo you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the Ritz we were me and have a security detail around your your life is going to change in ways you have never thought possible because you need personal security\nAnd when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute\nHow much money you're going to give your mom you just method after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars I must be given them a million bucks you ...\nCome on you're going to give her ten million you just got a hundred and Ninety two million dollars how much you've given your mom\nHow much you've given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children\nYour grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that's a hundred million dollars guess what\nYou didn't give away a hundred million dollars because when you give away a hundred million dollars you know my friend knock them you\nHave to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent\nWhich means if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars so of the four hundred and Ninety two that you did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to three fifty\nWe haven't even talked about charity let alone Bentley's do you see my point my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery\nRequires a massive change and lifestyle\nMassive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them and whatever you do for them ain't going to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying the lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars I guess what you'll have won the lottery of course past performances ... future results on your social the country's a federal ... and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery ticket\nBecause as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and I mentioned all of this one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one subject\nAren't you glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did you win the lottery on Tuesday\nYou saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday\nAnd you did notice that not only did you get rich you got a little poorer because of the stock markets performance and we're going to talk about the stock market and what it means for your investments in what you should do about your investment strategy as a result of the new\nVolatility that we're experiencing\nIn the stock market and the bond market and the real estate market and the gold market\nAnd the reason that this is such a a big deal conversation\nA is because you've got money invested and that's what we do for a living or at our organization uh we

evidence teams from Baltimore Washington and New York\nAre actively assisting investigators at the site how the synagogue shootings in Pittsburgh that killed eleven people and injured six

B. news radio and then\nCome back to the elements show we invite you to send me your questions by audio and\nThat's exactly what George did here's a question he sent to ask Rick\nAnd Rick element dot com\nI read this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks face this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much an interesting about only pay one or two or three percent but so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of a good\nSo traditionally we what are you don't take any more risk than is necessary to achieve your goals\nBut let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nA riskier investment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nBut the money into bills call today but think about this when you die who gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast view and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids you could argue that that money really isn't yours it's ...\nAnd you are merely the steward of that money you're the custodian your the caretaker of that money\nIf you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars they invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that none of taxes and inflation is growing in real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age but based on ...\nAnd if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic look at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources\nAnd design what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your question and if you would like to have this conversation with us you can do so just calls the triple each plan

revenue and within the Dahlia and you could drive and make seven grand a month pretty good income for being a cabdriver and you could sell your medallion\nIf you felt like it became a market where people were\nBuying and selling medallions the value of medallions rose really fast and New York the medallions hit one point three million dollars in value people were getting rich trading medallions\nThen came along over\nNew York city medallions fell from one point three million to a hundred and sixty grand in Philadelphia the medallions fell from half a million dollars to ten grand\nThousands of cab drivers around the country have lost huge amounts of money in San Francisco there has not been a single medallion bought or sold in more than two years which means they're virtually worthless seven hundred drivers bought those medallions the city generated sixty three million dollars in revenue\nA hundred and fifty of those drivers have now the fault it on the loans

after the questions okay we're talking to my he sent\nAnd the question to ask Greg at ... dot com\nIraq this is Mike from Evanston, Illinois I've learned to things from listening to you over the last Twenty years number one I can retire and the custom I'm used to when approximately three percent of my savings will cover my annual expenses\nNumber two thanks to exponential technology middle live longer than ever and probably should plan on having my retirement money last until I'm at least a hundred and Twenty years old\nSo my question is how do I count for inflation in my annual expenses and the calculation of retirement cost I found a a inflation calculator on the Internet she told me if my current monthly expenses and three thousand fifty years from now when I'm only a hundred and ten\nMy monthly cost will be ten thousand dollars\nAnd this is after I've been withdrawing from my savings for fifty years [noise]\nSo do I need three percent of my savings to cover ten thousand dollars given the high likelihood of inflation when it's costing me three thousand dollars now or how do I have very this over time do I need to work longer save more keep my investments in a more aggressive\nMode to cover the costs of inflation that's how we're going to compensate for\nPotentially up to six years of inflation\nMike your right to all three in other words your ear over complicating this a little bit Ah yes inflation will take it's toll overtime but there is nothing new about that inflation is taking and taking its toll overtime for as long as there's been times\nWe all know that everything is more expensive today than it was fifty years ago and everything will be more expensive than it is today fifty years from now so there's nothing new there so\nDon't worry about it in other words history tells us that a diversified investment portfolio earns more over long periods of time than the inflation rate now there's no assurance that that'll be true in the future but that's the basis on which all investment strategies are built there\nIs no reason to believe that won't be true in the future although we can't promise that are guarantee it so on that assumption which is what it is\nYou can assume that your investments will grow over time at a rate faster than the rate of inflation which is how your nest egg in the future will be big enough that when you withdraw three percent or four percent a year from the portfolio it'll produce the income you need even if your income as a whopping ten grand imam\nWhich by the way is the amount of income some people need even today so\nDon't worry about it you were ever complicating but let's shift over to the second half of your question how do you make sure you have enough money so that you can withdraw three percent a year to pay your bills no matter how hot does bills had might happen to be\nUs do you work longer do you save more do you earn higher returns yes yes yes we have to recognize as I've been talking with you about on this program for the past several years and is the basis of my book the truth about your future\nWhich they due to the New York times business bestseller list at number four we have to recognize that the future and what it used to be as Yogi Berra said\nYou're not going to live to eighty five or Ninety or Ninety five chances are you're going to live to one of five one Fifteen one twenty five but you have to recognize that life is going to be much longer due to medical advances and technological innovations that are extending longevity and on that basis\nWe have to recognize that a retirement at age sixty five is probably not realistic for an awful lot of folks\nYou're going to probably have to work longer that doesn't mean you're going to necessarily have to work sixty hours a week making a hundred and fifty grand a year it might be working a few hours a week making ten or twenty grand a year you're going to need to save more than you probably are right now so I Would encourage you if you're not already maximizing your contributions to your retirement plan at work do so\nAdd an extra one percent of your savings rate at work\nAnd make sure you're earning a competitive rate of return make sure that your investment returns are exceeding the inflation rate so that your money is actually growing and real economic terms if inflation is two percent and your bank account is paying one\nYou're losing one percent in real economic terms so we need to make sure that your investments are growing with the pace of the cost of living\nAnd that means you need to make sure that your investments are growing on average over long periods of time not necessarily every single day or week or month or quarter year but over long periods of time on average your overall portfolio was earning a return exceeding vat\nOf inflation and if you will do those three things work a little longer maybe save a little more maybe earn a little bit more maybe then yes you can expect your future retirement your future lifestyle to the everything that you want it to be and if you're not sure how to do all of the above\nHow do you design your career structures that you can generate income either on a part time basis how do you figure out how to lower your expenses in order to free up extra cash to save and how do you structure your investments so that you can achieve your goals you've got questions with any of those three\nCallers triple eight plan wreck and if you want to learn more about these exponential technologies and the notion of longevity read my New York times business best seller the truth about your future by the way you don't even have to just read the book you can watch the book\nWe've taken the entire content of the
